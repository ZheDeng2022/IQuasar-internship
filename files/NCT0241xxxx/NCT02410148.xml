      Glaucoma remains a disease with an unclear and complex underlying pathophysiology. Recently,&#xD;
      researchers have emphasized not only intraocular pressure (IOP) or vascular dysregulation,&#xD;
      but also translaminar pressure's (TPG) role in glaucoma (TPG=IOP-ICP). A higher TPG may lead&#xD;
      to abnormal function and optic nerve damage due to changes in axonal transportation,&#xD;
      deformation of the lamina cribrosa, altered blood flow, or a combination thereof leading to&#xD;
      glaucomatous damage. However only invasive ICP measurements are available within the&#xD;
      contemporary medicine. The ideas for non-invasive ICP measurement have been approached since&#xD;
      about 1980. Most of the proposed technologies were based on ultrasound and were capable of&#xD;
      monitoring blood flow in intracranial or intraocular vessels, cranium diameter, or acoustic&#xD;
      properties of the cranium. Broad research has extended into sonography of optic nerve sheath&#xD;
      and its relation with elevated ICP. However, most of these correlation-based methods had the&#xD;
      same problem-the need of individual patient specific calibration. Seeking to measure absolute&#xD;
      ICP values, researchers from Kaunas University of Technology created a non-invasive method,&#xD;
      which does not need a patient specific calibration. The method is based on direct comparison&#xD;
      of ICP value with the value of pressure Pe that is externally applied to the tissues&#xD;
      surrounding the eyeball. Intracranial segment of ophthalmic artery (OA) is used as a natural&#xD;
      sensor of ICP and extracranial segment of OA is used as a sensor of Pe. The special two depth&#xD;
      transcranial Doppler (TCD) device is used as a pressure balance indicator when ICP = Pe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to assess TPG in patients with primary open open-angle glaucoma&#xD;
      (POAG). In addition the investigators want to measure ICP in patients with papilledema (PE)&#xD;
      in order to compare them with glaucoma patients.&#xD;

      Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy leading to the retinal ganglion cell death and&#xD;
      typical optic nerve head (ONH) damage [1]. It remains a disease with an unclear and complex&#xD;
      underlying pathophysiology. Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the main and only modifiable risk&#xD;
      factor for glaucoma [2]. Although lowering IOP helps to decelerate or stabilize the disease,&#xD;
      a vast number of patients still show signs of glaucoma despite an IOP within normal range.&#xD;
      Clearly other pathogenetic mechanisms beyond IOP are involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma&#xD;
      for certain individuals. Non-IOP factors such as lower systolic ocular perfusion pressure&#xD;
      (OPP), reduced ocular blood flow, cardiovascular disease, and low systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      (BP) have been identified as risk factors for primary open-open-angle glaucoma (POAG) [3-6].&#xD;
      Evidence shows that non-IOP factors can impact the apoptotic process associated with glaucoma&#xD;
      [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, researchers have emphasized not only IOP or vascular dysregulation, but also&#xD;
      intracranial pressure's (ICP) role in glaucoma [8-10]. The optic nerve is exposed not only to&#xD;
      IOP in the eye, but also to ICP as it is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the&#xD;
      subarachnoid space. Because the lamina cribrosa separates these two pressurized regions [11],&#xD;
      the decrease in pressure that occurs across the lamina cribrosa (IOP-ICP) is known as the&#xD;
      translaminar pressure gradient (TPG). A higher TPG may lead to abnormal function and optic&#xD;
      nerve damage due to changes in axonal transportation, deformation of the lamina cribrosa,&#xD;
      altered blood flow, or a combination thereof leading to glaucomatous damage. Besides, TPG may&#xD;
      be the primarily pressure-related parameter for glaucoma [12-15], since the ONH is located at&#xD;
      the junction between the intraocular space and the orbital retrobulbar space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the role of TPG still remains unknown, because only invasive ICP measurements are&#xD;
      available within the contemporary medicine (lumbar puncture or punction of brain&#xD;
      ventricles-for patients with severe brain injury). The ideas for noninvasive ICP measurement&#xD;
      have been appearing since about 1980. Numerous methods for finding the objects or&#xD;
      physiological characteristics of cerebrospinal system that would be related to the ICP and&#xD;
      its monitoring have been sought by many authors. Most of the proposed technologies were based&#xD;
      on ultrasound and were capable of monitoring blood flow in intracranial or intraocular&#xD;
      vessels, cranium diameter, or acoustic properties of the cranium [16]. Broad research has&#xD;
      extended into sonography of optic nerve sheath and its relation with elevated ICP [17].&#xD;
      However, most of these correlation-based methods had the same problem-the need of individual&#xD;
      patient specific calibration. Seeking to measure absolute ICP values, researchers from Kaunas&#xD;
      University of Technology created a noninvasive method, which does not need a patient specific&#xD;
      calibration [18, 19]. The method is based on direct comparison of ICP value with the value of&#xD;
      pressure Pe that is externally applied to the tissues surrounding the eyeball. Intracranial&#xD;
      segment of ophthalmic artery (OA) is used as a natural sensor of ICP and extracranial segment&#xD;
      of OA is used as a sensor of Pe. A special two depth transcranial Doppler (TCD) device [18,&#xD;
      19] is used as a pressure balance indicator when ICP = Pe. Accuracy, precision, sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, and diagnostic value of this method were proven with healthy subjects and&#xD;
      patients with neurological diseases. This device has not yet been used in clinical studies to&#xD;
      investigate TPG significance in glaucoma. The aim of our study is to assess TPG in patients&#xD;
      with primary open open-angle glaucoma (POAG). In addition the investigators want to measure&#xD;
      ICP in patients with papilledema (PE) in order to compare them with glaucoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-invasive ICP measurement using two deeps TCD device allows us to get ICP values from&#xD;
      immediate vicinity of optic nerve, which in turn very important in term of understanding the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of such conditions like PE and POAG.&#xD;
