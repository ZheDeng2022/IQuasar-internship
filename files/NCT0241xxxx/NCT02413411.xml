    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled design will be utilized to examine and compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the proposed educational intervention, which includes a combination of an educational&#xD;
      decision aid and motivational interviewing with attention control on select key&#xD;
      patient-centered and process of care outcomes. The study sample will consist of approximately&#xD;
      450 African-American patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Patients will be recruited&#xD;
      from the University of Pennsylvania Health System and the Philadelphia VA Medical Center and&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of the two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immediate goal of this randomized controlled trial is to assess the effect of a&#xD;
      high-quality, evidence-based, patient-centered educational intervention supplemented with&#xD;
      targeted counseling (motivational interviewing) on African American patient preferences,&#xD;
      expectations, and the likelihood of achieving a referral for surgical evaluation. The&#xD;
      long-term goal of this research is to widely implement a patient-centered educational&#xD;
      intervention targeting African Americans who are potential candidates for joint replacement,&#xD;
      in a national effort to reduce and ultimately eliminate racial disparities in the utilization&#xD;
      of this effective treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim:To examine the effect of the knee osteoarthritis Decision Aid (DA)/Motivational&#xD;
      Interviewing (MI) intervention on orthopedic surgery referral rates for African American (AA)&#xD;
      patients. Hypothesis: Compared to attention control, the DA/MI intervention will lead to&#xD;
      higher orthopedic surgery referral rates for AA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim: To examine the effect of the DA/MI intervention on the rate of knee&#xD;
      replacement receipt among AA patients. Hypothesis: AA patients randomized to receive the&#xD;
      intervention will have higher rates of knee replacement compared to those in the attention&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study involves a baseline questionnaire, educational intervention, primary care follow-up&#xD;
      phone call questionnaire (approximately 2 weeks after primary care appointment), and&#xD;
      follow-up questionnaires by phone calls at 3 months and 1 year. All eligible, consented&#xD;
      patients will complete the baseline questionnaire, conducted by a REPAIR research staff&#xD;
      member. The baseline questionnaire will include the following instruments that have been&#xD;
      field-tested by our team in previous and ongoing studies: 1.) Willingness to Consider Joint&#xD;
      Replacement Question 2.) Knowledge Regarding Knee OA and Joint Replacement (developed by The&#xD;
      Foundation for Informed Medical Decision Making) 3.) Hospital for Special Surgery Knee&#xD;
      Expectations Survey 4.) Socioeconomic Survey 5.) Access to Health Care, Charleson Comorbidity&#xD;
      Index 6.) Quality of Life SF-12v2. This survey can be done over the phone or in person. It&#xD;
      should take approximately 30-40 minutes. At the completion of the baseline questionnaire,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized into either study Decision Aid (DA) supplemented by motivational&#xD;
      interview (MI) (hereafter referred to as DA/MI intervention) arm or the attention control&#xD;
      arm. Patient appointments for the DA/MI intervention or attention control activity will be&#xD;
      scheduled to occur 2 weeks prior to the patients next primary care appointment (up to the&#xD;
      date of the appointment). The DA/MI intervention (referred to as an information session in&#xD;
      patient material) will be completed by a REPAIR research study interventionist (the&#xD;
      interventionist will not administer the baseline assessment). In the intervention arm,&#xD;
      patients will be shown a decision aid video entitled, Treatment Choices for Knee&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis. Following the viewing of the decision aid video, the participant will be&#xD;
      engaged in a motivational interview by the research study interventionist.The completion time&#xD;
      for the educational intervention will vary from 30 to 80 minutes. The attention control arm&#xD;
      will be conducted by the REPAIR research staff. Patients will be given written educational&#xD;
      material adapted from the NIH/NIAMS publication Osteoarthritis to review at his/her&#xD;
      leisure.The completion time for the attention control arm is approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
      Follow-up procedures will occur at the following time points: 1.) approximately 2 weeks after&#xD;
      the participants primary care appointment, 2.) 3-months post intervention, 3.) 12-months post&#xD;
      intervention, and 4.) medical chart assessment. All followup procedures will be administered&#xD;
      by a REPAIR research team member that was not involved in the educational intervention.&#xD;
      Participants in both the DA/MI intervention and the attention control will complete a primary&#xD;
      care follow-up survey approximately 2 weeks following the patients next primary care&#xD;
      appointment. This survey will be comprised of the following: 1.) Willingness to consider&#xD;
      joint replacement question 2.) Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Expectations Survey 3.)&#xD;
      Knowledge Regarding Knee OA and Joint Replacement 4.) Communication questions regarding who&#xD;
      the patient talked to about their knee pain and/or the intervention. The follow-up will take&#xD;
      10-15 minutes to complete, and will be administered preferably by phone. Participants in both&#xD;
      the DA/MI intervention and the attention control will complete a 3-month follow-up (completed&#xD;
      approximately 3 months post intervention) survey over the phone. This survey will be&#xD;
      comprised the same as the primary care followup survey. This survey will take 10-15 minutes&#xD;
      to complete. Lastly, participants in both the DA/MI intervention and the attention control&#xD;
      will complete a 12-month follow-up (completed approximately 12 months post intervention)&#xD;
      survey over the phone. The survey will be comprised of the following: Willingness to consider&#xD;
      joint replacement, Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Expectations Survey, Knowledge Regarding&#xD;
      Knee OA and Joint Replacement, and a survey regarding referrals to orthopedics and for joint&#xD;
      replacement. At the time of the 12-month follow-up, the patients medical record will be&#xD;
      accessed to check for a referral to orthopedics and a joint replacement procedure.&#xD;
