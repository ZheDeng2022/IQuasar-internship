  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Needle aspiration of the epididymis causes rupture and irreversible damage to the duct.&#xD;
      Recurring punctures and needle aspirations of fluid and tissue during Testicular Fine Needle&#xD;
      Aspiration (TEFNA) procedure cause irreparable injury and loss of part of the testis'&#xD;
      tubules. The hypothesis of this research is that production of sperm from the testis will be&#xD;
      improved due to ultrasonically guided Rete Testis needle aspiration. In cases of Obstructive&#xD;
      Azoospermia, the Rete Testis is expected to contain a large number of sperm cells. In cases&#xD;
      of Non-Obstructive Azoospermia, the investigators can expect to produce sperm cells from&#xD;
      aspiration of the Rete Testis, which drains all of the testis' tubules. Furthermore,&#xD;
      catheterization of the Rete Testis will allow for the drainage of all testes tubules and for&#xD;
      the production of sperm cells created locally in some of the tubules or in parts of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential advantage of needle aspiration from the Rete Testis is that the procedure will&#xD;
      allow for the aspiration from all the testes tubules, as opposed to the standard method of&#xD;
      sperm cells production from the testis which samples only some of the tubules. Therefore, it&#xD;
      is expected that the procedure suggested in this research will be more efficient than the&#xD;
      standard procedures currently in practice. An additional advantage to this procedure is that&#xD;
      puncture and aspiration of the tubule network is not expected to block the drainage from the&#xD;
      testis, as is the case in aspiration of the epididymis, and it is also not expected to damage&#xD;
      the tubules, as is the case in TEFNA and in TESE.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects will be Azoospermic men who turn to the IVF unit at Hadassah Ein Kerem and&#xD;
      are candidates for a TEFNA treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only after the men will receive an explanation of the TEFNA procedure and sign a consent form&#xD;
      for TEFNA will they be invited to join the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an explanation, the men will sign a consent form (attached) for participation in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TEFNA procedure in each testis will begin with an ultrasonically guided Rete Testis&#xD;
      needle aspiration and washing of the testes tubules. A PP Spinal Needle, of 20-27 Gage and&#xD;
      90mm length, will be used for the ultrasonically guided puncture of the testis and&#xD;
      catheterization of the Rete Testis network. After the catheterization, there will be an&#xD;
      aspiration, followed by the washing of the testis tubule network in saline used for IV, in a&#xD;
      volume of up to 1mL (5), using a 1mL syringe. In men with Obstructive Azoospermia, in case&#xD;
      the samples aspirated from the Rete Testis will contain many motile sperm cells (more than&#xD;
      hundreds), there will be no need for a TEFNA procedure. In cases where an initial sample of&#xD;
      the Rete Testis aspiration will not show many motile sperm cells, the TEFNA procedure will&#xD;
      continue on as planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples from the Rete Testis aspiration will be separately checked for sperm cells from&#xD;
      the sample and tissue produced from the TEFNA procedure. The sperm cells produced from the&#xD;
      Rete Testis will be used for cryopreservation or fertilization of the ovum of the patient's&#xD;
      partner, as is customary in sperm cells attained through the TEFNA procedure. Should sperm&#xD;
      cells be produced both from the Rete Testis and from the epididymis or testes, the partner's&#xD;
      ovum will be fertilized by the highest quality sperm cells of both sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up on patients will be conducted as customary after testis aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be invited six months after the procedure for an ultrasonic check-up of the&#xD;
      testes and the Rete Testis.&#xD;
