  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are characterized by frequent relapses, often&#xD;
      resulting from common bacterial infections. Enhancing the immune response in these patients&#xD;
      may decrease the frequency of these relapses. The use of a mechanic Polyvalent Bacterial&#xD;
      Lysate (PMBL, Ismigen, 13 bacterial strains)may enhance the immune response and therefore&#xD;
      help significantly to the control of relapse in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study the effect of the administration of the PBML to patients older than 40&#xD;
      years, with moderate, severe or very severe COPD, in good or discrete physical condition on&#xD;
      the number of relapses in an observation period of 12 months. In addition, the effect of the&#xD;
      PMBL on the duration of the interval between relapses, on relapse symptoms, on the use of&#xD;
      other drugs, on the number of days of absence of work, on the number of hospitalizations and&#xD;
      duration thereof and on potential toxicity of the treatment.&#xD;

      Ancillary Study at the center of Genoa:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate in a subgroup of patient, taking part in the AIACE study, the ability of PMBL&#xD;
      to induce an Ig response, to modify the NK blood pattern, and to modulate inflammatory&#xD;
      parameters (e.g. CRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material &amp; Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients who were enrolled at the Respiratory Department of Genoa University during the&#xD;
      AIACE trial and double blind randomly treated with bacterial lysate or placebo, will&#xD;
      participate in this ancillary study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further informed consent to participate in this laboratory trial will be requested to the&#xD;
      patient besides the already ethical procedure approved for the AIACE study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the enhancement of the concentration of salivary antibodies, a sample of&#xD;
      salivary fluid (SF) will be collected at day 0 using Salivette (Starsted, Germany, used&#xD;
      according to the manufacture's instructions) and stored frozen until assayed. Then, treatment&#xD;
      with PMBL will be carried out for ten days. After twenty-day rest (day 30), at the end of&#xD;
      first treatment course (day 90) at the beginning and at the end of the second drug course&#xD;
      (day 180, 210) and at the end of the study (day 360), a SF sample will be collected and&#xD;
      stored frozen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the AIACE laboratory procedure already approved, a further blood sample (6 glass&#xD;
      tubes) will be collected for peripheral NK blood phenotyping and CRP dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purified NK cells will obtained from peripheral blood sample at time 0, 90 and 360 by&#xD;
      negative selection by using the NK cell isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach -&#xD;
      Germany) following the manufacturer instructions. The NK cell populations are assessed for&#xD;
      purity and only those homogeneously displaying CD3-CD14-CD15-CD19- phenotype are selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cells obtained as above described will be analyzed (time t0) by flow cytometry using the&#xD;
      following mAbs: anti-CD3, anti-CD56, anti-NKp30, anti-NKp46, anti-NKp44, anti-NKG2D,&#xD;
      anti-CD158B1/B2j, anti-KIR p70, anti-CD159A , anti-CD226 (Immunotech -Marseille, France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the efficacy of PMBL on systemic inflammation CRP will be evaluated at day&#xD;
      0 90 and 360. Finally, special T cell subpopulations, such as regulatory T cells, will be&#xD;
      assayed on collected samples, together with the concentration of circulating chemokines,&#xD;
      cytokines and inflammation-related molecules using a specific immunobeads and flow cytometry.&#xD;
