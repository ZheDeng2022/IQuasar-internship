  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, non-randomized, single-center study to assess the residency of&#xD;
      GSK2894512 in the skin of healthy adult male volunteers with normal barrier function. The&#xD;
      study will have two parts, Cohort 1 (Part A) followed by Cohort 2 (Part B). The study will&#xD;
      assess the residence time in human skin . The primary objective is to evaluate the residency&#xD;
      time in skin following topical application of two formulations of GSK2894512 Cream. The total&#xD;
      study duration will be of 15 days including 1 to 7 days of treatment period, 8 to 14 days of&#xD;
      post treatment period and 1 day of follow up. The screening period will be up to 28 days&#xD;
      prior to Baseline (Day 1).&#xD;

    <measure>Residence time in skin following topical application of two formulations of GSK2894512 Cream</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Fluorescent lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) images will be evaluated to determine if GSK2894512 is detectable in skin. Drug concentrations can be quantified considering the: depth of penetration at each time point and the amount of fluorescence detected. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) will also be used to measure the concentration of GSK2894512 from biopsies.</description>

    <measure>Adverse events (AEs) monitoring after two formulations of GSK2894512 cream</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in disability/incapacity, or; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

    <description>In Cohort 1, study medication (Cream A, 1%) will be applied as a thin layer onto a predefined area of the volar region of the forearm that is large enough to image and collect 3 biopsies (4 mm per biopsy). Vehicle will be applied on Day 1 only, onto a symmetrical location on the opposite forearm from Cream A. In cohort 2, subjects will be enrolled to evaluate Cream A (1%) and a different GSK2894512 Cream, Cream B (1%). Cream A, 1% and Cream B, 1% will be applied as a thin layer to the opposite forearms of the subject. Vehicle will be applied only on Day 1 to a separate area (at least 1.3 cm from study drug) of the forearm from where drug is applied. Both Cream A and Cream B will continue to be applied OD to the same area of the same forearm for 7 days.</description>
