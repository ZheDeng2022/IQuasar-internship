  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with autonomic failure are characterized by disabling orthostatic hypotension (low&#xD;
      blood pressure on standing), and at least half of them also have high blood pressure while&#xD;
      lying down (supine hypertension). Exposure to heat, such as in hot environments, often&#xD;
      worsens their orthostatic hypotension. The causes of this are not fully understood. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate whether applying local heat over the abdomen of patients&#xD;
      with autonomic failure and supine hypertension would decrease their high blood pressure while&#xD;
      lying down. This will help us better understand the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon,&#xD;
      and may be of use in the treatment of supine hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary autonomic failure is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by severe impairment&#xD;
      of the autonomic nervous system. The clinical hallmark of autonomic failure is disabling&#xD;
      orthostatic hypotension, but at least half of patients are also hypertensive while lying&#xD;
      down. This supine hypertension can be severe and associated with end-organ damage and&#xD;
      worsening of orthostatic hypotension due to increased pressure natriuresis. It also&#xD;
      complicates the management of these patients by limiting the use of daytime pressor agents&#xD;
      for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that heat exposure (e.g. hot weather or a hot bath or shower) produces an&#xD;
      acute and temporary worsening of orthostatic hypotension in autonomic failure patients.&#xD;
      However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are completely unexplored. Factors that&#xD;
      may predispose autonomic failure patients to the acute lowering blood pressure effects of&#xD;
      heat stress include 1) impaired heat dissipation due to inability to sweat, 2) preserved&#xD;
      heat-mediated skin vasodilation, and 3) blunted sympathetic hemodynamic responses to maintain&#xD;
      blood pressure. In this study, we test the hypothesis that moderate levels of local&#xD;
      (abdominal) passive heat stress will lower blood pressure in autonomic failure patients with&#xD;
      supine hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, we propose this pilot study with the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the acute blood pressure effects of local passive heat stress in autonomic&#xD;
           failure patients with supine hypertension, we will compare changes in BP between&#xD;
           controlled local heat stress (~44ºC) using a commercial heating pad that covers the&#xD;
           abdomen and part of the torso, and a control (non-heating) study day using the same&#xD;
           heating pad but turned off.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the mechanisms underlying BP changes during local heat stress, we will&#xD;
           compare changes in hemodynamic parameters (cardiac output, stroke volume and peripheral&#xD;
           vascular resistance), segmental fluid shifts (measured by segmental bioimpedance), skin&#xD;
           blood flow and skin temperature between the heat and non-heating study days.&#xD;
