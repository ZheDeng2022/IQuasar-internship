      Open-label, randomized, multicenter, Phase II trial designed to estimate the efficacy of&#xD;
      CAPTEM versus FOLFIRI as second line treatment in MGMT methylated, RAS mutated advanced CRC&#xD;
      patients who have progressed on or after first-line oxaliplatin containing chemotherapy for&#xD;
      metastatic disease. MGMT will be assessed centrally at Pathology Department of Fondazione&#xD;
      IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori prior to enrollment. A minimum of ten 3-micron unstained&#xD;
      sections on charged slides of tumor will be required and methylation status will be provided&#xD;
      within a maximum of seven days to the Study Centers. Presence of RAS mutation will be&#xD;
      assessed at each local participating center. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to one of two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A (experimental arm): CAPTEM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B (control arm): FOLFIRI Study treatment will be given in cycles repeated every 28&#xD;
           days for Arm A and every 14 days for Arm B. Patients in Arm A will receive capecitabine&#xD;
           at the oral dose of 1500 mg/mq/die bid from day 1 to day 14 every 28 days plus&#xD;
           temozolomide 150 mg/mq/die bid starting on day 9 to 14 every 28 days. Patients in Arm B&#xD;
           will receive FOLFIRI chemotherapy starting Day 1 q2w (every cycle) starting on Day 1 of&#xD;
           Cycle 1. FOLFIRI consists of irinotecan (starting dose of 180 mg/m2) on day one only;&#xD;
           5-FU 7 (starting bolus and 22-hour infusional doses of 400 mg/m2 and 600 mg/m2,&#xD;
           respectively), and leucovorin (racemic, starting dose of 200 mg/m2 or L-form, starting&#xD;
           dose of 100 mg/m2) for two consecutive days. Treatment will continue for up to 6 cycles&#xD;
           in Arm A and up to 12 cycles in Arm B or up to disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity or informed consent withdrawal. Randomization will be stratified across the&#xD;
           treatment arms by the following predefined stratification variables: disease progression&#xD;
           within 9 months from the start of first-line oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy (&lt; vs.&#xD;
           ≥9 months); prior bevacizumab in combination with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (yes&#xD;
           vs. no). Efficacy assessments will be performed every 2 cycles in Arm A and every 4&#xD;
           cycles in Arm B until progression. The study is expected to enrol approximately 82&#xD;
           patients who meet the eligibility criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second&#xD;
      in females, with over 1.2 million new cancer cases and 608,700 deaths estimated to have&#xD;
      occurred in 2008. Approximately 35% of CRC patients present a Stage IV metastatic disease at&#xD;
      the time of diagnosis, and 20%-50% of Stage II or III disease will progress to Stage IV at&#xD;
      some point during the course of disease. Stage IV CRC carries a dismal prognosis: the 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate is &lt;10%, and median survival time of patients given optimal supportive care&#xD;
      without chemotherapy is approximately 5 months. Hypothesis/rationale In advanced CRC, the&#xD;
      occurrence of chemo- refractory disease poses a major therapeutic challenge for presence of&#xD;
      an adequate performance status to potentially receive further treatments, but absence of&#xD;
      effective drugs which may be offered to patients with an evidence-based algorithm. Patients&#xD;
      who progress after all approved treatments may be generally considered suitable for new&#xD;
      investigational drugs or strategies. Thus, in the era of personalized medicine, tumor&#xD;
      molecular profiling may lead to the identification of therapeutic targets or predictive&#xD;
      biomarkers for pharmacological intervention. The DNA repair gene O6-methylguanine-DNA&#xD;
      methyltransferase (MGMT) is responsible of the elimination of alkyl groups from the&#xD;
      O6-position of guanine. If inactive, it may be involved in early steps of colorectal&#xD;
      tumorigenesis through an increase of the mutational rate particularly, G-to-A point mutations&#xD;
      of KRAS gene. Epigenetic silencing of MGMT during colorectal tumorigenesis is associated with&#xD;
      hypermethylation of the CpG island in its promoter. This transcriptional gene silencing is&#xD;
      responsible for diminished DNA-repair of O6-alkylguanine adducts, with the consequence of&#xD;
      enhancing chemosensitivity to alkylating agents in particular dacarbazine and its oral&#xD;
      prodrug temozolomide. In a previous phase II study, the investigators showed that&#xD;
      temozolomide induced an objective response rate by RECIST criteria in 12% of heavily&#xD;
      pretreated patients with advanced CRC and MGMT promoter 6 methylation. Treatment was well&#xD;
      tolerated, and the only grade 4 toxicity was one thrombocytopenia episode (3%). The trial met&#xD;
      its primary end point of acceptable response rate, with a disease control rate of 31%, a&#xD;
      median PFS (progression free survival) and OS (overall survival) of 1.8 and 8.4 months,&#xD;
      respectively. Other studies in carcinoids cell lines demonstrated synergistic cell kill if&#xD;
      5-FU (5-fluorouracil) and TMZ (temozolomide) were delivered in a schedule-dependent manner.&#xD;
      From these translational studies, it has been formulated the CAPTEM regimen using TMZ for 5&#xD;
      days at 150-200 mg/m2/day total daily dose on days 10-14 (given in BID oral dosing), with&#xD;
      capecitabine 750 mg/m2 PO (per OS) BID on days 1-14 of a 28-day cycle. The use of TMZ in BID&#xD;
      (BIS in DIE) dosing instead of daily dosing was done because the first dose binds 6-MGMT&#xD;
      levels, thus allowing the second dose to methylate guanines with decreased repair from MGMT.&#xD;
      Given the potential synergy of CAPTEM combination in CRC, the investigators planned a&#xD;
      randomized study of second-line CAPTEM vs. FOLFIRI after failure of prior first-line&#xD;
      oxaliplatin - based treatment. Study design Open-label, randomized, multicenter, Phase II&#xD;
      trial designed to estimate the efficacy of CAPTEM versus FOLFIRI as second line treatment in&#xD;
      MGMT methylated, RAS mutated advanced CRC patients who have progressed on or after first-line&#xD;
      oxaliplatin containing chemotherapy for metastatic disease. MGMT will be assessed centrally&#xD;
      at Pathology Department of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori prior to&#xD;
      enrollment. A minimum of ten 3-micron unstained sections on charged slides of tumor will be&#xD;
      required and methylation status will be provided within a maximum of seven days to the Study&#xD;
      Centers. Presence of RAS mutation will be assessed at each local participating center.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A (experimental arm): CAPTEM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B (control arm): FOLFIRI Study treatment will be given in cycles repeated every 28&#xD;
           days for Arm A and every 14 days for Arm B. Patients in Arm A will receive capecitabine&#xD;
           at the oral dose of 1500 mg/mq/die bid from day 1 to day 14 every 28 days plus&#xD;
           temozolomide 150 mg/mq/die bid starting on day 10 to 14 every 28 days. Patients in Arm B&#xD;
           will receive FOLFIRI chemotherapy starting Day&#xD;
&#xD;
           1 q2w (every cycle) starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1. FOLFIRI consists of irinotecan&#xD;
           (starting dose of 180 mg/m2) on day one only; 5-FU 7 (starting bolus and 22-hour&#xD;
           infusional doses of 400 mg/m2 and 600 mg/m2, respectively), and leucovorin (racemic,&#xD;
           starting dose of 200 mg/m2 or L-form, starting dose of 100 mg/m2) for two consecutive&#xD;
           days. Treatment will continue for up to 6 cycles in Arm A and up to 12 cycles in Arm B&#xD;
           or up to disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or informed consent withdrawal.&#xD;
           Randomization will be stratified across the treatment arms by the following predefined&#xD;
           stratification variables: disease progression within 9 months from the start of&#xD;
           first-line oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy (&lt; vs. ≥9 months); prior bevacizumab in&#xD;
           combination with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (yes vs. no). Efficacy assessments will&#xD;
           be performed every 2 cycles in Arm A and every 4 cycles in Arm B until progression. The&#xD;
           study is expected to enrol approximately 82 patients who meet the eligibility criteria.&#xD;
           Number of study centres 10 centers in Italy Primary objective and corresponding end&#xD;
           point&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy, as measured by progression-free survival, of FOLFIRI&#xD;
           (administered every 2 weeks) versus CAPTEM (administered four-weekly) Secondary&#xD;
           objectives and corresponding end points&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the activity of the two regimens, as measured by response rate; secondary&#xD;
           efficacy endpoints also include duration of response and overall survival of FOLFIRI&#xD;
           (administered every 2 weeks) versus CAPTEM (administered four-weekly)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of FOLFIRI versus CAPTEM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the quality of life as measured by Quality of life questionnaires (EORTC QLQ -&#xD;
           CR29; QLQ-C30) Statistical methodology According to the published results of the GERCOR&#xD;
           study, the median progression-free survival during second-line treatment with crossover&#xD;
           from FOLFOX to FOLFIRI was 2.3 months (calculated from the start of second-line&#xD;
           treatment with FOLFIRI). A one-sided log rank test with an overall sample size of 82&#xD;
           subjects (41 in the control group and 41 in the study group) achieves 90% power at a 5%&#xD;
           significance level to detect an increase in median progression free survival from 2&#xD;
           months of the control group to 4 months. The study lasts for 30 months of which subject&#xD;
           accrual (entry) occurs in 24 months&#xD;
