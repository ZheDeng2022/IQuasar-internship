  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of intravenous&#xD;
      administration of a tetravalent RNA-lipoplex cancer vaccine targeting four tumor-associated&#xD;
      antigens in patients with advanced melanoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The Lipo-MERIT vaccine consists of the four naked ribonucleic acid (RNA)-drug products&#xD;
           (DPs) RBL001.1, RBL002.2, RBL003.1, and RBL004.1 that are optimised to induce&#xD;
           antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses against four selected malignant&#xD;
           melanoma-associated antigens respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this study, naked RNA DPs will be formulated with liposomes to form RNA-lipoplexes&#xD;
           (RNA(LIP)) that (i) protect RNA from degradation in the serum, (ii) enable in vivo&#xD;
           targeting of systemic antigen-presenting cells (APC), and therefore (iii) constitute a&#xD;
           novel vaccine formulation that supports intravenous administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Lipo-MERIT vaccine is expected to lead to several effects contributing to its&#xD;
           immunological (therapeutic) effect. First, the RNA-lipoplexes home to APCs in lymphoid&#xD;
           organs after intravenous injection, where they are rapidly taken up by professional&#xD;
           APCs. Incorporated RNA is translocated to the cytoplasm leading to its translation by&#xD;
           the host ribosome complex into four Antigen encoding proteins which are processed and&#xD;
           presented on both HLA-class I as well as HLA-class II molecules. Consecutively,&#xD;
           antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses will be triggered by HLA-peptide&#xD;
           complexes on the surface of antigen-presenting cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, the Lipo-MERIT vaccine is expected to transiently activate APCs (change of&#xD;
           surface marker expression and cytokine secretion) via signalling of TLRs, subsequently&#xD;
           leading to the transient induction of inflammatory cytokines (such as IFN-α and IP-10)&#xD;
           supporting the induction of tumour-antigen specific T cell responses.&#xD;
