      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of novel pan-HER inhibitor,&#xD;
      NOV120101 (Poziotinib), in HER2-overexpressed recurrent stage IV breast cancer patients who&#xD;
      received at least 2 prior HER2-directed regimens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of NOV120101 (Poziotinib) as a therapeutic agent for&#xD;
      HER2-overexpressed recurrent stage IV breast cancer, patients who have received at least two&#xD;
      prior HER2-directed regimens will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will receive NOV120101&#xD;
      (Poziotinib) 12 mg PO once daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week drug-free intervals between&#xD;
      cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity development. Progression Free&#xD;
      Survival (PFS) will be analyzed as the primary endpoint in this trial. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      including PFS rate at 12 weeks, ORR, DCR, OS and TTP will also be analyzed.&#xD;
