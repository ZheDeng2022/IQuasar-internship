      This protocol is not designed as a treatment protocol. Patients enrolled on this study will&#xD;
      be treated according to the treating physician's plan of care, independent of enrollment into&#xD;
      the study. Once enrolled, the physician may proceed with the appropriate plan of care during&#xD;
      the period of specimen analysis if indicated. Upon return of the results, therapy may or may&#xD;
      not be altered based upon the patient's pathology, pertinent medical and treatment history,&#xD;
      imaging studies, available clinical trials, and on the CLIA validated clinical molecular&#xD;
      profiling results. Regardless of the results, the patient will be offered a treatment&#xD;
      selected on an empirical basis by the treating physician at the individual site. All patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the study will be followed for clinical outcome. Clinical molecular profiling&#xD;
      results will expire 14 weeks following the date the Foundation One report is received. No&#xD;
      investigational agents will be administered as part of this study. However, patients may be&#xD;
      referred to open clinical trials based on the results of profiling. Patients referred for&#xD;
      clinical trial may receive investigational agents under a separate clinical trial in&#xD;
      accordance with the written protocol for which they are subsequently enrolled. All&#xD;
      anti-neoplastic drugs used while participating in this study, whether used on-label or&#xD;
      off-label, will be administered to the patient by the route of administration published in&#xD;
      the FDA approved package insert. In addition, the dosing of the agent (including dose&#xD;
      modifications) will be calculated based upon what is published in the FDA approved package&#xD;
      insert.&#xD;
