      The main purpose of this study is to find the long-term effects of daily administration of 40&#xD;
      IU of intranasal insulin (INI) as compared to placebo (sterile saline) on cognition and&#xD;
      memory in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and non-diabetic controls over 24 weeks&#xD;
      with a follow-up period for 24 weeks. Four groups will be tested: DM group treated with INI;&#xD;
      DM group treated with placebo; control group treated with INI and the control group treated&#xD;
      with placebo. The INI or placebo will be delivered into the nose. The investigators are&#xD;
      interested to see whether INI can improve memory and cognition and blood flow in the brain in&#xD;
      the type 2 DM group as compared to placebo and to the non-diabetic group over a long-term&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial determining the long-term effects of&#xD;
      intranasal insulin (INI) on cognition and memory in type 2 diabetes (DM) and non-DM groups.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that: 1) INI-treated adults with DM have better memory and&#xD;
      functioning of specific cognitive domains and faster walking during a dual task than those&#xD;
      treated with placebo and the control group; 2) Glycemic and insulin resistance and genetic&#xD;
      markers for Alzheimer's disease (Apolipoprotein E4 [ApoE4]) may serve as predictors of&#xD;
      positive responses to INI therapy; 3) INI treatment neither adversely affects systemic&#xD;
      glycemic levels or the cardiovascular system nor causes weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine whether INI-treated type 2 DM adults have a) better memory and&#xD;
      functioning of specific cognitive domains and b) faster dual-task gait speed and better daily&#xD;
      living functioning than the placebo-treated and non-DM groups. Four groups will be tested: 60&#xD;
      DM subjects treated with insulin; 60 DM subjects treated with placebo; 45 control subjects&#xD;
      treated with INI and 45 control subjects treated with placebo. These 210 patients are&#xD;
      expected to complete treatment and 168 are expected to complete study by the study completion&#xD;
      anticipated date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 120&#xD;
      older adults with type 2 DM and 90 non-DM controls examining whether 40 IU INI once daily&#xD;
      over a 24-week period improves:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific domains of visuospatial attention and memory, verbal learning (primary&#xD;
           outcomes);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gait speed during a dual task (which is an excellent predictor of overall health), daily&#xD;
           living functionality, and depression as compared to the DM group receiving sterile&#xD;
           saline and the non-DM groups. The non-DM groups will provide reference of INI effects in&#xD;
           a clinical phenotype of cognitive decline and insulin resistance that occurs with normal&#xD;
           aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To identify a phenotype and long-term trajectory predicting clinically relevant&#xD;
      response to INI therapy based on glycemic control, insulin resistance, endothelial and&#xD;
      genetic markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators will determine a phenotype predicting a clinically relevant response&#xD;
           to INI therapy and identify time-dependent trajectories of INI effects on cognition in&#xD;
           the DM group vs. the placebo and the non-DM groups. Clinical predictors will be based on&#xD;
           associations between cognitive function and/or gait and demographic, glycemic control,&#xD;
           insulin resistance, endothelial and genetic (ApoE4) measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators will evaluate the dose-escalating trajectory of cognition, gait speed,&#xD;
           and functionality during the 24 weeks of therapy and 24 weeks post-treatment and their&#xD;
           dependence on the above-mentioned factors, and determine the time point when maximum&#xD;
           effect was reached. INI therapy response is defined as a clinically relevant improvement&#xD;
           on cognitive tests or in gait speed (as a continuous variable) or as responders vs.&#xD;
           non-responders as compared to placebo within DM and non-DM groups (as a categorical&#xD;
           variable).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. MRI substudy: The investigators will explore the long-term INI effects on regional&#xD;
           perfusion, vasodilatation, and resting functional connectivity in 40 DM subjects pre-&#xD;
           and post- INI/placebo administration at the beginning and at the end of intervention and&#xD;
           their relationships to cognitive outcomes. Regional perfusion and vasodilatation will be&#xD;
           measured by pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL) MRI at 3 Tesla, and&#xD;
           resting-state functional connectivity will be quantified from low-frequency (0.01-0.08&#xD;
           Hz) fluctuations (LFF) of the whole-brain blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) functional&#xD;
           Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine the long-term safety of INI vs. placebo with regard to glycemic control&#xD;
      (fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], hypoglycemic episodes), vital signs, and body mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators will obtain measurements of fasting glucose, insulin, vital signs, and&#xD;
           body mass at baseline, 2-months, 4-months, and 6-months follow-up and keep weekly logs&#xD;
           monitoring glucose and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety substudy: In the first 20 DM patients treated with subcutaneous insulin, the&#xD;
           investigators will conduct continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) OR 5 finger sticks/day&#xD;
           (effective after 9/25/2017) for 1 week during baseline and during the first week of INI&#xD;
           or placebo treatment to evaluate the INI effects on glycemic control, hypoglycemic&#xD;
           episodes, and body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may pave the way to potential treatment and/or cure of DM- and age-related&#xD;
      cognitive decline.&#xD;
