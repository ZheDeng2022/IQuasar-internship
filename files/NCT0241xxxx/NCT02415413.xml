      Patients included in the study will receive induction treatment during 6 months, followed by&#xD;
      receive high-dose therapy followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 3 months after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation patients will receive&#xD;
      consolidation treatment during 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently patients will start maintenance treatment during 24 months. Therefore, the total&#xD;
      duration of the treatment will be approximately 36 months.&#xD;

      This clinical trial is a multicenter Phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      toxicity of an intensive therapeutic approach in 90 patients with asymptomatic high risk&#xD;
      multiple myeloma (SMM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Patients will receive an induction treatment consisting of 6 cycles of carfilzomib,&#xD;
           lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (KRd): patients will receive carfilzomib 20-36&#xD;
           mg/m2 IV on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16; with oral lenalidomide 25 mg daily on days 1-21,&#xD;
           subsequently there will be a rest period of a week (from day 22 to day 27). Moreover,&#xD;
           oral dexamethasone 40mg daily will be administered weekly (days 1, 8, 15 and 22).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Following the induction treatment, patients will receive high-dose (200 mg/m2)&#xD;
           melphalan-based treatment administered via the intravenous route followed by peripheral&#xD;
           blood stem cell transplantation (HDT-ASCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - The consolidation treatment will consist of 2 cycles of KRd, with the same doses and&#xD;
           scheduled of the induction treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Maintenance treatment: all patients, without progression to symptomatic multiple&#xD;
           myeloma or toxicity requiring discontinuation of the trial, will receive maintenance&#xD;
           treatment during 24 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This maintenance treatment comprises the administration of lenalidomide 10mg on days 1-21,&#xD;
      followed by a rest period of 1 week, with the weekly administration of dexamethasone 20mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be administrated until the end of the maintenance, although patients will&#xD;
      continue in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If biological progression is observed following the discontinuation of the treatment,&#xD;
      lenalidomide and dexamethasone will be reinstituted in order to control the disease again.&#xD;
      Lenalidomide 10 mg will be administrated on days 1-21 combined with dexamethasone 20mg on&#xD;
      days 1, 8, 15 and 22. All patients will be monitored for asymptomatic disease progression and&#xD;
      to collect data regarding on overall survival (OS).&#xD;
