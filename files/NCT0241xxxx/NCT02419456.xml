    <textblock>
      Intravaginal rings (IVRs) may offer an ideal way to deliver antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to&#xD;
      prevent HIV infection. This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of two IVRs&#xD;
      containing different doses of a combination of two HIV ARV drugs, vicriviroc (VCV) (MK-4176)&#xD;
      and MK-2048, in healthy, HIV-uninfected women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of safe and effective HIV prevention strategies remains a global health&#xD;
      priority. IVRs are currently being studied as a method to deliver HIV ARV drugs in women.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of two IVRs containing different&#xD;
      doses of a combination of two HIV ARV drugs, vicriviroc (VCV) (MK-4176) and MK-2048, in&#xD;
      healthy, HIV-uninfected women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected women, 18 to 45 years old. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to receive either the low dose MK-2048A IVR or the original dose&#xD;
      MK-2048A IVR. Participants will receive their assigned IVR at the enrollment visit, and the&#xD;
      IVR will be removed on Day 28. Participants will attend study visits at screening, enrollment&#xD;
      (Day 0), and Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 35. Study visits may include&#xD;
      medical history reviews, physical examinations, blood collection, pelvic specimen collection,&#xD;
      urine collection, and counseling and adherence assessments.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  HIV-uninfected, based on testing performed by study staff at screening and enrollment&#xD;
             (per applicable algorithm in Appendix II of the protocol) and willing to receive&#xD;
             results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In general good health at screening and enrollment, as determined by the site&#xD;
             Investigator of Record (IoR) or designee&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At screening, participant states willingness to abstain from receptive sexual activity&#xD;
             (including penile-vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, receptive oral intercourse,&#xD;
             finger stimulation, and the use of sex toys) for the 5 days prior to the enrollment&#xD;
             visit and for the duration of study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Per participant report, using an effective method of contraception at enrollment, and&#xD;
             intending to continue the use of an effective method for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation. Effective methods for MTN-028 include: hormonal methods (except&#xD;
             contraceptive IVRs), intrauterine device (IUD) inserted at least 28 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment, engages in sex exclusively with women, sterilized (self or partner),&#xD;

             Table for Grading Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 1.0, December 2004&#xD;
             (Clarification dated August 2009), or satisfactory evaluation with no treatment&#xD;
             required of Grade 1 or higher Pap result. If otherwise eligible women do not have&#xD;
             documentation of a recent Pap test, one may be performed at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Per participant report at screening and enrollment, agrees not to participate in other&#xD;
             research studies involving drugs, medical devices, or vaginal products for the&#xD;

             levonorgestrel-releasing IUD) nor to participants using continuous combination oral&#xD;
             contraceptive pills, as the absence of regular menstrual cycles is an expected, normal&#xD;

                  than HIV, hepatitis B virus [HBV], or HCV) can be re-tested during the screening&#xD;
                  process. If a participant is re-tested and a non-exclusionary result is&#xD;

             performed by study staff is required for inclusion; however a self-reported pregnancy&#xD;
             is adequate for exclusion from screening/enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI) at screening or enrollment. Note:&#xD;
             Otherwise eligible participants diagnosed with UTI during screening will be offered&#xD;
             treatment. If within the 45 day screening window treatment is complete and symptoms&#xD;
             have resolved the participant may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease, reproductive tract infection (RTI) or a&#xD;
             sexually transmitted infection (STI) requiring treatment per current Centers for&#xD;
             Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/) at&#xD;
             screening or enrollment. Note: With the exception of gonorrhea, chlamydia and/or&#xD;
             syphilis, otherwise eligible participants diagnosed with a RTI during screening will&#xD;
             be offered treatment. If within the 45 day screening window treatment is complete and&#xD;
             symptoms have resolved, the participant may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At enrollment, has a clinically apparent Grade 1 or higher pelvic exam finding&#xD;
             (observed by study clinician or designee) per the Division of AIDS Table for Grading&#xD;

             (Clarification dated August 2009), Addendum 1, Female Genital Grading Table for Use in&#xD;
             Microbicide Studies. Note: Cervical friability bleeding associated with speculum&#xD;
             insertion and/or specimen collection judged to be within the range of normal according&#xD;
             to the clinical judgment of the IoR/designee is considered expected non-menstrual&#xD;
             bleeding and is not exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At screening, severe pelvic relaxation such that either the vaginal walls or the&#xD;
             uterine cervix descend beyond the vaginal introitus with valsalva maneuver or has&#xD;
             pelvic anatomy that compromises the ability to adequately assess vaginal safety&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the IoR/designee, would preclude&#xD;
             informed consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate interpretation of study&#xD;
             outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving study objectives&#xD;
