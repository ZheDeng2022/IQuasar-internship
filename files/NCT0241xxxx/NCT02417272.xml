    <textblock>
      Background : Cervical degenerative disc disease is frequent and the consequence of aging.&#xD;
      Degeneration may lead to disc herniation. Surgery is indicated in the presence of root&#xD;
      compression with cervicobrachial neuralgia and/or myelopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The main objective of the study is the comparison of efficacy between total disc&#xD;
      replacement (TDR) and Anterior Cervical Decompression and Fusion (ACDF) as surgical treatment&#xD;
      of symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease in term of &quot;Success&quot; rate, defined as&#xD;
      preservation of adjacent segments, 24 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our knowledge, there are no published data about randomized clinical trials comparing&#xD;
      these radiological parameters (worsening of degeneration signs on static cervical spine&#xD;
      radiographs and worsening of disc degeneration signs on MRI) at levels adjacent to surgery,&#xD;
      between these 2 surgical approaches in patients suffering from cervical degenerative disc&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical treatment of cervical degenerative disc disease usually consists in neural&#xD;
      decompression followed by intervertebral space reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACDF consists in interbody fusion by replacing disc space with a cage packed with bone&#xD;
      substitute, and inserted into the anterior portion of the interspace. Fusion is successful in&#xD;
      approximately 95% of patients with good to excellent clinical results in most of them.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, up to 25% of these patients will develop degenerative changes at adjacent&#xD;
      levels after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TDR consists in total disc replacement with preserved segmental motion decreasing load on&#xD;
      adjacent levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worsening of radiological degeneration signs at adjacent levels seems to be an important long&#xD;
      term prognostic factor for reoperation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, included patients will be randomly assigned to undergo either TDR or ACDF Six&#xD;
      visits are planned during the study: pre inclusion visit within 3 months before surgery,&#xD;
      inclusion/randomisation the day before surgery, 3 follow up visits (45 days, 6, and 12 months&#xD;
      after surgery) and an end of study visit 24 months after surgery (or at time of withdrawal if&#xD;
      relevant).&#xD;
