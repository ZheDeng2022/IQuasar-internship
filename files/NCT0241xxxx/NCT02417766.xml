      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - There are many types of immune disorders. These range from rare immune deficiencies to&#xD;
      allergies to autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis. Genes are the instructions our&#xD;
      body uses to work and develop. A new technology called whole exome sequencing may help find&#xD;
      the cause of these disorders. Whole exome sequencing is a way to look at many genes at once&#xD;
      for errors. Researchers hope to find new gene changes that lead to immune disorders.&#xD;
      Additionally, researchers are interested in finding the best way to manage unexpected but&#xD;
      important findings by whole exome sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To better understand genetic causes of immune system disorders. Also, to better understand&#xD;
      people s thoughts and feelings about immune system disorders and new genomic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People ages 0 100 with an immune disorder or a relative with an immune disorder. People&#xD;
      must be at least 2 to be evaluated at the NIH clinical center. People must be at least 12 to&#xD;
      do the survey/interview portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have their genes sequenced. They may be asked for a new sample of&#xD;
           blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participants cannot come for a study visit, they can have a blood sample collected by&#xD;
           their local lab or doctor and sent by mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers may or may not find the cause of the participant s immune disorder.&#xD;
           Participants will learn that information. Some participants may be asked to return to&#xD;
           NIH to get results and have more tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers may share information with other studies. The data will be anonymous.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the survey part of the study, participants will answer questions about their or&#xD;
           their relative s immune disorder. They will also answer about their thoughts and&#xD;
           feelings about genomic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants will be asked for a brief interview to ask more about the survey&#xD;
           topics. There may be more follow-up after several months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators at National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) are actively&#xD;
      developing the infrastructure and capability for identifying the cause of heterogeneous&#xD;
      immune-mediated disorders through whole exome and whole genome sequencing (WES/WGS). This&#xD;
      effort received additional support through the establishment of the NIAID Clinical Genomics&#xD;
      Program (CGP), a Division of Intramural Research (DIR)-supported cross-lab collaboration to&#xD;
      increase the effectiveness of NIAID s basic and applied genomic research. The disorders under&#xD;
      investigation include primary immunodeficiencies, immune homeostasis disorders, autoimmune&#xD;
      conditions, and allergic diseases for which the hypothesized causative genetic mutations(s)&#xD;
      have not yet been identified. Given recent discoveries of the genetic bases of many&#xD;
      immunological disorders, we are also expanding the disorders studied to include those with&#xD;
      prominent extra-immune manifestations in which a strong inherited immunological pathogenic&#xD;
      basis has been identified; such as the Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders&#xD;
      associated with Streptococcal infections (PANDAS) or Sydenham s chorea. Despite the breadth&#xD;
      of clinical presentations under investigation, these immune-mediated disorders share&#xD;
      significant overlap in underlying molecular pathophysiology and thus represent a coherent&#xD;
      study target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will facilitate the discovery of genes contributing to selected immune-mediated&#xD;
      disorders as well as generating experience with genetic secondary finding disclosure and will&#xD;
      further assess participant s perceptions and preference for WES and future secondary finding&#xD;
      procedures. Ultimately, a better understanding of the genetic contribution to immune&#xD;
      dysregulation will not only provide valuable diagnostic and, potentially, prognostic&#xD;
      information to affected families, but also has the potential to lead to the development of&#xD;
      novel therapeutic targets. Further, developing experience-tested and evidenced-based&#xD;
      procedures for secondary finding management is beneficial for NIAID CGP researchers and&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is specific for genetic testing. Probands, or the affected person serving as&#xD;
      the starting point for the genetic study of family, will be required to be enrolled on a&#xD;
      primary protocol, which will execute the clinical and research evaluations. Unaffected&#xD;
      relatives may be enrolled on this protocol only. Participants unable to travel to National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (NIHCC) may be evaluated through mailin blood&#xD;
      samples, although evaluation at the NIHCC is strongly preferred, particularly for affected&#xD;
      participants. This study aims to enroll 200 participants for exome sequencing, including both&#xD;
      patients and relatives with heterogeneous immune-mediate disorders; all participants&#xD;
      receiving exome sequencing plus those who decline will be offered participation in the survey&#xD;
      (i.e., up to the accrual ceiling of 200).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Whole Exome Sequencing with Secondary Findings Disclosure&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following inclusion criteria apply to all research participants on this protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 0-100 years old. Clinical evaluation at the NIHCC requires age &gt;2 years. Affected&#xD;
             relatives &lt;2 years of age may be included in genetic family studies despite the fact&#xD;
             that he/she is too young for evaluation at the clinical center. Including affected&#xD;
             relatives in family-based whole exome sequencing is critically important, even if the&#xD;
             study team has to rely only on medical records because NIHCC evaluation is not&#xD;
             permitted due to age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Willingness to allow sharing of genetic information in shared controlled access&#xD;
             databases like dbGaP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Willingness to receive secondary finding report.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Probands (i.e., affected individuals serving as the starting point for genetic study of a&#xD;
        family) must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Primary enrollment on a NIH Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocol (e.g.,&#xD;
             05-I-0213 or 93-I-0063), which will execute the majority of clinical and research&#xD;
             evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A suspected genetic basis for the presenting immune disorder with features including&#xD;
             but not limited to autoimmunity, autoinflammatory conditions, lymphadenopathy,&#xD;
             end-organ dysfunction, unusual infections, allergies, or laboratory abnormalities&#xD;
             consistent with immune dysregulation that has not been previously identified and/or&#xD;
             with a family history suggesting genetically-based immune dysfunction (e.g., similar&#xD;
             phenotypes among relatives and/or consanguinity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any participant can be excluded for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Any condition which in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with the research&#xD;
        that is the focus of this protocol.&#xD;
