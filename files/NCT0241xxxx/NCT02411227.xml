      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People with traumatic brain injury (TBI) can have problems with thinking and everyday&#xD;
      activities. They may have a higher risk for car accidents. NeuroDRIVE uses a virtual reality&#xD;
      driving simulator. Researchers think it can help test and improve how people think and drive&#xD;
      after TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test how NeuroDRIVE affects brain performance and driving safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People at least 18 years old with a history of TBI and who had a driver s license at some&#xD;
      point. They must speak, read, and write English and be physically able to drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to release their driving records, but they do not have to do&#xD;
           this to be in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: Screening physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Participants will lie on a table that&#xD;
           slides into a cylinder with a strong magnetic field. A device will be placed over the&#xD;
           head. Participants may do computer tasks during the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have tests of memory, attention, and thinking. They may be asked&#xD;
           questions, take tests, and do simple actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3: Tests of memory, attention, and thinking, plus a virtual reality driving&#xD;
           assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be assigned to Group 1 to start NeuroDRIVE training immediately or&#xD;
           Group 2 to start 10 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits 4 9, over 4 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will practice driving skills and mental exercises in the simulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will complete a driving questionnaire online each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 10: Repeat of Visit 3, with some small changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits 11-12: Very similar to Visits 1-2. Includes MRI scan; physical exam;&#xD;
           questionnaires; and tests of thinking, memory, and attention..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After Visit 12: Participants will fill out a weekly driving survey online for 4 weeks.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the NeuroDRIVE behavioral intervention for&#xD;
      enhancement of driving abilities, cognitive abilities, and neurobehavioral symptoms after&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury (TBI). For the purposes of this protocol, NeuroDRIVE refers to the&#xD;
      novel combined approach of driving training and cognitive rehabilitation in a virtual reality&#xD;
      environment. While NeuroDRIVE utilizes the VR system as the method through which the&#xD;
      intervention is administered, NeuroDRIVE is not the VR system itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 adult patients with a history of mild TBI and 30 adult patients with a history of&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe TBI. Participants will be recruited from the National Institutes of Health&#xD;
      (NIH), WRNMMC, and the broader community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a Clinical Trial Phase II interventional research study. The primary&#xD;
      purpose of the study is for treatment, and it will employ a parallel intervention model.&#xD;
      There will be no masking (i.e., open label). Participants will be classified into two groups&#xD;
      by TBI severity: those with history of mild TBI and those with history of moderate-tosevere&#xD;
      TBI. These different severities are known to have distinct cognitive sequelae. Within each&#xD;
      severity group, participants will be in a 2 (pre-post) x 2 (treatment vs. wait list)&#xD;
      experimental design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures will include:&#xD;

&#xD;
        Subjects eligible for participation must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Currently has a valid driver s license, or had a valid driver s license prior to&#xD;
             injury&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able to effectively manipulate the steering wheel and the gas/brake pedals without&#xD;

          4. Able to read, write, and speak in English&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of traumatic brain injury greater than 12 weeks prior to initiation into the&#xD;
             current study&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. NBSI score greater than or equal to 16 (Mild TBI sub-group only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are not eligible for participation if any of the following conditions exist:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Risk for injury from the MRI magnet, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pacemakers or other implanted electrical devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Brain stimulators.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Some types of dental implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aneurysm clips (metal clips on the wall of a large artery).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Metallic prostheses (including metal pins and rods, heart valves, and cochlear&#xD;
                  implants).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Permanent eyeliner (other non-metallic tattoos are permissible).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Implanted delivery pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Shrapnel fragments.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Welders and metal workers are also at risk for injury because of possible small&#xD;
                  metal fragments in the eye of which they may be unaware.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fear of confined spaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Back problems that may result in back pain or discomfort from lying in the&#xD;
                  scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Weight of over 350 pounds, due to the weight limit of the MRI table.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  It is not known if MRI is completely safe for a developing fetus. Therefore, all&#xD;
                  women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test performed no more than&#xD;
                  24 hours before each MRI scan. The scan will not be done if the pregnancy test is&#xD;
                  positive. Because neuroimaging is a key component of the current study, inability&#xD;
                  to participate in MRI scanning is a necessary exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of penetrating brain injury&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of serious medical condition other than TBI that could affect cognitive or&#xD;
             motor abilities (e.g., multiple sclerosis, encephalitis, cerebrovascular disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of severe motion sickness and/or vertigo.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Other medical or psychological instability that could create difficulty fulfilling the&#xD;
             study requirements (e.g., untreated mental illness, auditory/visual hallucinations,&#xD;
             narcolepsy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        To verify this information, study coordinators will request medical records (i.e., recent&#xD;
        medical history, medication list, any neuroimaging, and records pertinent to the&#xD;
        participant s recent injury) to further evaluate potential participants inclusion into the&#xD;
        study. Medical records can be obtained in three ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants can bring the records when they come to NIH for testing; it will be made&#xD;
             clear if they do not bring this information with them and we cannot verify that they&#xD;
             meet inclusion criteria, potential participants will not be enrolled into the study&#xD;
             that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Alternatively, the participants can also fax their medical records to a secured fax&#xD;
             machine at the Recreational Therapy office at the NIH where access is only permitted&#xD;
             to study staff (i.e., scheduler, physician, and nurse psychologist).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants may also fill out a medical release document and submit it to the study&#xD;
             coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medical history data will be reviewed, and if it is clear that the patient does not meet&#xD;
        the inclusion criteria, we will contact them and cancel their appointment. Data obtained in&#xD;
        this manner may be used to evaluate participant eligibility; however, it will not be used&#xD;
        for any research purposes. Additionally, for any patients who are deemed not eligible to&#xD;
        participate, their medical history data will be destroyed in accordance with NIH&#xD;
        regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        As a condition of receiving funding from CNRM, de-identified imaging and phenotyping data&#xD;
        (i.e., neurocognitive test results and behavioral questionnaires) from funded studies must&#xD;
        be made available within a centralized repository (the CNRM Informatics Core) one year&#xD;
        after the completion of the study. This is intended to facilitate use and analysis of this&#xD;
        data for future research questions or projects. As such, potential subjects will be&#xD;
        informed that they should not participate in this study if they do not want their data used&#xD;
        for other projects.&#xD;
