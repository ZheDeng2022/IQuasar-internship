  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective therapy for&#xD;
      resistant depression, it still fail to remit up to 70% of these patients. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      personalizing the procedure using functional MRI to better select dysfunctional regions and&#xD;
      robotic coil placement to stimulate these regions homogeneously, will increase its efficacy.&#xD;
      Individualized rTMS will be compared to traditional rTMS procedure and to trans-cranial&#xD;
      direct current stimulation (tDCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this small proof of principle study our primary outcome measure will be the correction of&#xD;
      the MRI anomalies. Symptoms reduction and the proportion of remitters will be secondary&#xD;
      outcome measurements.&#xD;

    <description>The target region will be defined by comparing the rCBF scan of the patient to a control population (n = 80). rCBF will be measured using the QUIPS2 arterial spin labeling sequence on a Siemens 3T Verio.

    <description>Functional connectivity map of the target region will be performed by extracting its average temporal course and looking at the region(s) which activity is correlated (smoothed by a 8 mm Gaussian kernel). The contrast map of each patient will be compared to the one of a control population submitted to the same analysis. We will compare the number of above threshold voxels (F-test, p &lt; 0.05 uncorrected, extension &gt; 1 cm3) before and after the therapeutic procedure (ANOVA). We will compare the average rCBF of the target region before and after the therapeutic protocol between the different procedures (ANOVA).</description>

    <description>The target region will be defined by comparing the rCBF scan of the patient to a control population (n = 80). rCBF will be measured using the QUIPS2 arterial spin labeling sequence on a Siemens 3T Verio.&#xD;
The therapeutic protocol will be design to correct the rCBF anomaly first by defining each point where to deliver the stimulation than the stimulation protocol for each point (180% of active motor threshold, 4-second 10 Hz train duration, with 26-second intertrain interval for a total of 3000 pulses). The whole target will be homogeneously stimulated.&#xD;
The active motor threshold will be assessed. The programmed protocol will be delivered while a figure of eight coil will be positioned by a robotic device (Axilum Robotics).&#xD;
The procedure will be repeated twice a day for 10 days over 2 weeks.</description>

    <description>rTMS will be performed as usual using a figure-eight coil: Defining the active motor threshold. For each session positioning the coil 5 cm ahead of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle, stimulating at 180% of active motor threshold (10 Hz, 4-second train duration, and 26-second intertrain interval) for 37.5 minutes (3000 pulses per session), twice a day for 10 days over 2 weeks.&#xD;
