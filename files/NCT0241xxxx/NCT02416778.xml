  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disordered iron metabolism characterizes an important determinant of impaired exercise&#xD;
      tolerance and work capacity. Iron-deficiency anemia commonly features impaired aerobic&#xD;
      capacity caused by decreased oxygen carrying capacity, and has been associated with a&#xD;
      negative effect on dyspnea and walking distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from that, iron deficiency without anemia was shown to affect endurance and energetic&#xD;
      efficiency via decreased tissue oxidative capacity. Consequently, depleted iron stores could&#xD;
      be capable of causing fatigue, breathlessness and impaired exercise tolerance, which are&#xD;
      common features of chronic cardiopulmonary diseases like chronic heart failure (CHF) and COPD&#xD;
      (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). Indeed, a current surge of interest aimed at&#xD;
      potential underlying determinants in CHF and COPD independent of the primarily disordered&#xD;
      organ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies identified iron deficiency without anemia as an independent factor of reduced&#xD;
      exercise intolerance in CHF as well as in COPD. Moreover, intravenous iron application&#xD;
      significantly improved exercise capacity in CHF patients with iron deficiency in presence as&#xD;
      well as in absence of anemia. Comparable to CHF, the daily living of patients with COPD is&#xD;
      compromised by impaired exercise tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, airflow limitation, as the foremost characteristic of COPD shows only weak&#xD;
      associations with exercise capacity. In line with that, exercise capacity showed no&#xD;
      remarkable improvement in lung transplant recipients, underlining the presence of systemic&#xD;
      determinants of limited exercise tolerance like iron deficiency. The investigators showed&#xD;
      that iron deficiency is present in 50% of stable COPD patients (unpublished data), which is&#xD;
      according to recently published data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators presume that iron deficiency contributes to limited exercise capacity in&#xD;
      COPD patients. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine whether iv iron is associated with&#xD;
      increases exercise capacity in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the investigators hypothesize that filling up depleted iron storages will increase&#xD;
      exercise capacity, measured by the 6-MWT (Minute Walking Test).&#xD;
