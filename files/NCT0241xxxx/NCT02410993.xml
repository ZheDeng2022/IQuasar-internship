  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to 2011 ACCF/AHA guideline and 2014 ESC/EACTS guideline, CABG surgery was&#xD;
      recommended for three-vessel coronary artery disease and left main coronary artery disease in&#xD;
      the patients with stable ischemic heart disease as class I. 2-VD with proximal left anterior&#xD;
      descending artery stenosis was also indicated for CABG surgery as class I recommendation.&#xD;
      However, many patients have been recommended for PCI by catheterization laboratory&#xD;
      cardiologist; 46% and 93% in the only-CABG candidates and both CABG and PCI candidates,&#xD;
      retrospectively, defined by previous ACC/AHA guideline. Although the discordance between real&#xD;
      practice in catheterization laboratory and guideline would be adjusted by recently updated&#xD;
      guideline. The revascularization strategy for patients with 3-VD/LMD in real practice have&#xD;
      been getting toward more PCI and less CABG surgery. In this study, we will identify the rate&#xD;
      of CABG candidates who were treated with PCI or medical treatment instead of CABG surgery in&#xD;
      different from current guideline. We are also going to compare two treatment strategies CABG&#xD;
      surgery vs. PCI with 2nd generation DES regarding clinical outcomes.&#xD;
