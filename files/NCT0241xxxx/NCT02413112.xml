  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well accepted that physical activity in the form of resistance training produces a wide&#xD;
      variety of neuromuscular-skeletal and health benefits. It is recommended in Finland that&#xD;
      older individuals (over 65yr) should perform resistance training twice per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, only approx. 5% of older individuals fulfill this recommendation. As Finnish&#xD;
      society grows ever older, research should focus on the specific needs of this group and how&#xD;
      to improve participation in physical activity, which may ultimately lead to modification of&#xD;
      physical activity recommendations - resistance training recommendations are currently the&#xD;
      same for young and older adults and do not include specific recommendations on the type of&#xD;
      resistance training. However, these recommendations appear to have been developed for &quot;best&#xD;
      possible&quot; improvements in maximum strength and muscle size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is of great importance to identify the number of resistance training sessions&#xD;
      per week required to induce improvements in physical fitness, metabolic and bone health&#xD;
      status, and importantly the reasons for adherence to/drop-out of resistance training&#xD;
      interventions (e.g. motivation to train) in a multi-discipline study. This knowledge would&#xD;
      benefit policy makers to update current recommendations for resistance training and to devise&#xD;
      strategies to advise realistic targets for resistance training in the older, particularly the&#xD;
      less-educated, age group (e.g. TELI-strategy for 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will include a 12-month resistance training intervention with a 12-month&#xD;
      follow-up period. Interviews and questionnaires will assess psychological/sociological data&#xD;
      and will be collected from both drop-out subjects and those that complete the intervention.&#xD;
      Neuromuscular performance and functional capacity will be tested using conventional methods,&#xD;
      along with body composition, bone density, and blood tests for metabolic markers of health.&#xD;
      Diet and other physical activity will be controlled throughout the intervention period.&#xD;
      Measurements are to be performed every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that 5 international peer-reviewed articles will be published in 2016-2017.&#xD;
      The data will be presented at international and national conferences in 2015-2017. Finally,&#xD;
      results of the entire research will be published in national peer-reviewed journals (e.g. The&#xD;
      Age Institute's &quot;Raportteja&quot;). All subjects will be invited to attend an information meeting&#xD;
      where group results will be presented and explained.&#xD;
