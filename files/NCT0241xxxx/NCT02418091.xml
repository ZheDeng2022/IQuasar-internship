      This study will build a population management system Simultaneous risk factor control using&#xD;
      Telehealth to slOw Progression of Diabetic Kidney Disease STOP-DKD Application STOP-DKD APP&#xD;
      and conduct a 6-month controlled trial to compare reduction of blood pressure. In addition,&#xD;
      the study will evaluate the feasibility of future large-scale intervention to slow diabetic&#xD;
      kidney disease (DKD) DKD progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Identify patients with moderate DKD and uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) using existing&#xD;
      electronic health record data in an integrated data warehouse (Southeastern Diabetes&#xD;
      Initiative- SEDI) to screen all patients within SEDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Implement an intervention designed to slow progression of DKD and treat associated&#xD;
      conditions in a high-risk population with moderate DKD and uncontrolled HTN using the&#xD;
      STOP-DKD APP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Outcome: Test the hypothesis that patients who receive the intervention will&#xD;
           have greater improvements in blood pressure as compared to a control group after 6&#xD;
           months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Outcomes: Exploratory analyses to determine whether patients who receive the&#xD;
           intervention will have less progression (defined as a smaller decrease in kidney&#xD;
           function), and improved behaviors that affect HTN control and cardiovascular risk&#xD;
           (medication adherence, diet, physical activity, and weight control) as compared to a&#xD;
           control group after 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Evaluate the STOP-DKD APP Study to guide large-scale implementation &amp; dissemination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impact Evaluation: Assess the potential population impact of our intervention using the&#xD;
           Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Economic Evaluation: Conduct an economic evaluation using the Archimedes Model by&#xD;
           estimating projected costs and quality-adjusted life-years&#xD;

The STOP-DKDAutomated Population Program will deliver a tailored, multi-factorial intervention to address medication self-management and modify multiple risk factors simultaneously through a combination of patient self-monitoring, behavioral therapies and education that optimize adherence and self-efficacy.</description>
