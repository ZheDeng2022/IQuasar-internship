    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover, 2-cohort study in&#xD;
      adult patients with refractory chronic cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of inhaled PA101 delivered via&#xD;
      eFlow high efficiency nebulizer for treating refractory chronic cough.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 treatment cohorts with refractory chronic cough: Idiopathic Pulmonary&#xD;
      Fibrosis (IPF, Cohort 1) and Chronic Idiopathic Cough (CIC, Cohort 2). In each cohort, the&#xD;
      study will include two treatment periods of 14 days each separated by a Washout Period of 14&#xD;
      days between Period 1 and Period 2. The two periods will be identical except that in Period&#xD;
      2, patients will crossover to the alternate treatment from that received in Period 1,&#xD;
      according to a 1:1 randomization scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each period, patients will self-administer study drug (i.e., 40 mg PA101 or Placebo&#xD;
      PA101 via eFlow) three times daily for 14 consecutive days of each period. Objective cough&#xD;
      count will be recorded over 24-hour period using a cough count device (Leicester Cough&#xD;
      Monitor) at the Baseline, Day 7 and Day 14 of each treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the IPF cohort, patients will be allowed to use antifibrotic therapy (i.e., pirfenidone,&#xD;
      nintedanib, and N-acetylcysteine) during the course of the study provided that the dose is&#xD;
      stabilized at least 3 months prior to Screening and throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical safety assessments will be performed at the start and end of each treatment period.&#xD;
