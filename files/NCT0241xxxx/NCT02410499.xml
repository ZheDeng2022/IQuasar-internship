  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the effects of 85 days treatment with MLN1202 on&#xD;
      urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) in participants with type 2 diabetes, advanced&#xD;
      kidney disease/diabetic nephropathy (DN) and macro-albuminuria (UACR&gt;300 mg/g) based on&#xD;
      average of 3 consecutive first morning voids sample collection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called MLN1202. MLN1202 is being tested to treat&#xD;
      people who have diabetes with macroalbuminuria. This study will look at the urinary&#xD;
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio in people who take MLN1202.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 156 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by&#xD;
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four treatment groups-which will remain&#xD;
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent&#xD;
      medical need):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MLN1202 75 mg subcutaneous (SC) injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MLN1202 105 mg SC injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MLN1202 150 mg SC injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo matching MLN1202 SC injection (dummy inactive solution) - this is a solution&#xD;
           that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive a loading dose of placebo or MLN1202 on Day 1 followed by&#xD;
      once-weekly injections of the study medication they were randomized to receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is 5 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, plus a final visit 5&#xD;
      weeks after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;
