    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ribociclib and gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride in treating patients with solid tumors or lymphoma that have spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Ribociclib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs&#xD;
      used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Giving ribociclib together with gemcitabine hydrochloride may&#xD;
      work better in treating patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the dose-limiting toxicities and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      recommended Phase II dose of the combination of LEE011 (ribociclib) and gemcitabine&#xD;
      (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the safety and tolerability of the combination of LEE011 and gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) of LEE011 in combination with gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe preliminary evidence of efficacy of the combination of LEE011 and&#xD;
      gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the correlation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) amplification (testing by&#xD;
      fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]), retinoblastoma (RB) and P16 expression (by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry) in archived and biopsied tumor tissue with treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ribociclib orally (PO) on days 1-14 and gemcitabine hydrochloride&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
