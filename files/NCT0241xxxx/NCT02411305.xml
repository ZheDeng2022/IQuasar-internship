      Few formal mechanisms for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data on quality in palliative&#xD;
      care exist. Such infrastructure is needed to understand current clinical practices, inform&#xD;
      quality improvement projects, and research which links adherence to specific quality measures&#xD;
      and improved patient-centered outcomes. This infrastructure, if proven feasible, can then&#xD;
      become integrated into usual palliative care delivery across the PCRC. Then, palliative care&#xD;
      can conduct the same types of collaborative quality improvement activities, based on data&#xD;
      collected at point of care, as other medical disciplines like general surgery and cardiology.&#xD;

      Healthcare processes are measured, evaluated, and characterized through the use of healthcare&#xD;
      quality measures. Healthcare quality measures are tools that quantify the consistency of care&#xD;
      delivery within a population eligible for the process. Containing a numerator (those with&#xD;
      successful delivery of a care process) and a denominator (eligible patients for that care&#xD;
      process), quality measures produce a frequency or adherence rate to which a care process was&#xD;
      performed. Adherence rates can then be compared to evaluate quality of care across&#xD;
      clinicians, organizations, or collaborations to compare data, establish benchmarks, and spur&#xD;
      quality improvement projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In palliative care, for example, it is usually considered best practice to prescribe opioids&#xD;
      for moderate/severe pain. Imagine that a palliative care program's calculated adherence rate&#xD;
      reveals that their clinicians prescribe opioids for moderate-to-severe pain only 50% of the&#xD;
      time. Armed with this information, the program can now develop a directed quality improvement&#xD;
      project with the intention of improving this performance towards a more ideal goal (e.g.&#xD;
      75%). Further, it can provide feedback to clinicians in real-time regarding how they are&#xD;
      performing against the quality measures of interest. In this example, clinicians may receive&#xD;
      an electronic alert reminding them to prescribe an opioid when directed by an accepted best&#xD;
      practice. This real-time approach, combined with a system that promotes culture of data&#xD;
      collection, sharing, benchmarking, and reporting, are effective methods to improve healthcare&#xD;
      quality. Lastly, and the focus of this proposal, is to build and test such an infrastructure&#xD;
      that performs such real-time quality monitoring of healthcare measures in the Palliative Care&#xD;
      Research Cooperative group (PCRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously identified the three major components needed for an&#xD;
      effective and usable quality-monitoring infrastructure. Together, these three components&#xD;
      answer the &quot;what&quot;, &quot;how&quot;, and &quot;for why&quot; questions that must be addressed within a quality&#xD;
      assessment and improvement system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, is the ability to perform collaborative and integrated data collection across several&#xD;
      sites. Successful multi-site data collection requires a centrally governed set of data&#xD;
      collection processes, which are guided by a data dictionary. A data dictionary is a set of&#xD;
      agreed-upon data elements, answer choices, rules, and branching logic. The data dictionary&#xD;
      informs the development of a data collection platform for use by clinicians. Together, the&#xD;
      data dictionary and software for use by clinicians guide &quot;what&quot; data is collected, and ensure&#xD;
      that the intended collaborative analyses can be performed with the data set created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, is the process for data collection - the &quot;how&quot; characteristic within the system. Data&#xD;
      is collected, transmitted and recorded through the use of a data collection platform,&#xD;
      transmission processes, and registry, respectively. The data collection platform is the&#xD;
      interface in which real-time data is captured and recorded. This can involve paper-based or&#xD;
      electronic forms using patient, caregiver, or clinician reporters. Data is then transmitted&#xD;
      to the registry, either through electronic or manual means. Lastly, data is collected and&#xD;
      securely stored in a prospective registry, so quality reports can be generated and research&#xD;
      analyses completed. These steps are recommended standards for development of health&#xD;
      information technology by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, is the component of the infrastructure that answers the question, &quot;for why?&quot; Several&#xD;
      reports have highlighted the need to translate raw data from quality monitoring efforts into&#xD;
      continuous feedback on quality to clinicians and other end-users to motivate the delivery of&#xD;
      best practices. This allows for changes in clinician performance during usual clinical care&#xD;
      delivery, thus meeting the Institute of Medicine's aim for a rapid learning healthcare&#xD;
      system. Generally, feedback is provided through system-generated reports that target specific&#xD;
      end-users (e.g. clinicians, administrators) delivered during pre-specified time periods (e.g.&#xD;
      weekly, quarterly).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Duke University, investigators recently built the information technology infrastructure&#xD;
      needed for prospective quality measure adherence and outcomes monitoring in palliative care.&#xD;
      This system was developed and deployed in the Carolinas Consortium for Palliative Care, a&#xD;
      four-site collaboration between Duke University and three community palliative care&#xD;
      organizations. Recently, this Consortium has expanded to include organizations outside the&#xD;
      Carolinas; eleven sites now comprise the Global Palliative Care Quality Alliance (GPCQA). The&#xD;
      rapid expansion of qdact users and subsequent data collected have supported several&#xD;
      research-level analysis published in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In using qdact.pc, clinicians record data on processes of care and patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
      on personal iPadsÂ® during face-to-face clinical encounters with patients. During patient&#xD;
      interviews, clinicians record patient-reported areas of distress, clinical management&#xD;
      decisions, and patient-reported outcomes using validated instruments. These instruments&#xD;
      include those common to the field, including the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS),&#xD;
      Palliative Performance Scale, and FACT-G. Longitudinal changes in these scales are captured&#xD;
      through repeat use of qdact.pc during subsequent encounters. Further, qdact.pc calculates&#xD;
      length of stay from admission and discharge dates, changes in symptom severity by calculating&#xD;
      the difference between two dates, and readmission rates by analyzing whether patients in the&#xD;
      registry had previously been admitted. Then, care processes and outcomes can be linked using&#xD;
      these data.&#xD;
