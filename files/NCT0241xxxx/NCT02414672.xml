  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CareSTEPS intervention fills an important service gap by providing education, skills&#xD;
      training, and support to the caregivers of advanced lung cancer patients on active treatment.&#xD;
      The home-based delivery format will facilitate future dissemination and outreach. By&#xD;
      empowering families with the skills they need to provide care and meet the challenges of lung&#xD;
      cancer, this intervention holds great promise for improving caregiver quality of life (QOL),&#xD;
      patient QOL, and the quality of palliative and supportive care services offered to patients&#xD;
      with advanced cancer and their families.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The profound symptom burden associated with advanced lung cancer (LC) makes caregiving a&#xD;
      complex and burdensome task. Despite the input of outpatient palliative care services, LC&#xD;
      families are often unprepared for caregiving, have low self-efficacy for managing symptoms at&#xD;
      home, report high rates of physical and emotional distress, and receive very little skills&#xD;
      training or psychosocial care. To date, the few psychosocial intervention trials targeting&#xD;
      the caregivers of advanced cancer patients that have been conducted have mostly targeted the&#xD;
      families of hospice patients, have not been well-integrated into routine palliative care, and&#xD;
      have not addressed the specific needs of LC caregivers. Based on our published and recently&#xD;
      completed pilot work in LC, the investigators have developed a psychosocial intervention&#xD;
      called CareSTEPS (self-Care, Stress management, sympTom management, Effective communication,&#xD;
      Problem-solving, and Social support). CareSTEPS is grounded by Self Determination Theory&#xD;
      (SDT) which focuses on individuals' needs for developing autonomy (a sense of choice and&#xD;
      volition), competence (self-efficacy), and relatedness (a sense of belonging and connection).&#xD;
      It: 1) teaches skills to enhance caregiver competence for managing symptoms, practicing&#xD;
      self-care, and coping with cancer; 2) supports caregiver autonomy by providing a clear&#xD;
      rationale for recommendations and a variety of options to encourage choice and elaboration;&#xD;
      and, 3) seeks to improve caregivers' sense of relatedness by teaching strategies for&#xD;
      effective communication and soliciting/accepting social support. 200 LC patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled within one month of treatment initiation (baseline) and their caregivers and&#xD;
      randomize them to either a usual medical care (UMC) condition or the CareSTEPS intervention&#xD;
      (caregivers receive a manual and six 45-minute weekly counseling sessions by telephone). The&#xD;
      primary aim is to determine the impact of the CareSTEPS intervention on caregiver self-care&#xD;
      behaviors, physical and emotional QOL, and satisfaction with care. Secondary aims are to: 1a)&#xD;
      examine the effects of CareSTEPS on the SDT constructs of competence, autonomy, and&#xD;
      relatedness; 1b) test whether caregiver competence, autonomy and relatedness mediate the&#xD;
      effects of CareSTEPS on caregiver outcomes as hypothesized; 2) explore whether&#xD;
      sociodemographic, medical, and relationship factors moderate the effects of the CareSTEPS&#xD;
      intervention on SDT constructs; and, 3) explore the effects of CareSTEPS on patient QOL,&#xD;
      palliative care utilization, and satisfaction with care. CareSTEPS fills an important service&#xD;
      gap by providing education, skills training, and support to the caregivers of advanced LC&#xD;
      patients who are on active treatment. The home-based delivery format will facilitate future&#xD;
      dissemination and outreach. By empowering families with the skills they need to provide care&#xD;
      and meet the challenges of LC, CareSTEPS holds great promise for improving caregiver QOL,&#xD;
      patient QOL, and the quality of palliative/supportive care services for advanced cancer&#xD;
      patients and their families.&#xD;
