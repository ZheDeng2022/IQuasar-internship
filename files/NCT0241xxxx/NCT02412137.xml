  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To measure the effectiveness of counseling on brace-wear compliance and curve progression in&#xD;
      patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The investigators hypothesize that compliance&#xD;
      is increased when it is measured and used to counsel patients, and therefore those patients&#xD;
      will have less curve progression and fewer would need surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second purpose is to evaluate whether there is a correlation between BMI and brace&#xD;
      effectiveness. Proposed theories for decreased effectiveness in patients with elevated BMI&#xD;
      have included decreased compliance due to discomfort and decreased force exerted on the curve&#xD;
      due to the larger habitus.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to enroll 300 subjects prospectively with the hypothesis that some&#xD;
      will be lost to followup, and would like a final number of at least 125 in each group. All&#xD;
      patients who fit the inclusion criteria and consent to participate in the study will have two&#xD;
      temperature monitors installed inside the padding in the front of their brace. The monitors&#xD;
      will sample temperature every hour, with room temperature and body temperature representing&#xD;
      periods of non-use and use respectively. Each temperature monitor is programmed to record&#xD;
      temperature sequentially, so that a longer period of time can be monitored in case the&#xD;
      patient's appointments get postponed beyond the time capacity of only one monitor. The&#xD;
      monitors will be downloaded into a laptop computer by an orthotist in the scoliosis clinic&#xD;
      each visit. A short questionnaire entitled the Brace Beliefs Questionnaire, consisting of 18&#xD;
      questions, will be administered to all patients at the time of brace prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In approximately 50% of the patients, the information would be shared on each follow-up visit&#xD;
      with the nurses, orthotist, and physician. Patients are not going to be randomized as&#xD;
      communication in the clinic waiting room is common among braced patients. However, by having&#xD;
      all patients treated by a specific physician included in either the counseling group, or if&#xD;
      treated by a different physician in the standard care group, all patients in the waiting room&#xD;
      at a given time would be enrolled in a single arm of the study. The patient and parent will&#xD;
      then be given the visit's wear-time information and counseled regarding compliance using this&#xD;
      information. A standardized progress report (Brace Progress Report) will be completed by the&#xD;
      physician or orthotist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the other 50% of patients, only the person downloading the loggers would be aware of&#xD;
      wear-time and that information would not be shared with the medical staff. Those patients&#xD;
      will not receive detailed counseling regarding the actual hours of brace wear as documented&#xD;
      by the temperature loggers, but instead will receive routine clinical care including a&#xD;
      discussion about the importance of compliance. Radiographs routinely obtained in the clinic&#xD;
      will be measured by the Principle Investigator. No extra radiographs will be obtained based&#xD;
      on the participation in this study. The curve will be classified using the criteria of Lenke.&#xD;
      Scoliosis will be measured by the Cobb angle technique and the Risser sign charted. Curve&#xD;
      progression will be defined as progression of greater than or equal to six degrees. Patients&#xD;
      with progression to greater than 45 degrees, who have surgery recommended, or who undergo&#xD;
      spinal fusion surgery will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment and follow-up, gathering data, and analysis of that prospective data from 200&#xD;
      subjects is estimated to take approximately 5 years. We will not disclose to the subjects&#xD;
      that information from the temperature monitors can be used to monitor compliance because such&#xD;
      disclosure would change the purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With permission of the authors (Katz, et al, 2010) we will utilize de-identified BMI and&#xD;
      brace compliance data from the 100 patients who completed their previous study. This data&#xD;
      will be combined with the same information obtained from patient participation in this study&#xD;
      since both studies essentially used the same method for measuring patient brace wear&#xD;
      compliance. The increased numbers should lend stronger evidence to the findings. A target&#xD;
      accrual number of 300 is expected (100 with de-identified retrospective data and 200&#xD;
      prospective study subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOURCES OF RESEARCH MATERIAL: Existing diagnostic data could come from the patients' medical&#xD;
      records and radiographs, but temperature/date/time information downloaded from the loggers,&#xD;
      data from the Brace Beliefs Questionnaire, and data recorded in the Brace Progress Report&#xD;
      will be obtained specifically for research. Identifiable data obtained specifically for&#xD;
      research purposes will be used to answer the study questions. Any data resulting from&#xD;
      radiographic studies will be standard of care that is associated with the patient's clinical&#xD;
      treatment, so no x-rays will be included for research purposes in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient name/ID&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic information necessary to initiate contact with patient, including telephone&#xD;
           numbers, address or language&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date and results of physical exams from clinical records and radiographic studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment history (surgical and non-surgical) and complications of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temperature/date/time data downloaded from logger&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data from short questionnaire (Brace Beliefs Questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documentation of counseling session with patients who are in the counseling group using&#xD;
           Brace Progress Report.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documentation of no counseling session in the &quot;no counseling&quot; group along with the&#xD;
           amount of their brace wear compliance as recorded in the Brace Progress report.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the purpose of reporting any correlation between brace effectiveness and BMI,&#xD;
           deidentified data from 100 patients previously enrolled in IRB#0598-2220 will be merged&#xD;
           with the same data collected from physical exams and brace compliance data from this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT OF SUBJECTS: Patients will be identified face-to-face as candidates for the study&#xD;
      by the treating physician or orthotist at the scoliosis clinics at Texas Scottish Rite&#xD;
      Hospital for Children as they present to clinic for diagnosis and treatment of their&#xD;
      idiopathic scoliosis when the brace is initially prescribed. They will be invited, all study&#xD;
      procedures will be explained to them, and they will be encouraged to have any questions&#xD;
      answered. All patients will be informed that temperature loggers are going to be inserted in&#xD;
      their orthoses, and that temperature information will be downloaded at each visit. Only the&#xD;
      group that will receive counseling will be informed that the temperature information is a&#xD;
      measure of brace compliance. The other group will not be informed that the temperature&#xD;
      information indicates whether or not, and how often, the brace is worn. Informing them that&#xD;
      the logger measures compliance would influence the outcome of the study, and therefore cannot&#xD;
      be shared with the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures Screening Procedures Subjects will be identified and screened according to&#xD;
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria as they present to clinic and are referred by their&#xD;
      respective physicians to the Orthotics Department for bracing. This referral is standard&#xD;
      clinical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention After the study subject accepts the invitation to participate in the&#xD;
      study, they will be asked to sign the consent documents and given copies for their records.&#xD;
      The Research Coordinator will record documentation of the recruitment process, invitation to&#xD;
      participate in the study, and informed consent on an Invitation Checklist. Subjects are&#xD;
      routinely assigned randomly into one of seven orthopaedic physician's clinics on their first&#xD;
      visit. Which of the two study groups they belong to will be determined by which physician is&#xD;
      seeing them. All physician staff Orthopedists at TSRH have agreed to participate in this&#xD;
      study and are listed as sub-investigators.The Principle Investigator will draw physician&#xD;
      names to determine which ones will be receiving information about bracewear compliance that&#xD;
      is downloaded from the monitors and then provide counseling to their patients, and which&#xD;
      physician staff will not be receiving information about bracewear compliance at the patient&#xD;
      visits, and thus will not be providing additional counseling based on this information.&#xD;
      (1.One group will be counseled after brace temperature/date/time data is logged at each&#xD;
      visit. 2. The other group will receive routine clinical care including a discussion about the&#xD;
      importance of compliance.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures and Evaluations All subjects will be fitted by the Orthotist with a customized&#xD;
      scoliosis brace that includes the two temperature logger discs (about the size of a nickel&#xD;
      coin) which are fitted into the felt lining of the inside front of the brace. The subject&#xD;
      will be given their first set of instructions regarding wear and care of the brace (standard&#xD;
      clinical procedure) along with the Brace Beliefs Questionnaire (which should take less than&#xD;
      10 minutes and is being done specifically for research purposes. If the patient expresses&#xD;
      anxiety at answering questions, they will asked whether they want to continue). At every&#xD;
      subsequent clinic follow-up visit (see Follow-up below for frequency and duration), the&#xD;
      counseling group will have their brace wear compliance documented on the Brace Progress&#xD;
      Report after the Orthotist downloads the time/temperature data onto a laptop from the sensor&#xD;
      reader (A piece of computer hardware which the sensor clips into and is attached to the&#xD;
      laptop via the USB port). The Orthotist will then reset the temperature logger discs and&#xD;
      reinstall them into the padding in the inside front of the brace in order to monitor the next&#xD;
      period of brace wear. Depending on which group the patient has been assigned to, they will&#xD;
      either be counseled for about 10 minutes or less regarding their brace-wear using the Brace&#xD;
      Progress report as a checklist, or receive standard clinical care. Ideally, counseling would&#xD;
      be done by the treating physician (standard clinical care) using the Bracing Progress Report&#xD;
      Form (done for research purposes only). Counseling may also be done by nurse coordinators&#xD;
      involved in the patient's care (which is standard clinical care) utilizing the same Bracing&#xD;
      Progress Report Form if the treating physician is not available to do it. Data from the Brace&#xD;
      Beliefs Questionnaire will be used to discover the subject's initial attitude about wearing&#xD;
      the brace. Brace wear compliance data received from counseled patients will be compared to&#xD;
      the same data received from the patients who have received standard clinical care to see&#xD;
      whether counseling makes a difference in their compliance and thus their clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Patients will be followed for the duration of their bracing, which typically lasts&#xD;
      approximately one to four years, and depends on the rate of their growth and curve&#xD;
      progression. Data will be collected each time they present to clinic for follow-up, on&#xD;
      average two to three times per year. Each patient will be followed until skeletally mature,&#xD;
      two years following brace discontinuation, or until spinal fusion surgery is performed. Final&#xD;
      outcomes (whether or not they progress to surgery) will be included in the data collected for&#xD;
      this study.)&#xD;
