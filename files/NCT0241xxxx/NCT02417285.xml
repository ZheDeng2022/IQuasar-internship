    <textblock>
      CC-122-NHL-001 study is a multicenter, open-label, phase Ib study with dose escalation and&#xD;
      expansion parts. It evaluates the safety, tolerability and clinical pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab (GA101). The study is also assessing the preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of the combination as well as pharmacodynamic and tumor biomarkers as exploratory&#xD;
      objectives. In the dose escalation part, the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of&#xD;
      CC-122 administered with a fixed dose of obinutuzumab will be administered to identify the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose. In the dose expansion part, more patients will be enrolled at a&#xD;
      CC-122 dose selected from the escalation part of the study in combination with fixed dose&#xD;
      obinutuzumab to further study safety and efficacy.&#xD;

      The one or two cohorts during the dose expansion phase (Part B) will enroll subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who were either refractory to or relapsed&#xD;
      after treatment with a lenalidomide-containing regimen (FL-1 cohort) or never been exposed to&#xD;
      lenalidomide (FL-2 cohort). The FL-1 and FL-2 cohorts will enroll up to 20 and/or up to 30&#xD;
      subjects, respectively.&#xD;
