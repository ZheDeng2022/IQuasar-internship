      Subgroups of patients with radically operated colorectal cancer can have a better prognosis&#xD;
      by over six months are treated with chemotherapy. This beneficial effect may be enhanced&#xD;
      somewhat by providing a combination of chemotherapy and the addition of oxaliplatin. It is&#xD;
      known that this treatment additions increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects such as&#xD;
      sensitivity to cold, numbness and tingling in hands or feet, muscle cramps, pain, taste&#xD;
      disorders and swallowing difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to investigate how colorectal cancer patients with oxaliplatin adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy experience neurotoxic effects and if the experience of the symptoms change over&#xD;
      time during treatment and how symptoms affect patients' daily lives and quality of life.&#xD;

      Subgroups of patients with radically operated colorectal cancer can have a better prognosis&#xD;
      by over six months are treated with chemotherapy. This beneficial effect may be enhanced&#xD;
      somewhat by providing a combination of chemotherapy and the addition of oxaliplatin. It is&#xD;
      known that this treatment additions increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects such as&#xD;
      sensitivity to cold, numbness and tingling in hands or feet, muscle cramps, pain, taste&#xD;
      disorders and swallowing difficulties. A few studies on patients' experience of the&#xD;
      neurotoxic symptoms and its impact on daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operative treatment of colorectal cancer is surgery. The possibility of curative&#xD;
      resection is the factor most strongly associated to the patient's survival. High-risk&#xD;
      patients and metastasis is not a contraindication for surgery of the primary tumor, but the&#xD;
      individual patient's benefit from surgery must be especially valued. If the primary tumor&#xD;
      does not cause any troublesome symptoms, and there are metastases in other organs, which can&#xD;
      be treated with non-surgical methods, the tumor can be left initially and removed later if&#xD;
      symptoms occur. For rectal cancer radiation therapy can be topical and reduces the risk of&#xD;
      local recurrence. In locally advanced cancer in which radical resection is not possible,&#xD;
      radiation therapy, with or without chemotherapy, be current in order to achieve tumor-killing&#xD;
      effect of the infiltration zone. Radiation therapy can cause acute and chronic complications,&#xD;
      such as pain, faecal incontinence and sexual dysfunction which may affect patients' quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At more advanced but radically operated colorectal cancer is commonly advised chemotherapy.&#xD;
      The goal of giving chemotherapy is that, if possible, prevent micrometastasis that may exist&#xD;
      in any patient, even though the patient is managed with radical surgery. Colorectal cancer&#xD;
      spreads primarily to the lymph nodes and liver, but also through the bloodstream to the&#xD;
      lungs, brain and bone. Choice of chemotherapy is influenced by several factors, including&#xD;
      tumor extent, time from primary diagnosis, previous treatment given, symptoms, performance&#xD;
      status, concomitant other diseases, blood tests and patient's own attitude towards such&#xD;
      readiness to accept some side effects. Treatment intention can be curative, palliative or&#xD;
      prophylactic (adjuvant). There are mainly three types of chemotherapy used to treat&#xD;
      colorectal cancers. They can be individual, but is usually provided in combination. They can&#xD;
      be given in multiple lines, which means that a combination can be administered initially and&#xD;
      then changed to another combination of poor tolerance or treatment failure. Most patients get&#xD;
      two or three lines of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intended to provide combination therapy is to increase efficacy against the tumor, reducing&#xD;
      the risk of resistance developing and spreading side effects. The effect of a particular&#xD;
      treatment is best the earlier it is given but may be meaningful even at a later stage. A&#xD;
      cornerstone of treatment for over five decades, 5-fluorouracil (5FU), which in colorectal&#xD;
      cancer, in combination with folinic acid (leucovorin). This regime is relatively lowtoxic and&#xD;
      most patients are capable of treatment without severe side effects. Capecitabine (Xeloda) is&#xD;
      another treatment regimen, which is often preferred by patients because it is given orally&#xD;
      and usually mild side effects. Another treatment option is to give oxaliplatin in addition to&#xD;
      5-flurouracil, leucovorin or capecitabine (FOLFOX 4, PHLOX, XELOX). These combinations are&#xD;
      under trials to prolong survival compared with only 5-flurouracil and leucovorin. Oxaliplatin&#xD;
      can reduce the risk of relapse by about 25 percent in comparison with 5FU/leukovorin. This&#xD;
      regimen poses an increased proportion of neurotoxic side effects as a result. Chemotherapy&#xD;
      can generally provide a number of unpleasant and sometimes life-threatening side effects.&#xD;
      Side effects that may occur are symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anemia, skin lesions&#xD;
      and mouth blown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This can result in nutritional difficulties, reduced strength and impaired immune system with&#xD;
      increased risk of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fact that the patient be informed of a cancer diagnosis is a strain on both the patient&#xD;
      but also for the relatives. This may mean that ordinary life is changing and that the normal&#xD;
      daily activities can not be performed previously because of hospitalization, surgical and&#xD;
      oncological treatment. As far as quality of life as it includes the experience of health and&#xD;
      welfare of the patient based on physical, psychological and social needs. It may also include&#xD;
      economic, political, and spiritual needs. The concept of health-related quality of life&#xD;
      suited to the context in which disease symptoms affect the individual's physical function.&#xD;
      Possible treatments and its side effects can affect individual's ability to function.&#xD;
      Health-related quality of life is an individual experience and can vary between individuals.&#xD;
      In the case of the most valuable views on the treatment results so the patient has a very&#xD;
      important role. Patients who have a disease with a reading experience both advantages and&#xD;
      disadvantages (side effects) with their treatment. By measuring the patients' health-related&#xD;
      quality of life it is possible to create a picture of the patient's perspective on their&#xD;
      illness and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sense Of Coherence (SOC) has been by Antonovsky divided into three key components:&#xD;
      comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness. Antonovsky argues that the degree of SOC&#xD;
      affects a person's ability to handle stressful situations. Studies show that psychological&#xD;
      stress has a negative impact on quality of life in patients with various types of cancer, but&#xD;
      few studies have shown that the same applies to colorectal cancer patients. But the cancer&#xD;
      patients' personality affects the perceived quality of life is known. Several psychological&#xD;
      and personality factors play a central role in the disease process. A strong sense of&#xD;
      coherence is a health-stimulating factor and in studies of cancer patients resulted in&#xD;
      reduced mortality, disease progression and resignation. The cancer involves the patient an&#xD;
      extensive psychological stressful situation, and the patient's capacity to adapt themselves&#xD;
      to be influenced by his defense. The validated instrument SOC (Sense of Coherence) is able to&#xD;
      measure the patients' sense of coherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurotoxic side effects often occur during treatment with oxaliplatin. Oxaliplatin can cause&#xD;
      acute and delayed neuropathies. Studies have shown that some patients have persistent and&#xD;
      chronic problems. Acute neurotoxicity is usually a half hour to an hour after start of&#xD;
      infusion and disappears after a few days, and often arrives at any doses. These symptoms can&#xD;
      present themselves as paresthesia, cold intolerance, and pain in the eye and jaw, abdominal&#xD;
      pain, cramps in legs and calves, numbness and tingling of the hands, feet and around his&#xD;
      mouth and voice and vision changes. Side effects are not reduced within 14 days can be&#xD;
      permanent nerve damage leading to difficulties to write, walk, swallow and carry out daily&#xD;
      activities. Permanent damage may occur without acute side effects initial stage. It is&#xD;
      important that especially during the second half of the treatment period, observe signs of&#xD;
      neurotoxic symptoms consisting of therapy. Studies show that the neurotoxic effects greatly&#xD;
      affected how long the treatment lasted. If patients have these side effects should&#xD;
      oxaliplatin reduced or excluded for fear debilitating and prolonged neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug-specific questionnaire Oxaliplatin-Specific Neurotoxicity Scale is the most accurate&#xD;
      instrument for measuring the neurotoxic symptoms. The instrument is divided into three parts:&#xD;
      upper extremities, lower extremities and mouth / facial region. Symptoms estimated from the&#xD;
      preceding cycle of therapy and graded based on whether symptoms exist or not. If the patient&#xD;
      has symptoms, these should be graded from 1-5. Patients should also rate the extent to which&#xD;
      symptoms affect their daily lives and activities between 1-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to note early neurotoxic effects and to encourage patients to report symptoms&#xD;
      that arise. Information before treatment is started if the side effects that might arise and&#xD;
      how patients can detect early symptoms are significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who had neuropathy in the upper extremities experienced difficulties such as&#xD;
      fastening buttons, zips close, write, sew and do housework, unlike the patients with lower&#xD;
      neuropathy who had difficulty driving, walking, train and carry out activities (balance). The&#xD;
      perceived disability can cause feelings of anxiety, depression, frustration, anger and&#xD;
      difficulty in adapting to their situation which may also affect the social interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to investigate how colorectal cancer patients with oxaliplatin adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy experience neurotoxic effects and if the experience of the symptoms change over&#xD;
      time during treatment and how symptoms affect patients' daily lives and quality of life.&#xD;
