    <textblock>
      Depression affects up to 20% of people in their lifetime and can be a severe debilitating&#xD;
      illness. Indeed, the World Health Organisation has estimated that depression will soon be the&#xD;
      second leading contributor to the burden of disease worldwide. One of the big problems for&#xD;
      patients and doctors is that currently available antidepressant drugs and psychotherapies do&#xD;
      not work for 30% of people. However, about 60% of such treatment-resistant patients will&#xD;
      recover fully with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Even though it was developed over 75&#xD;
      years ago, ECT continues to be the most powerful treatment for severe, often&#xD;
      life-threatening, depression. Despite that, we have recently reported that severe depression&#xD;
      symptoms return (called a &quot;relapse&quot;) in nearly 40% of such responders within six months of&#xD;
      completing a course of ECT. Actually, such high relapse rates are seen for all patients with&#xD;
      treatment-resistant depression, irrespective of what treatment they have received. There is&#xD;
      thus an urgent need for better treatments to prevent relapse and one such possibility is an&#xD;
      old drug called ketamine. Ketamine blocks the activity of glutamate, one of the major&#xD;
      chemical messenger systems in the brain. Because of this effect it is sometimes used as an&#xD;
      anaesthetic but it can also make you feel a bit &quot;high&quot; and so is sometimes abused as a&#xD;
      recreational drug. Fortunately, in small doses it is quite safe. Recently, it has been found&#xD;
      that ketamine has a remarkably rapid, but brief, antidepressant effect, including reducing&#xD;
      suicidal thoughts. We wish to evaluate ketamine as a way to reduce relapse rates in people&#xD;
      who have just been treated successfully with ECT for severe depression. Developing such a new&#xD;
      treatment, and understanding how it works, would be of tremendous benefit to persons with&#xD;
      severe depression, their families, and the wider society.&#xD;

      DESIGN: This pilot trial has two phases. Phase 1 is a prospective open study that involves&#xD;
      recruiting a cohort of patients with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV criteria) referred for&#xD;
      ECT. Patients subsequently identified as being responders will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      Phase 2, which is a two-group parallel-design randomised controlled pilot trial. These&#xD;
      results describe the participants who completed full informed consent to randomisation.&#xD;
      Consented ECT-responders were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to a four-week course of&#xD;
      either once-weekly ketamine or midazolam infusions, continuing regular care. Participants&#xD;
      were followed-up over six-months following ECT to identify if and when relapse occured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISATION AND BLINDING: In the randomised pilot trial, ECT responders were randomised&#xD;
      after baseline data collection. Patients and raters were blind to treatment allocation. The&#xD;
      anaesthetist administering ketamine/midazolam infusions will not be blinded but will not be&#xD;
      involved in assessments or data analysis. Computerised random allocation, using randomly&#xD;
      permuted blocks, will be done independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Patients ≥18 years with unipolar major depressive disorder (DSM-IV), a&#xD;
      24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24) score of ≥21, and referred for ECT&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in the open Phase 1. Patients will have a physical&#xD;
      examination, routine haematology and biochemistry investigations, and an ECG to screen for&#xD;
      any medical conditions that might affect ability to be treated with ECT or ketamine. For the&#xD;
      randomised Phase 2, patients must have (i) received a substantial course of ECT in Phase 1&#xD;
      (i.e. at least five sessions), (ii) achieved at least response criteria (i.e. ≥60% decrease&#xD;
      from baseline HRSD-24 score and score ≤16 on two consecutive weekly ratings), (iii) have a&#xD;
      nominated adult who can stay with them for 24-hours on out-patient treatment days, (iv) have&#xD;
      a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of ≥24, and (v) be able to provide informed&#xD;
      consent. Patients will continue on regular psychotropic and other medications as prescribed&#xD;
      by their consultant psychiatrist. This reflects the conditions under which adjunctive&#xD;
      ketamine would be used in routine clinical practice, thereby enhancing the generalisability&#xD;
      and external validity of a future definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are: any condition rendering patients medically unfit for general&#xD;
      anaesthesia, ECT or ketamine; active suicidal intention; dementia; lifetime history of&#xD;
      bipolar disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, or other Axis 1 diagnosis; ECT in the&#xD;
      previous six-months; alcohol/substance abuse in previous six-months; pregnancy;&#xD;
      inability/refusal to consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given verbal and full written information and be asked to provide written&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS: Please see description&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES Process outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus of a pilot trial's outcomes is on trial process with assessment of the primary&#xD;
      clinical outcome being secondary because the pilot itself is not designed to measure&#xD;
      efficacy. Process outcomes that will inform a future definitive ketamine relapse prevention&#xD;
      trial include information on the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  recruitment methods and rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  willingness of participants to be randomised&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  willingness of participants to complete assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  success of blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ability to administer a course of ketamine infusions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical safety and acceptability of ketamine infusions in an ECT responder population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rates of adverse dissociative and psychiatric events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adherence to allocated treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adherence to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reasons for drop-out from treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reasons for drop-out from follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the ketamine and midazolam groups&#xD;
           in six-month relapse rates to help with power calculations for a future definitive trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be used to obtain baseline, intra-treatment, end-of-treatment and&#xD;
      follow-up data. Most are standard measures used by ourselves and others in depression, ECT or&#xD;
      ketamine studies. Raters will be trained on all measures before recruitment begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Diagnosis and treatment history: Diagnosis of major depressive disorder will be confirmed&#xD;
      using the mood episodes module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I&#xD;
      Disorders (SCID). The Columbia Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF) will be used to&#xD;
      obtain index episode treatment details and provide measures of treatment-resistance.&#xD;
      Handedness will be recorded with the Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire. The National Adult&#xD;
      Reading Test (NART) will measure premorbid ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional baseline data from patient interview and case-note review will include age, sex,&#xD;
      weight, height, occupation, educational attainment, duration of index depressive episode,&#xD;
      number of previous depressive episodes, previous ECT, history of medical illness and surgical&#xD;
      treatments, personal and family history of alcohol/substance dependency, presence of&#xD;
      psychotic symptoms (detected by SCID), and current medications and other therapies. Changes&#xD;
      in medications during Phases 1 and 2 will be documented at follow-up interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Depression outcomes: The baseline clinical measure is absence of depression on the&#xD;
      Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. To enter Phase 1 patients must score ≥21. Response to&#xD;
      ECT is defined as achieving ≥60% decrease from baseline HRSD-24 and score ≤16 on two&#xD;
      consecutive weekly ratings. Remission criteria are ≥60% decrease in HRSD from baseline and&#xD;
      score ≤10 on two consecutive weekly ratings. Patients must achieve at least response to&#xD;
      participate in the Phase 2 pilot trial and be described here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary clinical outcome measure is the relapse rate at six months as measured using the&#xD;
      objectively-rated 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24). Criteria for&#xD;
      relapse are ≥10 point increase in HRSD-24 compared to baseline Phase 2 score plus HRSD ≥16;&#xD;
      in addition, increase in the HRSD should be maintained one week later (if indicated,&#xD;
      additional follow-ups will be arranged). Hospital admission, further ECT, and deliberate&#xD;
      self-harm/suicide also constitute relapse. Timing of these events will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and weekly intra-treatment course HRSD-24 scores will be obtained during the&#xD;
      treatment periods of Phases 1 and 2. During the infusion sessions in Phase 2 HRSD-24 scores&#xD;
      will be obtained 60 minutes before the infusion begins and at +120 and +240 minutes&#xD;
      afterwards. Baseline scores on sleep and appetite items will be maintained for repeated&#xD;
      measures within one day. The +240 HRSD-24 scores will serve as the weekly post-ECT scores up&#xD;
      to follow-up-week 4. Depression measures will be repeated at weeks 6, 8, 12, 20 and 26 during&#xD;
      the six-month follow-up. Subjective mood ratings will be measured at the above timepoints&#xD;
      using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, self-report version (QIDS-SR16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Cognitive outcomes: Cognitive testing can be challenging for severely depressed&#xD;
      patients. It is vital that patients be encouraged to remain in the trial throughout the whole&#xD;
      study period and a great deal of tact is required of raters. Priority will be given to&#xD;
      obtaining scores on the HRSD-24. In a recent meta-analysis we identified that ECT has the&#xD;
      most pronounced subacute (i.e. 0-3 days post course) adverse effects upon verbal memory&#xD;
      (delayed word list recall) and frontal executive function. Subanaesthetic doses of ketamine&#xD;
      can cause problems with orientation, concentration, working and episodic memory but these&#xD;
      resolve within two hours of beginning an infusion. There are no published data on effects of&#xD;
      ketamine on cognition in ECT responders. We will use the following battery in Phase 1 (pre&#xD;
      and post ECT course; the latter will serve as baseline for Phase 2) and Phase 2 (one day&#xD;
      after the first and fourth infusions and at six-months). Parallel versions will be used to&#xD;
      reduce practice effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Global cognition will be assessed with the revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination&#xD;
           (ACE-R; three parallel versions) which also generates Mini-Mental State Examination&#xD;
           (MMSE) and verbal fluency scores. The ACE-R provides a total score (maximum=100) plus&#xD;
           subscale scores for different aspects of cognition and has been used to study cognition&#xD;
           in depression and by ourselves during ECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Forward and Backward Digit Spans - immediate short-term memory, attention and working&#xD;
           memory&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Trail Making Test (Part A) - motor and psychomotor speed&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Frontal-executive function will be rated by Trail Making Test (Part B) plus letter and&#xD;
           category verbal fluencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Anterograde verbal memory will be tested using the Free and Cued Selective Reminding&#xD;
           Test variant (immediate and delayed recall) of the Buschke Selective Reminding Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To measure retrograde amnesia for autobiographical information we will use the Kopelman&#xD;
           Autobiographical Memory Interview (K-AMI), The K-AMI will be administered pre and post&#xD;
           ECT, after the fourth ketamine infusion, and at six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iv) Ketamine psychotomimetic effects and adverse events: Acute psychotomimetic effects of&#xD;
      ketamine are usually short-lived and restricted to the infusion period, resolving within one&#xD;
      hour. They include dissociative and psychiatric symptoms. In line with previous ketamine&#xD;
      trials we will measure dissociative effects with the Clinician-Administered Dissociative&#xD;
      States Scale (CADSS), psychotomimetic effects with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS;&#xD;
      four-item positive symptom subscale), and mood elevation with the Young Mania Rating Scale&#xD;
      (YMRS; mood item). These effects will be measured before, during (+35-40 mins) and after&#xD;
      (+240 mins) the ketamine infusions. The Patient-Rated Inventory of Side Effects will be used&#xD;
      to document other general adverse events by patients at the same time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse medical, psychotomimetic and general events will be reported to the Trial&#xD;
      Steering and Data Monitoring Committees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS A formal sample size calculation is not appropriate for this pilot trial.&#xD;
      Pilot trial data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis for all patients who&#xD;
      completed at least one infusion. Data analyses will be performed blinded to allocation.&#xD;

          <description>The score obtained at Pre-ECT baseline for participants who were ultimately randomised ie depression severity at the start of the Monitoring Phase. The scale is the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression which measures presence and severity of depression symptoms. The scale range is from 0-77 with higher scores indicating worse depression, and a standard cutoff of 10 for diagnosing presence of depression. To enter the monitoring phase patients must score ≥21 ie experience at least a moderately severe episode of depression. This is a total score, no subscale scores are reported.</description>

        <description>Clinical outcomes are secondary in this pilot trial. The 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24) will be used to assess for the main clinical outcome, the relapse rate over six months. Criteria for relapse are ≥10 point increase in HRSD-24 compared to baseline Phase 2 score plus HRSD ≥16; in addition, increase in the HRSD should be maintained one week later (if indicated, additional follow-ups will be arranged). Hospital admission, further ECT, and deliberate self-harm/suicide also constitute relapse.</description>

A course of up to four once-weekly infusions will be administered. Infusions will be discontinued by the Anaesthetist if there are persisting haemodynamic changes (i.e. heart rate &gt;110/minute or systolic/diastolic blood pressure (BP) &gt;180/100 or &gt;20% increase above pre-infusion BP for more than 15 minutes) that do not respond to beta-blocker therapy.&#xD;

          <title>Depression Relapse Rate</title>
          <description>Clinical outcomes are secondary in this pilot trial. The 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24) will be used to assess for the main clinical outcome, the relapse rate over six months. Criteria for relapse are ≥10 point increase in HRSD-24 compared to baseline Phase 2 score plus HRSD ≥16; in addition, increase in the HRSD should be maintained one week later (if indicated, additional follow-ups will be arranged). Hospital admission, further ECT, and deliberate self-harm/suicide also constitute relapse.</description>
          <population>All participants entered a 6-month follow up phase following randomised treatment. One participant in the ketamine arm dropped out of follow up at 12 weeks.</population>
