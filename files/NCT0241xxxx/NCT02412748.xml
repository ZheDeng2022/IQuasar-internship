  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of children living apart from their fathers has grown nationally, and the greatest&#xD;
      percentage is evident among African American (AA) families; two-thirds of all African&#xD;
      American children live in households without their biological father. Research supports the&#xD;
      importance of positive fathering in the lives of children. But in order for children to&#xD;
      benefit from their fathers' involvement, the father-child relationship must be timely and&#xD;
      sustained. This study will test culturally relevant interventions aimed at increasing&#xD;
      non-resident (not living with the child) AA fathers' involvement with their children.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this competing continuation study is to test the efficacy of the core&#xD;
      9-session BBTF program (held over12-weeks) on: (1) improving father outcomes (psychological&#xD;
      well-being, relationship quality with the child's mother, parenting competence); (2)&#xD;
      father-mother relationship quality; (3) father involvement (material support, in-kind&#xD;
      support, direct father-child interaction); and (4) child outcomes (behavioral, social,&#xD;
      emotional). The study will use an experimental design and randomly assign 180 AA fathers who&#xD;
      are not currently involved with the criminal justice system and their 2-5 year old children&#xD;
      to the BBTF or an attention control condition and assess outcomes at baseline, 12 weeks, and&#xD;
      24 weeks. Custodial mothers of the children will be recruited to concurrently complete child&#xD;
      outcome measures, measures of father-mother relationship quality, and father involvement&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims and hypotheses are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Test the direct effects of the 9-session BBTF program on: (1) father's outcomes&#xD;
      (psychological well-being, parenting competence, and communication and problem solving) and&#xD;
      (2) paternal involvement (material support, in-kind support, and direct father-child&#xD;
      interaction), controlling for father characteristics (demographics, history of criminal&#xD;
      justice system involvement, social support) and child characteristics (age, gender).&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: BBTF program fathers will report better father outcomes and greater paternal&#xD;
      involvement than the attention control group at 12 weeks and 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Test the mediating effects of father-mother relationship and father outcomes on&#xD;
      paternal involvement across the two conditions. Hypothesis 2: Father-mother relationship&#xD;
      quality and father outcomes will mediate intervention effects on paternal involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Compare the effects of the BBTF program, controlling for father outcomes,&#xD;
      father-mother relationship, and paternal involvement on child outcomes (behavioral,&#xD;
      emotional/social development) as compared to the attention control group. Hypothesis 3a: BBTF&#xD;
      children will have improved child outcomes relative to the control group at 12 weeks and 24&#xD;
      weeks. Hypothesis 3b: Child outcomes will be mediated by improvements in father outcomes,&#xD;
      paternal involvement and father-mother relationship.&#xD;

    <description>The Financial Literacy Program (FLP) attention control condition will not receive any information on fatherhood. They will participate in a nine-session financial education program, called &quot;Money Smart,&quot; which has modules that will be facilitated by a group leader that focus on banking, borrowing, checking accounts, money management, saving, establishing and repairing a credit history, using credit cards responsibly and learning about borrowing and home ownership. They will also receive a booster session 6 weeks after the final session that focuses on setting financial goals.</description>

    <description>The Building Bridges to Fatherhood (BBTF) intervention employs the following key features: a collaborative model for working with parents; vignettes of father-child models engaged in situations typical of non-resident fathers with young children for stimulating discussion and problem-solving; group discussion format, which allows fathers to support one another and share ideas on using program principles to fit within the contexts of fatherhood; &quot;homework assignments&quot; that help fathers practice the new skills at home; weekly handouts summarizing the major points discussed each week, which can be shared with others and used to gain greater support from extended family; and a Leader's Manual that standardizes the program across groups and group leaders.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AA biological father of a child 2 to 5 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child lives with father no more than 48 hours per week (e.g., spends the weekends with&#xD;
             his or her father)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child lives with the biological mother (or other custodial relative such as&#xD;
             grandmother) in the metropolitan Chicago area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  These fathers are referred to as AA non-resident fathers. Additional criteria include:&#xD;
             (1) child's mother is willing to consent to complete the child assessments; - Child's&#xD;
             mother is amenable to facilitating opportunities for fathers to interact with their&#xD;
             children in order to practice skills learned in the program&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Father is able and willing to travel to one of two intervention sites to attend a&#xD;
             weekly program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study is limited to fathers with a target child aged 2-5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The rationale for this limit is based on the developmental phase when families are&#xD;
             most vulnerable to decreased father involvement and children are highly dependent on&#xD;
             parenting for their growth and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fathers with histories of child abuse, neglect, or violence perpetuated against the&#xD;
             child or the child's mother (based on mother or father report).&#xD;
