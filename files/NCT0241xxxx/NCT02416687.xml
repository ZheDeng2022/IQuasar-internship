      The etonogestrel (ENG) implant inserted immediately postpartum reduces the risk of pregnancy&#xD;
      recurrence, especially in vulnerable populations. A limitation to recommending this practice&#xD;
      universally is the low quality of evidence on the effect of the ENG implant on breastfeeding&#xD;
      when inserted immediately postpartum. This study is the first assessing the impact of&#xD;
      inserting the ENG implant immediately postpartum on the amount of milk using the gold&#xD;
      standard method for this purpose.&#xD;

      What is known already: The ENG implant inserted immediately postpartum reduces the risk of&#xD;
      pregnancy recurrence, especially in vulnerable populations. A limitation to recommending this&#xD;
      practice universally is the low quality of evidence on the effect of the ENG implant on&#xD;
      breastfeeding when inserted immediately postpartum. This study is the first assessing the&#xD;
      impact of inserting the ENG implant immediately postpartum on the amount of milk using the&#xD;
      gold standard method for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design, size, duration: This randomized, single-blind and controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      evaluated 24 postpartum women and their NBs and was conducted at the Women's Health Reference&#xD;
      Center of Ribeirão Preto, Brazil. The mother-NB pairs were evaluated for six weeks&#xD;
      postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants/materials, setting, methods: Twenty-four mother-NB pairs were randomized into&#xD;
      two groups: a) Implant group: ENG-releasing implant inserted within 48 h after delivery and&#xD;
      b) Control group: absence of contraceptive method for six weeks after delivery.&#xD;
      Anthropometric assessments and breastfeeding questionnaires were conducted at 4-time points&#xD;
      of the 6-week monitoring period (at study admission and on the 14th, 29th and 43rd days after&#xD;
      randomization). Saliva samples were collected from the mother-NB pairs prior to deuterium&#xD;
      (D2O) dose administration. Totals of 5 g and 10 g D2O were orally administered to the&#xD;
      postpartum women on the day of randomization (day 0) and the 29th study day, respectively.&#xD;
      New saliva samples were collected on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 13 and 14 following intake of each D2O&#xD;
      dose. The D2O isotope ratio was assessed in saliva samples using mass spectrometry to&#xD;
      estimate the volume of breast milk ingested by the NB (daily average expressed as mL/day).&#xD;
