      The overall purpose of this study is to test the individual and combined effect of&#xD;
      transdermal testosterone and/or Vitamin D in reducing fall risk and improve function in&#xD;
      pre-frail hypogonadal senior men.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the challenges of demographic change is the enormous personal and economic burden of&#xD;
      falls and their consequences in the senior population. Thirty percent of adults 65 years or&#xD;
      older and 40 - 50% of those age 80 years or older fall once per year. Serious injuries occur&#xD;
      in 10 - 15% of falls, resulting in fractures in 5% and a hip fracture in 1-2% of cases. As an&#xD;
      independent determinant of functional decline, falls lead to 40% of all nursing home&#xD;
      admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have estimated the prevalence of low testosterone levels (hypogonadism) in&#xD;
      older men to be about 20% at age 60. This proportion increased in the Baltimore Longitudinal&#xD;
      Study of Aging with each decade (30% at age 70 and 50% at age 80). Low testosterone levels&#xD;
      are associated with decreased strength, impaired physical performance, and an increased risk&#xD;
      of falls, and, thus, low testosterone may contribute to the frailty syndrome in older men.&#xD;
      Current studies have focused on healthy, community dwelling men with a high level of&#xD;
      function. Our trial aims to enrol pre-frail senior men at risk of losing their autonomy.&#xD;
      Further, in this population and also relevant for muscle health and falling is the high&#xD;
      prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators chose 75 mg testosterone/day as the minimally sufficient dose to shift over&#xD;
      90% of participants to total testosterone levels of at least 16.86 nmol/l (lower end of the&#xD;
      third quartile in the pilot trial where fall reduction was significant -- Bischoff-Ferrari et&#xD;
      al.; Osteoporosis International 2008). Additionally, this dose has been chosen for its&#xD;
      cardiovascular safety as summarized in a 2013 review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators chose 24000 IU/month of vitamin D (equivalent to 800 IU vitamin D per day)&#xD;
      as the current recommended dose for vitamin D and its evidence for fall reduction. To allow&#xD;
      for the standard of care and given that 50% of participants will not be randomized to vitamin&#xD;
      D supplementation - all participants are allowed to take 800 IU vitamin D per day in addition&#xD;
      to the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized at the baseline clinical visit using a computer-based&#xD;
      randomization procedure. Willing and eligible participants will be randomized to one of the&#xD;
      four treatment groups stratified by age (2 groups: 75 - 79 and 80+). Within each stratum,&#xD;
      treatment assignments will be generated in blocks of 8 individuals, with 2 individuals in&#xD;
      each of the 4 treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medications will be labelled with a unique randomization code at the respective&#xD;
      companies. The codes will be inaccessible until the data set is frozen and the study is&#xD;
      unblinded. All study packages will look identical, except for the randomization codes on the&#xD;
      labels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up is 12 months with 3 clinical (Baseline, 6 and 12 months) and 4 (2, 4, 8 and 10&#xD;
      months) phone call visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of 168 senior participants was chosen to have sufficient power for the&#xD;
      primary endpoint (odds of falling) and the effect of testosterone treatment. Under these&#xD;
      assumptions and assuming an additive effect of the 2 interventions (testosterone and vitamin&#xD;
      D), as expected from the investigators pilot study, they have 89% power for the primary&#xD;
      endpoint &quot;number of participants sustaining at least 1 fall&quot;. This computation assumes that&#xD;
      the difference in proportions of fallers is -0.24 (specifically, 0.38 versus 0.62 - based on&#xD;
      the investigators pilot study). If 17% of participants would contribute no data (total n =&#xD;
      140), the investigators would still have 82% power to detect this difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rate of falls: under the same assumptions, and with the proposed sample size of 84 and 84 for&#xD;
      the two groups, the study will have power of at least 90.6% to yield a statistically&#xD;
      significant result for the rate of falls. This computation assumes that the mean difference&#xD;
      in rate of falls is -1.0 (corresponding to means of 0.9 versus 1.9) and the common&#xD;
      within-group standard deviation is 2.0 (based on standard deviation estimates of 2.2 and&#xD;
      1.7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis will be conducted according to the intention to treat (ITT) principle. Every&#xD;
      study participant who was randomized and received the study treatment package at baseline&#xD;
      clinical visit will be a part of the primary analysis population. In addition to the primary&#xD;
      ITT analyses, the same data will be analyzed in participants who demonstrated acceptable&#xD;
      adherence to the study protocol. The per protocol analyses will be treated as sensitivity&#xD;
      analyses. The per protocol analysis population will include the participants who: Attended at&#xD;
      least 1 out of the 2 follow-up clinical visits; Participated in at least 2 of the 4 follow-up&#xD;
      phone calls; Took at least 80% of the study medication(s) as confirmed by count of used&#xD;
      bottles for drinking solution and count and weight of used transdermal gel containers; did&#xD;
      not take additional vitamin D and calcium supplements in doses exceeding those stipulated by&#xD;
      the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All assessments of treatment effects in the efficacy analyses will be based on the&#xD;
      intent-to-treat principle. All endpoint variables will be summarized by treatment group. N,&#xD;
      Mean, Standard Deviation, Minimum and Maximum will summarize continuous endpoint variables&#xD;
      and Number and Percentage will summarize categorical endpoint variables. All endpoints will&#xD;
      be tested at the 2-sided at 5% significance level (α = 0.05, 2-sided). Two types of models&#xD;
      will be run for each analysis. Minimally adjusted models will include age, body mass index,&#xD;
      and baseline serum levels of total testosterone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D; fully adjusted&#xD;
      models in addition to the parameters included in the minimally adjusted models will also&#xD;
      include number of comorbidities, cognitive function, and additional potential confounders if&#xD;
      baseline analysis justifies their inclusion. Each of the models will initially check for&#xD;
      possible interaction between the study treatments. If no such interaction in found, the&#xD;
      interaction term will be dropped and the simplified models will be used to estimate separate&#xD;
      effects of the study treatments.&#xD;
