      Background The most common cause to pituitary insufficiency is the pituitary adenoma (PA). PA&#xD;
      may be divided into hormone producing PAs and non-functioning PAs (NFPA). Normal pituitary&#xD;
      tissue, as well as tissues from PAs, expresses somatostatin receptors (sst). Five subtypes of&#xD;
      sst receptors has been characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) presents anatomy, while in vivo diagnostics with&#xD;
      somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) or position emission tomography (PET) reflect the&#xD;
      functional properties of the tissue. The SRS have earlier been evaluated for diagnostics of&#xD;
      pituitary diseases and has low discriminative ability to differ tumor tissue from normal&#xD;
      pituitary tissue even though some secretory tumors and NFPA are seen. The superiority of the&#xD;
      PET in diagnostics compared to the SRS is based on higher spatial resolution and a higher&#xD;
      tumor to background ratio. Therefore it is of large interest to study Gallium 68 DOTATOC&#xD;
      (Ga-PET) i small tumours that exhibit sst, such as in the pituitary, where high resolution is&#xD;
      essential to discriminate from normal tissue and to evaluated residual tumor tissue&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim with the project&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate Ga-PET in the management of pituitary tumors and to seek the answer to the&#xD;
      following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is the method of value in primary diagnostics in PAs? Does Ga-PET contribute with more&#xD;
           functional information than that given from an conventional MRI?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is the method of value in the follow-up, the detection of residual tumor tissue, and&#xD;
           increase the possibility to differ scar tissue from true tumor?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Can relapses of PA be detected earlier with Ga-PET than with conventional MRI?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Are some of the sub-groups easier to detect that others??&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Can the pathological-anatomical findings and the immunochemical expression of sst be&#xD;
           correlated to the PET findings?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Can the treatment with somatostatin analogues be designed from the PET investigation and&#xD;
           the sst analysis?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method The aim is to recruit 10 patients with acromegaly (GH-producing PA), 10 patients with&#xD;
      Cushing's disease (ACTH-producing PA), 5 patients with TSH-producing PA (TSHoma) and 20&#xD;
      patients with NFPA and to do Ga-PET before and after the pituitary surgery. In the Cushing&#xD;
      patients, the TSHomas and in NFPA Ga-PET will also be dome after 3 years postoperatively to&#xD;
      detect recurrences. At surgery, pituitary tissue is taken to investigate hormonal expression,&#xD;
      sst and for further molecular genetic studies. At all PET occasions blood specimens from the&#xD;
      patients are collected for future analyses. They will be kept in a freezer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If difficulties to separate the Ga-Pet up-take in tumors from normal pituitary tissue the&#xD;
      tumor expression may be enhanced by a somatostatin injection before Ga-PET that suppresses&#xD;
      normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pituitary PET of pituitary tumours patients will be compared with the pituitary of&#xD;
      patients with thyroid associated tumours performing PET according to the similar protocol in&#xD;
      Another study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance This study is a pilot study. Ga-PET has not been used in pituitary tumors but&#xD;
      there is known from studies in patients with gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors that the&#xD;
      pituitary is seen on GA-PET. This is a &quot;proof of concept&quot;. It addresses some of the clinical&#xD;
      problems in the management of pituitary tumors. If the questions addressed in this study will&#xD;
      be answered in advantage for PET, PET may be a routine investigation and the patients may&#xD;
      avoid invasive procedures and repeated MRI. In addition, the patients may have better&#xD;
      information regarding cure or not. If not, the treatment may be tailored from the sst&#xD;
      receptor expression. This is of great importance for the patients and for the health care&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
