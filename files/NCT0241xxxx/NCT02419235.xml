  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Refractory hypertension is defined as failure to reach goal blood pressure control in&#xD;
      patients who are adherent to full doses of the appropriate drug regime. Hypertension results&#xD;
      in 7.6 million deaths annually and 92 million disability adjusted years worldwide, making it&#xD;
      the number one attributable risk for death throughout the world. Conventional treatment&#xD;
      involves lifestyle modification and antihypertensive drug therapy; however blood pressure can&#xD;
      remain uncontrolled despite these treatment options. Previous studies have demonstrated a&#xD;
      reduction in blood pressure in adults with essential hypertension with the use of various&#xD;
      homoeopathic complexes. There has been no research done to date on the effect of the&#xD;
      homoeopathic combination of Amylenum nitrosum 6cH, Crataegus oxyacantha 6cH, Natrum&#xD;
      muriaticum 6cH and Scutellaria lateriflora 6cH in adults with refractory hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of a homoeopathic complex Amylenum nitrosum&#xD;
      6cH, Crataegus oxyacantha 6cH, Natrum muriaticum 6cH and Scutellaria lateriflora 6cH on blood&#xD;
      pressure in adults with refractory hypertension, by means of blood pressure readings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a six week, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study. Thirty participants,&#xD;
      aged 35 to 60 years, who have been previously diagnosed by their healthcare provider with&#xD;
      refractory hypertension, will be recruited by means of purposive sampling. Adverts will be&#xD;
      placed at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) Doornfontein campus and the Soweto satellite&#xD;
      clinic Nanga Vutshilo Community Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants that respond to the advert will attend an initial consultation and&#xD;
      will be requested to sign a Participant Information and Consent Form once they agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study. The medical history and physical examination (including vital&#xD;
      signs, fundoscopic exam, cardiovascular exam, respiratory exam and urinalysis) will be&#xD;
      recorded on a Case Form. Blood pressure (BP) readings will be taken on each arm with a manual&#xD;
      BP cuff, according to standard operating procedures, on the first three consecutive days to&#xD;
      confirm inclusion into the study. Individuals with secondary organ damage from hypertension&#xD;
      will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those participants that qualify for the study will be placed into two groups. One group will&#xD;
      receive a 50ml bottle of the homoeopathic complex and the other group a 50ml bottle of&#xD;
      placebo. Participants will receive an Intake Diary, to be completed daily, recording&#xD;
      compliance and any adverse symptoms or aggravations that may be experienced. Follow-up&#xD;
      consultations will take place every 7 days and participants will be requested to bring with&#xD;
      their medication bottles for further assessment of compliance; BP readings will be recorded&#xD;
      on a data collection form. All participants will be given the Dietary Approaches to Stop&#xD;
      Hypertension (DASH) eating plan at the end of the study to help control their hypertension.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will be given an information leaflet to give to their healthcare&#xD;
      provider, detailing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed using the non-parametric methods: inter-group analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted using SPSS v18 with the Mann-Whitney U-test; intra-group analysis will be done&#xD;
      using the Friedman and the Wilcoxon-Signed Ranks tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A possible outcome of this study is that the homoeopathic complex will have a normalizing&#xD;
      effect on BP readings compared to placebo. Regardless of the outcome, this study will&#xD;
      contribute to our knowledge on the use of homoeopathic complex remedies in the treatment and&#xD;
      management of refractory hypertension.&#xD;
