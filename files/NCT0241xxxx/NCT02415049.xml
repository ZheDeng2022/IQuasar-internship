      There are several choices to consider when determining the timing of initiation of enteral&#xD;
      feeds following a pyloromyotomy. Some practice patterns have initiated feedings as soon as&#xD;
      the infant awakens from anesthesia. Some authors have suggested a period of withholding&#xD;
      feedings for several hours postoperatively, while others have recommended a significantly&#xD;
      longer period of starvation (18 hours) before initiating feedings. The ongoing debate arises&#xD;
      over whether a physician chooses a standardized, incremental feeding regimen versus an ad&#xD;
      libitum feeding schedule which allows the infant to decide when and how much to eat. Neither&#xD;
      has been studied effectively in a randomized controlled setting. A recent review of the&#xD;
      literature would suggest that a period of 4 hours of NPO, followed by ad lib feedings may be&#xD;
      the best postoperative regimen. This however, has not been studied in a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;

      SUMMARY AND SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is a condition well known to pediatric surgeons, and&#xD;
      has been deemed &quot;the most common cause for surgery in the first 6 months of life&quot;. This&#xD;
      condition affects a large group of children annually with an incidence of 1.8 per 1000&#xD;
      births. Postoperative length of hospital stay is a financial concern and remains a potential&#xD;
      target for reduction in hospital costs. Ultimately, these costs are directly affected by the&#xD;
      ability to effectively advance postoperative enteral nutrition. Some experts calculated this&#xD;
      savings to be $392.00 per patient while others estimate an impressive $1,290 saved per&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several choices to consider when determining the timing of initiation of enteral&#xD;
      feeds following a pyloromyotomy. Some practice patterns have initiated feedings as soon as&#xD;
      the infant awakens from anesthesia. Some authors have suggested a period of withholding&#xD;
      feedings for several hours postoperatively, while others have recommended a significantly&#xD;
      longer period of starvation (18 hours) before initiating feedings. The ongoing debate arises&#xD;
      over whether a physician chooses a standardized, incremental feeding regimen versus an ad&#xD;
      libitum feeding schedule which allows the infant to decide when and how much to eat. Neither&#xD;
      has been studied effectively in a randomized controlled setting. A recent review of the&#xD;
      literature would suggest that a period of 4 hours of NPO, followed by ad lib feedings may be&#xD;
      the best postoperative regimen. This however, has not been studied in a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore hypothesize that 1) infants provided with an ad lib diet&#xD;
      following pyloromotomy will progress more rapidly to full volume feeds than infants provided&#xD;
      an incremental advancement in diet, and 2) Preoperative blood chemistry abnormalities will&#xD;
      predict increased emesis postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the specific aims of this study are to determine whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Infants who are provided ad lib feeds following pyloromyotomy will progress more quickly&#xD;
           to goal feeds (100ml/kg/day) and be able to be discharged more rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preoperative abnormalities in potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate will predict&#xD;
           increased postoperative emesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. RESESRCH DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      B1. Experimental Design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. Hypothesis: Infants who are provided ad lib feeds following pyloromyotomy&#xD;
      will progress more quickly to goal feeds (100ml/kg/day) and be able to be discharged more&#xD;
      rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: If infants are able to reach goal feeds more quickly without experiencing&#xD;
      significant emesis, then they may be able to be discharged more quickly, thereby decreasing&#xD;
      hospital costs associated with longer hospital stays&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will be examined and assessed for a diagnosis of pyloric stenosis. Infants will be&#xD;
      diagnosed based on standard of care measures (clinical, ultrasound or UGI findings) and will&#xD;
      have preoperative blood chemistries drawn as per standard of care. At the time surgical&#xD;
      consent is obtained, the attending or fellow physician will educate the parents about the&#xD;
      study and obtain consent if they wish to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unit of randomization will be the child. Randomization will be done using numbered,&#xD;
      sealed, security envelopes available to investigators in the pediatric surgery office. Half&#xD;
      of envelopes will assign the child to the &quot;Standard/Incremental&quot; feeding regimen, and the&#xD;
      other half will assign the child to the &quot;Ad-lib&quot; regimen. The envelopes will be arranged in a&#xD;
      box in random order. The investigator will select and open the envelope sequentially after&#xD;
      each enrollment and informed consent of parents of the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Incremental&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. NPO for 4 hours following surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Initiate Pedialyte at 15ml PO Q2 hours x 2 feeds&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Then switch to formula or breastmilk 30ml PO Q2 hours x 2 feeds&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Then increase to&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 45ml PO Q3 hours x 2 feeds, or&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. to goal (100ml/kg/day) if goal volume is less than 45 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Then advance to goal feeds (100ml/kg/day) PO Q3 hours for 2 feeds&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. &quot;Time to goal feeds&quot; will be recorded when the infant has tolerated two consecutive goal&#xD;
           feeds without vomiting and is getting ready to have a third feed&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Infants will remain on IV fluids until tolerating goal feeds so as to maintain glycemic&#xD;
           control and hydration&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If vomiting ensues at any stage, repeat same volume of feeding until tolerates 2&#xD;
                total feedings at that volume and then advance&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If infant vomits three of the same volume feeds in a row, skip the next feed and&#xD;
                restart at same volume thereafter. If vomiting still persists, hold the next two&#xD;
                feeds and then restart feeds at same volume thereafter&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Reglan may not be used during the first 72 hours postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ad-lib&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. NPO for 4 hours following surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ad-lib formula or breastfeeds until tolerating goal feeds (100ml/kg/day) x 2 total&#xD;
           feeds. Feedings will be limited to 12.5ml/kg per feed so as to avoid overdistention of&#xD;
           the stomach&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. &quot;Time to goal feeds&quot; will be recorded when the infant has tolerated two consecutive goal&#xD;
           feeds without vomiting and is getting ready to have a third feed&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Infants will remain on IV fluids until tolerating goal feeds so as to maintain glycemic&#xD;
           control and hydration&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If infant vomits three feeds in a row, skip the next feed and restart ad lib feeds&#xD;
                thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Reglan may not be used during the first 72 hours postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will need to tolerate two goal feeds without vomiting prior to being discharged.&#xD;
      After tolerating two feeds, infants will need to stay in the hospital until it is time for&#xD;
      the third feed. The initiation of the third feed will be noted as the &quot;time to goal feeds.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional variables to be recorded include age, sex, birth weight, gestational age at birth,&#xD;
      preoperative weight, preoperative days of vomiting, preoperative resuscitation volume,&#xD;
      dimensions of pylorus on ultrasound/UGI, preoperative blood chemistries, laparoscopic or open&#xD;
      procedure, and parental satisfaction of the feeding regimen. Additionally, a phone call will&#xD;
      be made within 7-14 days following discharge to assess the infants clinical status as well as&#xD;
      continued parental satisfaction. Parents of infants who do not consent for randomization will&#xD;
      be asked to allow for perioperative data collection only so that we can get a baseline of our&#xD;
      entire pyloric stenosis population. The infants whose data will be collected but who are not&#xD;
      randomized will not have their data included in the randomization analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. Hypothesis:. Preoperative abnormalities in potassium, chloride, and&#xD;
      bicarbonate will predict increased postoperative emesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: A single previous study has suggested that the degree of preoperative dehydration,&#xD;
      particularly associated with blood chemistry abnormalities in potassium, chloride, and&#xD;
      bicarbonate, may predict which infants will have more vomiting postoperatively. If able to be&#xD;
      identified, these infants may benefit from a tailored feeding regiment postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol: Post hoc analysis will be undertaken to confirm if preoperative blood&#xD;
      chemistry abnormalities predict postoperative emesis. Also, we will be able to determine if&#xD;
      an incremental or adlib feeding regiment is best suited for this population of infants as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
