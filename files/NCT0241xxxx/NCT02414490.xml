  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study of 30 adult CIDP patients who receive home IVIg&#xD;
      infusion services from AxelaCare Health Solutions, LLC. The decision to treat with IVIg will&#xD;
      be entirely at the discretion of the patient's treating physician.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be recruited by individual site investigators. Prior to enrollment each&#xD;
      potential subject will have their screening data reviewed by a panel of medical experts for&#xD;
      confirmation of inclusion criteria. Each reviewer will be an independent, board-certified,&#xD;
      practicing and experienced neurologist with a special interest in CIDP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects who have provided informed consent will be instructed to perform and&#xD;
      document daily Jamar hand-held Dynamometer grip strength measurements in a paper diary for a&#xD;
      6 month time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly nursing visits will capture disability assessments, physical tests, adverse event and&#xD;
      concomitant medications assessment, and other clinical changes that may affect grip strength&#xD;
      measurements. Nurses will review each subjects captured grip data from paper diary on an iPad&#xD;
      during weekly home assessments. Nurses will also administer the HRQOL Short-Form (SF) 36&#xD;
      questionnaire at the baseline, week 12 and week 24 study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels will be captured by the home study nurse at three time&#xD;
      points surrounding IVIg infusions and will be classified as either trough, peak, or mid. Each&#xD;
      subject will have serum Ig collected by blood draw for the first 4 IVIg treatment cycles, for&#xD;
      a total of 12 blood draws per subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;trough&quot; serum IgG level will be collected immediately prior to Ig infusion. The &quot;peak&quot;&#xD;
      serum IgG level will be collected 5 minutes post-Ig infusion. The &quot;mid&quot; serum IgG level will&#xD;
      be collected two weeks post-Ig infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no known biomarkers that can assist with CIDP diagnosis, prognosis, or&#xD;
      treatment optimization. As part of this study, subjects will be required to have additional&#xD;
      blood taken and stored for future use. Future use may include the possible discovery of&#xD;
      specific biomarkers predicting the response to IVIg or other therapies, optimization of IVIg&#xD;
      dosage based on pharmacodynamics, pathogenesis of CIDP, and more effective CIDP diagnostic&#xD;
      markers. Blood taken for future use will be obtained with each serum IgG sample. No&#xD;
      additional blood draws will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should IVIg therapy be discontinued during the study, daily grip strength measurements will&#xD;
      continue to be performed and recorded in the subject diary for up to 30 days or to the end of&#xD;
      the study, whichever comes first. Weekly nurse visits with collection of the disability&#xD;
      assessments and serum IgG blood draws will continue for up to 4 home nurse visits or until&#xD;
      the end of the study, whichever comes first.&#xD;
