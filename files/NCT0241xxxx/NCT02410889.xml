  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to develop the method of combined recording of&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to&#xD;
      improve understanding of the relationship between electrical (EEG) and blood flow (fMRI)&#xD;
      responses to epileptic discharges as a necessary step towards clinical use. One factor that&#xD;
      currently limits the use of EEG-fMRI in patients with epilepsy is that a relatively large&#xD;
      proportion of patients do not show any fMRI response despite epileptic activity having been&#xD;
      detected on the EEG recorded during scanning. The reasons for this are unclear, which makes&#xD;
      it difficult to predict in advance whether useful information will be gained from the&#xD;
      scanning session. What is it about some epileptic discharges that results in a detectable&#xD;
      change in the fMRI signal, while others which are no less obvious or frequent do not? This&#xD;
      question will be addressed by determining the factors that are responsible for the occurrence&#xD;
      of robust fMRI signal changes via detailed morphological, topographical and spectral analysis&#xD;
      of the EEG signal on an event by event basis.&#xD;

      The purpose of the project is to continue the development of a new method of localising the&#xD;
      regions of the brain responsible for abnormal, epileptic discharges in patients with&#xD;
      epilepsy. The method, EEG-fMRI, combines electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI). EEG records the electrical activity of the brain via electrodes&#xD;
      attached to the scalp, and is widely used in the diagnosis and study of epilepsy. FMRI uses&#xD;
      an MRI scanner to detect changes in blood flow that occur whenever a region of the brain is&#xD;
      active. Both techniques have a wide range of applications in the study of normal and abnormal&#xD;
      brain function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantage of combining the two techniques is that fMRI can determine very accurately the&#xD;
      location of the active regions, while EEG has the potential to unlock their relative timing,&#xD;
      allowing more accurate interpretation of fMRI results and hence the brain response to&#xD;
      epileptic activity. The project will not be applied to the localisation of epileptic&#xD;
      seizures, because of their unpredictability, the safety implications of having a seizure in&#xD;
      an MRI scanner and problems with data quality if the patient moves during scanning. Instead,&#xD;
      interictal discharges will be studied, which are small events occurring regularly between&#xD;
      seizures of which the patient is unaware.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, it can be extremely important to determine which regions of the brain generate&#xD;
      epileptic discharges, both for a better understanding of the patient's epilepsy and, in&#xD;
      suitable cases, to help in planning surgery. EEG-fMRI is one method of doing this, and is&#xD;
      potentially very powerful because it is very straightforward for the patient, requiring only&#xD;
      the application of electrodes to the scalp followed by a period lying down in the MRI&#xD;
      scanner. In addition, since most UK hospitals have MRI scanners and EEG expertise, it could&#xD;
      take advantage of capacity that already exists within the NHS. This project will build on&#xD;
      previous work to characterise the link between the electrical (EEG) and blood flow (fMRI)&#xD;
      responses to interictal discharges which is necessary in order for the technique to become&#xD;
      widely used clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from epilepsy clinics after having the nature and purpose of the&#xD;
      project explained to them. They will also receive initial screening for MRI safety to ensure&#xD;
      that they can be scanned safely. Upon arrival at the Birmingham University Imaging Centre&#xD;
      (BUIC), EEG electrodes will be attached to the patient's scalp using an electrode cap. When&#xD;
      the electrodes are in place, the patient will be asked to lie down on the scanner bed. Ear&#xD;
      plugs and head phones will be worn to minimise the noise of the scanner but this will not&#xD;
      prevent communication with the scanner operator. Once the bed has been moved to the centre of&#xD;
      the scanner, the patient will be asked to lie still for the remainder of the scanning&#xD;
      session. No task will be performed. Scanning will include an anatomical image and multiple&#xD;
      runs of fMRI. The patient will have an alarm bell which can be pressed at any time to attract&#xD;
      the attention of the scanner operator, and fMRI scanning will have regular breaks every 5-6&#xD;
      minutes during which the scanner operator will talk to the patient. During the course of&#xD;
      scanning the patient will be monitored from the control room via the window and video camera.&#xD;
      Scanning will continue for a maximum of two hours or until the patient expresses the desire&#xD;
      to terminate the session. The patient will then be removed from the scanner and the&#xD;
      electrodes removed, following which the patient will be free to leave BUIC. It is expected&#xD;
      that the whole procedure will take up to 3 hours and will be conducted once per patient,&#xD;
      although if a patient expresses a willingness to return this may be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a variety of types of epilepsy will be scanned. This will result in a&#xD;
      comprehensive database, taking into account losses due to poor quality data, patients who&#xD;
      wish to leave the scanner early and those in whom no interictal discharges are observed. The&#xD;
      main result of the study will be to compare the properties of the fMRI response to the&#xD;
      corresponding properties of each interictal discharge, in order to determine why some&#xD;
      discharges are detectable by fMRI, while others are not. This will be done on a patient by&#xD;
      patient basis, although comparison across patients with similar types of epilepsy will begin&#xD;
      to help determine which patients are suitable for EEG-fMRI, a crucial question if the&#xD;
      technique is to be applied efficiently and effectively.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. adults with no contraindications to MRI scanning. Initial screening for MR&#xD;
             compatibility will be performed at recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. epilepsy with interictal epileptic discharges evident on scalp EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. rarity or lack of seizures. This is an important point to minimise the risk of the&#xD;
             patient having a seizure during scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. expected rate of interictal epileptic discharges sufficient to allow at least 10 but&#xD;
             less than 200 events to be recorded per hour. Both too few and too many events make&#xD;
             interpretation of the EEG-fMRI results difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. willingness to remain in the scanner for a minimum of 40 minutes. This ensures that a&#xD;
             reasonable amount of fMRI data is collected. It is important that motivated subjects&#xD;
             are recruited, preferably those who have previously undergone MRI scanning and so have&#xD;
             some idea of the environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. contraindications to MRI scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. epilepsy with rare or absent interictal discharges, or frequent seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. patient is unable to give informed consent or understand the nature of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. neurological or psychiatric diagnosis other than epilepsy.&#xD;
