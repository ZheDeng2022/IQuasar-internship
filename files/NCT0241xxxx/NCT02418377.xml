  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a complex multifactorial disease where genetics play an important role in&#xD;
      predisposing children to early onset obesity. Though many obesity susceptible genes and&#xD;
      variants have been identified with obesity, the most common obesity gene, MC4R only accounts&#xD;
      for 5% of all early onset obesity cases. This implies that there may be more obesity related&#xD;
      genes and variants that need to be unravelled to further delineate the relationship between&#xD;
      obesity and genetics. The investigators propose in screening the exonic regions of all the&#xD;
      genes in obese subjects using whole-exome sequencing (WES) to discover novel obesity related&#xD;
      variants and genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis The investigators hypothesized that our paediatric subjects with&#xD;
      early-onset severe obesity will have strong genetic predisposition and therefore the cohort&#xD;
      would be enriched with obesity susceptibility genetic variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis The investigators hypothesized that there is increasing prevalence of,&#xD;
      and possibly worsening, obesity-related complications (namely glucose intolerance,&#xD;
      hypertension, metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) in our severely obese&#xD;
      children, as compared to 15 years ago, due to an increasingly obesogenic environment&#xD;
      promoting unhealthy lifestyle and eating habits.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Number of subjects to be enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As our study aims to identify susceptible genetic variants associated with early onset&#xD;
      obesity, we will be recruiting 400 obese children to participate in this genetic study, in&#xD;
      addition to the existing DNA samples we collected in a previous study (DSRB Ref C/00/501).&#xD;
      These 400 obese children will be recruited through NUH paediatric clinic and School Health&#xD;
      Clinic at Health Promotion Board. We will also recruit family members of the obese children&#xD;
      who are interested to join the research study. We will be using the DNA samples and&#xD;
      information of 250 obese children previously recruited to the Obesity Genetic Study from&#xD;
      January 2000 to December 2004 (DSRB Ref C/00/501). We will also be performing WES on 500 lean&#xD;
      adults (as controls) recruited for an ongoing study titled &quot;Whole exome sequencing to&#xD;
      identify genes for extreme Myopia in Asian populations&quot; (NUS-IRB reference code: 12-466).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total number of new obese children subjects to be recruited: 400 Total number of family&#xD;
      members (Parents and siblings): 500 Total number of existing obese children subjects to be&#xD;
      used: 250 Total number of existing lean adult controls to be used: 500&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Recruitment:&#xD;

      The doctor will ask a few simple questions regarding the age and medical history of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For obese subjects: Overweight before 10 years of age, and the body weight is 40% above the&#xD;
      ideal body weight for height, or BMI for age above 97th percentile without any major medical&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For family members: Parents or direct siblings of obese children (no selection criteria) For&#xD;
      controls: Lean adults of ongoing study (NUS-IRB reference code: 12-466) with BMI between 18.5&#xD;
      kg/m2 and 23 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;

      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ideal body weight for height (WFH) of at least 140% or BMI for age above 97th percentile&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Overweight before 10 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Informed consent from both obese children subject and legal representative e.g. parents&#xD;
&#xD;

      participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unfit for blood testing and OGTT testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. No informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study may be discontinued if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No OSHE approval&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No DSRB approval&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complaints of any inappropriate procedures performed on subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening Visits and Procedures The subject will be screened at the school health clinic&#xD;
           at HPB or NUH paediatric clinic. The subject's age, weight and height will be taken.&#xD;
           Only those who the doctor determined to have an ideal body weight for height of greater&#xD;
           than 140% or BMI for age at greater than 97th percentile of the local children&#xD;
           population will be invited for the study. The subject will be allowed to go home with&#xD;
           the consent form and reply within 3 months before recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Visits and Procedures Study visit 1: Trained doctor will carry out an interview&#xD;
           regarding the medical history if the subject and performed physical examination. 15ml of&#xD;
           blood will be drawn from the subject (after overnight fasting) for testing of liver&#xD;
           panel, lipid panel, fasting insulin level, fasting C-peptide level. The subject will&#xD;
           also go through an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) where 2ml of blood will be drawn&#xD;
           at both 0 min and 120min time-interval during OGTT. During the 2 hr OGTT, the subjects&#xD;
           will be required to fill in 3 sets of questionnaire regarding motivational level,&#xD;
           socio-economic status and physical activity and diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The family member of the obese subject is required to go through all testing as&#xD;
           described above for the subject except that they do not need to undergo OGTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Final Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The final study visit will be scheduled 2-3 weeks after the first visit. The screening&#xD;
           report of the subject will be reviewed and evaluated by the attending doctor to the&#xD;
           subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Post Study Follow up and Procedures The subject will be able to keep a copy of their&#xD;
           health screening test reports. For subjects who are found to suffer from medical&#xD;
           conditions such as dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, high body fat percentage, liver&#xD;
           malfunction or glucose intolerance, they will be referred to other departments for&#xD;
           further testing and medical attention to confirm outcome measures. Subjects found to&#xD;
           have a rare genetic variant through genetic testing will also be called back for further&#xD;
           and repeat clinical examination and testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Discontinuation Visit and Procedures Subjects may withdraw voluntarily from&#xD;
           participation in the study at any time. The biological samples of the subject will be&#xD;
           discarded upon the request of the subject. However, if the patient was found to be&#xD;
           suffering from any other complications during the study health screening, they will be&#xD;
           advised and referred to other departments for medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Quality Assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electronic input of patients' data into the system will be handled by 2 research&#xD;
      coordinators who will perform the data entry independently. Thus, data of each subject will&#xD;
      be entered twice into the system by the 2 independent research coordinators. We will do a&#xD;
      system comparison between the 2 entries for per subject to ensure that all information of the&#xD;
      subject was entered correctly and accurately. The principal investigator will also randomly&#xD;
      check through the system every month for data quality assurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Entry and Storage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical testing data and questionnaire will be entered by the subjects on paper. The&#xD;
      paper documentations will be transferred or transported back to the PI's office and each&#xD;
      subject's data will be entered electronically by 2 independent research coordinators to&#xD;
      ensure data quality assurance. All electronic entry of the documentations can only be&#xD;
      performed within the office using the office computer and all paper documentations must be&#xD;
      returned for lock-up at the end of the day. The electronic documentations will be password&#xD;
      protected and the hard copy of the paper documentations will be stored in a lock and key&#xD;
      access cabinet in PI's office. Briefly discuss where data will be entered (i.e. will these&#xD;
      entries be on paper or electronically), stored and handled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations were carried out using Quanto (ver 1.2.4). To detect variants at a power&#xD;
      of odd ratios of 2.0-5.0 in the discovery stage at varying MAF (α=0.01), the sample size of&#xD;
      400 obese children is approximately 51% to 98% power to detect variants with large effects&#xD;
      (OR = 3.5) in our discovery stage, at MAF between 0.5% and 3.0%, respectively (α=0.01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical and Analytical Plans:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All prioritized damaging non-synonymous variants will be tested for statistical association&#xD;
      in a case-control design using SPSS. The 2-tailed Fisher's exact test will be utilized for&#xD;
      variants with MAF &lt; 3% and logistic regression, adjusting for sex will be performed for&#xD;
      variants with MAF ≥ 3%. These will be done using PLINK. We will also carry out a gene-level&#xD;
      burden tests using the Sequencing Kernel Association Test (SKAT) software. All single-variant&#xD;
      and gene-level results will be corrected for multiple tests using a Bonferonni correction.&#xD;
      Any variants identified by prediction tool (Polyphen2) to be highly disruptive (defined as&#xD;
      nonsense, splice site and frameshift changes, which severely disrupt protein structure) will&#xD;
      be prioritized for validations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses of de novo genotyping data will be similar to that in primary aim 1.&#xD;
      Subsequently, we will meta-analyse data from the discovery and validation stages using an&#xD;
      inverse variance-weighted method, assuming a fixed-effect model, to derive overall pooled&#xD;
      estimates and two-sided p-values. Heterogeneity checks will be conducted (Cochran's Q and I2&#xD;
      indices), and at variants where significant (Q p-value &lt;0.05 and/or I2 index &gt;40%)&#xD;
      heterogeneity is detected the meta-analysis will be carried out in the random effects mode as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RETENTION OF TRIAL DOCUMENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The records for all participants which include the medical history, clinical report, blood&#xD;
      test results, questionnaire, OSHE documentation, IRB documentation and DSRB documentation&#xD;
      will be kept by the principal investigator in a lock-up cabinet in his card access office.&#xD;
      Only the principal investigator will hold the key and have direct access to the lock-up&#xD;
      cabinet. These documents will be retained for a period of 6years after the end of the&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Principal Investigator initiated Trials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All serious adverse events (SAEs) that are unexpected and related to the study drug must be&#xD;
      reported to HSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;A serious adverse event or serious adverse drug reaction is any untoward medical occurrence&#xD;
      at any dose that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results in death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is a Medically important event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an event is an&#xD;
      important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life threatening&#xD;
      and/or result in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may&#xD;
      jeopardize the subject and/or may require intervention to prevent one of the other adverse&#xD;
      event outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      All SAEs that are unexpected and related to the study drug will be reported. The investigator&#xD;
      is responsible for informing HSA no later than 15 calendar days after first knowledge that&#xD;
      the case qualifies for expedited reporting. Follow-information will be actively sought and&#xD;
      submitted as it becomes available. For fatal or life-threatening cases, HSA will be notified&#xD;
      as soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar days after first knowledge that a case&#xD;
      qualifies, followed by a complete report within 8 additional calendar days.&#xD;
