    <textblock>
      Locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine (NE) neuron activity has been convincingly linked to&#xD;
      regulation of acute fear. This study will address whether LC NE activity examined through&#xD;
      pupil measures will reflect carbon dioxide (CO2) induced fear-responses in humans and if&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can mitigate these effects. A 2 year R21 phase&#xD;
      establishing feasibility, tolerability, safety, and proof-of-concept (POC) in terms of&#xD;
      capacity to engage LC NE neurons with tDCS, followed by a 3 year R33 parallel-group,&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized, controlled trial will determine the degree to which engaging LC NE&#xD;
      neurons with tDCS improves clinical symptoms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) has recently identified that a major&#xD;
      limitation to the understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders and the development of&#xD;
      treatments for these conditions has been the inability to identify key dimensions of&#xD;
      observable behavior that are central to these disorders and linked to underlying neurobiology&#xD;
      by measurable biomarkers. This project is intended to address this problem by establishing&#xD;
      that pupillary measures of norepinephrine (NE) neuronal activity are biomarkers of fear&#xD;
      dimension of observable behavior, alterations of which are believed to be core features of&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric conditions such as anxiety disorders. The investigators will establish this&#xD;
      biomarker-clinical dimension link by comparing pupillary indices in humans to a carbon&#xD;
      dioxide (CO2) fear provocation test, as well as in these subjects undergoing transcranial&#xD;
      Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) prior to and after CO2 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited in Dr. Krystal's laboratory at Duke University which has&#xD;
      proven infrastructure for clinical trials. The study team plans to enroll a total of 240&#xD;
      subjects healthy volunteers (age range: 21-65 years) in order to complete 100. This takes&#xD;
      into account the expected rate of failure to: have a pupillary response in the auditory&#xD;
      oddball task (AOT) (25%); have a sufficient fear response to CO2 challenge (50% - relevant&#xD;
      for last 10 R21 and all R33 subjects); and to meet other screening criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      R21 Phase: First 30 Subjects will undergo two sessions separated by 1 week in which a&#xD;
      promising electrode configuration (three promising configuration will each be tested in a&#xD;
      cohort of 10 subjects) will be used with tDCS stimulation at increasing electrical dosage&#xD;
      during which pupillometry will be carried out to determine the auditory oddball test (AOT)&#xD;
      response. A maximum of 5 total tDCS dosages and sham will be tested. Last 10 Subjects. These&#xD;
      subjects will take part in a double-blind, controlled, randomized, cross-over study over 3&#xD;
      sessions. At session 1 subjects will undergo electrical dose titration with the tDCS&#xD;
      electrode configuration resulting from the 3 rounds of optimization using the same procedure&#xD;
      as in the first 30 subjects to determine the lowest well-tolerated dose that suppresses the&#xD;
      AOT pupil response, except that a maximum of 5 tDCS dosages will be tested at this session.&#xD;
      At the third and fourth sessions (1 week apart) subjects will receive dose-optimized tDCS and&#xD;
      the control treatment with order randomized along with 7.5% CO2 (to evoke an LC response) for&#xD;
      20 minutes. The 7.5% CO2 will be delivered to us pre-mixed provided by Airgas. At these&#xD;
      sessions, the VAS-A and State Trait Anxiety-Inventory (STA-I) will be administered 5 minutes&#xD;
      prior to and just after the 20 minute session and Visual Analog Scale-Anxiety (VAS-A) will&#xD;
      also be obtained at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minute points of the CO2 inhalation. tDCS will be&#xD;
      administered during the last 5 minutes of the 20 minute CO2 inhalation period. Subjects will&#xD;
      be monitored for an hour post-session for safety and will undergo study physician assessment&#xD;
      to determine suitability to leave. Following the 2nd treatment session participation will end&#xD;
      except that subjects will be called the next day to assess for adverse effects and&#xD;
      appropriate care will be given if found. R33 Phase: 60 subjects will participate in a&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial. They will be randomized to either&#xD;
      active or control treatment and at the first post-screening visit they will undergo&#xD;
      electrical dose titration as described above for the treatment they are randomized to. For&#xD;
      all titrations, during the 5 minutes between tDCS treatments an unblinded member of the study&#xD;
      team not having contact with the subjects will compute their AOT pupil response and convey to&#xD;
      the tDCS treatment physician whether to continue or stop titration. Subjects randomized to&#xD;
      the control treatment will undergo a sham titration where the stop level will be randomly&#xD;
      selected from the distribution of titration outcomes occurring in the R21 phase. Subjects&#xD;
      will then return in 1 week and undergo optimal dose tDCS or control treatment for a single&#xD;
      treatment session as described in the prior paragraph. Primary outcome will be the VAS-A&#xD;
      &quot;fearful&quot; rating obtained at the end of tDCS/CO2 inhalation. AOT pupil response will be&#xD;
      obtained every 10 minutes after the end of the tDCS/CO2 inhalation period to map the duration&#xD;
      of persistent effects on LC. At the end of this session participation will end except that&#xD;
      subjects will be called the next day to assess for adverse effects and care given if&#xD;
      necessary. Preliminary data from the R21 phase will be used to provide justification for the&#xD;
      larger R33 study, and prior to commencing the R33 investigation phase that an addendum to the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol with approval will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pupillometry Procedure. The team will employ fully mobile SensoMotoric Instruments (SMI)&#xD;
      Eye-tracking Glasses to carry out pupillometry. Pupil diameter will be recorded continuously&#xD;
      from the each eye at a sampling rate of 60 Hz via glasses on the subject's face. The&#xD;
      investigators will capture pupil size at baseline and in response to the AOT and&#xD;
      administration of 7.5% CO2. Data will be segmented into epochs from 0 to 12 s relative to the&#xD;
      acquisition onset of each stimuli or experimental condition. An average pupil diameter&#xD;
      measure will then be calculated for the corresponding volume by taking the mean across the&#xD;
      remaining non-artifactual samples in that epoch. For 7.5% CO2 response the pupil diameter&#xD;
      will be averaged over 1 minute periods while subjects are staring at a dark screen in a dark&#xD;
      room. This will be computed at baseline, and at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes after the start of&#xD;
      CO2 inhalation and 5 minutes and 30 minutes postinhalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of 7.5% CO2. Inhalation of 7.5% CO2 for 20 min will be carried out. Subjects&#xD;
      will be instructed to avoid alcohol for 36 hours and caffeine for 12 hour prior to testing&#xD;
      and to eat a light lunch at least one hour prior to testing. A urine pregnancy test will be&#xD;
      administered to women of childbearing potential on both days of gas exposure with a negative&#xD;
      result needed in order to continue in study participation. Gas will be delivered via a&#xD;
      nasal-oral face mask connected via tubing to a 500 L reservoir bag filled with 7.5% CO2/21%&#xD;
      Oxygen (O2) 71.5% Nitrogen (N2). Subjects will receive air through the mask in the 10 min&#xD;
      prior to CO2 administration during which baseline measures will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) will be administered with a multichannel&#xD;
      direct current stimulation device that can be programmed so that the operator doesn't know&#xD;
      the combination of electrodes being used for stimulation, and, thereby allow double-blinding.&#xD;
      The active tDCS electrode configuration to be used will be determined with the 3 round&#xD;
      iterative procedure described above; based on electric field modeling and personalized&#xD;
      electrical dose titration to find the lowest dose that is well-tolerated and engages the&#xD;
      target in terms of inhibiting the AOT pupillary response. Electrical dosage will be&#xD;
      personalized for each subject by titrating dosage (gradually increasing) until the dosage is&#xD;
      found that is both well-tolerated (no more than mild discomfort on a 5-point Likert scale)&#xD;
      and suppresses the AOT pupillary response. If the 5-point Likert tolerability rating is&#xD;
      greater than &quot;mild discomfort&quot; or if maximum amperage is reached without effect on AOT then&#xD;
      subject participation will terminate.&#xD;

NeuroConn Direct Current stimulator Multiple Channel -4: (tDCS) will be administered with a multichannel tDCS device that can be programmed so that the operator doesn't know the combination of electrodes being used for stimulation, and, thereby allow double-blinding. The active tDCS electrode configuration to be used will be determined with the 3 round iterative procedure described above; based on electric field modeling and personalized electrical dose titration to find the lowest dose that is well-tolerated and engages the target in terms of inhibiting the AOT pupillary response.</description>
