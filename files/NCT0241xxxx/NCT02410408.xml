      Adverse events are also the cause of suffering in health professionals involved (second&#xD;
      victims). This study has the aim of design and evaluates two applications for staff of&#xD;
      hospital and primary care settings with the intention of improving their capacity to conduct&#xD;
      Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and to help them introducing patient safety certification (PSC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-blind randomized controlled trial shall conduct with a control and an experimental&#xD;
      group (N=84) in both cases. The characteristics of both apps shall specify based on the&#xD;
      suggestions of health professionals and shall design for Android and IOS (for iPhone or&#xD;
      Ipad).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomly subjects in the control group shall receive oral and written information and the&#xD;
      experimental group used App for two months. Pre- and post- measures shall include: patient&#xD;
      safety knowledge and culture and self-perceived capacity to enhance RCA or follow-up PSC. In&#xD;
      the experimental group, data shall also collect on their previous experience with information&#xD;
      and communication technologies, their rating of each App. The inter-group intervention&#xD;
      effects shall calculate by univariate linear models and ANOVA, with the pre- to&#xD;
      post-intervention differences as the dependent variables.&#xD;

      Adverse events (AEs) are the cause of harm and suffering in patients and may also markedly&#xD;
      affect the work, family and personal life of health professionals involved, second victims,&#xD;
      as well as damaging the reputation of affected health organizations (third victims), by&#xD;
      undermining people's trust in these institutions. Between 28 and 57% of physicians (79-89% in&#xD;
      the case of residents) recognize having being involved in medical error with serious&#xD;
      consequences for one or more patients at some point in their career, while 90% believe that&#xD;
      in their hospital there is insufficient help and support for professionals following an AE.&#xD;
      In Spain, extrapolating from national AE data in hospitals and primary care, it has been&#xD;
      estimated that 15% of healthcare professionals are involved in this type of event per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines and recommendations of the role of staff directive of health institutions in the&#xD;
      field of the safety of patients have been developed with the aim to reduce the impact of&#xD;
      adverse events in the second and third victims. The root causes analysis (RCA) and the&#xD;
      patient safety certification (PSC) systems following the International Organization for&#xD;
      Standardization (ISO) rules are two examples of these interventions in which staff has direct&#xD;
      responsibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators design and assess two apps designed for Android and IOS (for&#xD;
      iPhone or Ipad) to help staff conducting RCA or implementing PSC. To evaluate these Apps the&#xD;
      investigators opted for a single-blind experimental design with two groups (control and&#xD;
      experimental) and pre- and- post assessments. Subjects shall be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      control or experimental group. The control group shall compose of subjects who did not use&#xD;
      experimental devices, and the experimental group of people used this tool for two months. To&#xD;
      maintain the single-blind and be able to link the pre- and post- measurements, subjects shall&#xD;
      assign codes as a function of their date of birth and initials. The investigators randomly&#xD;
      select 84 subjects from health districts in Spain who develop directive function. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria: less than 3 years of professional experience. The sample size was calculated to&#xD;
      detect a difference between means of at least of 10 points with a statistical power of 90% at&#xD;
      a level of significance of α = 0.05 (in a two-tailed test). The investigators requested the&#xD;
      informed consent of patients from both control and experimental groups. All the participating&#xD;
      shall complete a questionnaire to assess patient safety knowledge and culture as well as&#xD;
      self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those in the control group received oral and written information regarding patient safety&#xD;
      certification or Root Cause Analysis. Participants in the experimental group were given the&#xD;
      apps installed and personalized according to their institution. Two months later, the&#xD;
      measurements made pre-intervention shall repeat. Additionally, subjects from the experimental&#xD;
      group also shall ask to evaluate apps (its performance, functionality, usability,&#xD;
      reliability, acceptability, usefulness, design, simplicity, accessibility, and&#xD;
      problem-solving power as well as overall satisfaction with the tool). In order to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the apps, we shall build various univariate linear models and, where there&#xD;
      were inter-group differences in pre-intervention measurements, performed univariate linear&#xD;
      models and ANOVA, using as the dependent variables the differences between the pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention measurements.&#xD;
