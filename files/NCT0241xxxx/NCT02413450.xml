  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have driven a paradigm shift in the modeling of&#xD;
      human disease; the ability to reprogram patient-specific cells holds the promise of an&#xD;
      enhanced understanding of disease mechanisms and phenotypic variability, with applications in&#xD;
      personalized predictive pharmacology/toxicology, cell therapy and regenerative medicine. This&#xD;
      research will collect blood or skin biopsies from patients and healthy controls for the&#xD;
      purpose of generating cell and tissue models of Mendelian heritable forms of heart disease&#xD;
      focusing on cardiomyopathies, channelopathies and neuromuscular diseases. Cardiomyocytes&#xD;
      derived from hiPSCs will provide a ready source of disease specific cells to study&#xD;
      pathogenesis and therapeutics.&#xD;

      Further study details as provided by Gordon F. Tomaselli, Johns Hopkins University:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biospecimen Retention: Blood or tissue samples, hiPSCs and cardiomyocytes reprogrammed from&#xD;
      hiPSCs Eligible patients will be approached and the study will be explained in full as a part&#xD;
      of obtaining informed consent for the study. The subjects will have an opportunity to ask&#xD;
      questions about the study. Control subjects, often but not exclusively family member that&#xD;
      meet the eligibility criteria will undergo a similar procedure for informed consent. Subjects&#xD;
      will be evaluated in clinic and will have a 1-3 mm skin biopsy or blood draw (30 cc). The&#xD;
      subjects will be asked about their medical history during the clinic visit but this&#xD;
      information will not be transmitted to the research laboratories where the iPSCs are&#xD;
      generated and re-programmed, only the disease genotype will be associated with the samples.&#xD;
      The samples that will be frozen and stored are whole blood, white blood cells, skin biopsies,&#xD;
      hiPSCs and reprogrammed cardiomyocytes.&#xD;
