  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory cytokines play a pivotal role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and innovative&#xD;
      non-pharmacological therapies aimed at limiting cytokine production are highly warranted.&#xD;
      Adrenaline, a neurotransmitter of the autonomic sympathetic nervous system, attenuates&#xD;
      cytokine production. Along these lines, endogenous modulation of sympathetic activity could&#xD;
      limit inflammation and therefore represent a treatment modality that would empower RA&#xD;
      patients to exert self-control over disease activity. However, both the autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system and the inflammatory response are regarded as systems that cannot be voluntarily&#xD;
      influenced. Nevertheless, results from two recent studies demonstrate that this is possible&#xD;
      through techniques developed by 'iceman' Wim Hof, namely meditation, exposure to cold, and&#xD;
      breathing exercises. Hof himself and healthy volunteers trained by him were able to&#xD;
      voluntarily activate the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in adrenaline release and&#xD;
      subsequent suppression of the inflammatory response during experimental human endotoxemia (a&#xD;
      model of systemic inflammation elicited by administration of lipopolysaccharide [LPS] in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers). Interestingly, while having been taught all three techniques, during the&#xD;
      endotoxemia experiment the trained subjects (like Hof himself) predominantly practiced the&#xD;
      breathing exercises consisting of two different techniques. A 'hyper/hypoventilation'&#xD;
      technique, characterized by cycles of hyperventilation followed by breath retention and a&#xD;
      'strength ventilation' technique consisting of deep inhalations and exhalations followed by&#xD;
      breath holding. These techniques resulted in intermittent hypoxia and cyclic shifts in&#xD;
      acid-base balance. Based on these observations and previous studies, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that these breathing techniques account for the increased production of&#xD;
      adrenaline and thus for the suppressed inflammatory response but it is unclear which of these&#xD;
      two techniques is most important.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to compare the increase in plasma adrenaline levels during&#xD;
      the two different breathing techniques in a group of healthy volunteers trained by Hof. Also,&#xD;
      the investigators investigate whether it is necessary to be trained by Hof and if a&#xD;
      relatively short instruction instead of the extensive training is sufficient. Additionally,&#xD;
      the investigators want to evaluate the influence of the training and breathing techniques on&#xD;
      pain thresholds.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Hyper/hypoventilation</intervention_name>
    <description>Subjects are asked to hyperventilate for an average of 30 breaths. Subsequently, the subjects exhaled and hold their breath for approximately 2 minutes (&quot;retention phase&quot;). The duration of breath retention will be entirely at the discretion of the subject himself. Breath retention is followed by a deep inhalation breath, that will be held for 10 s. Subsequently a new cycle of hyper/hypoventilation begins.</description>
