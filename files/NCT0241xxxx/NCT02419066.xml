      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine the level, patterns, and correlates of objectively measured ART adherence in&#xD;
      early and advanced-stage disease, among pregnant and non-pregnant individuals, to determine&#xD;
      the need and nature of interventions to support early ART adherence in Uganda and South&#xD;
      Africa. Outcomes include: i) average adherence, ii) incidence of any 28-day period with &lt;80%&#xD;
      adherence, iii) number of ART interruptions &gt;72 hours (which could lead to loss of viral&#xD;
      suppression), and iv) detectable HIV RNA &gt;400 copies/Ml at 6 and 12 months. Guided by prior&#xD;
      work and the Theory of Vulnerable Populations, we hypothesize that incomplete adherence will&#xD;
      be associated with a) early-stage, asymptomatic disease, b) pregnancy and postpartum periods,&#xD;
      and c) multiple social and economic factors. Individuals with CD4 200-350 will not be studied&#xD;
      in order to most efficiently identify differences at the extremes of early and advanced&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Given the known importance of social networks and social support for adherence in&#xD;
      advanced-stage disease in some RLS, we will determine the extent to which social network&#xD;
      cohesion, HIV serostatus disclosure within the network, and receipt of social support explain&#xD;
      differential ART adherence in early and advanced-stage disease. We hypothesize that: i)&#xD;
      compared to people with advanced-stage disease, people with early-stage disease will have&#xD;
      less cohesive social networks, disclose their seropositivity to fewer network members, and&#xD;
      receive less social support; ii) social network cohesion, serostatus disclosure, and social&#xD;
      support will be associated with greater ART adherence; and iii) these associations will&#xD;
      explain a significant portion of differential ART adherence in early versus advanced-stage&#xD;
      disease. Additionally, although these factors have been well established previously in&#xD;
      Uganda, prospective data is needed to account for secular trends related to treatment&#xD;
      expansion and comparable data are needed from South Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: We will use qualitative methods to identify, describe and explain influences on ART&#xD;
      adherence in early-stage disease to guide intervention development. In-depth understanding of&#xD;
      influences on ART adherence among individuals with early-stage HIV disease will inform the&#xD;
      focus of any needed ART adherence interventions for this population. We will conduct&#xD;
      in-depth, adherence-focused qualitative interviews with (a) 50 HIV+ men and non-pregnant&#xD;
      women, and (b) 50 HIV+ pregnant women, who initiate ART with early-stage disease. Interviews&#xD;
      with pregnant women may be post-partum by the time of the interview. Equal numbers of&#xD;
      individuals in these two groups will be drawn from the Uganda and South Africa sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims 1, 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon recruitment, participants will receive a baseline interview and phlebotomy. Women &lt;50&#xD;
      years will be given a urine pregnancy test. Participants will be given a Wisepill device, and&#xD;
      instructed on how to use it using training procedures established in prior studies by this&#xD;
      group. The RA will then fill the Wisepill device with the antiretroviral medication. If&#xD;
      feasible and acceptable to participants, participants will then be driven to their place of&#xD;
      residence for global positioning system (GPS) mapping (given that GPS-measured distance has&#xD;
      been associated with clinic visit adherence). If available, existing GPS map data may be used&#xD;
      in lieu of driving to the participant's place of residence and collecting GPS coordinates.&#xD;
      Structured interviews will be conducted at enrollment, 6 and 12 months. Interviews will&#xD;
      typically take place at the clinic. If feasible and desirable, they may be offered at home or&#xD;
      another location of the participant's choosing. It will be explained clearly to the&#xD;
      participant that if they do not have adequate cellular reception for reliable data&#xD;
      transmission via the Wisepill device they need to bring the Wisepill device to clinic for&#xD;
      pharmacy refill will be emphasized. Additionally, if they permanently move to an area that is&#xD;
      more than 60 km from the clinic, they will be disenrolled from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6 and 12-month follow up visits will be held separately from routine clinic visits to&#xD;
      avoid potential influence on routine clinic attendance and/or adherence (e.g., easier&#xD;
      transportation or higher motivation to attend due to study visit incentives). Participants&#xD;
      may be sought by phone or at home for study procedures if they do not attend their scheduled&#xD;
      6 and 12-month clinic visits. Individuals may also be contacted if the study team becomes&#xD;
      aware of technical problems with the Wisepill device. In that event, the study team will try&#xD;
      to reach the participant by phone, but if they are unable, they may go to the participant's&#xD;
      house to assess the technical difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As noted above, participants will be seen at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months for structured&#xD;
      interviews, phlebotomy (viral load, sample storage), and for women, pregnancy testing.&#xD;
      Because of the dynamic relationship between adherence and HIV RNA suppression, the first year&#xD;
      is the most critical period for adherence and because the greatest decline in adherence is&#xD;
      usually seen over the first year, a full year of observation is planned to determine if stage&#xD;
      of disease is associated with adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structured interviews will cover the following topics: demographics, health status,&#xD;
      socio-economic status, structural barriers to clinic access, food security, physical and&#xD;
      mental health, depression, coping, sexual behavior, transactional sex/intimate partner&#xD;
      violence, beliefs/satisfaction, necessity/concerns, alcohol and recreational drug use,&#xD;
      stigma, adherence, and medical mistrust/conspiracy. We will also define social networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence will be measured in real-time with the Wisepill device, which automatically&#xD;
      captures and reports, once daily via cellular technology, the participant's medication&#xD;
      adherence data. A second signal is transmitted daily to report battery level and confirm&#xD;
      device functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use purposeful sampling to systematically represent subgroups of early disease&#xD;
      adherers (both low and high) and create the conditions for in-depth qualitative analysis.&#xD;
      Starting at 6 months of follow-up, we will identify from the larger cohorts of participants,&#xD;
      25 pregnant early disease adherers and 25 non-pregnant early disease adherers at each of the&#xD;
      two (Ugandan and South African) study sites (total qualitative sample size = 100&#xD;
      individuals). Interviews with pregnant women may occur during the post-partum period. Each&#xD;
      qualitative participant will take part in a single, in-depth individual interview conducted&#xD;
      by a research assistant trained in the collection of in depth qualitative interviews.&#xD;
      Interviews will target the actual adherence experiences and behavior of interviewees and&#xD;
      systematically cover a range of relevant topics, including: (a) the circumstances under which&#xD;
      pills are taken (dosing behavior); (2) missed doses and why they happened; (3) what obstacles&#xD;
      impede adherence; (3) who helps with adherence and how (social support). Interviews will be&#xD;
      transcribed into English, if needed, to produce the qualitative data set of 100 interview&#xD;
      transcripts.&#xD;
