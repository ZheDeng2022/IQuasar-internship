      Stroke, a personal, familial, and social disaster, is the first cause of acquired disability,&#xD;
      the second cause of dementia, and the third cause of death worldwide. Its associated&#xD;
      socio-economic costs are astronomic. The burden of stroke is likely to increase, given the&#xD;
      aging of the population and the growing incidence of many vascular risk factors. Therefore,&#xD;
      apart from further development of stroke prevention and treatment strategies, rational and&#xD;
      effective tools for diagnosis, monitoring, and follow-up for stroke patients have potential&#xD;
      high long-term clinical and economic consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For neuroradiological work-up, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      are used as gold standard techniques to detect presence or absence, effective state, and&#xD;
      extent of stroke. However, these techniques achieve simply a baseline study of ischemia&#xD;
      occurred and can deliver only a snapshot of brain parenchyma and vessels. Furthermore, their&#xD;
      rapid and actual availability, especially in primary hospitals, and their dynamic&#xD;
      capabilities and predictive values for further infarction are poor with critically ill&#xD;
      patients have to be repeatedly transferred to the scanning unit for each measurement. Whereas&#xD;
      CT examination is associated with x-ray radiation and may miss early detection of stroke, MRI&#xD;
      is associated with higher costs and not generally routinely and around-the clock available in&#xD;
      all the hospitals. Therefore, a simple, fast, repeatable, non-hazardous, and non-invasive&#xD;
      dynamic bedside tool for the detection of acute brain tissue hypoperfusion and monitoring for&#xD;
      potential further infarction or efficacy of thrombolysis either by systemic intravenous&#xD;
      thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or by selective&#xD;
      intraarterial fibrinolysis and mechanical recanalization, both combined with or without&#xD;
      bridging after acute ischemic stroke, is strongly needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising alternative method of diagnosing stroke represents contrast-enhanced ultrasound&#xD;
      perfusion imaging (UPI). What makes UPI so valuable is the advantage of repeatedly and&#xD;
      non-invasively detecting brain tissue at risk for infarction by dynamic direct brain tissue&#xD;
      perfusion assessment and not by surrogate parameters, like blood flow velocity or vessel&#xD;
      diameter. Because of the possibility to screen and repeatedly measure the state of perfusion,&#xD;
      the chances increase to diagnose and monitor ischemic stroke and to define the appropriate&#xD;
      window for treatment. The perfusion analysis would also allow determination of treatment&#xD;
      results and guidance of rapid and adequate further therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the present pilot study in 40 patients is initiated. The objectives of this&#xD;
      observational diagnostic cohort trial are to evaluate feasibility and practicability of&#xD;
      repeated bedside assessments by contrast enhanced UPI in acute ischemic stroke patients and&#xD;
      to assess whether UPI can detect alterations in brain tissue perfusion before and after&#xD;
      recanalising therapy of strokes. Assessment of cerebral perfusion by CT or MRI serves as&#xD;
      reference and its results are compared to UPI data.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke is a personal, familial and social disaster. Apart from development of stroke&#xD;
      prevention and treatment strategies, the mainstay of stroke research remains new-product&#xD;
      development and improvement of current imaging tools for diagnosis, monitoring and follow-up&#xD;
      of stroke patients. For initial neuroradiological work-up, usually computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to detect presence or absence, effective state&#xD;
      and extent of stroke. However, their rapid and actual availability, especially in primary&#xD;
      hospitals, and their dynamic capabilities and predictive values for further infarction are&#xD;
      poor. Currently cerebral CT-perfusion (CTP) imaging can be regarded as the gold standard for&#xD;
      assessing tissue hypoperfusion in this setting. It employs, however, both contrast agent and&#xD;
      X-ray exposition and patients have to be repeatedly transferred to the scanning unit for each&#xD;
      measurement. Therefore, a fast, simple, repeatable, non-hazardous and non-invasive dynamic&#xD;
      bedside tool for the detection of acute brain tissue hypoperfusion and monitoring for&#xD;
      potential further infarction or efficacy of thrombolysis after ischemic stroke is strongly&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socioeconomic importance of stroke Stroke is the first cause of acquired disability, the&#xD;
      second cause of dementia and the third cause of death worldwide, and its associated&#xD;
      socio-economic costs are astronomic. The burden of stroke is likely to increase, given the&#xD;
      aging of the population and the growing incidence of many vascular risk factors. Therefore,&#xD;
      rational and effective diagnostic and therapeutic management in stroke patients has potential&#xD;
      high long-term clinical and economic consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current standard therapy after acute ischemic stroke According to the cause of stroke and&#xD;
      apart from medical treatment and surgical options in selected cases, the mainstay of&#xD;
      therapeutic management of acute ischemic stroke itself usually remain systemic intravenous&#xD;
      thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or selective&#xD;
      intraarterial fibrinolysis and mechanical recanalization, both with or without bridging&#xD;
      (combined intravenous and intraarterial thrombolysis). In this regard, reperfusion therapy is&#xD;
      the only proven treatment for acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current problems in diagnosis and monitoring of stroke patients At present, CT and MRI are&#xD;
      usually applied for diagnosis and follow-up of stroke. However, both CT and MRI achieve&#xD;
      simply a baseline study of ischemia occurred and can deliver only a snapshot of brain&#xD;
      parenchyma and vessels. Furthermore, whereas CT examination is associated with x-ray&#xD;
      radiation and may miss early detection of stroke, MRI is associated with higher costs and is&#xD;
      not generally routinely and around-the clock available in all the hospitals. Both imaging&#xD;
      methods require transportation and intensive care of the often critically ill patients to the&#xD;
      scanning unit for each measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is unanimous agreement about the need for a bedside assessment of the status of tissue&#xD;
      perfusion. Invasive cerebral angiography is indicated in cases of further evaluation of&#xD;
      stroke causes and intended endovascular therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential of ultrasound perfusion imaging (UPI) What makes contrast enhanced UPI so valuable&#xD;
      is the possibility to repeatedly and non-invasively detect brain tissue at risk for&#xD;
      infarction by direct brain tissue perfusion assessment and not by surrogate parameters, like&#xD;
      blood flow velocity or vessel diameter. Because of the possibility to screen and repeatedly&#xD;
      measure the state of perfusion, the chances increase to diagnose and monitor ischemic stroke&#xD;
      and to define the appropriate window for treatment. The perfusion analysis would also allow&#xD;
      determination of treatment results and guidance of rapid and adequate further therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the present study is to assess whether cerebral hypoperfusion can be&#xD;
      detected by ultrasound perfusion imaging (UPI) before and after treatment of acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory ischemic stroke are evaluated for&#xD;
      potential thrombolysis/thrombectomy according to the Bernese neurologic stroke algorithm. An&#xD;
      experienced neurosonographer performs contrast-enhanced ultrasound perfusion imaging (UPI)&#xD;
      after prospective study enrollment and specific stroke CT/MRI with perfusion measurement.&#xD;
      Clinical status is documented by use of the NIHSS on admission /first day after the&#xD;
      intervention. UPI and CT/MRI perfusion data is analyzed. Two different quantification&#xD;
      algorithms, standard versus patient-adjusted, are used. Data is analyzed by descriptive&#xD;
      statistics using the mean, median and standard deviation of the ROIs. Sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity analyses are calculated using Pearson's chi-square test. Receiver-operator&#xD;
      characteristic curves are calculated for UPI/perfusion MRI/CT parameters. Pearson correlation&#xD;
      is used to evaluate correlations between absolute values of UPI and MRI TTP data.&#xD;
