  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the preferred procedure to investigate any large-bowel disease in adults and&#xD;
      children. In addition, colonoscopy is the current gold standard for colorectal cancer&#xD;
      screening due to its high diagnostic capabilities and its unique feature that permits&#xD;
      sampling and removal of pathology. For optimal performance and visualization of details,&#xD;
      however, an adequate bowel preparation is essential. Inadequate bowel preparation is&#xD;
      associated with cancelled procedures, prolonged procedure time, incomplete examination,&#xD;
      increased cost and possibly complications, physician frustration and patient anxiety, but&#xD;
      most importantly serving to impede colorectal cancer screening and surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A good bowel preparation would need a solution with a reasonable volume, acceptable taste,&#xD;
      minimal diet restrictions, and easy to follow instructions; and would also need patients'&#xD;
      adherence to the instructions and diet restrictions. Noncompliance of patients to the diet&#xD;
      restrictions, the starting day of diet, the timing of drinking the solution, and other&#xD;
      instructions play an important role in rendering the colon preparation inadequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The investigators aim, at assessing the influence of having a reminder mobile&#xD;
      application on the compliance and adherence to instructions and diet and consequently on the&#xD;
      quality of colon preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators' hypothesis is that patients having a customized mobile App&#xD;
      reminding them systematically about instruction and time of intake of the preparation will&#xD;
      have a better adherence to the prep protocol and likely on the quality preparation than those&#xD;
      given written and verbal instructions in clinic.&#xD;

      This is a randomized controlled trial that will include patients undergoing elective&#xD;
      colonoscopy at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      into one of two study arms using a computer generated randomization list. 160 patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled in total. All patients will be instructed by the study coordinator on the&#xD;
      importance of adherence to the protocol in the leaflet emphasizing its importance to the&#xD;
      colonoscopy quality. In addition, patients in Arm 2 will be given information about the&#xD;
      application features. The application will have push notifications to inform patient on time&#xD;
      of start of dietary changes, type of diet, time of preparing the solution, time of drinking&#xD;
      the solution, reminder of their appointment, etc. All patients will then be interviewed by&#xD;
      the research coordinator to evaluate the adherence to the assigned diet and compliance with&#xD;
      the prep protocol as the main outcome and the ease of the application and the patient's&#xD;
      attitude towards having such application as secondary outcomes. Based on the results of&#xD;
      similar studies that assessed the use of software system to improve compliance, the&#xD;
      investigators' sample size was a calculated assuming similar results. Calculations showed&#xD;
      that 78 patients per arm will be enough to attain significance. The number 80 was chosen as&#xD;
      attrition is presumed to be low. As for the statistical analysis, SPSS version 20.0 will be&#xD;
      used for data entry and analysis.&#xD;
