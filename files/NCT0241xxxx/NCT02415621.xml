  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abiraterone is approved in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      to treat metastatic prostate cancer at 1000 mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out if an on and off schedule of taking abiraterone&#xD;
      would prolong the participant's cancer's response to this drug and maintain their&#xD;
      functionality to perform their daily activities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, 10 black participants and 15 non-black participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      after achieving 50% or more decline of their prostatic specific antigen (PSA) while on&#xD;
      abiraterone for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer (mCRPC). Abiraterone will be stopped and will not be re-initiated until there&#xD;
      is 50% or more increase of the PSA. Each time abiraterone is stopped, it will be defined as&#xD;
      the start of a new adaptive therapy cycle. Participants who cannot achieve a 50% decline of&#xD;
      their PSA after restarting abiraterone will continue abiraterone until they develop&#xD;
      radiographic disease progression. If the decline in performance status does not occur at the&#xD;
      time of radiographic disease progression, participants will be followed until they develop&#xD;
      radiographic disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be terminated early if less than 3 of the first 10 enrolled participants can&#xD;
      complete 2 cycles of the adaptive abiraterone.&#xD;
