  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I study is to test the safety of different doses of specially&#xD;
      prepared immune cells (called &quot;T cells&quot;) collected from blood. The Investigators want to find&#xD;
      a safe dose of these modified T cells for patients who have malignant pleural disease. They&#xD;
      want to find out what effects these T cells have on the patient and the cancer (MPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 part of the study, the investigators will test the dose in combination with another&#xD;
      drug, pembrolizumab, to see what effects the study treatment has on malignant pleural&#xD;
      mesothelioma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalating, non randomized, single-center, phase I/II study of&#xD;
      mesothelin-targeted T cells administered intrapleurally as an infusion in patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis (histologically or cytologically documented) of MPD from mesothelioma, lung cancer,&#xD;
      or breast cancer. Patients receiving pembrolizumab in cohort 9 only includes patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of mesothelioma. The total number of patients studied will depend on the number of&#xD;
      dose levels tested, up to a maximum dose of 6×10^7 mesothelin-targeted T cells/kg or until&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. In Phase I of this study, we anticipate infusing&#xD;
      a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 54 evaluable patients. The total number of enrolled patients&#xD;
      in Phase II of this study depends on the number of observed responses and ranges from 13-21&#xD;
      evaluable patients, including 6 patients treated at the final dose in Phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who were treated and were removed from study, duplicate enrollment is permitted&#xD;
      if it is determined the patients could receive benefit. If the patients meet all eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, they may receive treatment in a higher dose level cohort. Patients who are&#xD;
      re-treated with CAR T cell therapy will not be considered new accruals. Outcomes of&#xD;
      re-treated patients will be analyzed separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may receive palliative radiotherapy for symptom management prior to or following the&#xD;
      CAR T cell infusion. If a patient receives palliative radiotherapy, the study PI, treating&#xD;
      Radiation Oncologist, and treating Medical Oncologist will decide whether to proceed with the&#xD;
      infusion. Palliative radiotherapy must be completed at least 2 days prior to the&#xD;
      administration of cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in cohort 9 and in the Phase II portion of the study will begin treatment with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab 4 weeks (+3/-1 week window) after completing CAR T cell administration.&#xD;
      Patients will receive 3 doses of pembrolizumab given on a recurring schedule followed by&#xD;
      reassessment. Patients responding or deriving clinical benefit, without unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, will be followed for up to 6 months after the first dose of pembrolizumab and may&#xD;
      continue pembrolizumab. Patients who cannot receive all 6 doses of pembrolizumab at MSK will&#xD;
      be followed and medical records including images will be obtained from the treating&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;

Thirty to 60 minutes before T cell infusion, patients will be given 650 mg of acetaminophen orally and 25- 50 mg of diphenhydramine orally or intravenously, to prevent infusion-related reactions. The genetically modified T cells will be infused for at least 15 minutes and no more than 2 hours through the indwelling pleural catheter depending on the volume of the T cells. A physician will be available during the infusion. Please note, during formulation of iCasp9M28z T cells, under or over estimation of CAR modified T Cells may occur. Patient may receive an altered fractionation of the total dose or up to 35% over or under total cell dose with approval of the PI. Patients who do not have enough cells to match the current dose cohort will be treated in the cohort in which they have cells available</description>
