    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV open-label randomized clinical trial that will compare intestinal and&#xD;
      humoral immunity in infants receiving inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) and two or three&#xD;
      doses of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of polio vaccination is to protect the individual from paralytic disease (humoral&#xD;
      immunity) and to prevent transmission of poliovirus (intestinal immunity). Inactivated&#xD;
      poliovirus vaccine (IPV) induces humoral (systemic) immunity to all three types of poliovirus&#xD;
      (1, 2 and 3), protecting individuals from developing paralytic polio when exposed to wild&#xD;
      type poliovirus. However, it induces little intestinal immunity. Intestinal immunity inhibits&#xD;
      poliovirus replication thereby reducing the quantity and duration of poliovirus excretion in&#xD;
      stool. This is critical in preventing the spread of poliovirus to others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral polio vaccines are live attenuated vaccines and trivalent OPV (tOPV) is a mixture of&#xD;
      poliovirus strains type 1, 2 and 3. Like IPV, OPV induces humoral immunity and is more&#xD;
      effective than IPV at inducing intestinal immunity. In most developing countries, routine&#xD;
      childhood immunization for poliovirus consists of three doses of tOPV at 6, 10 and 14 weeks&#xD;
      of age and may also include a birth dose of tOPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important limitation is that the vaccine virus in OPV can mutate and acquire&#xD;
      neurovirulence causing paralysis either due to vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) or&#xD;
      due to circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs), in which the attenuated vaccine&#xD;
      virus not only acquires the ability to cause paralysis but can also circulate similarly to&#xD;
      wild poliovirus (WPV). The potential of vaccine virus to acquire neurovirulence and cause&#xD;
      paralytic poliomyelitis is incompatible with eradication of polio. Therefore, polio&#xD;
      eradication will require eventual cessation of all OPVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last case of WPV type 2 was reported in 1999 in India. Type 2 vaccine virus in tOPV is&#xD;
      most likely to cause cVDPVs and over 80% of cVDPVs over the past decade have been cVDPV2. Of&#xD;
      the estimated 250-500 annual VAPP cases, almost 40% are due to type 2. Thus, with the&#xD;
      eradication of WPV2 it is imperative to prioritize removal of type 2 containing OPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The licensing and availability of bOPV containing type 1 and 3 offers the option of an OPV&#xD;
      that does not contain OPV2. In April 2013, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on&#xD;
      Immunization (SAGE) recommended phased cessation of OPVs starting with the switch from tOPV&#xD;
      to bOPV. After the switch, bOPV is expected to be administered at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age,&#xD;
      the typical routine poliovirus immunization schedule in developing countries for tOPV.&#xD;
      Additionally, at least one dose of IPV was recommended to prevent rapid rise in type 2&#xD;
      susceptibility in the birth cohorts born after the switch to bOPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has advocated for administration of at least&#xD;
      one dose of IPV and delaying the dose to 14 weeks of age to decrease interference by maternal&#xD;
      antibodies and provide the highest seroconversion possible with a single dose of IPV in the&#xD;
      Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) schedule. The GPEI position of introducing only one&#xD;
      dose of IPV at 14 weeks of age is principally based on findings from a trial in Cuba that&#xD;
      reported type 2 seroconversion of 63% with a single dose of IPV given at 16 weeks of age. The&#xD;
      current schedule of Bangladesh is tOPV at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age with IPV also at 14 weeks&#xD;
      of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the addition of IPV to the routine immunization schedule, children will&#xD;
      receive four doses of the polio vaccine (three bOPV and one IPV) but are four doses&#xD;
      necessary? Could IPV administered with a reduced number of bOPV doses still lead to&#xD;
      protective levels of humoral and intestinal immunity? Previous studies in the US and UK&#xD;
      suggest that two doses of OPV given with one or two doses of IPV induces protective levels of&#xD;
      humoral and intestinal immunity comparable to three doses of tOPV. Furthermore, a recent&#xD;
      study in Bangladesh found that there were no significant differences in type 1 or 3&#xD;
      seroconversion proportions among children on a three-dose bOPV schedule versus a fractional&#xD;
      IPV (f-IPV)/bOPV schedule (two f-IPV, one bOPV). Although there were significant differences&#xD;
      in vaccine virus excretion among children who received only bOPV compared to f-IPV/bOPV to&#xD;
      type 1 and 3, this difference could have been diminished if a second dose of bOPV was given&#xD;
      instead of f-IPV .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, there has been interest in whether a VAPP-protective schedule could mount&#xD;
      protective levels of immunity in individuals. A VAPP-protective schedule is the&#xD;
      administration of IPV as the first dose of poliovirus vaccination. The risk of VAPP is&#xD;
      highest with the first dose of OPV and diminishes with subsequent OPV administrations. There&#xD;
      is no risk of VAPP when IPV is given as the first dose because the vaccine uses killed virus.&#xD;
      The rationale behind the VAPP-protective schedule is that individuals would have prior&#xD;
      exposure to types 1, 2, and 3 through IPV before their first bOPV administration, thereby&#xD;
      decreasing the risk for VAPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators of this trial will assess if a reduced number of bOPV doses given with a dose&#xD;
      of IPV confers a protective level of immunity against polio by examining the intestinal and&#xD;
      humoral immunity induced by two different bOPV/IPV VAPP-protective sequential schedules among&#xD;
      infants in Bangladesh. Specially, investigators will examine the proportion of seroconversion&#xD;
      and vaccine virus excretion in children who receive an IPV dose at 6 weeks of age and bOPV at&#xD;
      6, 10 and 14 weeks of age in comparison to children who receive an IPV dose at 6 weeks of age&#xD;
      and bOPV only at 10 and 14 weeks of age.&#xD;
