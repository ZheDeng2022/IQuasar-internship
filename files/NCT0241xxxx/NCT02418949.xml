    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a new rehabilitation approach for stroke survivors in the chronic phase&#xD;
      of recovery in which the combination of drug therapy (cyproheptadine) and active movement&#xD;
      practice (AMP) is used to encourage increased voluntary muscle control and strength.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this four arm parallel design you will be randomly assigned to one of 4 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1) cyproheptadine and active movement therapy, Group 2) placebo and active movement&#xD;
      therapy, Group 3) cyproheptadine and passive stretching, or Group 4) placebo and passive&#xD;
      stretching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The groups will be blinded so neither you nor the research staff (or even the study doctor)&#xD;
      will know which drug (Cyproheptadine or placebo) you receive. Only the RIC pharmacist will&#xD;
      have access to this information until all participants complete the entire study. Although&#xD;
      you and the research staff administering the training sessions will know if you have been&#xD;
      assigned to the active movement practice (AMP) or passive cyclical stretching group, it is&#xD;
      important not to discuss this information with the rater (evaluator) or the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyproheptadine is an anti-serotonergic and anti spastic agent. It is expected to reduce the&#xD;
      unwanted muscle hyper excitability (one measure of spasticity) common after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the treatment you will be required to make several visits per week to&#xD;
      RIC to either be evaluated or participate in the treatment sessions. Evaluations last&#xD;
      approximately 2 hours and will be performed at the beginning of weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4, during&#xD;
      the middle of treatment (beginning of week 7), at the end of training (beginning of week 10)&#xD;
      as well as a final follow-up visit one month after the end of treatment (beginning of week&#xD;
      14). The training sessions will occur from weeks 4 through week 9 and will involve 1.5-hr.&#xD;
      sessions (1 hr training plus setup time) 3 times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the group receiving the combined cyproheptadine and active&#xD;
      movement therapy will have better outcomes than the groups receiving cyproheptadine or active&#xD;
      movement therapy alone.&#xD;

          <description>Cyproheptadine will be titrated up to the chronic dose prior to involvement in hand therapy.&#xD;
Week 1 dose: 4mg taken twice daily (orally) Week 2 dose: 8mg taken twice daily (orally) Week 3 dose: (chronic dose): 8 mg taken three times daily (orally). Chronic dose will be maintained throughout the 6 weeks of Active movement practice (AMP) treatment (1 hour sessions 3x/week).

Cyproheptadine: Cyproheptadine will be titrated up to the chronic dose prior to involvement in hand therapy as well as gradually down to zero in the two weeks following treatment.&#xD;
Week 1 dose: 4mg taken twice daily (orally) Week 2 dose: 8mg taken twice daily (orally) Week 3 dose: (chronic dose): 8 mg taken three times daily (orally).

          <title>Chedoke McMaster Scale of Hand</title>
          <description>The Chedoke McMaster Stroke Assessment is comprised of 6 impairment inventories, which can be administered individually. Hand Impairment is scored on a 7-point scale with each point corresponding to seven stages of motor recovery. Higher scores indicate better motor recovery post-stroke. Stage 2 is indicated as spasticity presented as resistance to passive movement. Stage 3 shows marked spasticity but with voluntary movement of the fingers.</description>

          <title>Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment</title>
          <description>The Fugl-Meyer (FM) Assessment of Motor Recovery evaluates and measures recovery in post-stroke hemiplegic patients. The FM uses a 3-point ordinal scale from 0 (cannot perform) to 2 (performs fully). The FM has 5 domains with a maximum score of 226 points. Subscales can be administered with out using the full FM. The Upper Extremity component consists of 33 items with a score range of 0-66. A higher score indicates better performance.</description>

          <description>Cyproheptadine will be titrated up to the chronic dose prior to involvement in hand therapy.&#xD;
Week 1 dose: 4mg taken twice daily (orally) Week 2 dose: 8mg taken twice daily (orally) Week 3 dose: (chronic dose): 8 mg taken three times daily (orally). Chronic dose will be maintained throughout the 6 weeks of Active movement practice (AMP) treatment (1 hour sessions 3x/week). Dose will be titrated down to zero in the 2 weeks following treatment.&#xD;
Cyproheptadine: Cyproheptadine will be titrated up to the chronic dose prior to involvement in hand therapy as well as gradually down to zero in the two weeks following treatment.&#xD;
Week 1 dose: 4mg taken twice daily (orally) Week 2 dose: 8mg taken twice daily (orally) Week 3 dose: (chronic dose): 8 mg taken three times daily (orally). Week 4-9: (chronic dose): 8 mg taken three times daily (orally). Week 10: 8 mg taken twice daily (orally). Week 11: 4 mg taken twice daily (orally). Week 12: no drug&#xD;
Active Movement Practice (AMP): Participants will alternate between active training with a custom video game and a robot active-assistive Voice and EMG-Driven Actuated (VAEDA) glove during active training occupational therapy.</description>

Week 1 dose: 4mg taken twice daily (orally) Week 2 dose: 8mg taken twice daily (orally) Week 3 dose: (chronic dose): 8 mg taken three times daily (orally). Chronic dose will be maintained throughout the 6 weeks of passive cyclical stretching treatment (1 hour sessions 3x/week).

Passive Cyclical Stretching: Participants will wear the actuated device/glove for the duration of the training sessions (2 20-min stints followed by 10 min of rest) during which time the actuated glove will cyclically stretch the joints of the digits in the hand between flexion and extension while remaining passive/relaxed.</description>
