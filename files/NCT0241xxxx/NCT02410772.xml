    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether one or two four-month regimens of&#xD;
      tuberculosis treatment are as effective as a standard six-month regimen for treatment of&#xD;
      pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). All three regimens are administered daily, seven days each week,&#xD;
      with direct observation of each dose by a health-care worker at least five of the seven days&#xD;
      of each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard six-month regimen is two months of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and&#xD;
      pyrazinamide followed by four months of isoniazid and rifampin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first short regimen is a single substitution of rifapentine for rifampin: two months of&#xD;
      isoniazid, rifapentine, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, followed by two months of isoniazid and&#xD;
      rifapentine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second short regimen is a double substitution of rifapentine for rifampin and&#xD;
      moxifloxacin for ethambutol: two months of isoniazid, rifapentine, moxifloxacin, and&#xD;
      pyrazinamide, followed by two months of isoniazid, rifapentine, and moxifloxacin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target enrollment is 2500 participants. Each study participant will remain in the study for&#xD;
      18 months in order to include at least 12 months of evaluation of whether the participant's&#xD;
      TB recurs.&#xD;

      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifapentine-containing treatment shortening regimens for pulmonary tuberculosis: a&#xD;
      randomized, open-label, controlled, phase 3 clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Seventeen (17) week rifapentine-based regimen In previously untreated individuals with&#xD;
      active drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis treated with eight weeks of rifapentine (P),&#xD;
      isoniazid (H), pyrazinamide (Z) and ethambutol (E) followed by nine weeks of rifapentine plus&#xD;
      isoniazid, all given daily throughout, the proportion of participants who experience absence&#xD;
      of cure (unfavorable outcome) will not be inferior to that observed in participants who are&#xD;
      treated with a standard regimen (eight weeks of rifampin (R), isoniazid, pyrazinamide and&#xD;
      ethambutol followed by eighteen weeks of rifampin plus isoniazid), all given daily&#xD;
      throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Seventeen (17) week rifapentine- plus moxifloxacin-containing regimen In previously&#xD;
      untreated individuals with active drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis treated with eight&#xD;
      weeks of rifapentine, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and moxifloxacin (M), followed by nine weeks of&#xD;
      rifapentine, isoniazid, and moxifloxacin, all given daily throughout, the proportion of&#xD;
      participants who experience absence of cure (unfavorable outcome) will not be inferior to&#xD;
      that observed in participants who are treated with a standard regimen (eight weeks of&#xD;
      rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol followed by eighteen weeks of rifampin plus&#xD;
      isoniazid), all given daily throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This will be an international, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label,&#xD;
      3-arm, phase 3 non-inferiority trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Sites: Multiple international sites, primarily sites of the Tuberculosis Trials&#xD;
      Consortium and the AIDS Clinical Trials Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Duration per participant is approximately 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Agent or Intervention: After written informed consent, participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive one of the following oral regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen 1 (control regimen): 2RHZE/4RH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eight weeks of daily treatment with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol,&#xD;
           followed by&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eighteen weeks of daily treatment with rifampin and isoniazid&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen 2 (investigational regimen): 2PHZE/2PH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eight weeks of daily treatment with rifapentine, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and&#xD;
           ethambutol, followed by&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nine weeks of daily treatment with rifapentine and isoniazid&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen 3 (investigational regimen): 2PHZM/2PHM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eight weeks of daily treatment with rifapentine, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and&#xD;
           moxifloxacin, followed by&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nine weeks of daily treatment with rifapentine, isoniazid, and moxifloxacin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of a rifapentine-containing regimen to determine whether the&#xD;
           single substitution of rifapentine for rifampin makes it possible to reduce to seventeen&#xD;
           weeks the duration of treatment for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of a rifapentine-containing regimen that in addition&#xD;
           substitutes moxifloxacin for ethambutol and continues moxifloxacin during the&#xD;
           continuation phase to determine whether it is possible to reduce to seventeen weeks the&#xD;
           duration of treatment for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of the investigational regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the tolerability of the investigational regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect and store biospecimens from consenting participants for the purpose of future&#xD;
           research on discovery and validation of TB biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the correlation of mycobacterial and clinical markers with time to culture&#xD;
           conversion, culture status at completion of eight weeks of treatment, treatment failure,&#xD;
           and relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To conduct a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study of the test drugs. The main&#xD;
           objectives of the PK/PD study are to characterize study drug PK parameters and to&#xD;
           determine relationships between treatment outcomes and PK parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz-based antiretroviral treatment among&#xD;
           patients with TB/HIV co-infection taking efavirenz-based combination antiretroviral&#xD;
           therapy and TB treatment with rifapentine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy: TB disease-free survival at twelve months after study treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety: Proportion of participants with grade 3 or higher adverse events during study&#xD;
           drug treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TB disease-free survival at eighteen months after study treatment assignment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to stable sputum culture conversion (solid and liquid media considered separately)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Speed of decline of sputum viable bacilli by automated liquid MGIT culture days to&#xD;
           detection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of participants who are culture negative at completion of eight weeks of&#xD;
           treatment (solid and liquid media considered separately)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensitivity analyses assuming all participants classified as 'not assessable' have a&#xD;
           favorable outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discontinuation of assigned treatment for a reason other than microbiological&#xD;
           ineligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated steady state efavirenz PK parameters including mid-dosing interval&#xD;
