  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with stage IV&#xD;
      inflammatory breast cancer or triple-negative breast cancer that has spread to other places&#xD;
      in the body (metastatic) or has come back (recurrent), and who have achieved clinical&#xD;
      response or stable disease to prior chemotherapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as a single agent in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) and non-IBC triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the association between biomarkers in the peripheral blood and tumor&#xD;
      tissue, such as PD-L1 expression, with safety and efficacy for IBC or non-IBC TNBC patients&#xD;
      treated with MK-3475.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the disease control rate of metastatic IBC or non-IBC TNBC patients who have&#xD;
      achieved clinical response or stable disease to the systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate the association between biomarkers and efficacy by ribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (RNA)-sequencing of exosomes in blood and tumor for IBC or non-IBC TNBC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 30 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at approximately 1 and 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of disease control</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the percentage of patients either with measurable disease that maintain immune complete response (iCR), immune partial response, immune stable disease (iSD), or with non-measurable disease that achieve iCR or iSD, by 4 months or more in all evaluable patients. A disease control rate of 10% or lower will be considered treatment failure and the regimen will be rejected under this circumstance. A 95% exact binomial confidence interval on disease control rate will be computed. Will also perform secondary analysis on intent-to-treat patient population where those patients who drop out early will be considered as progression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biomarker analyses</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation among biomarkers at baseline in each specimen and between different specimens will be assessed. The association among various continuous and discrete biomarkers or disease status groups will be assessed by the exploratory data analysis using scatter plot matrix, box plots, BLiP plot and trellis plot, etc, and may be tested by t-test/analysis of variance/Wilcoxon rank sun test/Kruskal-Wallis test, whichever is appropriate. Correlation between continuous biomarkers will be examined by Pearson or Spearman rank correlation coefficients.</description>
