      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of ofatumomab in&#xD;
      combination with ICE chemotherapy in subjects with relapsed/refractory DLBCL following&#xD;
      failure to combination rituximab and anthracycline based chemotherapy. Participants with the&#xD;
      option of potentially curative stem cell therapy may proceed to high dose chemotherapy and&#xD;
      stem cell rescue. Participants with disease not considered curable with stem cell therapy,&#xD;
      ineligible for or decline stem cell therapy may receive up to a maximum of 6 cycles of study&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, single-arm, non randomized, safety and efficacy study of ofatumumab in&#xD;
      combination with salvage ICE chemotherapy (O-ICE) in 61 subjects with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      aggressive B cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      O-ICE would be administered as an inpatient. The cycles are administered at 3 weeks intervals&#xD;
      for ICE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects who are candidates for high dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell&#xD;
      rescue (ASCR) would receive one or two more cycle of ICE salvage chemotherapy with ofatumumab&#xD;
      before stem cell mobilization. G-CSF at 10 ug/kg per day after the third or forth cycle of&#xD;
      treatment (at the discretion of the treating physician) would be administered until the end&#xD;
      of leukapheresis for stem cell mobilization. After the third or forth cycle of salvage&#xD;
      chemotherapy, leukapheresis was initiated until a collection of more than 5 x 106 CD34&#xD;
      cells/kg white blood or 5 procedures were performed, whichever occurred first. Collection of&#xD;
      &lt;2x106 CD34+ cells/kg from peripheral blood will be considered mobilization failure for the&#xD;
      purposes of the study. Leukapheresis and cryopreservation will be performed according to&#xD;
      hospital practice. High dose chemotherapy will be administered as per our institution's&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects who are not candidates for HDC and ASCR would receive at most 6 cycles of&#xD;
      salvage chemotherapy with ofatumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who progressed on treatment would be taken off study protocol.&#xD;
