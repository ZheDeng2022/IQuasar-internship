  <brief_summary>

      The goal of the proposed project is to determine if providing an intervention for women who&#xD;
      decline the invitation to participate in standard cardiac rehabilitation programs (CRPs) will&#xD;
      ultimately result in an increase their participation in CRPs.This study will evaluate&#xD;
      outcomes of patients randomized to the FHHS STEP Program versus by non-STEP Program&#xD;
      participants. The overall goal is to provide an alternate, introductory program that will&#xD;
      engage, educate, and empower women following a cardiac event. Providing these women with the&#xD;
      necessary personal resources will encourage and enable these women to take the step towards a&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation program, which, in turn will ideally lead to a life-long commitment to&#xD;
      heart health.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation programs (CRPs) have been shown to improve outcomes following a&#xD;
      cardiac event. Referrals to the CRP are a standard part of the community-based continuing&#xD;
      care process within the Winnipeg region, to include automatic referrals for hospitalized&#xD;
      patients, based on specific criteria, physician referrals and self-referrals. However, fewer&#xD;
      women than men are referred to and participate in CRPs in Winnipeg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' study is unique in that the investigators plan to capture those women who&#xD;
      may not be ready to change or participate in a traditional CRP. While women who are in the&#xD;
      pre-contemplative or contemplative stages of change may not be ready to participate in a&#xD;
      standard CRP, they may be willing to explore a complementary opportunity: the FHHS STEP&#xD;
      Program. The overall goal of this project is to provide a collaborative team environment that&#xD;
      will engage women; educate, and empower women; and provide women with the necessary personal&#xD;
      resources to enable them to take the step towards a cardiac rehabilitation program and a&#xD;
      life-long commitment to heart health. The investigators' 2-group randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      will compare physiological and psychosocial outcomes among women completing a 12-week gender&#xD;
      specific introduction to cardiac rehabilitation with non-program attenders.&#xD;
