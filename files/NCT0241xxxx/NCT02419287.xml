      Study Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crizotinib is a selective ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met/HGFR and ALK&#xD;
      receptor tyrosine kinases and their oncogenic variants (eg. c-Met/HGFR mutations or NPM-ALK&#xD;
      fusion protein). Consistent with this mechanism of action, Crizotinib inhibited&#xD;
      phosphorylation of c-Met/HGFR and NPM-ALK and their kinase target dependent functions in&#xD;
      tumour cells both in vitro and in vivo. This compound will be clinically evaluated in&#xD;
      oncology indications in which c-Met/HGFR or NPM-ALK are dysregulated including, but not&#xD;
      limited to renal, lung, gastric, brain, prostate, head, and neck cancers, multiple myeloma,&#xD;
      and selected lymphomas. Crizotinib demonstrated preclinical antitumour activity, including&#xD;
      marked cytoreduction, in several tumour models that expressed activated c-Met/HGFR or&#xD;
      NPM-ALK, supporting the rationale for study in clinical trials. Collective PK/PD modelling&#xD;
      and efficacy data demonstrated that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. near complete inhibition (free plasma IC90) of c-Met/HGFR activity during the entire&#xD;
           dosing interval was necessary to achieve robust antitumour effect, as it was&#xD;
           demonstrated several years ago for imatinib;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the target efficacious free plasma concentration range was determined to be 8.1 to 12.8&#xD;
           nM (3.7 to 5.8 ng/mL). The projected efficacious dose in humans is estimated to be 70 to&#xD;
           100 mg once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional safety and efficacy data presented at the 2010 ASCO meeting (Tan et al., Bang et&#xD;
      al.) confirmed these data: plasma concentrations exceeding efficacious levels were obtained&#xD;
      in patients receiving at least 100 mg/day of crizotinib; in addition objective tumour&#xD;
      regressions were observed in &gt;50% of 82 advanced lung cancer patients whose tumours were&#xD;
      positive for the EML4/ALK fusion. Therefore the treatment of ALK+ lymphomas with crizotinib&#xD;
      represents a rational attempt at treating a human cancer through the inactivation of its&#xD;
      oncogenic mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When administered to 11 patients affected by relapsed resistant ALK+ lymphomas, crizotinib&#xD;
      obtained an Overall Response Rate (ORR) of 10/11 (91%) which included 9 Complete Responses&#xD;
      (CR, 82%) and 1 Partial Response. Disease status at the latest follow-up (June 2013) is as&#xD;
      follows: 4 CR (months 17+, 26+, 31+, 36+) and 3 deaths due to progression; 1 patient in CR&#xD;
      after crizotinib who received alloBMT and 2 patients (treated post alloBMT) are still in CR&#xD;
      but they stopped crizotinib; 1 patient is in CR under brentuximab. Progression Free Survival&#xD;
      (PSF) and Overall Survival rates at 3 years are 63.6% and 72.7%. Crizotinib exerted a potent&#xD;
      antitumor activity in advanced ALK+ lymphoma and produced durable responses in this&#xD;
      population of heavily pre-treated patients. In addition this study demonstrated that&#xD;
      PCR-based detection of the NPM-ALK fusion in the peripheral blood may be an effective method&#xD;
      to monitor disease response and progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although crizotinib shows activity, relapses occur typically within 5 months after starting&#xD;
      treatment and were supported by mutations like I1171N.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary Define the objective response rates (ORR) and duration of it in subjects&#xD;
      with ALK+ lymphomas resistant or refractory to standard cytotoxic treatment, according to&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in ALK+ lymphoma&#xD;
           patients treated with crizotinib, that are resistant or refractory to standard cytotoxic&#xD;
           treatment. Determine the toxicity profile of crizotinib in ALK+ lymphoma patients&#xD;
           resistant or refractory to standard cytotoxic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the Quality of Life (QoL) in this population of patients using the the EORTC -&#xD;
           C30 Quality of Life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the molecular mechanism of resistance to crizotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a phase II study open to 12 eligible patients with anaplastic large cell&#xD;
      lymphoma with a confirmed ALK rearrangement. Enrollment will start in February 2015 and it&#xD;
      will last 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients must have been pretreated with at least one line of standard cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy and they must have demonstrated progression (regardless of initial response) on&#xD;
      the last treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject selection Before any clinical procedure, patients will sign the Informed Consent.&#xD;
      Every patients included in this protocols will have to respect all inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure The study begins with a screening period to assess eligibility, up to and&#xD;
      including 28 days prior to the first dose of crizotinib. The treatment period begins on Day 1&#xD;
      of Cycle 1. Assessments of tumor response will be performed after 1 month, 2 months (only&#xD;
      Q-RT-PCR for NPM/ALK), 3 months and then every 12 weeks, starting from the first day of&#xD;
      treatment with crizotinib. After 1 year of treatment, assessments will be collected every six&#xD;
      months. From the beginning of the third year, assessments will be performed yearly till the&#xD;
      end of the study. Clinical, laboratory assessments, Quantitative Real-Time PCR (Q-RT-PCR) and&#xD;
      tumor imaging will be performed as described in Appendix 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will continue until patient experiences unacceptable toxicity or progressive&#xD;
      disease (PD), starts a new anti-cancer therapy or dies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient discontinues from study treatment an EOT visit must be performed within 7&#xD;
      days of the last dose of crizotinib. Patients will be contacted for the safety with a&#xD;
      follow-up 30 days after their last dose of crizotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow up phase, patients will be contacted once a year to obtain information&#xD;
      pertaining to survival status until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent to&#xD;
      survival follow-up, or the end of the study. Patients do not need to visit the clinic during&#xD;
      the survival follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatment Patients will receive crizotinib at the dose of 250 mg BID administered&#xD;
      orally. Crizotinib will be taken at approximately the same time each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of toxicity, it is possible to proceed to a dose reduction or a temporary&#xD;
      interruption of crizotinib according with the attached table (Appendix 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No dose escalation is scheduled. The metabolism of crizotinib is predominantly mediated by&#xD;
      the CYP3A isozymes in human liver microsomes and hepatocytes. Co-administration with drugs&#xD;
      that are CYP3A inhibitors and inducers may change plasma concentration of crizotinib in&#xD;
      humans. Concomitant use of potent CYP3A inhibitors or inducers are not allowed.&#xD;
