  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The events that underlie the conversion from Psoriasis to Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) are not&#xD;
      well understood. This conversion occurs 30% of the time within the first 10 years of&#xD;
      psoriasis diagnosis. PsA patients have about a 50% chance of developing joint damage within&#xD;
      the first 2 years of disease. A biomarker that identifies subclinical joint inflammation in&#xD;
      psoriasis patients would allow for a diagnostic tool to allow for earlier intervention in&#xD;
      psoriasis patients and provide a better understanding of the underlying molecular&#xD;
      pathogenesis that may lead to development of new therapeutic targets in PsA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our long-term goals are to: 1) develop arthritis biomarkers in psoriasis patients that will&#xD;
      facilitate early treatment interventions; and, 2) identify new therapeutic targets in PsA&#xD;
      through better understanding of the underlying molecular pathogenesis. PsA, an inflammatory&#xD;
      arthritis associated with psoriasis, affects approximately 650,000 adults in the United&#xD;
      States and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Joint inflammation and&#xD;
      damage arise within the first 2 years of disease in 50% of patients who manifest bone&#xD;
      erosions and joint space narrowing on plain x-rays. The advent of Tumor Necrosis Factor&#xD;
      antagonists (TNFi) for treatment of PsA has dramatically improved clinical response and&#xD;
      slowed bone and cartilage degradation. Nevertheless, up to 45% of patients do not meet&#xD;
      primary endpoints in clinical trials, which underscores the need for new therapeutic options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another approach to improve treatment response is early PsA diagnosis, and recent data&#xD;
      indicate that treatment soon after disease onset can improve outcomes. Relevant to the&#xD;
      potential for early intervention and prevention, psoriatic skin plaques typically precede PsA&#xD;
      by 10 years. Moreover, a significant percentage of these psoriasis patients have subclinical&#xD;
      musculoskeletal imaging findings. These findings provide an unparalleled opportunity for&#xD;
      early intervention that could potentially limit or halt joint inflammation and damage.&#xD;
      Regrettably, despite the obvious advantages of early diagnosis and treatment, this goal&#xD;
      remains elusive because the clinical significance of imaging abnormalities in psoriasis&#xD;
      remains unknown. Furthermore, investigators have limited understanding of the mechanisms that&#xD;
      underlie the transition from psoriasis to PsA, and investigators lack the disease specific&#xD;
      biomarkers necessary to identify psoriasis patients with new onset arthritis or sub-clinical&#xD;
      disease. Lastly, up to a third of psoriasis patients with moderate to severe skin disease&#xD;
      report they are undertreated and many are on topical agents unlikely to have a significant&#xD;
      effect on subclinical or clinically apparent joint inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 150 subjects will be consented and studied in this cross-sectional study - 125 subjects&#xD;
      with Psoriasis (Ps) and 25 Healthy controls. Power Doppler Ultrasound (PDUS) in joints and&#xD;
      entheses will be analyzed to find at least 35 subjects with positive US findings defined as&#xD;
      synovitis, effusion, joint erosions, or increased vascularity otherwise known as a signal. Up&#xD;
      to 50 Ps patients with positive PDUS results will be followed prospectively and contacted at&#xD;
      intervals to update medication history indefinitely. Ps patients will be asked for a follow&#xD;
      up PDUS 4 months post start of biologic, DMARD therapy or phototherapy if the patient decides&#xD;
      to go on such therapies to study longitudinally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 bone marrow aspirations on healthy and PDUS positive Psoriasis subjects will be&#xD;
      performed. A bone marrow aspiration post start of biologic or DMARD standard of care therapy&#xD;
      will be assessed as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research assays: serum will be used to measure biomarker 14-3-3η levels, which may be&#xD;
      analyzed by an external company. Peripheral blood will be used to measure the frequency of&#xD;
      DC-STAMP+ cells (CD14+DC-STAMP+ CD4+DCSTAMP+DC-STAMP+IL-17+). Using multichromatic flow&#xD;
      cytometry, we will measure DC-STAMP expression on peripheral blood cells and on bone marrow&#xD;
      cells. To determine if elevated BM DC-STAMP expression by stromal cells, T cells and/or&#xD;
      monocytes promotes OC formation, co-cultures of bone marrow stromal and hematopoietic cells&#xD;
      with peripheral blood cells will be analyzed for OCPs.&#xD;
