    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to use an herbal eye drop, Euphrasia, aka Eyebright, for&#xD;
      post-operative inflammation for Peripheral Laser Iridotomy for the treatment of narrow angle&#xD;
      glaucoma. A peripheral Laser Iridotomy is a simple laser procedure with few complications if&#xD;
      the patient follows the post-operative instructions. In this procedure, a blue-green Argon&#xD;
      laser is used to create an orifice in the iris to open the angle by allowing the aqueous from&#xD;
      behind the iris to enter the anterior chamber. Rarely the procedure needs to be repeated. The&#xD;
      main complications from this surgery are postoperative inflammation, bleeding, and&#xD;
      postoperative pressure spikes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be using Weleda's Euphrasia D3 eye drops. The investigators plan to do&#xD;
      a double blinded randomized control trial to objectively measure ocular inflammation in the&#xD;
      same process that was used for the steroid eye drops that are currently out on the market.&#xD;
      Some patients will be receiving steroids, prednisolone acetate, others, the herbal eye drop.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Status post Peripheral Laser Iridotomy Beraja Medical Institute has guidelines for the use of&#xD;
      steroids after a Peripheral Laser Iridotomy. Patients are normally given prednisolone acetate&#xD;
      ophthalmic solution, USP 1.0% to be used four times a day for seven days after the surgery.&#xD;
      This protocol will also be used for the Euphrasia drops. This will help us compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of the drugs as well as maintain a double blinded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given blank bottles with only an ID number containing either prednisolone&#xD;
      acetate or the Euphrasia eye drop. Bottles will be numbered sequentially by the Larkin&#xD;
      Community Hospital pharmacy resident once the drops have been transferred by her and records&#xD;
      of which bottles contain which drops will then be stored on the local intranet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given the exact same instructions as well as the instruction to come in/call&#xD;
      the on-call resident immediately if there are any adverse side effects, and explained that&#xD;
      the most common of which are expected to be signs of inflammation or allergy to the&#xD;
      medication. The symptoms that the patients will be advised to call in for will be: redness,&#xD;
      swelling, burning or itching lasting more than a few minutes, decrease/loss of vision lasting&#xD;
      more than a few minutes. The phone number for the on-call resident is in the consent form.&#xD;
      The patient will be given another copy of the consent form, if they do not have it, with the&#xD;
      phone number of the on-call resident highlighted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up by a resident ophthalmologist on days eight and fifteen&#xD;
      post-operatively to measure anterior chamber cell clearing and pain. The resident will only&#xD;
      know which number bottle was used, not the drops in the bottleThe resident will also be&#xD;
      measuring intraocular pressure, using a Goldman tonometer, and noting any other adverse&#xD;
      effects or change in medication or dosing.Goldman tonometers are the most common way that an&#xD;
      ophthalmologist checks a patient's intraocular pressure. It is done by using a topical&#xD;
      anesthetic and dye instilled onto the cornea. The resident then places the Goldman tonometer&#xD;
      onto the cornea, using a slit lamp, and measures the intraocular pressure. An attending&#xD;
      ophthalmologist will recheck all findings and intervene, if necessary. These days and&#xD;
      measures of efficacy are being used because these are the days and efficacy measures that&#xD;
      were used to determine efficacy of multiple different steroid eye drops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to determine if Euphrasia eye drops are, at the very least,&#xD;
      non-inferior to steroids in controlling intraocular inflammation in the post-operative period&#xD;
      after peripheral laser iridotomy used in the treatment of narrow angle glaucoma. Euphrasia&#xD;
      has been used for centuries for treating conjunctivitis, but there is no standardized method&#xD;
      for delivery and very few other studies to prove its efficacy. Currently, steroid eye drops&#xD;
      are the first choice to reduce intraocular inflammation. They are used after surgery,&#xD;
      uveitis, and certain forms of conjunctivitis. The biggest problem with steroids is that some&#xD;
      patients are &quot;steroid responders.&quot; These individuals respond to the steroids by having a very&#xD;
      large increase in their intraocular pressure which can lead to optic nerve damage. Up to 4%&#xD;
      of patients who use steroids can have spikes in their pressures of up to 31mmHg, where normal&#xD;
      intraocular pressure is 21 or less. These side effects can occur in as little of 5 days of&#xD;
      taking the steroid eye drops. Other, less common side effects are: cataracts, exacerbation of&#xD;
      bacterial/viral infections, ptosis, mydriasis, scleral melting, and eyelid skin atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a recent shift in the American public to wanting to use herbal supplements and&#xD;
      medications, it is very important to have clinical studies done to prove the efficacy of this&#xD;
      herb. It is also important to be able to give the public a treatment that has been proven to&#xD;
      work and is compounded safely and reproducibly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two previous studies that were done in Germany, that have shown both the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of Euphrasia when used topically to treat inflammatory conditions of the eye (Stoss,&#xD;
      M et.al. &quot;Prospective Cohort Trial of Euphrasia Single-dose Eye Drops in Conjunctivitis.&quot; The&#xD;
      Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, Vol. 6, Number 6, 2000. pp499-508.)&#xD;
      (Toelg, Michael. &quot;Euphrasia D3 Eye Drops in Children.&quot;&#xD;
      http://www.anthromed.org/Article.aspx?artpk=676 Accessed 2 July 2013.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve our goals, a comparison of the Euphrasia eye drop products that are currently on&#xD;
      the market must be done. Weleda's Euphrasia D3 eye drops will be tested against prednisolone&#xD;
      acetate eye drops to compare efficacy in reducing intraocular inflammation in the&#xD;
      post-operative period after a peripheral laser iridotomy. This will be measured using a&#xD;
      similar protocol used to show efficacy of steroidal eye drops already on the market. The&#xD;
      investigator swill be measuring inflammation, intraocular pressure, and assessing pain at&#xD;
      given intervals during the patient's post-operative period. The investigators will also be&#xD;
      looking for specific signs of side effects that are known to occur with steroids and any&#xD;
      other unwanted side effects, see research strategy for specifics.&#xD;
