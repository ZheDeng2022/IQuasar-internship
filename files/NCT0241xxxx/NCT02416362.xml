      The purpose of this study is to analyze the immediate effects of two exercise protocols on&#xD;
      the vibration platform, on the strength of the thigh muscles, joint position sense of the&#xD;
      knee and balance in healthy subjects.&#xD;

      Design and research site: This is a randomized and blinded clinical trial held at the&#xD;
      Laboratory of Neuromuscular Performance of the Department of Physical Therapy, Federal&#xD;
      University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN). Characterization of the sample: The sample&#xD;
      consisted of 60 women randomly divided into 3 distinct groups. Ethical aspects: For its&#xD;
      implementation, this project was submitted to the Research Ethics Committee (REC) of the&#xD;
      Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. Was respected and ensured the autonomy and&#xD;
      anonymity of participants, as well as your privacy as confidential data, as governed&#xD;
      Resolution 196/96 of the National Health Council and the Helsinki declaration for human&#xD;
      research. Instruments: Stationary bicycle (Ergo-Fit, ErgoCycle 167, Pirmasens, Germany);&#xD;
      computerized baropodometry platform Eclipse 3000 model (Guy-Capron® SA, France); vibrating&#xD;
      platform model Power Plate® pro5 ™; signal conditioning module (Telemyo direct transmission&#xD;
      system) 8-channel (Noraxon, USA); self-adhesive electrode active surface (Noraxon, USA);&#xD;
      isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Multi-Joint System 4, Biomedical Biodex System Inc.®, New&#xD;
      York, USA). Procedures: There was a previous pilot study for adequacy of any research&#xD;
      procedures and the training of evaluators. The volunteers were informed about the procedures&#xD;
      to be performed in the research, signed the informed consent form, fill in an evaluation form&#xD;
      with anthropometric data and personal examination of members. Evaluations were performed&#xD;
      before and after the intervention protocol. Initially, all the volunteers executed a warming&#xD;
      exercise on a stationary bike for 5 minutes. Postural balance: the volunteers were placed&#xD;
      standing on the baropodometry platform, supported in the non-dominant member and with the&#xD;
      knee kept at 20 ° of flexion. The dominant member remained with the knee in 90 ° of flexion.&#xD;
      The evaluation was repeated 3 times, being considered for analysis the average of the two&#xD;
      best measures. The evaluation time was 20 seconds on an acquisition frequency of 20 Hz with a&#xD;
      period of 1 minute break between tests. Previously the participant was allowed to become&#xD;
      familiar with the equipment. Joint position sense: the volunteer was positioned sitting on&#xD;
      the dynamometer, stabilized by braces and with the device axis aligned with the knee&#xD;
      evaluated. The apparatus of the lever arm was attached to the distal leg. Then, the volunteer&#xD;
      was instructed to perform a knee extension member starting with 90 ° of flexion. When the 45&#xD;
      target angle wass reached, the dynamometer arm remained in this position, keeping it for 5&#xD;
      seconds, so that the voluntary noticed which the angle to be achieved. Finally, prompted an&#xD;
      active extension from 90 ° knee flexion (1 / s) to the target angle, the second trial of the&#xD;
      subject. At that moment, the volunteer should trigger a device to record the angle reached.&#xD;
      Torque rating: keeping the same previous position, the normalization of the electromyographic&#xD;
      signal was held, where the subject performed two maximal voluntary isometric contractions of&#xD;
      knee extension at an angle of 60 ° for 5s, with one-minute interval between each repetition.&#xD;
      Then the concentric evaluation was conducted, with 5 maximal contractions for knee flexion&#xD;
      and extension at 60 ° / s, starting from 90 ° flexion up to full extension. Electromyographic&#xD;
      activity: emg was collected concurrently with exercise protocols on the platform, as well as&#xD;
      during the torque rating. The volunteers were submitted for shaving and cleaning the skin&#xD;
      with 70% alcohol before attaching the electrodes.&#xD;

    <description>The control group (No vibration) will hold an exercise protocol on the vibration platform, which is to stay on one foot on the non-dominant leg, with the knee held in 40 ° of flexion, hands together to the body and the trunk in the erect position. Altogether, the participant will perform 11 sets of 30 seconds with a rest interval of 30 seconds between sets. The knee angle will be monitored throughout the protocol by the second reviewer with a goniometer so that there is no change in it. The vibrating platform will remain off throughout intervention.</description>
