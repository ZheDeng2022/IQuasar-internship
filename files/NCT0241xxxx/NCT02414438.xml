  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study uses a randomized controlled study design of pediatric neurologists and&#xD;
      developmental pediatricians and front-line (primary care) pediatricians to determine if use&#xD;
      of FirstStepDx PLUS and Next StepDx PLUS are associated with higher clinical quality, less&#xD;
      variability in clinical practice, and lower costs from decreased resource utilization. The&#xD;
      Clinical Performance and Value Vignettes (CPV) used in this study simulate a clinical&#xD;
      encounter for individuals with an atypical phenotype and clinical presentation indicative of&#xD;
      a possible genetic disorder. We will measure the difference in combined diagnostic and&#xD;
      treatment CPV® domain score post-intervention versus baseline comparing intervention and&#xD;
      control groups&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an interventional longitudinal study design of physician practice. 225&#xD;
      specialist and general pediatricians without previous exposure to FirstStepDx PLUS or&#xD;
      NextStepDx PLUS will be selected from a nationally representative list of approximately&#xD;
      25,000 board-certified pediatricians and 5,000 specialists. These physicians will be&#xD;
      randomized into one of three arms: to receive information regarding FirstStepDx PLUS&#xD;
      (&quot;Intervention A&quot;), to receive information about FirstStepDx PLUS and NextStepDx PLUS&#xD;
      (&quot;Intervention B&quot;) for use in clinical practice, and controls not receiving any intervention.&#xD;
      Specifically we will test the hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical practice, specifically decisions around treatment of individuals with disorders&#xD;
           postnatal development including DD, ASD, and ID will vary widely among all physician&#xD;
           types. This documentation of variation in practice will demonstrate the need for a new&#xD;
           diagnostic service that FirstStepDx PLUS and NextStepDx PLUS would fulfill&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. FirstStepDx PLUS and NextStepDx PLUS will improve the quality and appropriateness of&#xD;
           care and therapeutic plans, as measured by the number of physicians that correctly act&#xD;
           on the results of the assay&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Physician Questionnaire will be administered to all physicians. This questionnaire will&#xD;
      assess physician, patient and practice characteristics. Data gathered from this set of&#xD;
      questions will become part of the baseline (pre-intervention) assessment and used for&#xD;
      analysis. At the baseline assessment, Clinical Performance and Value (CPVs) Vignettes, a&#xD;
      validated tool to measure physician performance and behavior will be used. CPV vignettes have&#xD;
      been used to establish clinical utility in the molecular diagnostic space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CPV vignettes used in this study will simulate a clinical encounter for a patient with an&#xD;
      atypical clinical presentation indicative of a possible genetic developmental disorder. Each&#xD;
      physician will provide open-ended responses regarding clinical care. These responses are&#xD;
      scored in five domains (taking a medical history, performing a physical examination, ordering&#xD;
      appropriate tests, making a diagnosis and prescribing treatment against explicit evidence and&#xD;
      criteria as determined by the literature and by expert physicians. Results are presented as&#xD;
      percentage correct controlling for primacy effects using case within pair randomization. Each&#xD;
      case will take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete. All case responses will be completed&#xD;
      electronically online and confidential. No physician or practice names are used when&#xD;
      reporting the results of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CPVs will be randomly assigned to physicians for each to complete 3 CPVs™ (one from each&#xD;
      type). Each of the CPVs will be scored by physicians for changes in clinical practice&#xD;
      including treatment changes, frequency of follow up, laboratory tests and imaging studies&#xD;
      ordered - see for scoring sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess how FirstStepDx PLUS (and NextStepDx PLUS) testing&#xD;
      affects the variability of clinical practice and resultant impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint Differences in CPV diagnosis/treatment domain score post-intervention versus&#xD;
      baseline for the intervention and control group physicians).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference in utilization of appropriate treatment including indicated versus&#xD;
           unnecessary therapy pre- and post-intervention between intervention and control groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference in utilization of laboratory testing such as fluorescence in situ&#xD;
           hybridization (FISH) analyses, global assessment, and utilization of other laboratory&#xD;
           tests pre- and post-intervention, between intervention and control groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference in overall Clinical Performance and Value Vignettes (CPV®) scores&#xD;
           post-intervention versus baseline between intervention and control groups&#xD;
