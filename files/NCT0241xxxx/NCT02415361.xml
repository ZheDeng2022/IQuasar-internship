  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Norway, 100-120 children are born with CLP (1.9 per 1,000 live births) each year. Parents&#xD;
      of infants with CLP need information and support, especially with feeding immediately after&#xD;
      birth. These needs are often not met. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect&#xD;
      of systematic follow ups of parents with infants with CLP performed by a special trained&#xD;
      nurse. Parental information needs, parental coping and stress and infant growth and feeding&#xD;
      will be explored and compared to a control group receiving standard care. 26 parents (mothers&#xD;
      and fathers) or more shall be included in each group according to specific criteria. The&#xD;
      control should be examined first. Both groups will answer questionnaires 3 times during the&#xD;
      child's first year.&#xD;
