      The overall purpose of the study is to compare two talk therapies (Clinic-Based Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioral Therapy and Cognitive Processing Therapy-Cognitive Only) for the treatment of&#xD;
      posttraumatic headache (PTHA) and co-morbid posttraumatic stress (PTS). The researchers hope&#xD;
      to learn if a non-medication, cognitive-behavioral treatment can result in noticeable&#xD;
      reductions in PTHA intensity/severity and frequency as well as PTS symptom severity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      More than 100,000 military service members and veterans suffer from chronic headaches&#xD;
      resulting from a traumatic brain injury (TBI) sustained during deployment. Although that&#xD;
      population has seen a sharp increase in these posttraumatic headaches (PTHA), the condition&#xD;
      is extraordinarily difficult to treat. There is very little evidence guiding its management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complicating things is the fact that those who have suffered a traumatic injury during&#xD;
      deployment often have co-occurring symptoms of posttraumatic stress, which may worsen their&#xD;
      headaches or make them more difficult to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better inform our understanding of how to help our suffering war veterans, we developed a&#xD;
      study for the Consortium to Alleviate PTSD (CAP) addressing posttraumatic headache in war&#xD;
      veterans with co-occurring symptoms of posttraumatic stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key aim of the study will be to evaluate whether a leading psychological therapy for&#xD;
      migraine headaches is effective with posttraumatic headaches. Investigators also seek to&#xD;
      determine if treatment for PTHA likewise improves problems with PTSD, and whether treatment&#xD;
      for PTSD simultaneously alleviates headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish these aims, the study will have three arms, with participants placed randomly&#xD;
      into one of three treatment conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment as usual (e.g., receiving standard care for PTHA through the South Texas&#xD;
           Veterans Health Care System's Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center in San Antonio);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A gold standard, manualized cognitive-behavioral intervention for headache; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A gold-standard treatment for PTSD, called Cognitive Processing Therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  adult (ages 18 - 70 years old)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  U.S. military Veterans with military service during Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF),&#xD;
             Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and New Dawn (OND)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have sustained a traumatic head injury&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have been diagnosed or report symptoms consistent with chronic (&gt; 3 months)&#xD;
             posttraumatic headache attributed to a traumatic injury sustained as part of military&#xD;
             service. We are focusing on chronic PTHA due to the very low likelihood of headache&#xD;
             remission after 3 months, the disability associated with chronic PTHA, and the high&#xD;
             prevalence of chronic versus acute PTHA in this Veteran population. A positive PTHA&#xD;
             diagnosis will be indicated for individuals with de novo headache onset within 3&#xD;
             months of a concussion or exacerbation of pre-existing headache symptoms (increased&#xD;
             frequency, duration, or intensity) within 3 months of traumatic injury. This is&#xD;
             consistent with the existing ICHD-III criteria for PTHA inclusion will be based on&#xD;
             either a pre-existing diagnosis of chronic PTHA documented in the Veteran's medical&#xD;
             record by a PRC/PSC provider or a Neurologist (e.g., ICD-10 code G44.329) or through&#xD;
             screening with one of our PRC/PSC co-PIs if the Veteran reports symptoms consistent&#xD;
             with chronic PTHA but has never had it documented in her/his medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants taking headache medication with a stable pattern of use for the prior 6&#xD;
             week period (including no prescribed changes in medical regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have some posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms based on a cut-off&#xD;
             score of at least 25 or above on the PTSD CheckList -Version (PCL-5), which all&#xD;
             participants will complete as part of their screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must also report on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) an&#xD;
             exposure to a traumatic event (Criterion A), at least one intrusion symptom (Criterion&#xD;
             B), and at least one avoidance symptom (Criterion C). There is some evidence&#xD;
             suggesting 40% comorbidity between PTSD and new onset headache, so it is reasonable to&#xD;
             assume that at least half of all PTHA participants recruited for this study will have&#xD;
             PTHA and comorbid PTS symptoms. The inclusion of PTS symptoms in this sample is vital&#xD;
             based on reports indicating that PTS symptoms and PTSD actually increase vulnerability&#xD;
             to PTHA and chronic headache in military populations&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  there has been a recent and significant change in the nature of headache symptoms over&#xD;
             the last 6 weeks prior to their screening (as determined by the investigators)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants currently in CPT or prolonged exposure for PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has medication overuse headache as defined by the Structured Diagnostic&#xD;
             Headache Interview-Revised (Brief Version; SDIHR).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the participant is unable to read or speak English at a 6th grade level&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they have had a psychiatric hospitalization in the last 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they currently meet a psychiatric diagnosis of substance abuse [based on Alcohol Use&#xD;
             Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) assessment during screening]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the trial (due to concerns about&#xD;
             pregnancy-induced headache that may obscure findings)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  if a psychiatric problem is present that warrants immediate treatment based upon&#xD;
             clinical judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  if they demonstrate significant cognitive impairment that could impact treatment&#xD;
             adherence/benefit.&#xD;
