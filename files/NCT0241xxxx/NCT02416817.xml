  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two already validated methods for massive transfusion&#xD;
      in trauma patients admitted to the emergency room of a large reference hospital.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized trial trauma patients in need of massive transfusion will be assigned to&#xD;
      one of the following transfusion strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Fresh Frozen Plasma, Platelets Concentrate and Packed red blood cells in 1:1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - These patients will receive Red blood cells based on Haemoglobin measurements and will&#xD;
           receive either Beriplex® P/N (CSL Behring GmbH, Marburg, Germany) or Haemocomplettan® P&#xD;
           (CSL Behring, Marburg, Germany), or Platelets based on thromboelastometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be included patients must meet the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Trauma victims&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Adults between 18 - 80 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Injury Severity Score (ISS) between 15 and 45&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Assessment of Blood Consumption (ABC) Score ≥ 3 points&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. - Shock Index ≥ 1,2&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. - Acute hemorrhage of more than 50% estimated blood volume in 3 hours or more than 1,5&#xD;
           ml/kg/min of blood during 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Early cardiac arrest&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Injury Severity Score (ISS) &gt; 45&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Patient transferred from another hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. - Drug abuse history&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. - Known coagulation impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. - Known use of anticoagulants, or platelet antiaggregants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group of health-care providers recruiting the patients based on eligibility criteria, is&#xD;
      different than the group that evaluates the clinical outcomes of the included patients, in&#xD;
      such a way that no researcher is tasked with post-randomisation care of the subjects. This is&#xD;
      done to prevent observational bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two informed consent forms are signed for each patient. The first one is signed by an&#xD;
      independent physician. Another consent form is signed by the patient's family or the own&#xD;
      patient within 24 hours of hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomisation is performed by sealed envelopes assigned to the eligible patients anytime&#xD;
      they reach the protocol criteria. The envelopes were created using a computer generated&#xD;
      randomisation table specifically designed to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis was performed in October 2015 and it showed that there was no increased&#xD;
      mortality or morbidity within the intervention group.&#xD;
