  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine effective treatment and identify diagnostic biomarkers&#xD;
      for Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Individuals that take part in the study will be&#xD;
      participating in either a weight loss surgery (WLS) group or a comprehensive lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention (CLI) group. People in the WLS group will receive vertical sleeve gastrectomy&#xD;
      (VSG). The CLI group will receive dietary, activity and behavioral interventions provided by&#xD;
      trained study staff.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have designed a rigorously controlled study designed to evaluate NASH&#xD;
      outcomes in two parallel cohorts: 1) severely obese adolescents with NASH who have chosen to&#xD;
      undergo WLS (specifically VSG) for clinical indications compared to 2) a control group of&#xD;
      severely obese adolescents with NASH enrolled in a CLI offered as part of this study. The&#xD;
      study will provide the best evidence to date of the effectiveness of WLS and CLI in treating&#xD;
      NASH in adolescents with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m2. The investigators will also&#xD;
      concurrently collect health-care utilization data to enable subsequent cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      analyses (CEA) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of WLS vs. CLI intervention in&#xD;
      severely-obese adolescents with NASH. If the investigators' data support our hypothesis that&#xD;
      WLS yields superior results, this will set the stage for randomized studies (if needed) and&#xD;
      translational studies of weight loss-independent biological mechanism(s) unique to WLS, which&#xD;
      may include specific changes in bile acid signaling and in the intestinal microbiome. The&#xD;
      latter would facilitate developing novel pharmacotherapies accessible to younger or less&#xD;
      obese children with NASH to whom WLS is not applicable. Cumulatively, this study has the&#xD;
      potential to yield significant improvements in medical and quality of life (QOL) outcomes for&#xD;
      a large proportion of pediatric patients with NASH and to reduce long term health care costs&#xD;
      by identifying effective treatment options and decreasing progression to cirrhosis and&#xD;
      end-stage liver disease.&#xD;
