  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are widely used as reversible contraceptives. Both copper- and&#xD;
      levonorgestrel (LNG)-releasing IUDs (LNG-IUDs) are safe,cost-effective in the long term and&#xD;
      equally effective compared with tubal sterilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the LNG-IUD (Mirena®) provides non contraceptive benefits, such as treatment for&#xD;
      menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea and anemia. The current use of IUDs among reproductive-aged women&#xD;
      ranges from 8 to 15% worldwide. Reported complications related to IUD insertion are 8.8%&#xD;
      insertion failure, 2.8-11.5% cervical problems, 0.2% cervical perforation, 0.2% syncope and&#xD;
      5.8% expulsion. Insertion failures and cervical problems seem to occur more often among women&#xD;
      who have never delivered vaginally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical stenosis, an immature or small cervix and a significantly ante- or retroverted&#xD;
      position of the uterus, has been described as factors associated with a difficult sounding of&#xD;
      the cervical canal or even failure to insert the IUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Misoprostol is an inexpensive prostaglandin E1-analogue, which is associated with few side&#xD;
      effect. More over several have shown the benefit of misoprostol as a cervical ripening agent&#xD;
      in non pregnant women. Priming with misoprostol prior to hysteroscopy and dilatation and&#xD;
      curettage (D&amp;C) in perimenopausal women resulted in increased cervical dilatation and lower&#xD;
      rate of cervical laceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of misoprostol on the cellular matrix causes dissolution of collagen fiber&#xD;
      increasing the amount of fluid in the stroma and consequentially causes cervical effacement.&#xD;
      Fear of pain during insertion, however, might prevent some women from choosing IUD and fears&#xD;
      of painful and/or difficult placements may lead them to recommend or counsel women on other,&#xD;
      less effective methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women's perception of pain is multifactorial and likely to be influenced by cultural&#xD;
      differences and personal experiences; insertion-related pain is therefore difficult to&#xD;
      predict. Nevertheless, factors associated with greater pain include nulliparity, not&#xD;
      currently breastfeeding and longer time since last pregnancy; of these factors, nulliparity&#xD;
      is the strongest predictor of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of women of reproductive age who are nulliparous is increasing, with women&#xD;
      delaying childbirth and having fewer children or choosing to remain childless. The proportion&#xD;
      of Caesarean section births has also increased and women who have only ever had a Caesarean&#xD;
      section are often viewed as nulliparous with respect to IUD placement. Anticipated pain is&#xD;
      often greater than the actual pain experienced, and the majority of nulliparous women&#xD;
      experience no more than moderate pain during IUD insertion. However, among nulliparous women&#xD;
      there is a subset (about 17%) for whom the insertion of IUD is associated with severe&#xD;
      pain.These women need effective pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For most nulliparous, nulligravid or parous women, IUD insertion can be performed&#xD;
      successfully without cervical priming and with a minimum amount of discomfort. Whether&#xD;
      selective use of misoprostol has a role in management of pain in certain subsets of women&#xD;
      (e.g. nulliparous women and those in whom the insertion is non-routine/difficult) has yet to&#xD;
      be adequately studied.&#xD;
