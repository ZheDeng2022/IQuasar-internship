  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Problematic anger is a strong predictor of failed attempts at smoking cessation. The&#xD;
      investigators proposed study seeks to evaluate whether a novel 8-session computerized&#xD;
      anger-reduction treatment improves quit rates among smokers. Smokers with elevated trait&#xD;
      anger will be administered transdermal nicotine patch therapy and either anger-reduction&#xD;
      treatment or a control intervention. They will be assessed throughout treatment and up until&#xD;
      three months after a scheduled mid- treatment quit date. The investigators propose to test&#xD;
      whether, compared to the control condition, the anger-reduction treatment will lead to: 1)&#xD;
      greater reductions in anger and 2) greater abstinence rates at post-cessation and at&#xD;
      follow-up assessments. The investigators will also test whether changes in anger-related&#xD;
      symptoms account for group differences in abstinence rates.&#xD;

      The current proposal seeks to evaluate an eight-session, computerized, anger-focused&#xD;
      intervention for smokers (Anger Reduction Treatment or ART). The investigators will&#xD;
      administer this intervention to smokers (N = 114) who are interested in quitting and have&#xD;
      elevated levels of trait anger. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either: (1)&#xD;
      computerized ART, consisting of interpretation bias modification, or (2) a computerized&#xD;
      control condition, which consists of health education and relaxing video clips. The&#xD;
      computerized sessions (eight total) will take place twice a week for four weeks. All&#xD;
      participants will have a scheduled quit date for the beginning of the third week of treatment&#xD;
      (i.e., at mid-treatment). All participants will also receive nicotine patch therapy to use at&#xD;
      their scheduled quit date. Anger symptoms, smoking cravings, and smoking frequency will be&#xD;
      assessed throughout treatment. Smoking status, anger, and other measures of negative affect&#xD;
      will also be assessed at baseline and regularly for 12-weeks following the scheduled quit&#xD;
      date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test whether, compared to the control condition, the anger-reduction&#xD;
      treatment will lead to: 1) greater reductions in anger and 2) greater abstinence rates at&#xD;
      post-cessation and at follow-up assessments. The investigators will also test whether changes&#xD;
      in anger-related symptoms account for group differences in abstinence rates.&#xD;

    <description>The treatment consists of eight 30-minute IBM sessions. Participants will be presented with ambiguous scenarios and asked imagine themselves in these situations. In the first task, the scenario will be followed by a benign interpretation of the situation. Participants will answer a comprehension question designed to have participants endorse this benign interpretation. In the second task, participants will be presented with a word denoting an interpretation with either a negative/hostile or positive/benign connotation. Following this word, an ambiguous scenario will appear. Participants will indicate whether the word and the scenario were related. They will receive feedback training them to endorse positive interpretations and reject negative interpretations.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the control condition will complete eight computerized sessions consisting of psychoeducation on healthy behaviors (i.e., topics of exercise, diet, hygiene, social support, healthy activities, and sleep, taken from protocols developed from our ongoing research). These participants will also view relaxing videos consisting of brief guided meditation instructions, pictures of nature scenes, and soft music. These sessions (psychoeducation and relaxing videos) will be matched for time with the active treatment condition, lasting 30 minutes each.</description>
