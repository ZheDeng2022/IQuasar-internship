      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal dosing scheme for the combination of&#xD;

      (MCL).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, study which will be open at up to 4 clinical sites. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the optimal dosing scheme for the combination of ibrutinib with&#xD;
      ABT-199 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The main&#xD;
      criterion for eligibility is MCL with measurable disease which is relapsed or refractory to&#xD;
      at least 1 chemotherapy-containing regimen and has not been previously treated with&#xD;
      ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This dose finding study will use a continual reassessment method, which accounts for both&#xD;
      toxicity and efficacy in combinations of agents, to determine the optimal combination of the&#xD;
      approved treatment ibrutinib with the investigational agent ABT-199. This study will accrue&#xD;
      patients in two stages. In the initial stage, subjects will be accrued to dosing cohorts of&#xD;
      increasing dosages of ABT-199 in combination with ibrutinib. The modeling is initiated once 1&#xD;
      subject experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). During the modeling stage, treatment&#xD;
      assignments will be made based on model prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will remain on treatment until progression or unacceptable toxicity, and will be&#xD;
      monitored for safety during the treatment interval. Safety will be evaluated by incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events and number of discontinuations due to AEs. Efficacy endpoints include Overall&#xD;
      Response Rate (ORR), Complete Response Rate (CRR), minimal residual disease response rate,&#xD;
      and survival (PFS and OS). The study will also include exploratory analysis of the gene&#xD;
      expression pattern in subjects who progress on treatment.&#xD;
