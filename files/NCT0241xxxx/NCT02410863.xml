  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, clinical phase II study to explore the correlation of&#xD;
      the genetic make-up of the treated tumor before start of therapy and to correlate clinical&#xD;
      response at 8 weeks as well as metabolic response at 2 and 8 weeks with genetic features of&#xD;
      the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be conducted as a rationale optimization of targeted therapy in BRAF naïve and&#xD;
      pretreated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prerequisite for all patients is the availability of tumor sample at start of treatment in&#xD;
      order to determine the underlying driver mutation (BRAF mutational status) as well as&#xD;
      molecular composition by next generation sequencing (NGS) and assessable lesions for biopsy&#xD;
      at week 2. Melanoma patients in stage III (non-resectable) and stage IV are sorted into&#xD;
      Cohort A or B according to their previous BRAF-treatment and treated with dabrafenib and&#xD;
      trametinib (cohort A and B)&#xD;

      In this open-label, multi-center, clinical phase II study melanoma patients in stage III&#xD;
      (non-resectable) and stage IV are sorted into Cohort A or B according to their previous&#xD;
      BRAF-treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A (BRAFi naïve): Patients who have not received prior BRAFi or MEKi-therapy.&#xD;
      Dabrafenib (BRAFi) and trametinib (MEKi) will be administered orally at their recommended&#xD;
      doses for combination therapy of 150 mg twice daily (BID) and 2 mg daily (QD). Clinical&#xD;
      endpoint is clinical response at week 8. Metabolic response will be assessed at week 2 and 8.&#xD;
      Treatment will continue until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B (BRAFi / MEKi rechallenge): Patients with CR/PR as best response to previous BRAFi /&#xD;
      MEKi combination therapy, discontinuation of this therapy after progression and different&#xD;
      therapy for &gt; 3 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients will receive dabrafenib and trametinib at their recommended combination&#xD;
      therapy doses of 150 mg twice daily (BID) and 2 mg daily (QD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will continue until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival will be assessed every 3 months after the final dose of BRAFi / MEKi until the end&#xD;
      of the follow-up phase for the individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up phase for each subject is 1 year following first treatment dose. End of study will&#xD;
      be at recruitment finished plus 1 year post start of treatment of last patient thus ensuring&#xD;
      that 1 year survival rate can be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies taken before start of treatment, after 2 weeks (+/- 4 days) and after progressive&#xD;
      disease will be analyzed by Next generation sequencing (NGS), immunohistochemistry (IHC),&#xD;
      phosphorplex Luminex as well as by reverse phase protein array in order to determine the&#xD;
      magnitude of suppression of downstream signaling as well as reactivation of adaptative&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rebiopsy is mandatory after 2 weeks and in case of progressive disease in order to determine&#xD;
      mechanisms of adaptation of the signaling pathway downstream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental molecular data will be analyzed in correlation with clinical response at&#xD;
      week 8 (defined as partial or complete response according to RECIST) and metabolic responses&#xD;
      at weeks 2 and 8 (responders are defined as those patients with changes of &gt;66% in the&#xD;
      Standard Uptake value (SUVmax) between interim PET and baseline PET.&#xD;
