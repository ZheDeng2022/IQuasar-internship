      Switching from positive airway pressure ventilation to spontaneous ventilation during weaning&#xD;
      from mechanical ventilation, pulmonary edema may occur and in this case, doppler&#xD;
      echocardiographic (U/S) indices of cardiac dysfunction correlates with the concentration of&#xD;
      fluid in interstitial space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty consecutive mechanically ventilated critical ill patients who fulfill criteria for&#xD;
      weaning from mechanical ventilation, will be included in this study. All patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated daily and when the patients fulfill weaning criteria them they will undergo a&#xD;
      2-hour spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) through a T-piece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after SBT cardiopulmonary function will be assessed by thermodilution and&#xD;
      echocardiography. In patients with preserved LV systolic function, an echocardiographic index&#xD;
      of diastolic dysfunction (E/Em ratio) before preforming SBT may identify high risk patients&#xD;
      for increasing extravascular water in weaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators expect to find positive correlations (p&lt;0.05) between&#xD;
      pulmonary extravascular lung water and echocardiographic indices (such as E/Em ratio) during&#xD;
      SBT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary edema (PE) is an underestimated factor of weaning failure. The interruption of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. increases left ventricular (LV) afterload, sympathetic tone and may provoke myocardial&#xD;
           schema, LV dysfunction and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. augments blood in-flow into the thorax and may cause right ventricular dilation and&#xD;
           intraventricular septum left shift.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These events may impair LV compliance during weaning, increase intra-capillary pulmonary&#xD;
      pressures and cause cardiogenic PE (CPE). The investigators have recently shown that LV&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction may predispose to weaning failure, while echocardiographic markers of&#xD;
      CPE may provide further insight in weaning process. Notably, this could be especially true in&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients where strategies aiming to manage heart&#xD;
      failure (i.e. diuretics, nitroglycerin) has been shown to improve weaning outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, vigorous inspiratory efforts against the endotracheal tube during spontaneous&#xD;
      weaning trials may reduce excessively extracapillary pressures in pulmonary interstitial&#xD;
      spaces, causing an intra-pulmonary fluid shift known as negative pressure PE (NPPE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim: To study whether echocardiographic parameters of left and right ventricular&#xD;
      function, and echocardiographic surrogates of cardiogenic PE (markers of elevated LV filling&#xD;
      pressures, such as E/Em) are associated to weaning-induced alterations in extravascular lung&#xD;
      water index (EVLWI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis A) Switching from positive airway pressure ventilation to spontaneous ventilation&#xD;
      during weaning from mechanical ventilation, pulmonary edema may occur and in this case,&#xD;
      doppler echocardiography (U/S) indices of cardiac dysfunction correlates with the&#xD;
      concentration of fluid in interstitial space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) These events can be further provoked after Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Pulmonary edema is a major cause of weaning failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD) patients, even in those without known cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS Thirty-five consecutive mechanically ventilated critical ill patients who fulfil&#xD;
      criteria for weaning, will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS All patients will be evaluated daily for the aforementioned weaning criteria and when&#xD;
      the patients fulfill them they will undergo A) a 2-hour spontaneous breathing trial (SBT)&#xD;
      through a T-piece and B) MIP trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after SBT and MIP trials cardiopulmonary function will be assessed by&#xD;
      thermodilution and echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extravascular Lung Water Index (EVLWI) study. EVLWI will be assessed by transpulmonary&#xD;
      thermodilution (PiCCO plus system, Pulsion Medical Systems and Philips Medical Systems, USA).&#xD;
      Transpulmonary thermodilution measures left-side CO by injection of a cold injectate (15-20&#xD;
      ml,10C lower than blood temperature) via subclavian or internal jugular vein and by the&#xD;
      detection of the change in temperature in the arterial system via femoral access. Analysis of&#xD;
      the thermodilution curve in terms of mean transit time (MTt) and downslope time (DSt) will be&#xD;
      used for determination of intra and extra vascular fluid volumes. EVLW correlates to the&#xD;
      extravascular thermal volume in the lungs and it is evaluated through the MTt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principle parameters obtained by transpulmonary thermodilution are following&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cardiac output (absolute/indexed parameters, CO/CI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cardiac function index (CFI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  extravascular lung water (EVLW/EVLWI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  global ejection fraction (GEF)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiographic study. Baseline Doppler echocardiographic measurements will be obtained&#xD;
      before SBT initiation, while participants will be in pressure support ventilation (pre-SBT).&#xD;
      Follow up measurements (end-SBT) in patients who succeeded in the trial, will be collected&#xD;
      120 minutes after SBT initiation. In those participants who fail the procedure, measurements&#xD;
      will obtained before reconnection to the ventilator. Doppler echocardiography will be&#xD;
      performed as previously described (Philips i33, U.S.A.). Mitral inflow pulsed-wave Doppler&#xD;
      signals [peak velocities of early (E) and late (A) LV diastolic filling, E-wave deceleration&#xD;
      time (DTE)], Tissue Doppler Imaging(TDI)-derived peak systolic (Sm)/early diastolic (Em)/late&#xD;
      diastolic (Am) velocities at the lateral/septal mitral annulus and lateral tricuspid annulus,&#xD;
      and color M-mode Doppler velocity of propagation (Vp) will be obtained from the apical&#xD;
      4-chamber view. Analysis will be also performed for &quot;conventional&quot; (E/A ratio) and &quot;advanced&quot;&#xD;
      (E/Em, ) echocardiographic indices of LV filling pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results Recruitment period: three months Analysis of results: three months Based on&#xD;
      a previous study contacted by the investigators, echocardiographic variables of LV diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction is expected to be found associated with direct measurements of pulmonary edema&#xD;
      (EVLWI). In participants with preserved LV systolic function, an E/Em ratio&gt;7.8 before&#xD;
      preforming SBT may identify high risk patients for increasing extravascular water in weaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on preliminary findings EVLWI values measured in critical patients by the investigators&#xD;
      were 2-11 ml/Kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to find positive correlations (p&lt;0.05) between EVLWI and E/Em during&#xD;
      SBT and MIP trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of the study will provide further insights in the pathophysiology of weaning.&#xD;
      This could be especially true in COPD patients where failure rates are high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of weaning failure and identification of those patients who are prone to develop LV&#xD;
      dysfunction during weaning and weaning outcomes may improve with the application of&#xD;
      strategies aiming to manage heart failure (i.e diuretics, nitroglycerin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVLW measurements and DE indices will be use as an aid to diagnose and to determine the&#xD;
      etiology of pulmonary edema in critical care patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These indices may retain the predictive value even in the subset of patients who initially&#xD;
      pass SBT; therefore, E/Em pre-SBT could identify patients who will probably fail to remain in&#xD;
      SBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between DE indices and EVLWI could be advantageous compared to EVLWI&#xD;
      measurement alone, for the quantification of lung edema and the guidance of therapy.&#xD;
