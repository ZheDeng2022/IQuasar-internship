      This study will pilot test the use of two mHealth devices. One is called the Bite Counter and&#xD;
      one is called a MisFit. The study will be among a sample of participants (n = 50) to monitor&#xD;
      their eating and sleeping habits. The Bite Counter is a wearable watch-like device that&#xD;
      detects and records when an individual has taken a bite of food. The benefit of using the&#xD;
      Bite Counter is that it places a low-burden on participants to self-monitor their dietary&#xD;
      intake. The MisFit is a commercial device that tracks an individual's sleeping and activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to (1) find out how the Bite Counter calculates daily bites&#xD;
      taken on a vegan diet compared to an omnivorous diet, (2) examine differences in sleep and&#xD;
      activity between individuals following a vegan diet compared to an omnivorous diet and (3)&#xD;
      get feedback from users before the device is tested in larger studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In several randomized controlled trials comparing vegan or vegetarian diets to omnivorous&#xD;
      dietary approaches, significant weight loss has occurred in the absence of significantly&#xD;
      different changes in reported energy intake between groups. This is different than what is&#xD;
      seen in studies using traditional weight loss diets (reduced energy omnivorous diets), which&#xD;
      demonstrate a greater reduction in energy intake corresponding to greater weight loss. In&#xD;
      observational cohort studies, among Adventist Health Study-2 participants following five&#xD;
      different diets, BMI was found to be lowest among vegans and highest among omnivores; yet&#xD;
      energy intake did not significantly differ among the five groups, averaging 2,000 kcals/day,&#xD;
      with the exception of lower energy intake among semi-vegetarians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This difference in body weight without observed differences in energy intake could possibly&#xD;
      be explained by higher levels of physical activity among vegan and vegetarian participants,&#xD;
      which have been observed in some of the cohort studies. Physical activity, however, was&#xD;
      controlled for in the randomized trials either giving participants identical exercise&#xD;
      recommendations, or holding exercise levels constant across experimental groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This present study will utilize the Bite Counter to estimate the differences between calories&#xD;
      consumed between a vegan diet and an omnivore diet. The significance of using the Bite&#xD;
      Counter is that it is a simple way to estimate energy intake. While there are many devices&#xD;
      that measure energy expenditure (e.g. various exercise scales and equipment), there are few&#xD;
      devices that account for energy intake. Traditional methods of estimating energy intake tend&#xD;
      to utilize dietary recalls, but these procedures require much more effort and do not provide&#xD;
      real time feedback like the Bite Counter does. Therefore, this study will contribute to&#xD;
      current research by capturing data on dietary differences between vegans and omnivores, as&#xD;
      well as assessing the usability of this device for dietary self-monitoring. The study will&#xD;
      also use an objective physical activity and sleep tracker (the MisFit) to examine differences&#xD;
      in exercise and sleeping between omnivorous and vegan participants.&#xD;
