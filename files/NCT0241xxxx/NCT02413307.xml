      **PLEASE NOTE** this study is currently open only to clients on the waiting list at the&#xD;
      Centre for Trauma Resilience and Growth, UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will involve adapting and implementing a five minute daily self-practice&#xD;
      compassion-focused intervention and evaluate its impact on psychological and physiological&#xD;
      factors associated with trauma. It aims to offer a novel intervention which may facilitate&#xD;
      further benefits from trauma specific therapy. This would be a unique use of self-practice&#xD;
      Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT) specifically for trauma clients. Previous research has found&#xD;
      that many factors can impact on client's benefitting from therapy, including depression,&#xD;
      anxiety and self-criticism. These things also get in the way of being compassionate towards&#xD;
      oneself, and this can be a difficulty for people who have experienced traumatic events.&#xD;
      Service users have identified that additional support before trauma specific therapy can be&#xD;
      useful and this may offer a positive use of time whilst on therapy waiting lists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. A brief CFT intervention will decrease levels of depression, anxiety, stress and increase&#xD;
      baseline Heart Rate Variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. The compassion focused intervention will increase experiences of self-compassion, social&#xD;
      safeness, and reduce levels of self-criticism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. High 'fear of compassion' will moderate the impact of the intervention and result in&#xD;
      smaller changes in depression, anxiety, stress and post traumatic change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clients of the Centre for trauma, resilience and growth will be approached to participate in&#xD;
      the study. All participants will have experienced trauma for which they are seeking&#xD;
      psychological support. The current compassion focused intervention will be offered to&#xD;
      participants on the waiting list for trauma specific therapy at the trauma centre. Each&#xD;
      participant will be asked to practice the intervention in their own time over a period of&#xD;
      three weeks. There will be initial assessments, repeated assessments following the&#xD;
      intervention, and repeated assessments pre and post trauma specific therapies engaged in.&#xD;

      The project will implement a five-minute daily self-practice CFT intervention and evaluate&#xD;
      its impact on psychological and physiological factors associated with trauma. It aims to&#xD;
      offer a novel intervention which may facilitate further benefits from trauma-specific&#xD;
      therapy. Follow-up data may demonstrate maintenance of positive effects and increased&#xD;
      positive effects if self-practice is continued. This would be a unique use of self-practice&#xD;
      CFT specifically for trauma clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The study will use a delayed intervention Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT)&#xD;
      using a block design.A delayed intervention group will act as a passive control group.&#xD;
      Participants will engage in a daily five-minute self-practice CFT intervention prior to&#xD;
      engaging in trauma-specific TAU. The CFT intervention will be adapted specifically for trauma&#xD;
      clients based on the literature review, involvement of service users, and close collaboration&#xD;
      with Professor Paul Gilbert. The project will involve three stages, outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage One: Development of CFT intervention and feasibility testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development The final version of the adapted five-minute CFT practice will include&#xD;
      consultation with Paul Gilbert as original author of the five-minute CFT intervention&#xD;
      (unpublished) as well as consultation with research supervisors. It will be available in both&#xD;
      audio and written format. Permission has kindly been given by Paul Gilbert to adapt this for&#xD;
      use in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current version of the CFT intervention includes: instructions, an explanation of&#xD;
      compassion and aims of the intervention. It includes several exercises designed to increase&#xD;
      self-compassion including breathing exercises and compassionate imagery exercises focused on&#xD;
      self and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the adaptation process, services users' ideas will be considered. The intervention&#xD;
      will include explicit instructions not to focus on traumatic events participants have&#xD;
      experienced. This will be addressed in their trauma-specific therapy . Participants will be&#xD;
      encouraged to focus on milder difficulties and stressors. The adaptations will account for&#xD;
      the current literature in CFT and maintain its basic principles, focusing on building&#xD;
      self-compassion and reducing self-criticism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant sampling for feasibility testing will be opportunistic, seeking voluntary&#xD;
      engagement from clients currently accessing services. The sample size for this stage is not&#xD;
      explicitly defined and will depend on the number of interested parties. This aims to test&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and its instructions with a clinical&#xD;
      population. Participants will be asked to practice the intervention over a two-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage Two: Randomised controlled trial Design The research will utilise a single-blind&#xD;
      blocked-randomisation design, incorporating three-week intervention versus waiting-list&#xD;
      blocks. Following the end of the initial block, participants who formed the passive,&#xD;
      waiting-list group will engage in the active intervention, whilst the active group will&#xD;
      continue to remain on the waiting list. Both routine and project-specific outcomes measures&#xD;
      will be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapists from the recruitment site will conduct screening assessments and post TAU&#xD;
      assessments. All other measurements will be completed with the primary researcher.&#xD;
      Prospective participants will be provided with an information sheet as part of the screening&#xD;
      interview and, if they consent, will be contacted by the researcher. They will be given the&#xD;
      opportunity to ask questions and be asked to sign a consent form if they wish to participate.&#xD;
      It will be made clear that non-participation will have no adverse effects on their access to&#xD;
      psychological treatment and that engaging in the project will not affect their access to&#xD;
      treatment. An initial appointment will then be made and the pre-intervention assessments&#xD;
      completed. Participants will be allocated to the CFT or waiting-list condition using blocked&#xD;
      randomisation. Self-report measures will be uploaded to an academically-focused online survey&#xD;
      tool (eSurv) and participants will have Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measurements taken&#xD;
      during face-to-face appointments with the primary researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The five-minute CFT self-practice intervention will be available both in written and audio&#xD;
      (CD and mp3) formats. Participants will receive a daily email or text reminder to practice&#xD;
      the intervention if deemed appropriate. Participants will be given the choice to complete a&#xD;
      daily monitoring sheet or have their daily online access monitored to record levels of CFT&#xD;
      practice. Participants will be asked to practice the intervention on a daily basis for three&#xD;
      weeks with repeated completion of the online assessments and the HRV measurements in the week&#xD;
      following the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An a priori power calculation was obtained using G*Power 3.1.9 software (Faul, Erdfelder,&#xD;
      Buchner &amp; Lang, 2009). With the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21: Lovibond &amp;&#xD;
      Lovibond, 1995) as the primary outcome measure, the average effect size of a brief CFT&#xD;
      intervention on the DASS was equivalent to a large effect size f of .74 (McEwan &amp; Gilbert,&#xD;
      2013). An average estimate of test-retest reliability is 0.77 (Brown, Chorpita, Korotitsch &amp;&#xD;
      Barlow, 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the number of groups (2) and repetitions (4) in the planned study and assuming a&#xD;
      test-retest reliability of .77, a sample size of at least 16 (8 per group) will be required&#xD;
      to provide sufficient power (80%) to detect an effect of similar magnitude (f = .74) at an&#xD;
      alpha level of .05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Average attrition rates for clients with PTSD are approximately 20%, although rates vary up&#xD;
      to 48% (Imel, Laska, Jakupcak &amp; Simpson, 2013). A cautious 60% (approx.) attrition rate has&#xD;
      been considered given the research is additional to participants' involvement at the CTRG.&#xD;
      Further allowing room for a more moderate effect size, given that the intervention has not&#xD;
      previously been trialled with a clinical sample, a target sample of 40 participants will be&#xD;
      sought. Given the 150 referrals received by the CTRG last year this is feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal Participants will be assigned a code number with which all of their assessment&#xD;
      data will be stored on a password-protected computer file. This will be accessible only to&#xD;
      the researcher and any transferring of data will be done using an encrypted memory stick. Any&#xD;
      personal data used to contact participants will be deleted upon completion of the&#xD;
      experimental aspects of the project. Participants can withdraw at any time but will be&#xD;
      informed that any data collected past the first week of the intervention process cannot be&#xD;
      erased and may still be used in the project analyses. Consent forms will be signed and will&#xD;
      be stored in a locked filing cabinet at the researcher's home office and transferred to the&#xD;
      University of Lincoln's archived storage following project completion. Data will be stored&#xD;
      for seven years in line with the University's data storage policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications and Dissemination This research project will contribute to the theoretical&#xD;
      literature on both CFT and PTSD. It is anticipated that it will offer new findings regarding&#xD;
      self-practice interventions for PTSD which may have beneficial psychological and&#xD;
      physiological implications and impact on TAU outcomes. The project will be prepared for&#xD;
      publication in an appropriate peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant conferences. It&#xD;
      may also be disseminated on the Compassion Mind Foundation Website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that any participants find the intervention difficult or experience distress,&#xD;
      they will be able to discuss this with an identified person and if deemed appropriate, will&#xD;
      be withdrawn from the project. Research suggests continued practice may reduce fear of&#xD;
      compassion (Rockliff, et al. 2008) and this information will be shared with participants. It&#xD;
      is felt that the risk of such adverse events is minimal.&#xD;
