      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Noncirrhotic Portal Hypertension (NCPH) is caused by liver diseases that increase pressure&#xD;
      in the blood vessels of the liver. It seems to start slowly and not have many warning signs.&#xD;
      Many people may not even know that they have a liver disease. There are no specific&#xD;
      treatments for NCPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn more about how NCPH develops over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People age 12 and older who have NCPH or are at risk for getting it. In the past year, they&#xD;
      cannot have had other types of liver disease that typically result in cirrhosis, liver&#xD;
      cancer, or active substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 2 screening visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: to see if they have or may develop NCPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine and stool studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fibroscan. Sound waves measure liver stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver blood vessel pressure (hepatic venous portal gradient (HVPG)) measurement. This is&#xD;
           done with a small tube inserted in a neck vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They may have a liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will visit the clinic every 6 months for a history, physical exam, and&#xD;
           blood tests. They will also repeat some of the screening tests yearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with NCPH will also have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upper endoscopy test. A tube inserted in the mouth goes through the esophagus and&#xD;
           stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least every 2 years: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least every 4 years: testing including HVPG measurements and liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants without NCPH will also have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver biopsy and HVPG measurements to see if they have NCPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 2 years: abdominal MRI and stool studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will last indefinitely.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Noncirrhotic Portal Hypertension (NCPH) includes a spectrum of chronic liver diseases&#xD;
      characterized by increased pressure within the portal circulation in the absence of&#xD;
      cirrhosis. The complications from NCPH are similar to that of cirrhosis induced portal&#xD;
      hypertension which includes the development of gastrointestinal varices, portal hypertensive&#xD;
      gastropathy, splenomegaly, sepsis and ascites. However, unlike cirrhosis related portal&#xD;
      hypertension, NCPH is characterized by well-preserved hepatic synthetic function. With&#xD;
      increasing recognition both of patients with noncirrhotic portal hypertensive liver diseases,&#xD;
      and mortality due to NCPH, it is clear that the specific mechanism(s) and the natural&#xD;
      history(s) of noncirrhotic portal hypertensive liver disease have yet to be elucidated and&#xD;
      described. At the Clinical Center of the NIH, various cohorts of patients have been&#xD;
      identified to be at increased risk for the development of noncirrhotic portal hypertensive&#xD;
      liver diseases such as those with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), common variable immunodeficiency&#xD;
      (CVID), Turner s Syndrome (TS) and congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) to name a few. We&#xD;
      propose to study individuals with NCPH, and those at risk of developing NCPH within these and&#xD;
      other cohorts of patients known to be at risk for NCPH for an indefinite period of time.&#xD;
      Through continued evaluation and scientific discovery, our aim is to provide a greater&#xD;
      understanding of noncirrhotic portal hypertensive liver diseases and the different underlying&#xD;
      biological processes that lead to the development of NCPH. We also aim to further the scant&#xD;
      existing knowledge regarding the natural history of this disease and the global phenomenon of&#xD;
      portal hypertension. From the data obtained from this natural history protocol, future&#xD;
      studies will be planned to evaluate specific hypothesis in specific disease cohorts. Patients&#xD;
      with diseases known to cause cirrhosis will be excluded. Patients 12 years of age and older&#xD;
      thought to be at risk for the development of NCPH will undergo preliminary testing which&#xD;
      includes; History and physical examination, blood, urine and stool tests, radiologic imaging,&#xD;
      echocardiogram and fibroscan. Adults and minors who are likely to have NCPH will also undergo&#xD;
      transjugular or percutaneous liver biopsy with transjugular hepatic venous gradient&#xD;
      measurements and endoscopy. After these evaluations, those without strong evidence of NCPH&#xD;
      will be asked to return for biannual clinic visits for updated history and physical&#xD;
      assessments. Those with evidence of NCPH will be followed every six months with additional&#xD;
      testing that may include imaging and laboratory evaluations. Over time, those individuals&#xD;
      that develop NCPH will be converted to the intensive characterization and monitoring schemata&#xD;
      as described in the protocol. All patients with NCPH will undergo preventative screening&#xD;
      examinations for complications of NCPH. There is no planned treatment for patients with&#xD;
      existing or newly diagnosed NCPH, as no such treatment currently exists. Treatment for&#xD;
      complications of NCPH will be offered according to the standard of care with referrals as&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
