  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to determine the expression of Interferon-ε (IFNε) in the female&#xD;
      genital tract, which has never been mapped before in humans. High expression in other&#xD;
      mammalian female reproductive tract (FRT) has been suggested to be important in anti-sexually&#xD;
      transmitted infection (STI)/HIV immunity and its expression decreases with progestogen&#xD;
      treatment. Future studies are planned to understand if hormonal contraceptives affect the&#xD;
      presence of interferon in the healthy female genital tract, potentially changing the risk of&#xD;
      for STI and HIV.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To optimize measurement protocols for IFNε and related biomarkers in samples from the&#xD;
           female reproductive tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To quantify and characterize IFNε expression in the upper and lower genital tract and&#xD;
           blood in normally cycling women during the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual&#xD;
           cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a single site, parallel cross-sectional study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine which &quot;IFNε -related assays&quot; can be performed on&#xD;
      different types of FRT samples. The possible &quot;IFNε-related assays&quot; are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IFNε messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels by quantitative reverse transcriptase&#xD;
           polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR) (requiring frozen tissue processed for RNA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IFN Regulated Gene expression by qRT PCR, microarray or targeted gene set using Fluidigm&#xD;
           platform (frozen tissue)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PR and ER gene expression (as above)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IFNε tissue protein levels* (by immunoassay) and progesterone and estrogen receptors&#xD;
           (PR/ER) by Western blotting (frozen tissue)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IFNε and Neopterin (a well characterized compound whose production can be stimulated by&#xD;
           IFNs and whose specificity in this setting needs validation) or other IFNε-biomarkers**&#xD;
           by immunoassay in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) fluids&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunohistochemistry of IFNε, PR/ER, + other (e.g. cells, cytokines) (fixed tissue)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Studies of FRT samples from wild type and IFNε-/- mice would be used to first&#xD;
                validate Neopterin as a &quot;biomarker&quot; of IFNε activity in the FRT; and microarray&#xD;
                analyses may reveal other secreted proteins that may be used as &quot;biomarkers&quot; of&#xD;
                IFNε activity.&#xD;
