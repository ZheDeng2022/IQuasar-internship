  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility is expressed as an inability to conceive or carry a healthy pregnancy to the end.&#xD;
      It is often said that the couple suffers from infertility if for a year they could not get a&#xD;
      normal pregnancy. 30% of the reasons for this unsuccess are attributed to women, 30% are&#xD;
      attributed to men, while the other 40% of cases are attributed to the combination between men&#xD;
      and women and for unknown reasons. In women, the source of most of the problems of&#xD;
      infertility are associated with different failures in ovulation (early ovulation, lack of&#xD;
      ovulation or irregular ovulation). Other reasons are Blocked fallopian tubes (due to&#xD;
      endometriosis, infection or surgery), problems in the uterus and endometrium. There is a&#xD;
      group of women that apparently does not have the failures described above, and they have&#xD;
      infertility that does not include pathological findings. Apparently chronic stress is a&#xD;
      potential cause among couples who could not get pregnant (despite 6 months of focused sex) so&#xD;
      there is a request for various techniques for reducing stress including yoga and meditation.&#xD;
      One common option in various conditions of infertility is in vitro fertilization. This&#xD;
      technique is also known as artificial insemination and is the most common technique used in&#xD;
      Israel. Data from the Ministry of Health from the last years, indicate that the rate of&#xD;
      successful pregnancies after embryo transfer is more than a third (in average), this is from&#xD;
      an average of 20 treatment cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researches in alternative medicine are not easy to carry out. The placebo group which is&#xD;
      usually the control group tend to be a treatment group by itself and gives effective results&#xD;
      than a group that does not receive treatment at all. Carrying out a strict study with a good&#xD;
      control group such as reflexology research in multiple sclerosis, has brought significant&#xD;
      results in various statistical measures examined in this study (movement, sensory mode and&#xD;
      urinary tract symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group the calf was chosen as a place of a massage as a dummy treatment&#xD;
      (gynecological place), which prevented contact with specific points of the feet like in&#xD;
      patients in the treatment group. This study wishes to answer the research question: Does&#xD;
      reflexology treatment increase the chances of pregnancy implantation in women without&#xD;
      pathological findings that are treated with IVF. Other questions related to measures that&#xD;
      could lead to the implant of pregnancy, are whether reflexology treatment affect the&#xD;
      endometrial thickness, number of oocytes and embryo quality. Literature indicates the&#xD;
      potential of reflexology treatment on ovulation induction (But requires a good control group&#xD;
      and large sample size).&#xD;

      The purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does reflexology treatment increase the chance of pregnancy in women treated with IVF?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the Study will recruited women who come for IVF treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are fit to participate and give their consent, will be randomized to one of three&#xD;
      treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - placebo reflexology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 - control group that receives no alternative treatment. Data will be taken from&#xD;
      questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 - will be receiving a built-in protocol reflexology treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reflexology treatment can begin at any stage up to the stage of the eggs implantation. If the&#xD;
      patient is not pregnant, she will start another reflexology treatment cycle. Reflexology&#xD;
      treatment will be minimum 4 treatments and up to six treatments for every cycle. Rate&#xD;
      treatment will be two or three times a week. The patient can receive reflexology treatment&#xD;
      for three cycles of IVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research tools and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photo of feet before the first treatment and before final treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Permanent set by 4 parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire: to be transferred at baseline and after treatment and will be in a state&#xD;
           of double blinded. There will be no connection between the treatment protocol and&#xD;
           questionnaires. At the end of the study, the analysis and cross checking data will form&#xD;
           their own measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Quality of Life Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Questionnaire &quot;dhak&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Mind-body questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Family support questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests (measurements taken any way and will be used for the study): blood tests,&#xD;
      medical record indicating that there is no pathological findings, ultrasound, endometrial&#xD;
      thickness, number of follicles, number of oocytes and embryo quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 - experimental group 80 - a control group that receives no alternative treatment 80 - a&#xD;
      group that receives a placebo treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of participation in the study: Six months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment strengthens the natural healing of the body, in that it strengthens the blood&#xD;
      flow and the release of endorphins, which can reduce pain, stress relaxation and a general&#xD;
      feeling better (wellbeing). Recently a promising theory was added, a theory called Nerve&#xD;
      Impulse the suggests that pressure points in the foot improve neural connection to other&#xD;
      parts of the body through the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system,&#xD;
      regulates body systems that are under unaware control such as respiratory, heart rate and&#xD;
      blood pressure systems which are sensitive to pressure and vibration in accordance with&#xD;
      Physical and psychological changes, and able to control the sympathetic system and moderate&#xD;
      the fight or flight response. Recent meta-analysis that scanned many articles pointed out&#xD;
      that there is no unity in studies about reflexology, that there are a wide range of&#xD;
      parameters, methods and measurements of efficacy .Therapeutic Touch are complex and it is&#xD;
      difficult to maintain such double-blind trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a great need for maintaining the uniformity of treatment. In the&#xD;
      investigators' study, will be responsible coordinator of reflexology, Rachel Hoddov, to teach&#xD;
      and train coaches participating in the study protocol the standard treatment in a way that&#xD;
      will allow a free hand. In addition, Placebo treatment will be in superficial areas in&#xD;
      particular, and will be directed to organs and organ systems which are not relevant to the&#xD;
      research topic.&#xD;
