  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      - The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of CAIV-T in a diverse Asian&#xD;
      population aged from 6 months to less than 36 months, in tropical and temperate climates,&#xD;
      against culture-confirmed influenza illness. In addition, the trial provides the opportunity&#xD;
      to investigate the efficacy of CAIV-T over multiple influenza seasons, and to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of CAIV-T on acute otitis media.&#xD;
