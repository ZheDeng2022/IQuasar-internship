  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study of gemcitabine- Vinorelbine combination in a 3-weekly schedule as&#xD;
      first line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Eighty patients with&#xD;
      measurable disease will be enrolled in the study. Gemcitabine will be used at 1000 mg/m2,&#xD;
      vinorelbine at 25mg/m2. Every cycle, vinorelbine will be administered before gemcitabine.&#xD;
      After the initial dose, modifications of Gemcitabine and vinorelbine doses are allowed based&#xD;
      on patient toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study therapy may continue until:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is evidence of progressive disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient experiences unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigator decides that the patient should be discontinued&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient requests discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient has received 6 cycles of the regimen(if the physician decides to continue&#xD;
           after 6 cycles-this will be done after consultation with the sponsor)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discontinuation from study therapy is indicated according to the protocol It's the&#xD;
           investigator's responsibility to strictly stick to the protocol procedures. It needs to&#xD;
           be discussed with Lilly medical designee in advance when any special situation occurs&#xD;
           which has not been defined in protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patients discontinue from study therapy, they proceed to the post-study follow up phase&#xD;
      of the study. Assessments to take place during this phase are outlined in the protocol.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria-&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological or cytological diagnosis of breast carcinoma with evidence of&#xD;
             unresectable, locally recurrent, or metastatic disease. Lesions should not be amenable&#xD;
             to surgery or radiation of curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of metastatic or local-regional recurrent disease, according to the American&#xD;
             Joint Committee on Cancer (Greenz, et al, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uni-dimensionally measurable lesions with clearly defined margin that are clearly&#xD;
             measurable by following methods according to computerized tomography (CT), Chest x-ray&#xD;
             or clinical examination, according to RECIST criteria (Therasse, et al, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior chemotherapy for metastatic or locoregionally recurrent disease. Prior&#xD;
             adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy with Anthracyclines based regimen is mandatory.&#xD;
             The time from the last dose of prior adjuvant chemotherapy and study entry must be at&#xD;
             least 30 days and patients must have completely recovered from all acute chemotherapy&#xD;
             related toxicities (with exception of alopecia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiotherapy must be completed at least 30 days before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No concurrent hormonal therapy for MBC. Prior hormonal therapy is allowed, the time&#xD;
             from the last dose of prior hormonal therapy for breast cancer to study enrollment&#xD;
             must be at least 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria -&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received treatment within the last 30 days with an investigational drug for any&#xD;
             indication before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent administration of other tumor therapy, including cytotoxic chemotherapy,&#xD;
             surgery of cancer, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy and immunotherapy (including&#xD;
             Herceptin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the&#xD;
             patient's ability to tolerate therapy, unless adequately treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious concomitant disorders that would compromise the safety of the patient or&#xD;
             compromise the patient's ability to complete the study, at the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
