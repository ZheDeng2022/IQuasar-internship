  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the proposed research study is to determine the potential utilization&#xD;
      of [18-F] Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with&#xD;
      complicated diabetic foot, especially in the diagnosis or exclusion of osteomyelitis in this&#xD;
      setting. We intend to validate and establish the necessary criteria for making such a&#xD;
      diagnosis and determine the accuracy of the technique through comparison with other existing&#xD;
      modalities, including MRI, and patient outcome. We expect that at the completion of the&#xD;
      proposed research, the role of these powerful imaging modalities will be clearly defined in&#xD;
      the management of patients with this challenging and serious complication.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      FDG-PET imaging is a promising imaging technique, which has the potential to overcome many of&#xD;
      the shortcomings mentioned previously with regard to radiologic and scintigraphic&#xD;
      methodologies. FDG is a diagnostic tracer utilized to measure the metabolic rates of normal&#xD;
      and abnormal tissues. Many investigators have noted the affinity of FDG for active&#xD;
      inflammatory and infectious disorders, such as sarcoidosis, the abdominal abscess, brain&#xD;
      abscess, lung abscess, renal abscess, inflammatory pancreatic disease, lobar pneumonia,&#xD;
      asthma, tuberculosis, colitis, sinusitis, myositis, mastitis, vasculitis, deep venous&#xD;
      thrombosis, thyroiditis and other infections including those encountered in orthopedic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the literature, the most accurate nuclear medicine modality for detecting&#xD;
      infection associated with diabetic foot is the labeled WBC method. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      FDG-PET imaging has several advantages over this method. Detection of infection by labeled&#xD;
      WBC imaging is based upon the assumption that the administered cells will migrate to the&#xD;
      sites of infection. Since the majority of the labeled leukocyte preparation consists of&#xD;
      neutrophils, inflammatory/infectious processes with a predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate&#xD;
      (acute infections) are likely to yield positive results. However, most infections associated&#xD;
      with diabetic foot are sub-acute or chronic. Consequently, the dominant inflammatory cells&#xD;
      involved are monocytes and lymphocytes. Therefore, labeled leukocytes are unlikely to detect&#xD;
      chronic infection since very few monocytes and lymphocytes are labeled. In addition, the&#xD;
      previous treatment (antibiotics, etc) can severely reduce the chemotropic effect of bacteria&#xD;
      and therefore, fewer leukocytes will migrate to the infectious sites, rendering the labeled&#xD;
      leukocyte method ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, the uptake of FDG in inflammatory cells reflects &quot;in vivo labeling&quot; of the&#xD;
      existing cells at the site of infection soon after the administration of the compound. This&#xD;
      would indicate that FDG-PET technique might allow imaging a substantially larger population&#xD;
      of cells, which are residing in the area of infection and inflammation. Therefore, in&#xD;
      addition to considerable simplification of procedures associated with the labeled WBC method,&#xD;
      including the time required to complete the study, this approach may provide higher&#xD;
      sensitivity for diagnosing infection in such settings. Furthermore, since FDG uptake does not&#xD;
      rely upon leukocyte migration, treatment with antibiotics is less likely to affect its&#xD;
      sensitivity in delineating the sites of infection. One possible advantage of the labeled WBC&#xD;
      method over FDG-PET imaging is that high serum glucose levels do not appear to have an&#xD;
      adverse effect on the test results with the former technique while hyperglycemia is known to&#xD;
      decrease tumor cell FDG uptake. However, our preliminary results indicate that high glucose&#xD;
      levels do not negatively affect FDG uptake by inflammatory cells. Based on these&#xD;
      observations, FDG-PET imaging appears to be an attractive alternative to conventional&#xD;
      techniques for the detection of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDG-PET imaging offers a unique tool for the diagnosis and management of the diabetic foot.&#xD;
      Through the establishment of appropriate diagnostic criteria, a PET scan may prove to be&#xD;
      highly accurate in localizing deep infections of bone and soft tissue associated with the&#xD;
      complicated diabetic foot. By distinguishing these infections from inflammation, it has the&#xD;
      potential to become the optimal diagnostic imaging technique with which to diagnose and&#xD;
      manage patients with diabetic foot. Therefore, research studies designed to further validate&#xD;
      the ability of this technique are essential to achieving this goal.&#xD;

          -  The 240 patients selected for entry into this study will be men or women of any ethnic&#xD;
             background diagnosed with diabetic foot disease by members of the team in the Diabetes&#xD;
             Center of the Department of Medicine and the division of Vascular Surgery of the&#xD;

&#xD;
        Study I: FDG-PET imaging of patients with diabetic foot without clinical suspicion of&#xD;
        osteomyelitis or deep-seated tissue infections The patients must have clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
        uncomplicated diabetic foot. Each patient will undergo appropriate evaluation including&#xD;
        history, physical examination, standard radiographic evaluation (including MRI), and&#xD;
        grading of peripheral neuropathy using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI).&#xD;
        Patients will be divided into three groups, corresponding to MNSI score of 0-3, 4-8, and&#xD;
        9-13, which we will classify as mild, moderate, and severe, respectively. We intend to&#xD;
        enroll 26 patients in each of the first two groups and 27 patients in the third.&#xD;

        osteomyelitis or deep-seated infections The patients must have clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
        complicated diabetic foot. These patients will be those suspected of having a deep-seated&#xD;
        infection and may or may not be scheduled to undergo amputation or debridement of affected&#xD;
        tissue. Each patient will undergo an appropriate evaluation including history, physical&#xD;
        examination, radiologic examination including MRI, MNSI, and vascular assessment by&#xD;
        segmental Doppler pressures and pulse wave recording.&#xD;
