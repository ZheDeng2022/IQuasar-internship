      The purpose of this study is to develop a technique for the intraoperative identification of&#xD;
      human functional and epileptiform cortex using intrinsic signal imaging. The investigators&#xD;
      propose that the ability to optically monitor neuronal activity in a large area of cortex in&#xD;
      &quot;real-time&quot; will be a more sensitive and time-saving method than the electrical methods&#xD;
      currently available. The applications of this technique will not only theoretically increase&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of many of neurosurgical procedures, but will be useful as an&#xD;
      investigational tool to study human cortical physiology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a disease affecting 1-2% of the population. Currently, the only known cure for&#xD;
      epilepsy is surgery, which is much more effective at eliminating seizures arising from the&#xD;
      medial temporal lobe compared with the neocortex. The problem with neocortical epilepsy is&#xD;
      that the population of neurons underlying each epileptiform discharge varies over time. In&#xD;
      addition, the spatial relationship between interictal events and the ictal onset zones, which&#xD;
      are critical in defining the region of epileptogenesis, is not well understood and essential&#xD;
      to the surgical treatment of epilepsy. Electrophysiological recording methods, although&#xD;
      currently the &quot;gold standard&quot; in mapping epilepsy, are inadequate to address these questions&#xD;
      based on restrictions due to volume conduction or sampling limitations. Optical recording&#xD;
      techniques can overcome many of these limitations by sampling large areas of cortex&#xD;
      simultaneously to provide information about blood flow, metabolism and extracellular fluid&#xD;
      shifts that are intimately related to excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity. In fact,&#xD;
      optical recordings may actually be more sensitive to certain aspects of epileptic activity&#xD;
      than electrophysiologic recordings. The goal will be to translate these findings into the&#xD;
      operating room and map human neocortical epilepsy with the same optical techniques. Outcome&#xD;
      following surgical resections to treat neocortical epilepsy will be correlated with the&#xD;
      optical maps to determine the utility of intrinsic signal imaging in guiding brain surgery.&#xD;
      These experiments will set the groundwork for implementing optical recordings in general&#xD;
      clinical practice as a novel technique for mapping and predicting human seizures.&#xD;
