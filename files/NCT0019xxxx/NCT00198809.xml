      Effects of herbal products on weight loss, weight maintenance and metabolic rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of two herbal weight loss&#xD;
           products, BioLean and BioLean Free compared to each other and a matching placebo, in&#xD;
           effects on appetite suppression, changes in metabolism, weight loss, and safety in&#xD;
           overweight men and women over a 12 month active weight loss and weight maintenance&#xD;
           program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a randomized double-blind study. The planned sample size is 180 healthy,&#xD;
           overweight (BMI 27-40) males and females aged 18-60.&#xD;

      â€¢ The study data collection will occur in two phases, active weight loss (phase 1) and weight&#xD;
      maintenance (phase 2). Transition into phase 2 will be individually determined by participant&#xD;
      attainment of a goal 'healthy' weight. During the 52 weeks participants will pick up&#xD;
      supplemental pills, have weight measured, and meet for educational meeting on an every other&#xD;
      week basis. Upon entering phase 2, participants will have the option of educational sessions&#xD;
      on a monthly basis or every other week. Participants will have a goal 'healthy' weight&#xD;
      determined at baseline by a combination of personal goals, Harris Benedict Equation goals,&#xD;
      body composition goals, and BMI range. All participants will be put on a weight reduction&#xD;
      plan to reach these goals and be randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment groups, Biolean,&#xD;
      Biolean Free, or Placebo. Since it is expected some participants will reach goal weight&#xD;
      before others, the 2nd milestone data collection will occur at attainment of goal weight. To&#xD;
      assure all participants have 3 data collection points, any participant who is not expected to&#xD;
      reasonably reach their goal weight by 34 weeks will have the 2nd milestone data collection at&#xD;
      26 weeks. The 3rd milestone data collection for all participants is 52 weeks after initial&#xD;
      intake of supplement. Upon attainment of goal weight and 2nd data collection point,&#xD;
      participants will be educated on a weight maintenance plan and given a new meal plan to&#xD;
      achieve long term healthy weight maintenance.&#xD;
