      Patients with epilepsy undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) have electroencephalograms&#xD;
      (EEGs) recorded before and during their stimulation treatment. Subsequently the investigators&#xD;
      will be using computer-assisted analysis of the digitally-recorded EEG signals to assess the&#xD;
      effects of DBS on the brain-wave frequency content and any abnormal seizure-like patterns&#xD;
      that may be present.&#xD;

      Study Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess EEG changes during electrical stimulation of the&#xD;
      thalamus to treat people with epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background on stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus for epilepsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the estimated 4 million people in the U.S. and Europe with epilepsy, approximately 1.2&#xD;
      million have recurrent seizures that do not respond to antiepileptic drugs. For these&#xD;
      patients, alternative treatments consist of neurosurgical removal of the seizure source from&#xD;
      the brain, or surgical implantation of a device to electrically stimulate the vagus nerve in&#xD;
      the neck. In spite of these options, a significant number of people suffer from seizures that&#xD;
      remain uncontrolled. For this group, deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be helpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for using deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat epilepsy is that DBS disrupts&#xD;
      regulatory feedback loops in the brain that allow seizures to develop and spread. By&#xD;
      influencing these regulatory areas in the brain, electrical stimulation has the capacity to&#xD;
      reduce or eliminate seizures that originate in portions of the brain that cannot safely be&#xD;
      surgically removed. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) works in a similar way against seizures,&#xD;
      but VNS disrupts the regulatory loops indirectly, while DBS disrupts the regulatory loops&#xD;
      directly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thalamus is an appealing target for DBS to treat epilepsy because it has widespread&#xD;
      connections to, and influences on, the cerebral cortex, which is the outer layer of the brain&#xD;
      where seizures originate. Fourteen patients with various types of refractory epilepsy have&#xD;
      been treated with stimulation of the anterior nucleus (AN) of the thalamus during the past&#xD;
      several years. During the first 3 months of AN stimulation, the median seizure frequency&#xD;
      reduction, relative to baseline, was 64%. Eight of the 14 patients (57%) had a 50% or greater&#xD;
      decrease in seizure frequency (responders). Nine of the 14 patients had seizures presumed to&#xD;
      arise from the temporal or frontal lobes. During the first 3 months, these 9 patients had a&#xD;
      median 80% reduction in seizure frequency and 78% of them were responders. The AN was&#xD;
      selected for stimulation because of its many connections to the &quot;limbic system&quot;, a cortical&#xD;
      system which is often a source of seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies of thalamic stimulation for epilepsy (centromedian nucleus [CM]) The majority&#xD;
      of the research addressing stimulation of the thalamic centromedian nucleus (CM) for the&#xD;
      treatment of epilepsy has been reported by Velasco et al. (1-3). In 1987, the group published&#xD;
      a paper in which 5 patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures were implanted&#xD;
      bilaterally. Stimulation was delivered 2 hours per day for 3 months. All patients experienced&#xD;
      an 80-100% reduction in generalized tonic-clonic seizures and a 60-100% reduction in partial&#xD;
      complex seizures. Much of the benefit observed continued beyond the 2-hour period of&#xD;
      stimulation, suggesting that the stimulation resulted in a long-term change in thalamic&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1993, the same group published a report of 23 patients with externalized CM&#xD;
      stimulators(2,3) (9 with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, 3 with focal motor and secondary&#xD;
      generalized seizures, 5 with partial complex and secondary generalized seizures, and 6 with&#xD;
      generalized tonic seizures and atypical absence seizures). These investigators found that&#xD;
      stimulation resulted in a significant decrease in seizure frequency in the patients with&#xD;
      tonic-clonic and partial motor seizures. However, no significant changes were observed in&#xD;
      patients with complex partial seizures or generalized tonic seizures. Overall, 12 of the 23&#xD;
      patients had at least a 50% decrease in seizure frequency, and 1 patient was seizure free.&#xD;
&#xD;
      None of these studies from the Mexico City group (Velasco et al.) were blinded or controlled.&#xD;
      However, in 1992, Fisher et al. (4) from John Hopkins reported a double-blind, controlled&#xD;
      trial of CM stimulation. This treatment had no effects on the patients. Therefore, CM&#xD;
      stimulation was abandoned and AN stimulation was undertaken instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalograms (EEG) and thalamic stimulation for epilepsy An electroencephalogram&#xD;
      (EEG) is a recording of brain wave electrical activity. The cerebral cortex nerve cells&#xD;
      generate the EEG signal. The principal features of the EEG studied in patients with epilepsy&#xD;
      are: 1) how rapidly and often the electrical signal changes amplitude (&quot;frequency&quot;), and 2)&#xD;
      any abnormal excessive very brief unexpected electrical discharge (&quot;spike-waves&quot;).&#xD;
      Spike-waves are the type discharges characteristic of patients with epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical stimulation of the CM nucleus of the thalamus has resulted in less EEG spike-waves&#xD;
      (1-3). However, there have been no studies of EEG frequency in epilepsy patients receiving AN&#xD;
      stimulation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study the investigators will record EEGs on computerized monitors. These recording&#xD;
      machines are small portable computers (about the size of a &quot;Walk-Man&quot;) which the patient&#xD;
      wears for one hour. The brain-wave sensing electrodes are attached to the patients' scalp&#xD;
      with a water-soluble temporary conducting glue. These monitors are placed on the patients in&#xD;
      the EEG laboratory at New York Hospital-Cornell. The recorded EEG signal is downloaded to our&#xD;
      EEG analysis computer. This is a routine test commonly performed to evaluate patients with&#xD;
      epilepsy, and the ambulatory EEG in and of itself is not experimental in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEGs will be recorded at the following times relative to the DBS treatment for epilepsy: 1&#xD;
      month before stimulator implant, 1 month after stimulator implant (but before stimulator&#xD;
      activation), after 3 months of DBS, after 6 months of DBS, and thereafter every 6 months or&#xD;
      after stimulation setting changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recorded EEGs will be mathematically analyzed, according to the following line of&#xD;
      reasoning: Nerve cells in the thalamic AN connect to the cerebral cortex. AN activity (and AN&#xD;
      stimulation) therefore may change how rapidly the electrical potentials of the cortex nerve&#xD;
      cells change, which in turn may change the EEG frequency content. The investigators will&#xD;
      utilize computer programs to determine the EEG frequency content, using a tool called&#xD;
      &quot;spectral analysis&quot;. The investigators will compare the spectral analysis between different&#xD;
      time periods during the DBS treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another feature the investigators will study is &quot;EEG coherence&quot;. This is a computer-generated&#xD;
      measure of how similar the brain wave frequencies are in different brain cortex regions.&#xD;
      Since AN nerve cell activity regulates cortex nerve cell activity, AN stimulation may cause&#xD;
      cortical activity in different regions of the brain to be more similar to each other. This&#xD;
      type of change in cortical activity might be part of the mechanism of action of DBS against&#xD;
      epilepsy. The investigators will compare the coherence analysis between different times&#xD;
      during the DBS treatment regimen.&#xD;
