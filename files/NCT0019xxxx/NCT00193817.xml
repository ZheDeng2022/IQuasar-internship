    <textblock>
      Surgery is the standard treatment for esophageal (food pipe) cancer. Esophageal cancer is&#xD;
      known to spread to the lymph nodes (glands) adjacent to the esophagus. The extent of lymph&#xD;
      nodes that need to be removed along with removal of the esophagus is a controversial topic.&#xD;
      The basic surgery will remain the same i.e., the foodpipe in the chest will be removed and a&#xD;
      new substitute will be created from the stomach and joined to the foodpipe in the neck. This&#xD;
      will involve incisions in the chest, abdomen and neck. We intend to compare two types of&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy (removal of lymph nodes) - the two field lymphadenectomy, whereby the lymph&#xD;
      nodes in the abdomen and the lower half of the chest will be removed and three field&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy, wherein lymph nodes in the abdomen, the whole chest and the lower neck will&#xD;
      be removed. Both these procedures are practised widely worldwide and there is no definite&#xD;
      scientific evidence showing the superiority of either of them. We are conducting this study&#xD;
      to see whether one of these procedures is superior to the other. Seven hundred patients are&#xD;
      expected to participate in this study.&#xD;

      Three field radical esophagectomy versus two field esophagectomy - a prospective randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Esophageal cancer is a common problem worldwide and is associated with poor&#xD;
      prognosis. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment and offers the only realistic possibility of&#xD;
      cure and long term survival. Neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been&#xD;
      tried in addition to surgery and have only marginally impacted on survival. In spite of&#xD;
      advancements in postoperative care and refinements in surgical technique, overall results&#xD;
      with surgery have been disappointing. Moreover studies of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      have been confounded by the lack of a uniform surgical approach and extent of&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of prophylactic radical lymph node dissection in surgical treatment of&#xD;
      esophageal cancer has been a topic of major controversy for many years. It has not been&#xD;
      studied in a randomized controlled trial with adequate numbers. Non randomized studies have&#xD;
      been criticized on the basis of selection bias and stage migration. There is presently no&#xD;
      convincing evidence regarding improvement in survival by extensive three field&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare overall survival after three field and two field esophagectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare locoregional recurrence, disease free survival after three field and two&#xD;
           field esophagectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare postoperative morbidity and mortality in the two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate short and long term quality of life after the two procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Prospective randomized controlled trial Setting Tertiary level comprehensive cancer&#xD;
      care centre in Western India. Patients and methods All patients with biopsy proven carcinoma&#xD;
      of the esophagus presenting to our hospital will be considered for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with biopsy or cytology proven (squamous or adenocarcinoma) esophageal cancer&#xD;
           (including Siewert's type I and II CO junction cancers)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with staging investigations indicating operability&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Surgical plan for total transthoracic esophagectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with low performance status (ECOG score &gt; 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Past history of malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Staging investigations indicating advanced disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients medically unfit for surgical resection&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients with pulmonary reserve inadequate to undergo thoracotomy and extensive&#xD;
           mediastinal dissection&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients considered for salvage surgery after definitive chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patients unreliable for follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Patients above the age of 70 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Patients with enlarged supracarinal nodes on CT scan / EUS&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Grossly enlarged supracarinal lymph nodes seen intraoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Patients with Siewert's type III cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed history including the main complaints and symptoms, symptoms suggestive of&#xD;
      advanced disease or dissemination, comorbid conditions and performance status of the patient&#xD;
      will be recorded on presentation. A confirmed diagnosis of esophageal carcinoma will be&#xD;
      documented in our hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staging investigations will be standard and will include&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Computed Tomography (CT) scans in all patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Endoscopic Ultrasonography (EUS) wherever possible&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (all upper and middle third growths and patients with history of&#xD;
           recent voice change).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Symptomatic patients will undergo further investigations depending on the symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy will not be excluded but&#xD;
      will be one of the stratification criteria for randomization. Patients will be assessed for&#xD;
      operability by a team including two qualified thoracic surgeons and a radiologist. All&#xD;
      patients will undergo routine and special investigations where indicated to assess fitness&#xD;
      for major surgery and anesthesia. The perioperative risk will be assessed by a combination of&#xD;
      the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grading and a modified risk score (Annexure&#xD;
      1). Patients with ASA grade I or II and those who have low or intermediate risk according to&#xD;
      the modified risk scoring system will be considered for the trial. Patients will be explained&#xD;
      about the trial and written informed consent will be taken (Annexure 2). Patients considered&#xD;
      operable (either per primum or after neoadjuvant therapy) and fit for either procedure and&#xD;
      who consent for the trial (Eligibility confirmation and randomization form, annexure 3) will&#xD;
      be randomized into two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Block randomization will be done using a computer generated sheet.&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed intraoperatively after confirming resectability of the&#xD;
      primary tumor and confirming the absence of grossly enlarged supracarinal lymph nodes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preoperative T stage (T1&amp;2, T3 and T4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preoperative N stage (N0, N1)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        4. Neoadjuvant therapy (none, chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Histology (squamous or adenocarcinoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients considered for the trial will have a proforma filled for pre, intra and&#xD;
      postoperative details (Annexure 4). Preoperative patient preparation would be routine and&#xD;
      identical in both groups and will include chest physiotherapy, deep breathing exercises and&#xD;
      incentive spirometry. Bronchodilators and antibiotics will be used selectively only if&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;

&#xD;
      All surgeries will be performed under general anesthesia with epidural analgesia. The surgery&#xD;
      will be either performed by or under the direct supervision of consultant thoracic surgeons&#xD;
      with experience in esophageal surgery. Thoracic esophageal mobilization and mediastinal&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy will be done by open thoracotomy or video assisted thoracoscopic surgery.&#xD;
      Lymphadenectomy will be as defined in the consensus conference of the fifth IGSC at Munich.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Field 1. The abdominal field will include all lymphatic and connective tissues between the&#xD;
      hiatus cranially, the upper border of the pancreas caudally, the splenic hilum to the left&#xD;
      and the hepatoduodenal ligament and right gastric artery to the right.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Field II. This refers to the intrathoracic compartment and is defined as&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard lymphadenectomy: This includes para esophageal lymph nodes, subcarinal lymph&#xD;
           nodes and right and left para bronchial lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Extended lymphadenectomy: This includes the standard lymphadenectomy plus the right&#xD;
           apical nodes, right recurrent nerve nodes and the right paratracheal nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Total lymphadenectomy: This includes the extended lymphadenectomy plus the left apical&#xD;
           nodes plus the left recurrent nerve and paratracheal nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Field III. This refers to the cervical compartment and includes clearance in the omohyoid&#xD;
      triangle with sparing of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein. The&#xD;
      cranial landmark is the cricoid cartilage and the caudal landmark the upper margin of the&#xD;
      clavicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three-field lymphadenectomy: The type of resection will include lymph node clearance of&#xD;
      Fields I and III and a total type Field II lymphadenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two field lymphadenectomy: The type of resection will include lymph node clearance of Field I&#xD;
      and any of the types of lymphadenectomy in Field II. Standard mediastinal lymphadenectomy&#xD;
      will be done in all patients; no special effort will be made to dissect the supracarinal&#xD;
      compartment unless grossly enlarged lymph nodes are seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three field lymphadenectomy Two field lymphadenectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative time, blood loss, blood product replacement and all intraoperative details will be&#xD;
      recorded in the proforma. Patients will be shifted postoperatively to the intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) for observation and subsequently to the recovery or high dependency ward once&#xD;
      stabilized. Postoperative details including period of postoperative ventilation, hemorrhage,&#xD;
      pulmonary and cardiac complications, arrhythmias, thoracic duct leak, anastomotic leak, wound&#xD;
      infection and recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis or palsy will be recorded. Postoperative&#xD;
      complications will be recorded as per Annexure 5. Postoperative mortality will be defined as&#xD;
      30-day mortality plus death before discharge after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be started on oral feeds between the 8th and 10th day in the absence of an&#xD;
      anastomotic leak. The total duration of ICU stay and hospital stay will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Patients will be followed up four to six monthly for the first three years and&#xD;
      annually thereafter. A detailed history and clinical examination will be done on every follow&#xD;
      up with the quality of speech, swallowing recorded. Patients who had a fixed cord&#xD;
      postoperatively will undergo laryngoscopy to assess recovery of function. Symptomatic&#xD;
      patients will be investigated by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, CT scan, ultrasound and&#xD;
      haematological and biochemical investigations. Asymptomatic patients will not be routinely&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size considering an improvement of survival from 25% to 35% will be&#xD;
      588 patients (289 in each arm). The trial will aim at enrolling 700 patients in order to&#xD;
      adjust for loss to follow up and protocol violations. Interim analyses will be done when ¼ th&#xD;
      (103 events) and ½ (206 events) of the estimated events occur. We expect to complete accrual&#xD;
      of patients in seven years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management All collected data will be entered into a statistical software package for&#xD;
      subsequent analysis (SPSS for Windows, Version 11.5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main research variables Primary end point Overall survival in the two arms Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints&#xD;
