  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Of the more than 2 million Americans with heart failure (HF), up to 70% have disturbed sleep&#xD;
      that worsens the dyspnea, fatigue, and reduced daytime function associated with HF. Exercise&#xD;
      improves sleep in healthy people but the effects of exercise have not been tested in patients&#xD;
      with HF. A controlled, randomized trial is proposed to compare the effects of 16 weeks of&#xD;
      usual activity (control) with 16 weeks of regular, supervised walking exercise (treatment),&#xD;
      on cardiac function and sleep. Approximately 170 subjects with NYHA Class I, II, or III&#xD;
      stable heart failure will be recruited. Subjects in the treatment group will walk for&#xD;
      exercise up to 5 times a week for up to 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized trial is to examine the effects of 16 weeks of regular walking&#xD;
      exercise on cardiac function, sleep, and quality of life in persons with stable New York&#xD;
      Heart Association (NYHA) Class I, II or III heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the physiologic measures of cardiac function (peak oxygen utilization,&#xD;
           exercise capacity, nocturnal arterial oxygen desaturations, and heart rate variability)&#xD;
           and self-reported quality of life (i.e., symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue, and the&#xD;
           ability to perform activities of daily living) of patients randomized to walking vs.&#xD;
           control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the somnographic (sleep fragmentation, slow wave sleep, sleep efficiency) and&#xD;
           self-reported (sleep effectiveness, sleep disturbance, and nap supplementation) measures&#xD;
           of sleep for HF patients randomized to walking vs. control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Considering the extent of apnea-hypopnea episodes at study entry and group assignment&#xD;
           (walking vs. control), explore whether HF patients with frequent apnea-hypopnea episodes&#xD;
           (more than 20 per hour) in the walking group experience greater pretest-posttest&#xD;
           improvements in physiologic cardiac and somnographic function, when compared with HF&#xD;
           patients with few apnea-hypopnea episodes (less than 20 per hour) assigned to walking,&#xD;
           or the control group of HF patients with frequent or few apnea-hypopnea episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Heart failure patients who walk regularly will have better cardiac function than the&#xD;
           control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Heart failure patients who walk regularly will have higher self-reported quality of&#xD;
           life, less shortness of breath/fatigue, and greater ability to perform activities of&#xD;
           daily living than the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Heart failure patients who walk regularly will have better sleep than the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Heart failure patients with frequent episodes of slowed or stopped breathing during&#xD;
           sleep who walk regularly will have a greater improvement in pretest-posttest measures of&#xD;
           cardiac function than heart failure patients with few episodes of slowed or stopped&#xD;
           breathing during sleep who walk regularly, or the control groups with frequent or few&#xD;
           breathing difficulties during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart failure patients with frequent apnea-hypopnea episodes who walk regularly will have a&#xD;
      greater improvement (i.e., larger difference) in pretest-posttest somnographic sleep measures&#xD;
      of efficient, fragmented, and slow wave sleep, than heart failure patients with few&#xD;
      apnea-hypopnea episodes who walk regularly, or the control groups with frequent or few&#xD;
      apnea-hypopnea episodes.&#xD;

      PROCEDURES. Walking Exercise Intervention. An individualized program of walking exercise is&#xD;
      prescribed (walking up to 5 times a week for up to 30 minutes each session). The protocol for&#xD;
      this walking intervention is based on exercise programs adapted from 12 research protocols&#xD;
      for patients with NYHA Class II-III heart failure, one cardiac rehabilitation protocol in use&#xD;
      for approximately 20 years; and the AHCPR Clinical Practice Guidelines for activity&#xD;
      prescriptions for heart failure patients. The walking exercise prescription is based on a&#xD;
      modified Naughton treadmill test and a 6-minute walk test, both conducted as part of&#xD;
      eligibility screening and used as pretest measures. The target exercise heart rate range is&#xD;
      calculated from the peak heart rate (measured on treadmill at the peak of oxygen utilization)&#xD;
      minus the resting heart rate, multiplied by 40% to 60%, plus the resting heart rate. Weekly&#xD;
      for 6 weeks, and then every other week for 10 weeks, the research nurse makes visits to&#xD;
      initiate, monitor, and advance an individualized program of walking exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION. Our target population was persons diagnosed with heart failure (HF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pretest and posttest measures include an exercise tolerance test; two nights of somnographic&#xD;
      sleep and oxygen saturation recordings; one 24-hour recording of heart rate variability; and&#xD;
      subjective reports of quality of life. One-way analyses of variances (ANOVA) will be used to&#xD;
      test for control-treatment group differences in cardiac function (Aim 1) and sleep (Aim 2).&#xD;
      Interaction will be examined in a two-way ANOVA of group (HF subjects with frequent vs. few&#xD;
      apnea-hypopnea episodes walking vs.control) and time (before and after condition) to&#xD;
      determine whether HF subjects with frequent apnea-hypopnea episodes who exercise have better&#xD;
      outcomes than HF subjects with few apnea-hypopnea episodes who exercise, or the control group&#xD;
      (Aim 3).&#xD;
