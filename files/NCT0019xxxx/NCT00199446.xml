  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a very common neurological disorder with a prevalence of&#xD;
      approximately 10% in the adult population. It is characterized by an almost irresistible urge&#xD;
      to move the legs, usually accompanied by feelings of intense discomfort. The feelings are&#xD;
      usually present while at rest and are temporarily relieved by activity. Symptoms are worse in&#xD;
      the evening and at night and lead to profound sleep disturbance and daytime fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a number of therapeutic approaches have been used to treat the symptoms of RLS, none&#xD;
      have been universally adopted. While it has been shown that some dopaminergic&#xD;
      anti-parkinsonian medications are effective in treating RLS, their use may be somewhat&#xD;
      limited by side effects associated with long-term dopaminergic activation. Istradefylline may&#xD;
      provide a nondopaminergic approach to the treatment of RLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the efficacy of 40 mg per day of istradefylline in improving the&#xD;
      symptoms of RLS with placebo.&#xD;
