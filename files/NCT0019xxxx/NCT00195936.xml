  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure the effect of cinacalcet (Sensipar) on parathyroid hormone (PTH)&#xD;
      secretion in children and adolescents with hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH). The investigators&#xD;
      are seeking evidence that patients with XLH may benefit from treatment with cinacalcet by&#xD;
      achieving better control of PTH secretion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) is an X-linked dominant genetic disorder. Common&#xD;
      findings are low serum phosphate and inadequate 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D production. It is&#xD;
      generally believed that the primary defect in XLH is impaired renal tubular transport of&#xD;
      phosphate coupled with abnormal regulation of the enzyme responsible for the 1-alfa&#xD;
      hydroxylation of 25(OH) vitamin D. The current treatment of children with XLH is large oral&#xD;
      doses of phosphate and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. There are two common side effects to this&#xD;
      treatment; nephrocalcinosis and secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT). The latter at times may&#xD;
      cause hypertension, hypercalcemia, and permanent renal damage. The complication of secondary&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism is seen in 20% of the patients. The release of PTH from the glands into&#xD;
      the circulation is tightly regulated by serum calcium concentration. The glands &quot;read&quot; serum&#xD;
      calcium concentration via Ca sensing receptors (CaR) which are located at the surface of the&#xD;
      glands. Calcimimetics are compounds that allosterically modulate the CaR, thereby enhancing&#xD;
      its sensitivity to circulating serum calcium concentrations and consequently decreasing PTH&#xD;
      secretion. When used in primary HPT, they rapidly reduce PTH level and normalize serum&#xD;
      calcium concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent recently approved by the FDA for treating hypercalcemia in&#xD;
      patients with parathyroid carcinoma and secondary HPT in patients with chronic renal disease.&#xD;
      Cinacalcet was found to be effective in decreasing both PTH level and the calcium X&#xD;
      phosphorous ion product in dialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of our proposed acute study is to see whether concomitant administration of&#xD;
      Cinacalcet and phosphate, to patients with XLH, will block completely or partially secretion&#xD;
      of PTH (day 2), expected to be seen following administration of phosphate alone (day 1). We&#xD;
      will also monitor serum phosphate, total calcium, and ionized calcium concentration to learn&#xD;
      to what extent, if any, blockage of PTH secretion affects mineral homeostasis under this&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If found to be effective in blocking PTH secretion, Cinacalcet will become a candidate for a&#xD;
      long-term study in children with XLH to protect them from developing secondary&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism.&#xD;
