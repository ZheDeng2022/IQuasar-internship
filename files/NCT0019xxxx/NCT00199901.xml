  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess whether treatment with NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX® vaccine&#xD;
      improves outcomes for people with Malignant Melanoma which has been removed, but is at high&#xD;
      risk of relapse.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NY-ESO-1 protein is an immune target found in many cancers including melanoma. ISCOMATRIX®&#xD;
      adjuvant enhances immune responses. This trial compares NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX® vaccine with&#xD;
      ISCOMATRIX® adjuvant alone to assess whether treatment with NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX® vaccine&#xD;
      improves outcomes for participants with Malignant Melanoma which has been removed, but is at&#xD;
      high risk of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants are randomly allocated to a treatment arm. Treatment involves four&#xD;
      intramuscular (into a muscle) injections (1 injection every 4 weeks x 3, plus 1 injection at&#xD;
      6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are assessed for recurrence of melanoma, safety and immune responses (by blood&#xD;
      test) over the 18 month study period. Off study, their own doctor will follow them for&#xD;
      melanoma recurrence and survival.&#xD;

    <description>The number of patients who were alive and relapse free 18 months after starting therapy and the number of patients who relapsed or died within 18 months of starting therapy.&#xD;
Disease was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) as measured by CT. Disease progression or relapse was based on an increase of 20% or more in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, the appearance of any new lesion as confirmed by CT scan or death.</description>

    <description>Toxicity was graded in accordance with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Adverse events (AEs) were reported based on clinical laboratory tests, vital sign and weight measurements, physical examinations, performance status evaluations, electrocardiograms, magnetic resonance imaging, and any other medically indicated assessments, including subject interviews, from the time informed consent is signed through 18 months. AEs were considered to be treatment emergent (TEAE) if they occurred or worsened in severity after the first dose of study treatment.</description>
