  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Circulating concentrations of cytokines, such as leptin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and&#xD;
      interleukins 1 and 6 are increased in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In light of&#xD;
      the increasing recognition that growth hormone receptor signaling involves cytokine pathway&#xD;
      activation, the investigators hypothesize that maladaptation of cytokine regulation in&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease may underlie growth failure. Secondly, they hypothesize that&#xD;
      administration of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) will result in growth rate&#xD;
      stimulation in pre-pubertal children with growth impairment due to chronic kidney disease by&#xD;
      down regulation of the cytokine pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomized open-label study to evaluate the effect of recombinant human growth&#xD;
      hormone on biochemical/metabolic and immunologic parameters in relation to body composition&#xD;
      pre- and post-recombinant human growth hormone therapy of pre-pubertal growth hormone naive&#xD;
      children. The efficacy of recombinant human growth hormone to improve growth velocity in&#xD;
      pre-pubertal children with growth failure is a secondary objective. Fifteen children are to&#xD;
      be studied over a six month period. Each patient will serve as his/her own control. Six&#xD;
      months of growth data prior to study is required.&#xD;

      Hypothesis: The energy cost of growth is increased in experimental CKD. Caloric intake has&#xD;
      been shown to correlate with height velocity in children with CKD, and calorie&#xD;
      supplementation has been clearly shown to improve height velocity in children on dialysis.&#xD;
      However, when energy intake exceeds 75% of the recommended allowance, further growth&#xD;
      improvement does not occur. Circulating concentrations of cytokines, such as leptin, tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-alpha and interleukins 1 and 6 are increased in patients with CKD. In light&#xD;
      of the increasing recognition that growth hormone receptor signaling involves cytokine&#xD;
      pathway activation, we hypothesize that maladaptation of cytokine regulation in CKD may&#xD;
      underlie growth failure. Secondly, we hypothesize that administration of recombinant human&#xD;
      growth hormone (rhGH) will result in growth rate stimulation in pre-pubertal children with&#xD;
      growth impairment due to CKD by down regulation of the cytokine pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: This investigation's primary objective will be to evaluate&#xD;
      biochemical/metabolic, and immunologic parameters in relation to body composition pre- and&#xD;
      post-rhGH therapy. The secondary objective is to examine the efficacy of rhGH to improve&#xD;
      growth velocity in prepubertal, rhGH naïve, children with growth failure secondary to CKD.&#xD;
      The safety of rhGH will be assessed by measuring the above parameters, in addition to&#xD;
      identifying if there is an increase in the incidence of slipped capital femoral epiphyses,&#xD;
      and an increase in progression of the underlying renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of Procedure: This is an open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      recombinant human growth hormone in children with chronic kidney disease and growth failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves obtaining the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical History and Physical Examination: Subjects will have a complete medical history&#xD;
           for any potential conditions/medications, which might affect linear growth, growth&#xD;
           velocity, or responsiveness to rhGH. A complete physical examination will be performed,&#xD;
           including Tanner Staging, accurate measurement of standing height (or recumbent length,&#xD;
           if &lt; 3 years of age) using a stadiometer (in triplicate), weight (in triplicate), blood&#xD;
           pressure and funduscopic examination at each referring Center. Anthropometric&#xD;
           measurements will be made at the Body Composition Unit at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical&#xD;
           Center, New York, NY.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Routine labs will include a CBC (Hgb/ Hct), BUN, creatinine, liver function studies, and&#xD;
           albumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bone Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Leptin&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Cytokines that will be measured include IL-6, TNF alpha, TNFsR, Rp55 (type1), IL-1beta,&#xD;
           and IL-1Ra. The ratio of IL-1 to IL-1Ra will be measured as intracellular and&#xD;
           extracellular IL-1b compared to extracellular IL-Ra measured in circulation and as&#xD;
           produced in vitro, both spontaneously and in response to activation. TNF alpha levels&#xD;
           and production both intracellularly and extracellularly will be compared to TNFsRp55&#xD;
           (type 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. GH-IGF Axis Proteins&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Body Composition by DXA&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the two years of the study, we anticipate that 15 eligible subjects will receive rhGH&#xD;
      at 0.05 mg/kg daily by subcutaneous injection. This estimate of patient enrollment is based&#xD;
      upon our preliminary data and our experience with the incidence, age of onset of CKD, and the&#xD;
      anticipated change in therapy as some of these patients receive transplants. The dose will be&#xD;
      calculated based on the initial weight and will be adjusted as needed every three months&#xD;
      according to weight. A parent or legal guardian will administer all doses at home after&#xD;
      appropriate training. Following treatment for 6 months and termination from the study,&#xD;
      patients who remain eligible due to persistent growth retardation, will receive daily rhGH as&#xD;
      standard of care therapy at their institution and their growth rates will be followed. During&#xD;
      the course of the study all study subjects will continue medical management and follow-up of&#xD;
      their CKD as prescribed by their Pediatric Nephrologist. Subjects may require concomitant&#xD;
      medications such as erythropoietin, calcium supplements, sodium bicarbonate/sodium citrate,&#xD;
      phosphate binders, calcitriol, and/or antihypertensives as part on their on-going management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline assessment (Time 0), all study subjects will enter a six-month observation&#xD;
      phase. Medical history, physical examination, biochemical studies, creatinine clearance for&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR), Hgb/Hct, Glucose Tolerance testing (GTT) with insulin&#xD;
      measurements, GH-IGF axis proteins, cytokine and leptin studies will be obtained at Time 0,&#xD;
      +3 months, and +6 months. At Time 0 and at the end of six months of observation, study&#xD;
      subjects will also undergo body composition evaluation (DXA) for a total of two sets of&#xD;
      studies. Bone age will be assessed at these time points as well. Each patient will serve as&#xD;
      his/her own control at Time 0 for all these measurements. Historical growth data will be&#xD;
      obtained back as far as six months, and further, if possible.&#xD;
