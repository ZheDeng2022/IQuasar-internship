      Several clinical studies in Western countries have revealed that the prevalence of HIT is 0.5&#xD;
      to 5%, varying depending on the clinical setting. Thirty to 50% of HIT patients suffer from&#xD;
      thromboembolic events, and the mortality of HIT is 10 to 20%. In contrast, many physicians in&#xD;
      Japan report no experience in treating HIT, although approximately 200,000 patients per year&#xD;
      receive heparin. This raises the possibility that the prevalence of HIT might be much lower&#xD;
      in Japan than in Western countries. In fact, neither the drug for HIT treatment nor the&#xD;
      laboratory test for HIT diagnosis has been approved by the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law in&#xD;
      Japan. We have therefore conducted a multi-center, prospective cohort study to determine the&#xD;
      prevalence and profile of HIT in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery or percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention. Approximately 1,500 patients will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heparin is an important anticoagulation treatment, especially for cardiovascular patients.&#xD;
      Recently, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT) has been shown to be an&#xD;
      immune-mediated, life-threatening side effect of heparin therapy. Antibodies against&#xD;
      heparin-platelet factor 4 (HIT antibodies), induced by heparin administration, are the major&#xD;
      cause of HIT. HIT antibodies can stimulate platelets and endothelial cells, resulting in an&#xD;
      excess production of thrombin, inducing thrombocytopenia and thromboembolic events. HIT&#xD;
      typically occurs 5 to 14 days after the initial administration of heparin (typical-onset).&#xD;
      HIT antibodies are transient but can be detected for about 100 days after the cessation of&#xD;
      heparin treatment. Thus, some patients develop HIT either days after discontinuing heparin&#xD;
      (delayed-onset) or soon after the re-administration of heparin (rapid-onset). HIT is&#xD;
      clinically diagnosed by a drop in platelet count to less than 100,000/μL or a 50% decrease in&#xD;
      platelets after the initiation of heparin therapy with no apparent explanation other than&#xD;
      HIT. A positive laboratory test for HIT antibodies supports the clinical diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical studies in Western countries have revealed that the prevalence of HIT is 0.5&#xD;
      to 5%, varying depending on the clinical setting. Thirty to 50% of HIT patients suffer from&#xD;
      thromboembolic events, and the mortality of HIT is 10 to 20%. In contrast, many physicians in&#xD;
      Japan report no experience in treating HIT, although approximately 200,000 patients per year&#xD;
      receive heparin. This raises the possibility that the prevalence of HIT might be much lower&#xD;
      in Japan than in Western countries. In fact, neither the drug for HIT treatment nor the&#xD;
      laboratory test for HIT diagnosis has been approved by the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law in&#xD;
      Japan. We have therefore conducted a multi-center, prospective cohort study to determine the&#xD;
      prevalence and profile of HIT in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery or percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention. Approximately 1,500 patients will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
