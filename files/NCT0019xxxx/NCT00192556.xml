  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether food is a cost-effective method for improving treatment&#xD;
      compliance for TB patients in Timor Leste. Our hypothesis is that the provision of locally&#xD;
      available, locally acceptable, cheap and highly nutritious food at the clinic will encourage&#xD;
      patients to come for daily directly observed treatment, and thus improve the chance of TB&#xD;
      cure and decrease the chance of the development of TB drug resistance. Primary outcome will&#xD;
      be successful completion of treatment and secondary outcomes will include treatment&#xD;
      compliance and clinical and biological measures of nutritional improvement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a randomised controlled trial of a food intervention to improve&#xD;
      compliance in East Timor. Patients will be diagnosed in the usual way and given the&#xD;
      opportunity to enrol in the study. Consenting individuals will be randomised to receive the&#xD;
      intervention (meal at the clinic daily during the first two months of treatment and a food&#xD;
      parcel fortnightly during the other six months of treatment) or standard care (nutritional&#xD;
      advice only). The primary outcome will be TB cure rates and the secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      include response to treatment (weight gain, decreased symptoms, sputum clearance) and&#xD;
      percentage of days attended at the clinic. In conjunction with this study of TB treatment&#xD;
      compliance we will collect blood samples to measure micro-nutrient changes in response to the&#xD;
      food intervention. A cost-effectiveness analysis of the intervention will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to do a pilot study in three urban clinics in Dili to establish feasibility and&#xD;
      provide pilot data for other funding applications so that, if the intervention does improve&#xD;
      compliance, and funding applications are successful, we can expand the project to include&#xD;
      rural districts in conjunction with the National TB Control Program. Ultimately, the health&#xD;
      outcome addressed by this project is improved control of tuberculosis in a high burden, low&#xD;
      income setting. Better compliance with tuberculosis treatment at the community level will&#xD;
      contribute to this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of the project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Design a locally appropriate food intervention to improve adherence to TB treatment and&#xD;
           TB treatment outcomes in East Timor; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct a study of the intervention in three clinics in Dili. If this pilot study is&#xD;
           successful, we will use our experience and pilot data to obtain funds to generalise the&#xD;
           intervention to rural clinics as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Food incentives are an achievable, effective method of encouraging full adherence to&#xD;
           DOTS and thus improved cure rates in East Timor;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Locally available, whole food supplements are a cost-effective intervention to improve&#xD;
           cure rates in East Timor; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Lessons learned in East Timor are adaptable to other settings in other parts of the&#xD;
           world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes and its measurements :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To show statistically significant differences in treatment success (cure rate) between&#xD;
           the intervention and the control arm. We will assess the sputum clearance, treatment&#xD;
           compliance and treatment completion rates and compare the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To show the effectiveness of food supplementation in improving compliance with&#xD;
           treatment. In the intensive phase of treatment (usually the first two months), we will&#xD;
           compare the observed versus expected daily visits to the clinic, compliance with daily&#xD;
           medications and the default rate between the intervention and control arms. In the&#xD;
           continuation phase of treatment (usually 6 months), we will compare the observed versus&#xD;
           expected fortnightly visits to the clinic, daily medication diaries and default rates&#xD;
           between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To show a statistically significant difference in nutritional status between the&#xD;
           intervention arm and the control arm. We will measure clinical improvement, sputum&#xD;
           clearance (in sputum smear positive patients), gain in BMI, changes in bio-impedence and&#xD;
           improvement in levels of micronutrients in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention to improve TB control in East&#xD;
           Timor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of two interventions: food&#xD;
      supplements or nutritional advice (standard care). The random assignment to intervention&#xD;
      group will be provided by the statistician at the Menzies School of Health Research. The&#xD;
      random allocation sequence will be computer-generated (Stata Version 8.0) and concealed from&#xD;
      all investigators throughout the study. Allocation will be stratified by community health&#xD;
      clinic and by the TB diagnosis (sputum smear positive and other). Block randomisation will be&#xD;
      used to maintain similar numbers of participants in both intervention groups and to minimise&#xD;
      the potential influence of time of enrolment. The random allocation will be in sealed&#xD;
      envelopes in two boxes (smear positive and other) in each clinic. Prior to opening the&#xD;
      envelope, the research assistant will complete the randomisation form to check if the patient&#xD;
      is eligible for enrolment, obtain informed consent and complete the enrolment questionnaire.&#xD;
      The research assistant will then inform the local investigator of the name of the patient,&#xD;
      the time of randomisation and the randomisation number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of patients who successfully complete&#xD;
           the eight month course of TB treatment and achieve cure in each group (treatment&#xD;
           success) and the proportion of patients who do not complete treatment (defaulters) or&#xD;
           have persistent disease (treatment failure). The primary analysis will be by intention&#xD;
           to treat. All participants in the study will contribute an outcome for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary analyses will be conducted to evaluate the proportion of clinic visits&#xD;
           compared with expected and response to treatment measures: symptoms (cough, sputum,&#xD;
           fever); changes in weight, BMI and bio-impedence; sputum clearance; and micronutrient&#xD;
           measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The primary outcome (treatment success) will be determined by an independent observer&#xD;
           (based in Darwin) who will be blinded to the intervention received by the patients.&#xD;
