      This project is a clinical study of women with high blood pressure who become pregnant.&#xD;
      Preeclampsia is a syndrome developing at the end of a pregnancy characterized by an abrupt&#xD;
      rise in blood pressure (BP), blood clotting and kidney dysfunction, and may result in&#xD;
      premature delivery, infant death, and maternal bleeding, kidney failure and stroke. The goal&#xD;
      is to determine whether lowering blood pressure to a normal pressure of 120/80 is associated&#xD;
      with a lower incidence of preeclampsia. Women who are completely healthy have a 5% chance of&#xD;
      developing preeclampsia, however women with preexisting high blood pressure have a 25% chance&#xD;
      of this complication. Several studies, including our own suggest that higher blood pressure&#xD;
      early in pregnancy (&lt;20 weeks) is associated with an even higher risk of preeclampsia.&#xD;
      Currently we, the researchers at Weill Medical College of Cornell University, do not know how&#xD;
      to treat women with high blood pressure and/or kidney disease during pregnancy. Keeping the&#xD;
      BP in the normal range may be beneficial to the mother. On the other hand, we are not sure if&#xD;
      the blood pressure lowering or the medications may or may not have adverse effects for the&#xD;
      baby. Different trials to answer this question have been performed with no clear conclusions.&#xD;
      Because of these uncertainties, we propose to compare two different strategies for treating&#xD;
      women with high BP who become pregnant. We will treat half the women with BP medications to&#xD;
      normalize BP (120-130/80 mm Hg) (experimental group) and the other half with the goal of&#xD;
      keeping the BP slightly higher (140-150/90-100 mm Hg)(standard therapy group). We will&#xD;
      determine which approach results in healthier pregnancies, and lower incidence of&#xD;
      preeclampsia. Reducing the incidence of preeclampsia would be of significant benefit to both&#xD;
      mothers and babies.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study to examine the feasibility of conducting a larger, multi center&#xD;
      randomized control trial. Fifty women with chronic hypertension who are pregnant and are seen&#xD;
      in the first trimester of pregnancy will be recruited from the offices of obstetricians at&#xD;
      New York Presbyterian Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First trimester (up to 13 6/7th weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratified by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parity (primiparous vs. multiparous delivering a fetus &gt;20 weeks gestation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severity of hypertension (&gt;150/95) as determined on screening antepartum visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pregnant patients will be evaluated for recruitment to 13 6/7 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age 18-50&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients will be included for consideration to enter this trial if office blood pressure&#xD;
           is &gt;140/90 mm Hg: systolic &gt;140 mm Hg, diastolic &gt;90 mm Hg or both. The average of 3&#xD;
           readings taken a minimum of 5 minutes apart will be recorded as the baseline blood&#xD;
           pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients will also be included for consideration to enter this trial if they have known&#xD;
           longstanding hypertension diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;90 within 2 years of index&#xD;
           pregnancy and/or are on antihypertensive medication, regardless of in-office blood&#xD;
           pressure if seen in their first trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant target organ damage; at the patient's initial antepartum visit, routine serum&#xD;
      creatinine and urine dipstick for protein are performed by the attending obstetrician. If the&#xD;
      patient has been hypertensive by history for over 5 years, a screening electrocardiogram will&#xD;
      be performed. These will be reviewed for results precluding participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Known renal disease creatinine &gt; 1.2 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Proteinuria &gt;500 mg/day at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiography (ECG) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. History of the following: chronic illness requiring immunosuppression, as well as&#xD;
           secondary causes of hypertension: pheochromocytoma, hyperaldosteronism, coarctation of&#xD;
           aorta, renal artery stenosis not revascularized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NB: the presence of the above conditions would make it more likely that a clinician would&#xD;
      treat blood pressure during pregnancy. Therefore, the patient may be randomized and treatment&#xD;
      begun as per protocol prior to complete evaluation of presence of above conditions; if&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are subsequently identified the patient would then be excluded and treated&#xD;
      according to individual physicians standard of practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo initial baseline evaluation. History and physical will be performed.&#xD;
      Weight, height and blood pressure will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will sign informed consent. Each patient will have a data sheet for the&#xD;
      purpose of recording study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to one of two blood pressure targets:&#xD;
&#xD;
      120-130/80-85 mm Hg vs. 140-150/90-100 mm Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will occur by blocked randomization in blocks of 6. Randomization is stratified&#xD;
      for parity (nulliparous vs. multiparous) and severe vs. non-severe hypertension. There are&#xD;
      therefore 4 potential groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nulliparous + non-severe hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Multiparous + non-severe hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nulliparous + severe hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Multiparous + severe hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 54 envelopes for each group (allowing for the theoretic possibility that all&#xD;
      patients may fall into one group) and envelopes are numbered and will be opened sequentially&#xD;
      to allocate patients during the randomization process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with no prior history of hypertension will be treated as per the protocol described&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a known history of hypertension will still be randomized to the appropriate&#xD;
      group according to parity and blood pressure in clinic, but will be asked to stop their&#xD;
      antihypertensive medication for a wash out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will then return to clinic three to seven days later off medication to have a&#xD;
      repeat blood pressure measurement. If they own a home blood pressure monitor and this has&#xD;
      been calibrated to office equipment, they may take their blood pressure at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be then be treated as per their randomization group i.e. to a blood pressure of&#xD;
      120-130/80-85 mm Hg vs. 140-150/90-100 mm Hg as per the protocol below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be given a diary to record obstetric data and blood pressure data. Duplicate&#xD;
      records will be kept by the patient and physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight, blood pressure, pulse, presence or absence of edema and urinary protein will be&#xD;
      recorded at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment is to commence immediately after randomization unless the patient is undergoing a&#xD;
      washout period described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients will initially require no medication as BP's may be below the treatment&#xD;
      threshold, depending on their treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be with methyldopa, labetolol, long acting nifedipine, hydralazine or&#xD;
      clonidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scheduled Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed every two to four weeks until delivery. Medication will be titrated&#xD;
      to achieve the desired blood pressure targets. Patients will not be billed for these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The achievement of target blood pressure will be assessed by an average of three blood&#xD;
      pressure measurements obtained at every six weeks visits: weeks 20, 26, 32 and 38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 20 week visit, routine blood work will be drawn to evaluate uric acid and plasma renin&#xD;
      activity as validation of the prediction algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Blood Pressure Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients own a home blood pressure monitor, they will be asked to bring it into clinic for&#xD;
      calibration. They will be given a blood pressure diary to record home blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring or BP measurements done in another clinic or pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment goals of 120-130/80 mm Hg vs. 140-150/90 mm Hg will be applied from the time of&#xD;
      randomization until delivery. Postpartum, clinicians will choose their own blood pressure&#xD;
      goals as per JNC-7 guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the pilot trial, maternal blood pressure is the primary outcome. This will be measured at&#xD;
      weeks 20, 26, 32, 36 using a standardized method: after 15 minutes of rest, blood pressure&#xD;
      will be measured with the woman seated, arm supported at heart level, bladder of cuff&#xD;
      encircling &gt;80% of arm circumference and phase V Korotkoff used for diastolic reading. Blood&#xD;
      pressure will be recorded three times, five minutes apart, and the mean of these values will&#xD;
      allow assessment of BP control in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The incidence of superimposed preeclampsia in chronically hypertensive women. Diagnosis&#xD;
           of superimposed preeclampsia will be made by the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Worsening hypertension after 20 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AND proteinuria &gt;.3g/day on 24 hour collection when there was previously none OR&#xD;
                doubling of proteinuria, in those positive at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AND/OR the HELLP syndrome (hemolysis on blood smear, liver transaminase levels &gt; 2&#xD;
                x normal, low platelets &lt;100/mm3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gestational age&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Birth weight &lt; 10th centile for gestational age&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Serious perinatal complications including neonatal death, respiratory distress,&#xD;
           intraventricular hemorrhage, hypotension, bradycardia, and maternal complications of&#xD;
           eclampsia, stroke, or end organ failure, cesarean section. Preterm admission, severe&#xD;
           hypertension and indication for delivery will also be evaluated.&#xD;
