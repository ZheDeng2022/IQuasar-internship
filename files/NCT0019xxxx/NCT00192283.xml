  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of the liquid formulation of CAIVT&#xD;
      against culture confirmed influenza illness in healthy children aged at least 6 months and&#xD;
      less than 36 months, attending day care centers in Europe. In addition, the trial provides&#xD;
      the opportunity to investigate the effect of CAIV-T on acute otitis media, on healthcare&#xD;
      resource utilization and economic resources.&#xD;
