      This study is designed to describe the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of escalating, repeated IM injections (the intended route of administration&#xD;
      for immunoprophylaxis) of MEDI-524, initially in children £6 months old with a history of&#xD;
      prematurity (³32 to £35 weeks gestation, without BPD), one of the target populations of&#xD;
      infants at high risk for serious RSV disease.&#xD;
