  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with congestive heart failure are often associated with delayed intraventricular&#xD;
      depolarization which causing dyssynchrony and an inefficient pattern of left ventricular&#xD;
      contraction. A number of studies have shown that bi-ventricular or left ventricular pacing&#xD;
      improves indexes of systolic function as well as decreases sympathetic activation in patients&#xD;
      with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, dilated cardiomyopathy and a major&#xD;
      left-sided intraventricular conduction disorder such as left bundle branch block. One recent&#xD;
      study also demonstrated that bi-ventricular pacing can shift heart rate variability (HRV)&#xD;
      toward a more favorable profile. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) is a measure of the negative&#xD;
      feedback properties that interact in modulating the dynamic heart rate and arterial pressure&#xD;
      fluctuations. Blunted BRS is found to be associated with an increased risk for both cardiac&#xD;
      deaths and arrhythmic events. However, the effect of bi-ventricular pacing on BRS has never&#xD;
      been studied. In the present proposal, we plan to measure common hemodynamic parameters, BRS&#xD;
      and HRV in a group of heart failure patients receiving open heart surgery in different pacing&#xD;
      conditions (bi-ventricular pacing, single LV pacing, single RV pacing). The major aims are to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of bi-ventricular pacing on BRS and to clarify the underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;

      Operation and lead placement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) is performed based on patient's coronary angiography.&#xD;
      Following the completion of coronary anastomoses, epicardial pacemaker leads are implanted by&#xD;
      simple stitches in different locations. The right atrial (RA) lead is placed on the right&#xD;
      atrial appendage. The right ventricle (RV) lead is placed on the RV free wall near the apex.&#xD;
      The left ventricle (LV) lead is placed on the lateral wall of LV at the border zone between&#xD;
      diagonal and obtuse marginal branches of coronary artery. All three ground leads are placed&#xD;
      on the rectus abdominis muscle. All these leads are pulled out of the patient percutaneously.&#xD;
      Medtronic dual-chamber pacemaker is used for this study. The change of different pacing&#xD;
      protocol (RV pacing, LV pacing, or biventricular pacing) is through the connection of&#xD;
      different pacemaker leads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent OPCAB have Swan-Ganz catheter in our institute. Cardiac output&#xD;
      measurement is obtained by thermodilution method. Hemodynamic variables (systemic blood&#xD;
      pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge&#xD;
      pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary vascular resistance, etc) are recorded&#xD;
      during the measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG and blood pressure monitoring system:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG and radial arterial blood pressure were recorded by an analog to digital converter system&#xD;
      (National Instrument Inc.). The ananlog signals were digitized in a rate of 500Hz and were&#xD;
      stored in a hard disk. The data were then analyzed by a program written with MATLAB language&#xD;
      (version 5.2, Mathwork Co.). QRS complexes were automatically classified and manually&#xD;
      verified as normal sinus rhythm, arterial or ventricular premature beats, or noise by&#xD;
      comparison of the adjacent QRS morphologic features. The N-N interval time series were then&#xD;
      transferred to a personal computer and post-processed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baroreflex sensitivity analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of BRS was conducted by both the sequence method (19, 20) and the spectral&#xD;
      (α-index) method. Sequence method: In brief, the beat-by-beat time series of systolic&#xD;
      arterial blood pressure and ECG R-R intervals were scanned to identify sequences of over&#xD;
      three consecutive beats in which the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and R-R intervals of the&#xD;
      next beat changed concomitantly in increasing or decreasing sequence. Such beat-to-beat&#xD;
      sequences were identified as baroreflex sequences. A linear regression was applied to the&#xD;
      individual sequence and only r2 values &gt;0.85 were accepted. The measure of each type of the&#xD;
      integrated spontaneous BRS was obtained by averaging all accepted slopes of the same type&#xD;
      during a 5-minute recording. Spectral (α-index) method: The α-index (α) was obtained by means&#xD;
      of the simultaneous spectral analysis of the R-R intervals and the SBP variabilities, with&#xD;
      the calculation being made from the square root of the ratio between the R-R intervals and&#xD;
      the SBP variability in low frequency (LF) band (αLF, 0.04 to 0.15 Hz). The coherence between&#xD;
      the R-R intervals and SBP was assessed by a cross-spectral analysis. The α-index was&#xD;
      calculated only when the magnitude of squared coherence (K2) between the RR and the SBP&#xD;
      signals exceed 0.5 in LF band.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate variability analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The missing intervals of the raw N-N data were linearly interpolated and resampled at 4 Hz by&#xD;
      the Ron-Berger method. Each 5-minute segment of N-N intervals was taken for HRV analysis. The&#xD;
      time domain measurements of HRV included SDNN, r-MSSD. The frequency-domain measurements of&#xD;
      HRV included LF and HF, which were calculated by Welch's averaged periodogram of the N-N&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
