      This is a prospective, non-randomised, 48 week study of the effect of protease inhibitor (PI)&#xD;
      containing and non-PI containing antiretroviral regimens on the expression of adipocyte&#xD;
      specific genes, protein levels and cellular structure in HIV-infected individuals, naive to&#xD;
      therapy, who are starting therapy for the first time.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral medications, used to treat HIV infection, cause side effects. These include&#xD;
      changes in composition of fat throughout the body (loss in some areas and accumulation in&#xD;
      others), elevations in blood lipids and abnormalities in glucose metabolism. The resulting&#xD;
      syndrome is known as &quot;HIV associated lipodystrophy&quot; or HIVLD. In HIV negative populations,&#xD;
      such abnormalities in lipid and glucose metabolism are associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this study is to characterize the changes&#xD;
      that occur in body composition and metabolism with antiretroviral treatment and compare them&#xD;
      to changes in fat tissue structure and function and surrogate markers for cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Be able to provide written consent to perform in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV antibody positive at time of entry to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Specific to HIV Infection and Metabolic Abnormalities Protocol 1 (HAMA) part A only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be naive to antiretroviral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Specific to HAMA part B only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had a minimum total exposure to antiretroviral medications (to include drugs from&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any finding on screening clinical examination, which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
