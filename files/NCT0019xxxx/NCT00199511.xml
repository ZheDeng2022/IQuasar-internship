  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Hypertonic Saline 7.5% vs Mannitol 20%&#xD;
      on brain bulk (using a 4 point scale), intracranial pressure (subdural catheter)and the&#xD;
      changes on serum and urinary Na, K and Osmolarity during elective craniotomy for brain tumor&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Raised intracranial pressure occurs following an expansion of an intracranial mass e.g.&#xD;
      hematoma or brain tumor and if left untreated, can lead to brain ischemia, stroke and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategies for reducing raised intracranial pressure include hyperventilation, use of a&#xD;
      hyperosmolar agent and the evacuation of the intracranial mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two hypertonic solutions most commonly used are Mannitol 20% and Hypertonic Saline 7.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During elective neurosurgical removal of a brain tumour, the anesthesiologist needs to reduce&#xD;
      intracranial pressure and provide good operating brain conditions to avoid brain ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, Mannitol 20% is routinely used intra-operatively in these patients to reduce brain&#xD;
      bulk and intracranial pressure and to improve brain operating conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, Mannitol itself can cause secondary effects that can be deleterious to the&#xD;
      neurological patient. Mannitol causes a diuresis which may lead to systemic hypovolemia and&#xD;
      hypotension, and adverse changes in serum and urinary sodium, potassium and osmolarity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experience with Hypertonic saline 7.5%, has been mainly in brain injured patients either in&#xD;
      the Emergency Dept or in the Intensive care setting. There is growing evidence that&#xD;
      Hypertonic saline 7.5% is just as effective as Mannitol 20% in reducing raised intracranial&#xD;
      pressure, especially in traumatic brain injury and it has become a widely accepted form of&#xD;
      treatment. One of the advantages of Hypertonic saline is that it does not cause a diuresis&#xD;
      and therefore less likely to cause hypotension and hypovolemia. While transient hypernatremia&#xD;
      has been observed after the administration of hypertonic saline, there have been no clinical&#xD;
      consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately there have been only two studies which compared the effectiveness of Hypertonic&#xD;
      saline and Mannitol during elective brain surgery. One of them, Gemma et al, failed to&#xD;
      demonstrate any difference in the reduction of brain bulk between Mannitol and Hypertonic&#xD;
      saline. However the 2 solutions used had different osmolarities and this may have had a&#xD;
      confounding effect on the results. In the other study (published in Polish), the authors&#xD;
      found a 20% reduction in brain bulk in favour of hypertonic saline. In view of these two&#xD;
      opposing findings, we feel that another investigation is warranted.&#xD;
