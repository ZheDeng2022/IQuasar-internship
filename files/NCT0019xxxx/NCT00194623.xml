  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) is thought to affect approximately 8% of men aged 18 and&#xD;
      older. Patients with this condition experience pain in the perineum, the genitalia, and the&#xD;
      rectum. As well, there is associated voiding, sexual, and ejaculatory dysfunction. The impact&#xD;
      of patient well-being is thought to be equivalent to patients with congestive heart failure.&#xD;
      The etiology of this condition is unknown, thus making treatment very difficult. Researchers&#xD;
      have pursued an infectious cause for the disease; however, studies have failed to&#xD;
      substantiate this theory. Despite this, the main treatment offered to patients is long-term&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy. Results from this treatment modality have been unsatisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other groups have postulated that the symptoms of CPPS may be secondary to neuromuscular&#xD;
      factors. Some studies have demonstrated increases in pelvic muscular tone. Maneuvers such as&#xD;
      prostate massage and levator massage have shown some benefit in relieving symptoms. Treatment&#xD;
      with alpha-blockers to relax prostate smooth muscle has brought about improvement in a&#xD;
      portion of patients. Use of generalized muscle relaxants has produced mediocre results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, many of these neuromuscular treatments are generalized and do not target the&#xD;
      perineal musculature directly. It is theorized that spasm of the perineal muscles triggered&#xD;
      by an unknown noxious stimuli (e.g. infection) cause the pain and symptoms of CPPS. At our&#xD;
      center, we have performed pilot studies using botulinum toxin A. Four patients were treated&#xD;
      with Botox&quot;. 100 U were injected in three locations in the midline of the bulbocavernosus&#xD;
      muscle. The bulbocavernosus muscle is easily accessible and shares innervation with the&#xD;
      pelvic musculature. Patient's response to medication was measured by the NIH Prostatitis pain&#xD;
      scale and as well as the University of Washington prostatitis pain scale. All patients&#xD;
      reported resolution of symptoms. Remission lasted for duration of 10-12 weeks. No patients&#xD;
      reported adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin A is effective in the treatment of chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men.&#xD;

      Visit 1 Patient will review and sign the study consent form. Subject will be asked to&#xD;
      complete questionnaires. Then, patient will then be asked to give a semen sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (1 week after Visit I) Prior to this visit, the patient will be randomized to either&#xD;
      active medication or placebo. First, the patient will then undergo a physical exam including&#xD;
      a genital and rectal exam. Then, the patient will be brought in to the room and placed in&#xD;
      lithotomy position. The perineum will be prepped with iodine solution. EMG electrodes and a&#xD;
      ground will be placed in the perineum. Three landmarks (1. middle of bulbospongiosus muscle;&#xD;
      2. perineal body; 3. an area equidistant from 1 and 2) will be marked using a skin marker.&#xD;
      The EMG needle will be placed into each landmark and the patient will be asked to squeeze his&#xD;
      perineal muscles. Once in the proper location, 1.3 cc of medication (active drug or placebo)&#xD;
      will be distributed into these landmarks. The remaining 2.6 ccs will be injected into 2 other&#xD;
      painful pelvic muscle sites as determined physical exam. The area will then be gently&#xD;
      massaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Month Post Injection Mailing:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient will be mailed a packet containing follow-up questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Month Post Injection Mailing: Same as 1 Month Post Injection Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Month Post Visit (Visit 3) First, the subject will be asked to fill out follow-up&#xD;
           questionnaires. Next, a physical exam and prostate massage will be performed and&#xD;
           expressed prostatic secretions collected. Finally, the subject will be asked to provide&#xD;
           a semen sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional open label trial for those patients randomized to placebo section:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open label injection visit (Visit 4) Injection of open label Botox as in Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Month Post Open Label Botox Injection Mailing:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient will be mailed a packet containing follow-up questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Month Post Open Label Botox Injection Mailing:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Same as 1 Month Post Injection mailing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Month Post Open Label Injection Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Same as Visit 3.&#xD;
