  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical nodal metastasis is the single most important prognostic factor in head and neck&#xD;
      cancers. Appropriate management of the neck is therefore of paramount importance in the&#xD;
      treatment of these cancers. While it is obvious that the positive neck must be treated,&#xD;
      controversy has always surrounded the clinically node negative neck with respect to the ideal&#xD;
      treatment policy.The situation is difficult with regards to early cancers of the oral cavity&#xD;
      (T1/T2). These cancers are usually treated with surgery where excision is through the&#xD;
      per-oral route. Elective neck dissection in such a situation is an additional surgical&#xD;
      procedure with its associated costs, prolonged hospitalization and may be unnecessary in as&#xD;
      high as 80% of patients who finally turn out to be pathologically node negative. Should the&#xD;
      neck be electively treated or there be a wait and watch policy? Current practice is that the&#xD;
      neck is always addressed whenever there is an increased propensity to cervical metastasis or&#xD;
      when patient follow-up is unreliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is clearly a need therefore for a large randomized trial that will resolve the issue&#xD;
      either way once and for all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate whether elective neck dissection (END) is equal or superior to the wait and&#xD;
      watch policy i.e.&#xD;
&#xD;
      therapeutic neck dissection (TND) in the management of the clinically No neck in early T1 /T2&#xD;
      cancers of the oral cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does Ultrasound examination have any role in the routine initial workup of a node&#xD;
           negative patient?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How are patients ideally followed up -does sonography have a role or is clinical&#xD;
           examination sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is assessment of tumor thickness by the surgeon at the time of initial surgery accurate&#xD;
           -Is there a correlation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Identify histological prognostic factors in the primary that may help identify a sub-set&#xD;
           of patients at an increased risk for cervical metastasis.&#xD;

      Stratification criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Size&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Site&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sonography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization (I): All patients will be randomly allocated into one of two arms: wait and&#xD;
      watch policy group or elective neck dissection group. Both arms will have similar wide&#xD;
      excision of primary tumor in oral cavity per oral route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization (II): Following surgery and after complete recovery prior to discharge,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized a second time for follow-up into two arms namely clinical&#xD;
      examination versus clinical examination and ultrasonography of neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGICAL PROCEDURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: tumor will be excised after proper exposure via per-oral route.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emphasis will be to achieve a wide clearance with tumor free margins to obviate need of&#xD;
           subsequent radiotherapy to primary, which would otherwise act as a confounding factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neck: Patients randomized to neck dissection will undergo a standard supra-omohyoid neck&#xD;
      dissection that will involve clearance of nodal Levels I, II, and III.Completion MND will be&#xD;
      done as and when required. Patients who develop metastatic adenopathy on follow-up will&#xD;
      undergo a modified neck dissection/radical neck dissection depending on size of metastatic&#xD;
      disease. Those who have nodes suggestive of metastasis on follow-up sonography, will undergo&#xD;
      a supraomohyoid dissection, frozen section followed by a modified neck dissection if&#xD;
      positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depth of tumor infiltration though probably most important individual prognostic factor in&#xD;
      deciding likelihood of cervical metastasis, is unfortunately only available to clinician with&#xD;
      final histopathology report. Had this parameter been present at time of surgery patient with&#xD;
      an increased likelihood of metastasis could have undergone an elective neck dissection while&#xD;
      those with a lower incidence could have been saved an unnecessary operation .This study would&#xD;
      help find out accuracy of correlation between gross assessments of thickness by surgeon, on&#xD;
      frozen section with final thickness on histopathology and would be of importance in a country&#xD;
      like ours where oral cancers are very common and facilities of frozen as well as expertise to&#xD;
      measure accurately tumor thickness at histopathology may be unavailable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      END POINT OF STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point will be overall survival and secondary end point will be DFS. The&#xD;
      patients will be followed up until death or study close whichever is earlier. Since overall&#xD;
      survival is the primary endpoint, patients will be followed up until death. telephonic or&#xD;
      mail contact is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local failures, distant metastasis and second primary will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION, QUALITY CONTROL &amp; ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming baseline overall survival of 60%, for expected improvement in treatment arm of 10%&#xD;
      no. of patients required will be is 710 (355 in each arm) with α=0.05 (one sided) &amp; power of&#xD;
      80% (β=20). An interim analysis is planned at 250 events (death) occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound in routine follow-up of all patients will be labor intensive. However median&#xD;
      follow-up to recurrence in all studies both retrospective/prospective has been 9 months on an&#xD;
      average (range 6 months- 13months). It will therefore be important to follow patients every&#xD;
      vigilantly in first 12 months from primary treatment. Follow-up schedules will be: First&#xD;
      visit: 4 weeks;First 6 months: 4-6 weeks; 6-12 months: 6-8 weeks; 12 months- 2 years: 8-12&#xD;
      weekly; Thereafter: 3 monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be encouraged and counseled to come for check up on earlier date within range&#xD;
      allowed. All patients will be followed up by one of investigators and entry made both in&#xD;
      source document as well as central registration cell at CRS with study coordinator. At each&#xD;
      examination patients will undergo a through head and neck examination as well as an&#xD;
      ultrasound if randomized to that arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUMMARY OF PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS The first version of the protocol (hereafter called Version 1)&#xD;
      received approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee in September 2003.The most recent&#xD;
      version of the protocol (hereafter called Version 4) received approval from the Institutional&#xD;
      Ethics Committee in June 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Version 1 dated: September 2003 Version 2 dated: December 2008 Version 3 dated: August 2011&#xD;
      Version 4 dated: June 2014&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of prospective randomized controlled trials previously reported and reviewed is&#xD;
      three in version 1 and the number of prospective Randomized controlled trial previously&#xD;
      reported and reviewed has increased to four in version 4. The change was done in version 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre randomization USG findings for lymph nodes were not considered for eligibility criteria.&#xD;
      Therefore patients with normal, indeterminate and those suggestive of metastasis were&#xD;
      eligible for trial inclusion in version 1 and Patients with pre randomization ultrasound neck&#xD;
      findings suggestive of metastasis were excluded in version 4. The change was done in version&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on pre-randomization ultrasound neck findings, patients were stratified between those&#xD;
      with normal versus indeterminate versus suspicious for metastasis in version 1 and Patients&#xD;
      stratification was between normal versus indeterminate ultrasound findings in version 4. The&#xD;
      change was done in version 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and investigators blinded to pre- randomization ultrasound neck findings in version&#xD;
      1 and Patients and investigators are no longer blinded to pre- randomization ultrasound neck&#xD;
      findings in version4. The change was done in Version 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end points are locoregional recurrence survival in version 1 and The secondary endpoint&#xD;
      of the study has been explicitly clarified to be disease-free survival in version 4. The&#xD;
      change was done in Version 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Nodal relapse' and 'Regional Recurrence' have been defined explicitly in version 4. The&#xD;
      change was done in version 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Concerns:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol amendment details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol amendment was accepted by scientific ethics committee/Instititional Review board on&#xD;
      29/12/2008 as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a pre randomization ultrasonography of neck. If USG report suggests&#xD;
      metastasis patients would be treated according to merit to avoid ethical concerns and if USG&#xD;
      report is normal or indeterminate, patients would be randomized for trial. This protocol&#xD;
      amendment is done in view of following 2 reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very often patients are uncomfortable to give consent when they are explained that initial&#xD;
      ultrasonography report will be blinded and findings will not be considered in deciding&#xD;
      patient's treatment plan. This resulted in lower recruitment of patients and it also raised&#xD;
      ethical issues when blind was not adequately maintained especially if sonography suggested&#xD;
      metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome a difference of opinion amongst examining clinicians about a clinically&#xD;
      significant node.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, breaking blind would have no bearing on outcome / impact of this study.&#xD;
