  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, naturalistic, open label study will test the hypothesis that Depakote is&#xD;
      correlated with a reduction in elevated Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Index (CMAI) verbal and&#xD;
      physical agitation and aggression scales over a 6-week period among patients with elevated&#xD;
      scores on those scales, and that these positive results can be achieved with fewer side&#xD;
      effects than with other agents. In addition, patients will be rated with respect to changes&#xD;
      in the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) at baseline, week 1, 3, and 6 and the&#xD;
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) at baseline and week 6.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open label, naturalistic study will enroll a total of 20 patients who are being treated&#xD;
      for Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD), and who are being newly tried&#xD;
      on Depakote in either the ER or sprinkle formulation. Patients who are suitable for study&#xD;
      inclusion will have a score of at least 4 (out of 5, with 5 being the most severe) on at&#xD;
      least one item (verbal agitation, physical agitation, and or aggression) of the&#xD;
      Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), short form. In this study Depakote ER will be&#xD;
      prescribed in addition to existing pharmacotherapy; there will be no washout of co-prescribed&#xD;
      psychotropic agents. The study will not seek to enroll equal numbers of patients on Depakote&#xD;
      only vs. concomitant treatment. Study subjects will be recruited in multiple assisted living,&#xD;
      nursing home and hospital sites in Massachusetts. We anticipate that they will roughly mirror&#xD;
      the age, gender, and other demographic distribution of the larger SCU population. This will&#xD;
      be a rolling enrollment as patients present with symptoms appropriate for this treatment. Our&#xD;
      estimate is based on past experience with the referral rates for medication evaluation from&#xD;
      these sites. Patients currently on atypical antipsychotics who have residual BPSD will be&#xD;
      considered for the study, as will those on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Our logic is that&#xD;
      as prescribed, these agents are not having the desired effect in reducing BPSD. Patients who&#xD;
      are taking, and are appropriate to remain on, conventional antipsychotics will be excluded&#xD;
      from the study. For each enrolled patient we will obtain baseline a psychiatric and medical&#xD;
      assessment; results of the Mini Mental Status Evaluation (MMSE), CMAI, NPI - NH version and&#xD;
      CGI; and a nursing staff patient status report prior to beginning psychotropic medication.&#xD;
      These will be completed at time of study enrollment. Patients will then be followed for six&#xD;
      weeks, with valproic acid levels drawn at weeks 1,3, and 6. Nursing staff will complete the&#xD;
      CMAI at baseline and at weeks 1, 3, and 6. Physicians will score patients on the CGI at&#xD;
      baseline, week 1, 3, and 6, and Clinical Raters will complete the NPI at baseline and week 6.&#xD;
