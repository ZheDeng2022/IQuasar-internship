  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral neuropathy is a frequent neurological complication of chronic alcoholism. Most&#xD;
      studies evaluated large-fiber involvement by nerve conduction studies (NCS). Since previous&#xD;
      studies document the predominant injury of small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers in&#xD;
      patients with alcoholic neuropathy, it will be imperative to know their prevalence and&#xD;
      clinical significance. Moreover, the pathogenesis of alcoholic neuropathy, especially the&#xD;
      roles of ethanol and its metabolites and thiamine, remains elusive. This proposal will be&#xD;
      designed to understand the extent and clinical significance of cutaneous nerve degeneration&#xD;
      in the skin of alcoholic patients and to investigate its pathogenesis. We will investigate&#xD;
      cutaneous innervation by 3 mm punch skin biopsies with immunohistochemistry for protein gene&#xD;
      product 9.5 and quantifying epidermal nerve density (END) in alcoholic patients. Patients&#xD;
      will undergo clinical evaluation, quantitative sensory testing (QST), nerve conduction&#xD;
      studies (NCS), and tests of sympathetic skin response (SSR) and beat-to-beat RR interval&#xD;
      variability (RRIV). The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in chronic alcoholic patients&#xD;
      with emphasis on small-fiber involvement will be first evaluated. The sensitivity of punch&#xD;
      skin biopsy, QST, SSR and RRIV tests, and NCS will be compared, and the correlations between&#xD;
      END and psychophysic and electrodiagnostic parameters will be discussed. Subsequently, we&#xD;
      will elucidate the clinical significance of END reduction in alcoholic patients. Patients&#xD;
      with evidences of involvement of central nervous system will be excluded, and END will be&#xD;
      correlated with clinical manifestations and neurological deficits. Finally, the role of&#xD;
      ethanol and thiamine in alcoholic neuropathy will be further studied. To clarify the role of&#xD;
      thiamine in alcoholic neuropathy, we will examine whether it has influences on small-fiber&#xD;
      degeneration. This may provide important information in understanding the pathogenesis and&#xD;
      designing optimal treatment for alcoholic neuropathy.&#xD;

      Alcoholic patients and control subjects. Alcoholic patients will be recruited from neurologic&#xD;
      clinics and ward at the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. A detailed clinical&#xD;
      history that includes daily alcohol consumption, daily dietary intake, lifestyle, and&#xD;
      occupation will be obtained from patients as well as their families. The inclusion criteria&#xD;
      include daily uptake of at least 100 g ethanol for more than 3 years prior to the onset of&#xD;
      neuropathic symptoms (Behse and Buchthal, 1977). All patients will undergo clinical and&#xD;
      neurologic assessment, cranial MRI or CT, and neuropsychological evaluation to rule out CNS&#xD;
      disorders, which interfere the evaluation of neuropathic symptoms and signs and psychophysic&#xD;
      test. Laboratory investigations will include complete blood count, fasting plasma glucose,&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1C, liver and renal function tests, ethanol level, tumor markers, antinuclear&#xD;
      antibodies, complement factors, serum protein electrophoresis, thyroid function, human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis virus, and vitamin B12 level. Thiamine status will be&#xD;
      assessed at the time of the first referral to the hospital by measuring total thiamine&#xD;
      concentration in whole blood by high performance liquid chromatography, as described&#xD;
      elsewhere (Koike et al., 2001 and 2003). None of the patients will administrate thiamine at&#xD;
      the time of determination. Age- and gender-matched control subjects will be retrieved from&#xD;
      our database, who will be evaluated by detailed questionnaires and neurological examinations&#xD;
      to exclude any neurological disorder or clinical neuropathy (McCarthy et al., 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin biopsy. Skin biopsy will be performed following established procedures after informed&#xD;
      consent has been obtained (McCarthy et al., 1995; Pan et al., 2003; Shun et al., 2004). Under&#xD;
      local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine, punches 3mm in diameter will be taken from the following&#xD;
      locations: (1) the extensor side of the distal forearm, 5 cm above the middle point of a line&#xD;
      connecting the radial styloid process and the ulnar styloid process; and (2) the lateral side&#xD;
      of the distal leg, 10 cm above the lateral malleolus. No suturing will be required, and the&#xD;
      wounds will be covered with a piece of gauze. Wound healing takes 7-10 days, the same as&#xD;
      would a typical abrasion wound. The protocol is under review by the Ethics Committee of Far&#xD;
      Eastern Memorial Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunohistochemistry. For immunohistochemistry on freezing microtome sections, the skin&#xD;
      samples will be fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH&#xD;
      7.4, for 48 h (McCarthy et al., 1995; Hsieh et al., 2000). Sections of 50 mm perpendicular to&#xD;
      the dermis will be cut on a sliding microtome (model 440E; Microm, Walldorf, Germany). They&#xD;
      will be quenched with 1% H2O2, blocked with 5% normal goat serum, and incubated with rabbit&#xD;
      antiserum to PGP 9.5 (UltraClone, UK, diluted 1: 1000 in 1% normal serum/Tris) at 4C for&#xD;
      16-24 h. After rinsing in Tris, sections will be incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit&#xD;
      IgG at room temperature for 1 h, followed by incubation with avidin-biotin complex (Vector,&#xD;
      Burlingame, CA) for another hour. The reaction product will be demonstrated with chromogen SG&#xD;
      (Vector, Burlingame, CA), and counterstained with eosin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitation of epidermal innervation. Epidermal innervation will be quantified following&#xD;
      established protocols, and slides will be coded to ensure that measurements are blinded&#xD;
      (Hsieh et al., 2000; Pan et al., 2003; Shun et al., 2004). PGP 9.5-immunoreactive nerve&#xD;
      fibers in the epidermis of each section will be counted at a magnification of  40 with an&#xD;
      Olympus BX40 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) through the depth of the entire section. Each&#xD;
      individual nerve with branching points inside the epidermis will be counted as one. For&#xD;
      epidermal nerves with branching points in the dermis, each individual nerve will be counted&#xD;
      separately. The length of the epidermis along the upper margin of the stratum corneum in each&#xD;
      section will be measured using Image-Pro PLUS (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). END&#xD;
      will therefore be derived and expressed as fibers/mm. For each tissue, there will be 48-50&#xD;
      sections, and all sections will be sequentially labeled. Every fifth section will be&#xD;
      immunostained and quantified. The mean of values from these sections will be considered the&#xD;
      END of the tissue specimen. In the distal leg, normative values from our laboratory (mean &#xD;
      SD, 5th percentile) of END are 11.16  3.70, 5.88 fibres/mm for subjects aged &lt; 60 years and&#xD;
      7.64  3.08, 2.50 fibres/mm for subjects aged  60 years. The cut-off point of END is 5.88&#xD;
      and 2.50 fibres/mm in the two age groups, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative sensory testing. We will perform quantitative sensory testing (QST) with a&#xD;
      Thermal Sensory Analyzer and Vibratory Sensory Analyzer (Medoc Advanced Medical System,&#xD;
      Minneapolis, MN) to measure thresholds of warm, cold, and vibratory sensations following the&#xD;
      established protocol (Pan et al., 2001; Pan et al., 2003; Yarnitsky and Ochoa, 1991).&#xD;
      Briefly, the machine will deliver a stimulus of constant intensity which had been determined&#xD;
      by the test algorithm. The intensity of the next stimulus will be either increased or&#xD;
      decreased by a fixed ratio according to the response of the subject, i.e., whether or not the&#xD;
      subject perceives the stimulus. Such procedures will be repeated until a pre-determined&#xD;
      difference of intensity is reached. The mean intensity of the last two stimuli will be the&#xD;
      threshold for the level method. Thermal thresholds recorded on the toe will be expressed as&#xD;
      warm threshold temperature and cold threshold temperature, respectively. These temperatures&#xD;
      will be compared with normative values (Pan et al., 2003). Vibratory thresholds recorded on&#xD;
      the malleolus will be measured with similar algorithms. Normative values are documented&#xD;
      previously and are similar to those of previous reports (Pan et al., 2001; Pan et al., 2003).&#xD;
      Threshold values greater than the 95th percentile value for each age group will be considered&#xD;
      abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerve conduction studies. NCS will be carried out in all patients with a Keypoint&#xD;
      electromyographer following standardized methods (Pan et al., 2003). Amplitudes of compound&#xD;
      muscle action potential (CMAP) and sensory action potential (SAP) will be analyzed according&#xD;
      to the normative data in our laboratory. Studied nerves include bilateral median, ulnar,&#xD;
      peroneal, tibial, and sural nerves. Abnormal result on NCS is defined as having abnormalities&#xD;
      of 1 or more nerves with reduced amplitude, prolonged distal latency, or slowed nerve&#xD;
      conduction velocity. Neurophysiologic criteria of sensorimotor polyneuropathy are defined as&#xD;
      having symmetrical abnormalities in motor and sensory nerves (Dyck et al., 1985).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests of the autonomic nervous system. Sudomotor function will be examined using the&#xD;
      sympathetic skin response (SSR) (Ravits, 1997). Results of SSR in the palm and sole will be&#xD;
      interpreted as present or absent, but will not be evaluated quantitatively because of&#xD;
      variations in the latencies and amplitudes of SSR. Parasympathetic function will be evaluated&#xD;
      using the beat-to-beat heart rate variation [RR interval variability (RRIV)] at rest and&#xD;
      during deep breathing (Ravits, 1997). Each test will be performed three times, and the mean&#xD;
      value will be compared with that for the age-matched controls in our laboratory. Medication&#xD;
      that interferes with sympathetic or parasympathetic functions will not be administered before&#xD;
      or during these tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. Numerical variables following Gaussian distribution will be compared&#xD;
      using t-test and expressed as the mean  SD; for those variables not following Gaussian&#xD;
      distribution, data will be expressed as the median (range) and will be analyzed with&#xD;
      non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Results are considered significant if p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with evidences of CNS disorders will be excluded first. Furthermore, those with&#xD;
      attributable etiologies for neuropathy, such as diabetes, uremia, autoimmune disorders, or&#xD;
      neoplasm will be excluded, too. The rest alcoholic patients will be separated as 2 groups:&#xD;
      alcoholic patients with normal thiamine level (ATN) and alcoholic patients with thiamine&#xD;
      deficiency (ATD). In the ATN group, patients will be further subgrouped as alcoholic patients&#xD;
      without clinical evidence of neuropathy, alcoholic patients with sensory symptoms (especially&#xD;
      burning lightning pains and painful paresthesia), and alcoholic patients with sensory and&#xD;
      motor symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first point to address in our study is to evaluate the prevalence of peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy in chronic alcoholic patients with emphasis on small-fiber involvement. Since&#xD;
      early detection of neural degeneration is important, the sensitivity of punch skin biopsy,&#xD;
      QST, NCS, and SSR and RRIV tests will be compared. The correlations between END and&#xD;
      psychophysic and electrodiagnostic parameters will be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, we will elucidate the clinical significance of END reduction in alcoholic patients.&#xD;
      END will be correlated with clinical manifestations and neurological deficits. Small-fiber&#xD;
      sensory symptoms and signs will be correlated with END, and autonomic symptoms and signs will&#xD;
      be correlated with the presence of sweat gland denervation. The degrees of END reduction in&#xD;
      the 3 groups of ATN patients and control subjects will be compared. Since other systemic&#xD;
      disease, especially diabetes, also causes small-fiber degeneration, we will examine whether&#xD;
      alcoholic patients with diabetes have further cutaneous denervation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the role of ethanol and thiamine in alcoholic neuropathy will be explored. The&#xD;
      reduction of END will be correlated with thiamine status, lifetime ethanol dose, ethanol&#xD;
      level, and other laboratory parameters. If END correlates with ethanol consumption, it will&#xD;
      support the conclusion that alcoholic neuropathy is caused by direct toxic effect of ethanol&#xD;
      or its metabolites. Since previous report documented the large-fiber-predominant axonal loss&#xD;
      in sural nerve specimens in patients with pure-form of thiamine-deficiency neuropathy (Koike&#xD;
      et al., 2003), we wonder if thiamine level influences small-fiber degeneration, i.e.,&#xD;
      reduction of END. The degrees of END reduction between alcoholic patients with ATD and those&#xD;
      with ATN will be compared. These will further clarify the role of thiamine in alcoholic&#xD;
      neuropathy.&#xD;
