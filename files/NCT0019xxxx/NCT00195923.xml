      Triple antibiotic therapy providing broad spectrum coverage of gram positive, gram negative&#xD;
      and anaerobic bacteria has long been the standard treatment for perforated appendicitis in&#xD;
      children. This regimen has traditionally consisted of ampicillin, gentamicin, and&#xD;
      clindamycin. The dosing regimen for these medications are quite frequent, as follows:&#xD;
      ampicillin (every 6 hours), gentamicin (every 8 hours), and clindamycin (every 8 hours),&#xD;
      until there is no evidence for postoperative infection, usually 5 to 7 days. Further,&#xD;
      gentamicin is an aminoglycoside with known renal and ototoxic side effects. Its therapeutic&#xD;
      window is small necessitating measurement of serum levels to maintain therapeutic levels and&#xD;
      avoid toxicity. The contemporary selection of antibiotics includes very few drugs that&#xD;
      require such monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monotherapy with newer broad-spectrum agents such as piperacillin/tazobactam for&#xD;
      intraabdominal infections has recently been demonstrated to be equally efficacious as&#xD;
      traditional triple therapy. Such data calls into question the need for such onerous&#xD;
      antibiotic regimens which include a nephrotoxic agent (gentamycin). However, the benefits of&#xD;
      monotherapy are outweighed by the increased expense of the antibiotic, and the ongoing&#xD;
      cumbersome dosing schedule of 3-4 doses daily. We have recently moved to a dual antibiotic&#xD;
      regimen (ceftriaxone and metronidazole) which provides excellent antimicrobial coverage and&#xD;
      can be dosed on a once daily dosing schedule with an identical duration of therapy as for the&#xD;
      triple antibiotic regimen. This regimen has proven effective in adults with intraabdominal&#xD;
      infections such as perforated appendicitis. Further, ceftriaxone plus metronidazole has been&#xD;
      shown equal to the aforementioned monotherapy schedule with piperacillin/tazobactam in&#xD;
      children with complicated perforated appendicitis. The advantages of dual antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      with once a day dosing for children with perforated appendicitis are immense, especially if&#xD;
      the antibiotics are well tolerated, less expensive, and have a simple dosing schedule.&#xD;
      Additionally, neither drug is nephrotoxic; both have broad therapeutic ranges and therefore&#xD;
      require no serum level measurements. This translates into less blood draws, less time&#xD;
      patients need to be receiving infusions, and less utilization of nursing resources. These&#xD;
      advantages would be expected to culminate in greater nursing and patient satisfaction. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to scientifically compare the traditional triple antibiotic regimen&#xD;
      to dual antibiotic regimen for children with perforated appendicitis, quantify its&#xD;
      significance, and report our findings to physicians caring for these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective randomized study involving children who undergo appendectomy for&#xD;
      perforated appendicitis. All patients will receive antibiotics (ceftriaxone and flagyl)&#xD;
      preoperatively. The determination of perforation will be made by the surgeon at the time of&#xD;
      the operation. Perforation will be determined by either identifying a perforation in the&#xD;
      appendix itself, or by identifying anaerobic odors emanating from the abdominal cavity during&#xD;
      operation (sniff test). Once perforated appendicitis has been documented, the&#xD;
      parents/guardians of the patient will be informed of the option to participate in the&#xD;
      prospective randomized study. Patients whose parents agree and consent to enroll in the study&#xD;
      will then be randomized to one of 2 groups based on a sequential randomization number created&#xD;
      by Steve Simon, PhD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a power analysis of length of stay, performed by Dr. Simon, 50 patients in each of&#xD;
      the two arms of the study will provide a power of 82% with an alpha level of 0.05. Dr. Simon&#xD;
      feels that this level is appropriate for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will consist of triple antibiotic coverage with ampicillin 50mg/kg every 6&#xD;
      hours, gentamicin 2.5 mg/kg every 8 hours and clindamycin 10mg/kg every 6 hours, which are&#xD;
      standard dosing regimens. The experimental group will receive ceftriaxone 50mg/kg once a day&#xD;
      (maximum dose = 2 grams) and metronidazole 30mg/kg once a day (maximum dose = 1 gram) with&#xD;
      once a day dosing for both. The length of antibiotic therapy will not differ from our&#xD;
      standard management and will remain standardized in both arms. All patients will receive a&#xD;
      minimum of 5 days of therapy (regardless of group randomization). At that time, if they have&#xD;
      been afebrile for at least 24 hours, a white blood cell (WBC) count will be obtained, and if&#xD;
      that is within normal limits, the antibiotics will be discontinued. If, after 5 days of&#xD;
      therapy, the patient remains febrile, therapy will continue without change, unless cultures&#xD;
      obtained from the febrile response indicate a need for antibiotic coverage change. If a&#xD;
      change in antibiotic regimen is indicated, the antibiotic profile will be evaluated and the&#xD;
      most appropriate antibiotic will be instituted. If this occurs, the patient's data will&#xD;
      continue to be collected in an intention to treat analysis. In cases where there is no&#xD;
      indication for a change in antibiotic regimen, a WBC count will be drawn once the patient has&#xD;
      become and remains afebrile for a complete 24 hour period of time. If the WBC is elevated,&#xD;
      the antibiotic course will continue with WBC counts to be drawn daily until normal values&#xD;
      return. If leukocytosis or fever persists for 10 days, or if there is clinical indication of&#xD;
      a postoperative intra-abdominal infection, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be&#xD;
      performed to determine if a postoperative abscess has developed. Identification of a&#xD;
      postoperative abscess will result in percutaneous drainage with culture and sensitivity of&#xD;
      the abscess fluid. Subsequent antibiotic treatment will be based on the sensitivities&#xD;
      obtained from the culture of the abscess. In these cases the patients' data will be collected&#xD;
      and they will be regarded as a failure of antibiotic therapy in the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parental permission and child assent, if the child is old enough, will be obtained (see&#xD;
      attached form) and patients will be randomized to the control or experimental group based on&#xD;
      a randomization number generated by Dr. Steve Simon, PhD. Patient demographics, operative&#xD;
      approach, time to tolerating full feeds, length of hospitalization, infectious complications,&#xD;
      medication charges, and hospital charges will be collected for comparison between the groups.&#xD;
