  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of addition of aripirazole to the treatment of bipolar depressed patients who&#xD;
      are not better on the medications that they are currently receiving.&#xD;

      Hypothesis/Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To investigate whether aripiprazole is effective in the treatment of bipolar&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Aripiprazole will lead to a significant decrease in scores on the Hamilton&#xD;
      Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) during an 8-week treatment course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 10 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Study Design and Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal will use an open label design. Aripiprazole will be added to the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) BDD. Patients will be allowed&#xD;
      to continue their psychotropic medication, at a stable dose, as long as they meet inclusion&#xD;
      criteria as described below. Aripiprazole will be started at a dose of 10 mg for two weeks,&#xD;
      15 mg for an additional two weeks, and 20 mg for the last four weeks. The length of time a&#xD;
      patient stays on the maximum dose (20 mg) depends upon the patient's tolerance and treatment&#xD;
      response. Treatment will continue for 8 weeks with weekly visits and ratings on the 17-item&#xD;
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D 17) and other ratings scales.&#xD;
