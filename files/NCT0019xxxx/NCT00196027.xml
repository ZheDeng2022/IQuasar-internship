  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety of the PFX Closure System&#xD;
      when utilized for patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) suffering from cryptogenic stroke,&#xD;
      transient ischemic attacks or paradoxical embolism.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patent Foramen Ovale has been implicated in the etiology of paradoxical embolism, cryptogenic&#xD;
      stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and right to left gas embolism in severe&#xD;
      decompression illness. An association between patent foramen ovale and severe migraine&#xD;
      headaches has also been reported. Several implantable devices are being used for percutaneous&#xD;
      closure of patent foramen ovale; we propose to use a non-implantable system to safely effect&#xD;
      closure.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is between 18 and 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented patent foramen ovale as determined by positive micro bubble study&#xD;
             demonstrating right to left shunt and/or anatomic detection and functional assessment&#xD;
             by pre-operative TCD and peri-operative echocardiography or ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of cryptogenic stroke, transient ischemic attack or&#xD;
             paradoxical embolism due to presumed paradoxical embolism through a PFO.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative pregnancy test in women who are of child-bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed Informed Consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of thrombus at the intended site of closure, in left atrial appendage, or&#xD;
             documented evidence of venous thrombus in the vessels through which access to the PFO&#xD;
             is gained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active endocarditis, or other infections producing a bacteremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of atrial septal defects or fenestrations which allow right-to-left shunting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of implanted cardiac valves, pacemaker, implantable&#xD;
             cardioverters/defibrillators (ICDs) or vena cava filters.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with an intra-cardiac mass, tumor, clot or vegetation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Large, redundant atrial septal aneurysm that would prohibit adequate device access to&#xD;
             the PFO or closure of the PFO, in the judgment of the investigator. A coexisting&#xD;
             redundant atrial septal aneurysm is considered large if it prohibits the ability of&#xD;
             the operator to adequately achieve vacuum suction necessary to achieve PFO closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of arrhythmia requiring pharmacologic or electrical therapy intervention or&#xD;
             1st degree block.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current enrollment in any investigational trial(s) using devices implanted in the&#xD;
             vascular system or enrolled in any experimental drug study(ies) within three months of&#xD;
             study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of stroke or TIA within the past 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Source of stroke other than paradoxical embolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemodynamic instability or shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypercoagulable disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with coagulation disorders who are unable to take antiplatelet or&#xD;
             anticoagulant therapy.&#xD;
