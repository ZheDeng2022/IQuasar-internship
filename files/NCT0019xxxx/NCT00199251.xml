      STUDY PHASE III OBJECTIVES · To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rupatadine 10 mg and 20&#xD;
      mg for the treatment of CIU symptoms over four-week treatment period in comparison with&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN · A multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, parallel-group study in&#xD;
      300 patients (100 patients each treatment) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDICATION · Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU) ASSESSMENT Primary efficacy measure of each&#xD;
      treatment will compare the frequency and severity of symptoms of CIU as measured by the&#xD;
      patient in terms of change in mean pruritus score (MPS) over the 4-week treatment&#xD;
      period.Secondary efficacy measures include change from baseline over the 4 and 6-week&#xD;
      treatment period in the mean number of wheals (MNW) score; mean total symptoms score (MTSS),&#xD;
      calculated as the sum of the MPS (Mean pruritus symptoms) and the MNW (Mean number of wheals)&#xD;
      scores, severity of symptoms of CIU as measured by the patient in terms of change in mean&#xD;
      pruritus score (MPS) over the 6-week treatment period, Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) and&#xD;
      Quality of life (QoL) which will be assessed by the &quot;Dermatology Life Quality Index&quot;&#xD;
      (DLQI).Safety: ECGs baseline and final visit; clinical laboratory controls, physical&#xD;
      examination, incidence of adverse events (AE).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Man or woman aged between 12 and 65&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Active CIU (score ³2 labeled as moderate pruritus) for at least 3 days (not&#xD;
             necessarily consecutive days) in the week before inclusion with a total score of&#xD;
             active CIU ³6 labeled as moderate pruritus for these 3 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Documented history of active CIU (urticaria wheals) with or without an associated&#xD;
             angioedema for at least three days per week over the last 6 weeks prior to Screening&#xD;
             Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. 12 lead ECG obtained at screening within acceptable limits, moreover in absence of any&#xD;
             drug effect or disease, QTc interval values (msec) after Bazzet's correction must be&#xD;
             normal (not prolonged). The values considered to be normal are &lt; 430 msec for males&#xD;
             and &lt; 450 msec for females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient who signed the informed consent form. In case the patient to be underage (from&#xD;
