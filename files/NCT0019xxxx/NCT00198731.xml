  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal death is a substantial burden in developing countries. In Bangladesh, recent studies&#xD;
      have suggested that a large proportion of women giving birth in rural areas experience&#xD;
      pregnancy and delivery related complications. This study, which is set in context where&#xD;
      home-birth is the norm, provides the opportunity to provide descriptive information on the&#xD;
      self-reported prevalence of maternal behaviors and morbidities during pregnancy, delivery and&#xD;
      postpartum periods and to quantify the effects of provision of maternal care interventions&#xD;
      through trained community health workers on a few selected maternal behaviors and&#xD;
      morbidities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maternal mortality is a substantial burden in developing countries. The World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) estimates that between 500,000 to 600,000 women die from complications&#xD;
      related to pregnancy and childbirth each year, with 99% of these deaths occurring in&#xD;
      developing countries (WHO/UNICEF/UNFPA, 2000). It is estimated that pregnancy-related causes&#xD;
      result in about one-quarter to one-third of the deaths of women in their reproductive years&#xD;
      (Koblinsky, 1995). Improving maternal mortality has received recognition at the global level&#xD;
      as evidenced by the inclusion of reducing maternal mortality in the Millennium Development&#xD;
      Goals (United Nations, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among problems experienced by women related to child-bearing, maternal mortality is the &quot;tip&#xD;
      of the iceberg&quot;. Consideration of the morbidity associated with pregnancy, delivery and the&#xD;
      postpartum period is essential in understanding the burden of diseases due to maternal&#xD;
      causes. The WHO estimates that up to 300 million women suffer from short- or long-term&#xD;
      illnesses related to pregnancy and childbirth (WHO, 1998). In addition, the WHO estimates&#xD;
      that in developing countries, death and disability related to maternal morbidity account for&#xD;
      18.5% of the burden of disease among women of reproductive age (WHO, 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Bangladesh, recent studies have suggested that a large proportion of women giving birth in&#xD;
      rural areas experience pregnancy- and delivery- related complications (NIPORT et al, 2001),&#xD;
      and more than 80% of the women suffer from a serious postpartum illness (Goodburn et al,&#xD;
      1994; BIRPERHT, 1994). In the baseline survey for the project &quot;Community-Based Interventions&#xD;
      to Reduce Neonatal Mortality in Bangladesh&quot; in Sylhet, a total of 75% of women reported at&#xD;
      least one maternal complication during pregnancy, delivery and the postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is little evidence as to the effect of maternal care interventions on maternal&#xD;
      morbidity. Several studies have evaluated the impact of traditional birth attendant (TBA)&#xD;
      training on morbidity and referral rates. In a review of 15 studies on the effects of TBA&#xD;
      training programs, Ray and Salihu found an improvement in maternal morbidities in two of the&#xD;
      three studies reviewed, and an impact on referral rates in six of the seven studies reviewed&#xD;
      (Ray &amp; Salihu, 2004). In a meta-analysis conducted by Sibley et al, there was no effect&#xD;
      detected between TBA training and recognition of maternal complications, referral for&#xD;
      complications or on maternal compliance with referral (Sibley, Sipe, &amp; Koblinsky, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal morbidity is a substantial burden on the health of women in Bangladesh and&#xD;
      throughout developing countries. Further research is needed to more carefully document the&#xD;
      community-based incidence of maternal morbidity and to evaluate program impact on maternal&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to provide data on descriptive information on self-reported&#xD;
      maternal morbidities for future planning, and to measure the effect of a package of maternal&#xD;
      care interventions by comparing differences in care seeking for perceived complications and&#xD;
      the unmet obstetric need (based on major obstetric interventions (MOI) for facility-validated&#xD;
      absolute maternal indications (AMI) ) among the three arms, and by comparing anemia rates&#xD;
      among the three arms.&#xD;
