      A study to evaluate the efficacy of concomitant chemoradiation as compared to radiotherapy&#xD;
      alone. Concomitant chemoradiation is not a new treatment modality for carcinoma cervix.&#xD;
      Studies have shown improvement in survivals with chemoradiation, but majority of the patients&#xD;
      was in early stages. Since this treatment modality has not been tested adequately in advanced&#xD;
      stages in our setting, the present study is being undertaken. The study arm of chemoradiation&#xD;
      has the potential to improve the survivals by 10%, but is associated with additional 5% risk&#xD;
      of toxicities, which are treatable. In the study arm, apart form the standard radiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment, you will receive weekly chemotherapy injections (Cisplatin) during external&#xD;
      radiation therapy. The study arm is associated with additional 5% acute hematological and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal toxicities, which are treatable with medications, blood transfusions,&#xD;
      modifications in the ongoing treatment etc.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Carcinoma cervix is the commonest malignancy seen in Asian women and constitutes&#xD;
      approximately 30% of all cancers (1). It is also the leading cause of cancer mortality in&#xD;
      India. Nearly 50% of the patients present with advanced stages (FIGO Stage III/IV). The main&#xD;
      stay of treatment has traditionally been radical radiation therapy and over decades the&#xD;
      survival rates have achieved a plateau of 30 - 45% at 5 years. In developing countries the&#xD;
      socioeconomic problems, illiteracy, late presentation and irregular follow-up have further&#xD;
      compromised our survivals. Over the last decade there have been studies on the use of&#xD;
      chemo-radiotherapy in carcinoma cervix. Over 19 randomized trials have been published&#xD;
      addressing the issue of chemo-radiotherapy. However, heterogeneous data, poor randomization,&#xD;
      inadequate number of patients, sub-optimal radiotherapy, non-uniform use of chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      drugs, its sequencing and poor documentation have not yet provided the evidence to&#xD;
      substantially alter the practice. Hence, meta-analysis of these trials was undertaken to&#xD;
      further evaluate the role of chemo-radiotherapy in carcinoma cervix (2,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first meta-analysis published by Cochrane Collaborative Group of 4580 randomized patients&#xD;
      (19 randomized trials) suggested that chemo-radiation did show an absolute survival benefit&#xD;
      improvement both in progression free and overall survivals by 16% and 12% respectively&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.0001). The survivals were significantly better with Cisplatin based concomitant&#xD;
      chemo-radiation (p&lt;0.0001). Incidentally, the distant metastasis rates were also&#xD;
      significantly lower in chemo-radiation (p&lt;0.0001). However, all these benefits were seen only&#xD;
      in early stages. In addition, acute grade 3/4 hematological and gastro-intestinal toxicities&#xD;
      were higher with chemo-radiation (additional 8% and 5% respectively). The data was&#xD;
      insufficient to report on late toxicity (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second meta-analysis of 9 randomized trials, recently published by the Canadian Group to&#xD;
      evaluate only cisplatin based concomitant chemo-radiation confirms the improvement in overall&#xD;
      survival (4year survival data) in advanced stages, bulky IB tumors (prior to surgery) and&#xD;
      high risk early disease (post-surgery). Although acute grade 3/4 hematological and&#xD;
      gastro-intestinal toxicities were higher in chemo-radiation, they were short-lived, with only&#xD;
      2 deaths and the remaining resolved with medical treatment. There was no significant increase&#xD;
      in the late toxicity from the data available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the Cochrane and Canadian meta-analysis have to a large extent tried to address the role&#xD;
      of concomitant chemo-radiation, but Carcinoma Cervix Stage III accounted for only 30-35% and&#xD;
      moreover evaluation with optimal radiation schedules and comparison of late toxicities still&#xD;
      remains unanswered. What is more important is that the cisplatin is relatively inexpensive&#xD;
      and is available worldwide. This means that cisplatin-based chemo-radiation is affordable in&#xD;
      the developing countries where carcinoma cervix still forms the major cancer. However, the&#xD;
      role of chemo-radiation in Carcinoma Cervix Stage IIIB in a developing countries including&#xD;
      India still remains unexplored. We propose this randomized study to evaluate the role and&#xD;
      benefit of chemo-radiation in-patients with cervical cancer.&#xD;
