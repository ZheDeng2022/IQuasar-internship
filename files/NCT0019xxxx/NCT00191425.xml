  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to compare 3 different osteoporosis therapies following&#xD;
      one year of teriparatide.In the first year,all eligible patients received open-label&#xD;
      teriparatide 20 micrograms/day.After 1 year, patients are randomly assigned to one of 3&#xD;
      possible follow-up treatment regimens for the second 12 months: continuation of teriparatide,&#xD;
      switch to raloxifene, or no pharmacological treatment(other than the calcium and vitamin D&#xD;
      supplements that everyone receives). Patients are stratified into 3 subsets: (a) patients who&#xD;
      have never received any anti-osteoporosis treatment before; (b) patients who received prior&#xD;
      antiresorptive treatment successfully; (c) patients who failed to respond adequately to prior&#xD;
      antiresorptive drugs (such as bisphosphonates or raloxifene) in the past. These latter&#xD;
      patients are not randomized at month 12 but will continue treatment with teriparatide 20&#xD;
      micrograms/day throughout the second year.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ambulatory women greater or equal to 55 years, at least 2 years postmenopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lumbar spine or total hip or femoral neck bone mineral density measurement must be at&#xD;
             least 2.5 standard deviations (SD) below the average bone mass for young women&#xD;
             (T-score -2.5 or less).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of at least one known and documented preexisting clinical fragility fracture,&#xD;
             in the past 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be included in substudy 2 if they meet any one of the following additional&#xD;
        criteria - Patients who have sustained at least one new fragility fracture (vertebral or&#xD;
        nonvertebral), despite prescription of antiresorptive therapy* during the 12 months prior&#xD;
        to the last new fracture or patients who, after a minimum of two years after initiating&#xD;
        antiresorptive therapy*, either have a lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip BMD of at&#xD;
        least - 3SD below the average bone mass for young women (T-score -3 or less), or who show a&#xD;
        decrease of at least 3.5% in BMD at any one of these sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        *Antiresorptive therapy includes all bisphosphonates, raloxifene, ERT/HRT, calcitonin, and&#xD;
        vitamin D metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For substudy 1 patients only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  current or history of vaginal bleeding or spotting of unknown cause in the 1 year&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  currently suspected or history of venous thrombotic events (VTE), including lower&#xD;
             extremity thrombosis, and other major venous thromboses, or high risk of developing&#xD;
             VTE as assessment by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment with&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vitamin D &gt;50,000 IU/week or with any dose of calcitriol or vitamin D analogs or&#xD;
             agonists in the 6 months prior to visit 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fluorides in the 12 months prior to visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic corticosteroids (other than for replacement therapy) in the 1 month prior to&#xD;
             visit 2.(Ophthalmic, otic topical, orally inhaled, nasally inhaled, or intra-articular&#xD;
             corticosteroid therapy may be used without these restrictions.)&#xD;
