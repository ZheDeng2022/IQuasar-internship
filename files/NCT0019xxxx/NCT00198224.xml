  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Valganciclovir (VGCV) has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      for the treatment and prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in HIV patients. It is&#xD;
      under review for the prevention of CMV disease following organ transplantation. Mycophenolate&#xD;
      mofetil (MMF), the morpholinoethyl ester of mycophenolic acid (MPA) is currently the most&#xD;
      widespread used immunosuppressant in kidney transplantation. These drugs exerts their effects&#xD;
      by blocking the production of DNA primarily in lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have suggested that combining both MMF and GCV in vitro may have a beneficial&#xD;
      effect on the treatment of CMV infections. However, the effect of these two drugs in&#xD;
      combination on the effects of the immune system both in vitro and in vivo have not been&#xD;
      studied. Preliminary studies in our lab show that a combination of these two drugs have an&#xD;
      additive effect on the level of immunosuppression of both the growth and differentiation of&#xD;
      progenitor bone marrow cells as well as lymphocyte proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to test patients degree of immune reactivity both on and off VGCV when&#xD;
      used in combination with MMF. Patients will have blood drawn as several time points and an&#xD;
      immune assay will be performed to show if VGCV when used in combination with MMF exerts&#xD;
      immunosuppressive effects.&#xD;

      Recruitment and screening of subjects will be performed between 4 and 8 weeks after&#xD;
      transplantation at which time consent will be obtained. Per clinical standard of care at&#xD;
      Indiana University, VGCV is routinely stopped at 12 weeks post transplantation. At week 10&#xD;
      and the day of discontinuation of their prophylaxis the patients will be seen by the study&#xD;
      physician. The subjects will also be seen at 2 and 4 weeks after discontinuing VGCV. At each&#xD;
      study visit, the subject will have a limited history and physical (H&amp;P) performed, one 3ml&#xD;
      light green top (lithium heparin) tube, one 3ml dark green top (sodium heparin) tube, and one&#xD;
      5ml purple top (EDTA) tube will be obtained by phlebotomy during their regularly scheduled&#xD;
      blood draw times. This blood will then be used for the Cylex® assay, Flow cytometry and MMF&#xD;
      and GCV trough level. The patient's complete blood count and differential as well as drug&#xD;
      levels, and medication dosages will be recorded. This information will be used for assure&#xD;
      that Cylex® results are not being influenced by changes in immunosuppressive drug levels. The&#xD;
      complete blood count and differential will be used to determine absolute neutrophil counts.&#xD;
      After the week sixteen visit, the subjects will have completed the protocol. Pregnancy tests&#xD;
      will not be performed as patients are not directly receiving any treatment secondary to this&#xD;
      study. Flow cytometry will be performed to measure absolute CD4 counts, CD4/CD8 ratios, and&#xD;
      look at several activation markers on lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signed IRB approved informed consent must be obtained from all subjects prior to screening&#xD;
      assessments. The following evaluations will be performed prior to initiation of phlebotomy&#xD;
      for purposes of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history including age, gender, race, and renal disease, immunosuppressive regimen&#xD;
      including dose, level and use of antibody treatment at time of transplant will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination including: vital signs, cardiac, and lung evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory testing which will be performed as part of standard of care because of the&#xD;
      transplant are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematology: complete blood count. Drug level: tacrolimus, cyclosporine and/or sirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations during treatment and post treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed by surgical co-investigators throughout the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A limited history and physical examination will be performed as indicated in the schedule of&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical laboratory testing Additional clinical laboratory testing beyond standard of care&#xD;
      that will be done for this protocol includes adding a differential to the complete blood&#xD;
      count. CBC and drug levels will be noted from already scheduled clinic appointments and post&#xD;
      transplant protocols. Research blood levels for GCV and MPA will be run from a 3ml lithium&#xD;
      heparin and a 5ml EDTA tube in the research laboratory or at outside laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplant laboratory testing On the testing days an additional 3ml sodium heparin blood tube&#xD;
      will be drawn in phlebotomy at the same time the scheduled labs are obtained. Flow cytometric&#xD;
      analysis will be performed at times listed above. A 5 tube panel using three color analysis&#xD;
      will be performed using approximately 500_L of whole blood from the sodium heparinized tube.&#xD;
      The panel will consist of the following staining protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tube 1 - CD 45 FITC / CD 14 PE - Used to locate lymphocyte population as well as determine&#xD;
      purity of specimen and monocyte contamination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tube 2 - _1a FITC/ _1a PE/ _1a PerCP - Isotype control to check for background staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tube 3 - CD 4 FITC/ CD 8 PE / CD 20 PerCP - Used to determine CD4/CD8 ratio as well as&#xD;
      determining B cell population counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tube 4 - CD 4 FITC/ CD 25 PE/ HLA - DR PerCP - Check for specific activation markers on CD 4&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tube 5 - CD 4 FITC/ CD 69 PE/ CD 3 PerCP - Used to get true CD4 counts on T-cells as well as&#xD;
      look at another activation marker on CD4 cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cylex immune assay will be run as listed above. This assay requires minimal amount of whole&#xD;
      sodium heparinized blood and will be used from same tube as flow analyses. The whole blood is&#xD;
      diluted with a saline base diluent. It is then stimulated overnight with phytohemagglutinin.&#xD;
      The CD4+ or CD3+ T cells are then isolated using magnetic beads. They are lysed and ATP&#xD;
      production is recorded using a luciferase based reaction.&#xD;
