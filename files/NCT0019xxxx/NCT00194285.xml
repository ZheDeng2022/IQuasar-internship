  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the proposed research study is to determine the efficacy of [18-F]&#xD;
      Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in differentiating infections&#xD;
      from other complications such as loosening in patients with painful joint prosthesis. We&#xD;
      intend to validate and establish the necessary criteria for making such a diagnosis and&#xD;
      determine the accuracy of the technique through comparison with other existing modalities&#xD;
      such as white blood imaging and patient outcome. We expect that at the completion of the&#xD;
      proposed research, the role of this novel and powerful imaging modality will be clearly&#xD;
      defined in the management of patients with this challenging and serious complication.&#xD;

      The purposes of this study are: 1. To determine the normal pattern of FDG uptake demonstrated&#xD;
      by pet up to two years following total joint replacement surgery 2. To establish the optimal&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria for differentiating septic from aseptic painful joint prosthesis by&#xD;
      FDG-PET imaging and determine its accuracy 3. To compare the accuracy of FDG-PET imaging to&#xD;
      conventional techniques for the differentiation of septic from aseptic painful joint&#xD;
      prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to enroll 100 patients per year for 5 years. These patients will be selected from&#xD;
      more than 300 cases that undergo joint revisions at the collaborating institutions. After&#xD;
      each patient undergoes an appropriate evaluation including history, physical examination,&#xD;
      radiographic and laboratory evaluation, he/she will be assigned into one of the groups listed&#xD;
      below based on the degree of suspicion of an infectious process. Every effort will be made to&#xD;
      have approximately one-third of the patients recruited from each of the following groups.&#xD;

      Study Plan Study I: FDG-PET imaging in the painful partial or total joint prosthesis We&#xD;
      intend to enroll 100 patients per year for 5 years. These patients will be selected from more&#xD;
      than 300 cases that undergo joint revisions at the collaborating institutions. After each&#xD;
      patient undergoes an appropriate evaluation including history, physical examination,&#xD;
      radiographic and laboratory evaluation, he/she will be assigned into one of the groups listed&#xD;
      below based on the degree of suspicion of an infectious process. Every effort will be made to&#xD;
      have approximately one-third of the patients recruited from each of the following groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Low pre-scan suspicion of infection. The incidence of infection based on past&#xD;
      experience is &lt;10% in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: High pre-scan suspicion of infection. The incidence of infection in this group is&#xD;
      quite high based on past experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: Intermediate pre-scan suspicion of infection. Criteria: Any patient who does not fit&#xD;
      into either group 1 or 2 will be considered for this category. The incidence of infection in&#xD;
      this group based on past experience is intermediate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the large number of patients who undergo joint revision (more than 300 annually)&#xD;
      in the participating institutions combined, we expect no difficulties in recruiting adequate&#xD;
      numbers in all 3 categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will undergo only one preoperative diagnostic FDG-PET scan. After the PET scan&#xD;
      is completed, a diagnosis and detailed description of the observations made will be&#xD;
      communicated to the attending surgeon before the operation. We believe this information will&#xD;
      enable investigators to establish the correct diagnosis during surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study II: FDG-PET imaging following uncomplicated partial or total joint arthroplasty To&#xD;
      accomplish this goal, we will enroll 10 patients per year for the first 3 years. FDG-PET&#xD;
      scans will be performed at approximately 12 months, 18 months and/or 2 years following&#xD;
      surgery. All scans will occur within 2 months of the 12-, 18-, and/or 24-month anniversary of&#xD;
      that patient's most recent joint replacement surgery. It is unknown how long FDG uptake&#xD;
      persists in an uncomplicated partial or total joint arthroplasty. The expected pattern of FDG&#xD;
      uptake following arthroplasty will provide a basis for the correct diagnosis of&#xD;
      periprosthetic infection and loosening during the life of the implant.&#xD;

        Five hundred patients selected for entry into this study will be men or women of any ethnic&#xD;
        background who are scheduled to undergo clinical and diagnostic evaluation for joint&#xD;
        prosthesis revision by members of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the University of&#xD;
        Pennsylvania Health System (Hospital of University of Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania&#xD;
        Hospital) or by the collaborating physicians at the Rothman Institute at Thomas Jefferson&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients selected for entry into this study will be men or women of any ethnic&#xD;
             background who are scheduled to undergo clinical and diagnostic evaluation by a member&#xD;
             of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the Hospital of the University of&#xD;
             Pennsylvania Health System or by the collaborating physicians at the Rothman Institute&#xD;
             or the VA Philadelphia Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study I: FDG-PET imaging in painful partial or total joint prostheses Each patient who is a&#xD;
        candidate will be evaluated by one of the collaborators mentioned above for a painful&#xD;
        partial or total joint prosthesis. The patient will undergo an appropriate routine&#xD;
        evaluation including history, physical examination, radiographic, scintigraphic, and&#xD;
        necessary laboratory evaluation. An initial diagnosis must be made for each patient. The&#xD;
        diagnosis of loosening will be established based on clinical examination and/or&#xD;
        radiographic evaluation demonstrating clear evidence of this complication. Other etiologies&#xD;
        for the joint pain, except for infection and aseptic loosening, need to be excluded.&#xD;
        Surgical intervention (prosthesis revision) may or may not be planned for the patient who&#xD;
        is a candidate for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study II: FDG-PET imaging following uncomplicated partial or total joint arthroplasty All&#xD;
        patients fulfilling the criteria below will be considered potential candidates for this&#xD;
        study. Each patient must have a diagnosis of degenerative joint disease caused by&#xD;
        osteoarthritis (no previous hip surgery) and have undergone primary partial or total joint&#xD;
        arthroplasty by a member of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the Hospital of the&#xD;
        University of Pennsylvania or referring hospitals. Other causes of degenerative joint&#xD;
        disease will be excluded by physical, radiographic and laboratory evaluation as clinically&#xD;
        indicated. Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of degenerative joint disease, and in&#xD;
        order to avoid any confounding factors in experimental results that may be caused by other&#xD;
        types of disorders, only this group of patients will be studied. A patient will be&#xD;
        eliminated from this group at anytime if the post-operative course is complicated by any&#xD;
        process that is thought to influence the outcome. Variations from an uncomplicated&#xD;
        postoperative course will be determined by the operating surgeon and include clinical signs&#xD;
        or other evidence to suggest infection, early loosening, or any other process directly&#xD;
        involving the prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other etiologies for pain, other than for infection and aseptic&#xD;
             loosening, will be excluded from enrollment into the study.&#xD;
