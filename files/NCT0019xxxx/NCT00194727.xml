  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of combination&#xD;
      therapy consisting of daily oral capecitabine and weekly intravenous vinorelbine in stage IV&#xD;
      breast cancer subjects. The study is designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of this&#xD;
      combination therapy. Safety will be assessed by analyzing the types of toxicity, the severity&#xD;
      of toxicity and the need for dose modification or delay due to toxicity. Effectiveness will&#xD;
      be assessed by analyzing response rates, time to treatment failure, time to progression and&#xD;
      overall survival. Our hypothesis is that the regimen will be more effective than standard&#xD;
      historic regimens for this type and stage of cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single-agent chemotherapy is rarely curative in advanced breast cancer. Combination regimens&#xD;
      are the next logical step in the attempt to improve tumor response rates and prolong&#xD;
      survival. Oral capecitabine is a convenient way to deliver drug a 5-fluorouracil analogue. In&#xD;
      addition, vinorelbine is a newer vinca alkaloid chemotherapeutic agent with improved efficacy&#xD;
      and probably improved toxicity over its predecessors in the treatment of breast cancer. We&#xD;
      propose combining these two agents. As these two drugs have non-overlapping toxicities and&#xD;
      differing mechanisms of action, we anticipate being able to deliver both drugs in near full&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary purposes include assessing whether there is a correlation between intra-tumoral&#xD;
      enzyme levels and prognosis.&#xD;

          -  Subject must have pathologic confirmation of breast cancer (at least of primary&#xD;
             disease). Biopsy confirmation of stage IV disease is desirable but not required.&#xD;
