  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Males and females may exhibit different responses to testing of adrenal function. The&#xD;
      hormones responsible for controlling adrenal function are ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone&#xD;
      or corticotropin) and CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone). Adrenal function is tested with&#xD;
      an ACTH stimulation test. ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. Cortisol&#xD;
      levels are measured, and a certain peak level indicates normal adrenal gland function.&#xD;
      Females may produce more cortisol in response to ACTH testing than males. This difference may&#xD;
      be due to certain proteins, called G proteins. The hormones controlling adrenal function,&#xD;
      ACTH and CRH, work through G proteins. Females may have more G proteins than males allowing&#xD;
      for the increased cortisol response to ACTH stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators speculate that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There may be differences in adrenal responsiveness to ACTH stimulation testing between&#xD;
           healthy males and females.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ACTH and CRH induce their own function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sex differences in adrenal responsiveness to ACTH stimulation testing may be related to&#xD;
           sex differences in G protein expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, will be measured before&#xD;
      and after the administration of ACTH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also measure G proteins. G proteins are found in the white blood cells. White&#xD;
      blood cells from females may have more active G proteins than white blood cells from males.&#xD;
      Sex differences may be augmented after exposure to ACTH.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Many nonsteroidal hormones work through G protein signal transducers. These heterotrimeric&#xD;
      signal transducers couple cell surface receptors to intracellular pathways, thus conveying&#xD;
      biologic effects. Most hormones that work via the stimulatory G protein, Gas, also exert&#xD;
      actions through a homologous stimulatory G protein, Gaq, suggesting that these pathways&#xD;
      exhibit redundancy. We have previously demonstrated sex differences in the expression of Gas&#xD;
      and Gaq. We have observed that female mice and humans display significantly higher levels of&#xD;
      mRNA and protein for the G protein, Gaq. We have also observed that estrogens induce&#xD;
      expression of Gaq mRNA and protein in female mice. In addition, preliminary studies in mice&#xD;
      demonstrate that both ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone or corticotropin) and CRH&#xD;
      (corticotropin-releasing hormone) induce Gaq in immune cells and adrenal tissue in a sex&#xD;
      restricted fashion, i.e. females only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTH and CRH are the two major hormones controlling adrenal function. Adrenal function can be&#xD;
      tested using a standard 1mcg synthetic ACTH stimulation test and measuring the production of&#xD;
      cortisol. We have observed that females exhibit a trend toward increased responsiveness to&#xD;
      ACTH stimulation than males. We speculate that sex differences in cortisol responsiveness to&#xD;
      ACTH exist, and that these differences will correlate with sex differences in the expression&#xD;
      or induction of the G proteins, Gaq or Gas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to determine whether healthy female subjects undergoing low-dose ACTH stimulation&#xD;
      exhibit altered levels of Gaq or Gas mRNA and protein and cortisol levels compared with male&#xD;
      subjects undergoing the same provocative testing. This study may have implications for the&#xD;
      interpretation of provocative ACTH testing.&#xD;
