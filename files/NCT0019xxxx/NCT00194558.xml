      The researchers will conduct a 12-month randomized controlled trial comparing usual care&#xD;

      We will conduct a 12-month randomized controlled trial comparing usual care versus chronic&#xD;
      disease management using the Internet among patients with type 1 diabetes on multiple daily&#xD;
      injections with insulin glargine and rapid-acting analogs. Specifically, the objectives of&#xD;
      the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the difference in glycemic control (HbA1c) between intervention and control,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the difference in resource utilization and costs of care between intervention&#xD;
           and control, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the difference in satisfaction with care between intervention and control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 80-85 subjects will be recruited from patients receiving care in the Diabetes Care&#xD;
      Center (DCC) at the University of Washington in Seattle. As part of a pretest-posttest&#xD;
      experimental design, intervention-group subjects will be trained in the use of an existing&#xD;
      diabetes disease-management module comprising six related Web sites that are accessed from&#xD;
      home via links displayed within the University's &quot;MyUW&quot; Internet portal. These sites allow&#xD;
      patients to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. View their entire electronic medical record including clinical reminders, the same&#xD;
           record used by providers,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Upload blood glucose readings stored in a digital meter,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Manually enter medication, nutrition, and exercise data into an online daily diary,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Communicate with providers regarding treatment recommendations or other questions using&#xD;
           a clinical e-mail service,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Obtain additional information from a traditional education site whose content and links&#xD;
           were sanctioned by the Medical Director of the DCC, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Employ a second education site to collaboratively generate action plans intended to&#xD;
           enhance self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to login and password protection, access to confidential information from home&#xD;
      requires the use of secondary authentication (SecureID). All clinical and other data can be&#xD;
      viewed by patients and providers in online trended displays that will be used by a nurse&#xD;
      practitioner to review cases no less than weekly. As the control group, subjects receiving&#xD;
      usual care will not have access to the diabetes module and related case-management services&#xD;
      being evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary clinical outcome for the study is the between group differences in glycemic&#xD;
      control using HbA1c as the metric. A co-primary outcome is all direct medical care&#xD;
      utilization. Satisfaction with diabetes care, employing both a quantitative survey (Patient&#xD;
      Assessment of Chronic Illness Care) and semi-structured interviews performed on a 20%&#xD;
      purposive sub-sample of intervention patients, is a secondary outcome measure.&#xD;
