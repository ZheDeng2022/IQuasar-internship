  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We, the researchers at Hamilton Health Sciences, have developed a novel approach to cancer&#xD;
      therapy using transfected dendritic cells (DCs) to generate enhanced immunity to defined&#xD;
      tumor antigens. Dendritic cells are highly specialized antigen presenting cells found in the&#xD;
      bone marrow, lymph nodes, skin and thymus. Infection of DCs with Adenovirus (Ad) vectors&#xD;
      incorporating genes for defined tumor antigens enables intracellular expression and major&#xD;
      histocompatability complex (MHC)-restricted presentation of tumor peptides by transfected&#xD;
      DCs. Given the potent immunostimulatory properties of DCs and ability to use gene transfer to&#xD;
      &quot;load&quot; DCs with tumor antigen, we hypothesize that administration of transduced autologous&#xD;
      DCs may have potential therapeutic benefit as a cancer vaccine. We have examined Ad-tumor&#xD;
      antigen DC based vaccination in murine models of breast cancer and melanoma. In both models,&#xD;
      injection(s) of Ad-transduced DCs results in highly potent immune activation and&#xD;
      antigen-specific anti-tumor responses. In these models, high levels of antigen-specific,&#xD;
      cytotoxic effector lymphocytes that recognize and kill cancer cells directly correlates with&#xD;
      a therapeutic response (tumor regression and/or complete protection of animals subsequently&#xD;
      re-challenged with tumor cells). Animals demonstrating specific in vitro immunity are&#xD;
      protected against subsequent injection of cancer cells. Moreover, we have observed complete&#xD;
      resolution and significant long-term survival in animals with established metastatic disease&#xD;
      with no demonstrable toxicity. As opposed to vaccination protocols with tumor peptides or&#xD;
      purified epitopes that are MHC-I restricted (i.e. HLA-A2), we have found that injection of&#xD;
      DCs transduced with a vector expressing the entire tumor antigen results in peptide&#xD;
      presentation from both MHC-I and MHC-II complexes. The subsequent immune response is&#xD;
      comprised of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. Thus, Ad-based gene transfer of tumor&#xD;
      antigens appears to be an efficient approach: (1) enabling sustained endogenous peptide&#xD;
      processing, and (2) facilitating DC-specific presentation to the host immune system. We have&#xD;
      shown that using a replication deficient adenovirus vector expressing Her-2/neu DNA under the&#xD;
      control of a human mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter that we can transfect bone&#xD;
      marrow derived DCs (AdHer2/DC). These cells are then used to immunize recipient mice against&#xD;
      tumour challenge with Her2 transgenic tumour cells. The protection is antigen specific (anti&#xD;
      Her2). On the basis of these pre-clinical studies we will initiate a pilot trial of the&#xD;
      AdHer2/DC vaccine in Her -2/neu overexpressing patients with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
      Long-term goals and implications of possible results: The goals of this initial pilot phase I&#xD;
      study are to evaluate the safety and dosing schedule of the vaccine therapy. The vaccine will&#xD;
      be tested in subsequent phase II and III studies to determine efficacy in comparison to&#xD;
      standard therapies. The long-term goals are to eventually test this therapy in the adjuvant&#xD;
      breast cancer setting in Her-2/neu overexpressing patients.&#xD;

      Following written, informed consent, consecutive cohorts of 3-6 patients, up to a maximum of&#xD;
      18 patients, will be treated at increasing dose levels based on a modified Fibonacci scheme.&#xD;
      Peripheral blood progenitor cells will be obtained from each patient following cytokine&#xD;
      mobilization (with GM-CSF and G-CSF). Selected CD34+ cells are then cultured with human&#xD;
      GM-CSF, human TNFÎ±, Flt-3 ligand and human interleukin-4. The CD34+ derived dendritic cells&#xD;
      are then transduced with an adenovirus expressing rat HER2/neu. These transduced DCs are then&#xD;
      injected intradermally into the patient. Patients will be injected with the AdHER2/neu&#xD;
      transduced DCs every 21 days for a total of three treatment cycles. The starting dose of&#xD;
      dendritic cells will be 10 X 10^6 DCs. If none of the initial three patients treated at this&#xD;
      dose experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT) then a new cohort of three patients will be&#xD;
      treated at a second dose level of 50 X 10^6 DCs. If any patient experiences DLT then up to&#xD;
      six patients will be treated at the current dose level; if 2/6 or fewer patients experience&#xD;
      DLT, we will escalate to the to the second dose level. If 3 or more patients experience DLT,&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose will be deemed as exceeded and a second cohort of 3 patients will&#xD;
      be treated at a 10 fold dose reduction of the initial dose level. The third dose level will&#xD;
      consist of 100 x 10^6 DCs. All treatments will occur in the out-patient setting and patients&#xD;
      will be seen prior to each injection and then monthly for at least three months following the&#xD;
      last injection of AdHER2/neu DCs.&#xD;
