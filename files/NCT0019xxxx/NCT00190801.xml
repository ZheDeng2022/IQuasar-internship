  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pemetrexed has shown an anti-tumor activity in advanced gastric cancer patients in a previous&#xD;
      study, while cisplatin is widely used in the combination chemotherapy of gastric cancer.&#xD;
      Pemetrexed has shown synergy with cisplatin in preclinical models and in various human&#xD;
      cancers. The introduction of vitamin supplementation has made treatment with pemetrexed plus&#xD;
      cisplatin safe and well tolerated. The present phase 2 study is an effort to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin in Korean patients with&#xD;
      gastric carcinoma who had no prior palliative chemotherapy for advanced disease. The&#xD;
      patients, who will give their consent for participating in this study, will be screened for&#xD;
      their eligibility and on meeting pre-defined study eligibility criteria, they will receive an&#xD;
      intravenous therapy of the combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin for number of times that&#xD;
      in the opinion of their treating physician is appropriate for them. A response rate of 30% is&#xD;
      considered as the minimum activity level of interest for this patient population.&#xD;
