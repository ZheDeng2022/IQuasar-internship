  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the PAL trial is to increase the understanding of the experiences of long-term&#xD;
      breast cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: Strength training will not increase the rate of lymphedema or worsen&#xD;
      lymphedema as compared to the non-exercising control participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will recruit 288 healthy breast cancer survivors (1-15 years post&#xD;
      diagnosis, currently free of cancer), in two strata: 144 BrCa survivors with stable&#xD;
      lymphedema (defined in section D.2.), and 144 without lymphedema. The women with lymphedema&#xD;
      will be 1-15 years post diagnosis. The women without lymphedema will be 1-5 years post&#xD;
      diagnosis. The difference in timing is due to the timing of the onset of lymphedema. Because&#xD;
      90% of all lymphedema cases are likely to occur by 5 years post treatment, it would be of&#xD;
      greater value to evaluate the safety of strength training for women without lymphedema during&#xD;
      the time frame when lymphedema is most likely to develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be balanced by timing since diagnosis and other factors. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned within lymphedema strata, to the exercise intervention group or the&#xD;
      control group. Participants will be recruited in groups (a total of 8 waves) and randomized&#xD;
      to either a strength-training group or control group. All outcome measurements will occur at&#xD;
      baseline and 12 months later; additionally, all participants will undergo arm volumetry&#xD;
      circumference measures, and a subset of arm function tests (range of motion, pain, grip&#xD;
      strength) every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protection and safety of all participants All participants will be given access to trained&#xD;
      lymphedema specialists throughout study participation, paid for by the study, for evaluation&#xD;
      and treatment of lymphedema. Participants without lymphedema will all participate in an&#xD;
      educational session led by Dr. Schmitz and co-developed by Ms. Benson and Ms. Oatman to&#xD;
      ensure all participants enter the study with a clear understanding of lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant with lymphedema will undergo a clinical evaluation to review lymphedema&#xD;
      related measures and to assess current management strategies as part of the baseline and&#xD;
      12-month measurement visits. The protocol to standardize the content of these evaluation&#xD;
      sessions will be developed in the first twelve months of the study. Participants with&#xD;
      lymphedema, who wear a compression garment, will receive two free garments as part of&#xD;
      participating in the study. Arm volumes, circumferences, extra-cellular water in the arm and&#xD;
      a subset of arm function tests (range of motion, pain, grip strength) will be monitored&#xD;
      quarterly in all participants and monthly in treatment group participants. All participants&#xD;
      will be encouraged to request more frequent arm volumetry and/or circumferences and/or&#xD;
      extra-cellular water in the arm measures if they believe they have had or are concerned about&#xD;
      a change of symptoms. Any participant, regardless of group assignment, who experiences the&#xD;
      onset or a flare-up of lymphedema will be seen by a trained lymphedema specialist for&#xD;
      evaluation and treatment, paid for by the study. Clinical experiences of Ms. Oatman and Ms.&#xD;
      Benson suggest that 10% of the participants with lymphedema will experience a flare-up over&#xD;
      12 months of participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For purposes of this study, a flare-up will be defined as a 5% increase in inter-limb&#xD;
      discrepancy in volume or circumference at the point of greatest visible difference.as&#xD;
      persistent pain/achiness/fullness (in the trunk and/or arm), persistent puffiness (visible),&#xD;
      or change of color that does not resolve within three days of rest, and that requires 5 or&#xD;
      more days of combined decongestive therapy to resolve. Further, for the purposes of this&#xD;
      study, onset of lymphedema will be defined as follows: among women not diagnosed with&#xD;
      lymphedema prior to study entry, a &gt; 10% inter-limb discrepancy in volume or circumference a&#xD;
      the point of greatest visible difference OR swelling or obscuration of anatomic architecture&#xD;
      on close inspection OR pitting edema. as a 2 cm or 200 ml or greater difference between the&#xD;
      arm treated for breast cancer compared to the unaffected arm in a woman not diagnosed with&#xD;
      lymphedema prior to study entry. By these actions and the careful training of the fitness&#xD;
      trainers, we will monitor all participants carefully with regard to onset or worsening of&#xD;
      lymphedema symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will receive social, behavioral support and research staff contact&#xD;
      time to encourage them to increase their activity level to include two weekly&#xD;
      strength-training sessions over 12 months. For the first three months, the exercise sessions&#xD;
      will be supervised and conducted in small groups of 4, to teach the specifics of the&#xD;
      protocol. Thereafter, participants will continue the same exercise protocol on their own or&#xD;
      in groups of their choosing. Treatment group participants will be held accountable for&#xD;
      completing workouts through exercise logs and reminder calls from research staff.&#xD;
      Participants in the treatment group will undergo assessments of arm volumes and&#xD;
      circumferences , as well as a subset of arm function tests (range of motion, pain, grip&#xD;
      strength) monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will undergo all outcome measures at baseline and 12 months, and a few&#xD;
      measures at 3 and 6 months. The outcome measures include assessments of arm circumferences,&#xD;
      extra-cellular water in the arm, and volumetry, as well as a subset of arm function tests&#xD;
      (range of motion, pain, grip strength), and will be asked to neither make purposeful changes&#xD;
      in diet nor to begin strength training until the final measures are completed 12 months&#xD;
      later. After completion of the final measures, control group participants will have the&#xD;
      option to participate in the same intervention offered to treatment group participants,&#xD;
      including a 1-year membership to the YMCA, Sisters in Shape gym, or Pottruck Health and&#xD;
      Fitness Center.&#xD;
