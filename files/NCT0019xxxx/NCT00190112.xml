  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (Af) is the most common morbid event after open heart surgery. Its&#xD;
      incidence ranges from 19% to 27%, as reported by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database.&#xD;
      Many groups have tried to understand and treat this difficult problem and have formulated&#xD;
      different hypotheses to explain its origin. An imbalance of the autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      after surgical intervention has been accepted as a major determinant for this morbidity.&#xD;
      Ventral cardiac denervation is a fast and low-risk procedure. This intervention has shown&#xD;
      significantly reduction of the incidence and severity of Af after routine coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass surgery. This technique could be applied both on-pump or off-pump and used as an&#xD;
      adjunctive procedure to achieve Af prophylaxis. However, the detailed mechanism remains&#xD;
      unclear. Theoretically, heart receives its innervation from the autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      (ANS) via the great vessels and pericardial attachment. The propensity and distribution of&#xD;
      ANS nerve fibers are different in location. In this study, we would like to evaluate the ANS&#xD;
      function after ventral cardiac denervation by using heart rate variability (HRV) and&#xD;
      baroreflex (BRS) sensitivity. 30 patients proposed to have elective off-pump coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass surgery are enrolled. After induction of anesthesia, the depth of anesthesia is&#xD;
      controlled by inhalation agents and monitored by bispectral index. After the major cardiac&#xD;
      operation, ventral cardiac denervation is performed by using electrocautery. The digital&#xD;
      signals of heart rate and blood pressure are acquired before and after the surgical&#xD;
      procedures under the same range of bispectral index (50~60). The paired HRV and BRS are&#xD;
      analyzed. This will provide us more information to justify the procedure.&#xD;

      Coronary artery bypass and ventral cardiac denervation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) is performed based on patient's coronary angiography.&#xD;
      Following the completion of coronary anastomoses, ventral cardiac denervation is achieved by&#xD;
      removing the nerves around the large vessels of the base of the heart that run from the right&#xD;
      side of the superior vena cava and end at the level of the midportion of the anterior&#xD;
      pulmonary artery. This was done by excising the fat pads that surround the superior vena&#xD;
      cava, the aorta, and the anterior and right lateral aspects of the main pulmonary artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent OPCAB have Swan-Ganz catheter in our institute. Cardiac output&#xD;
      measurement is obtained by thermodilution method. Hemodynamic variables (systemic blood&#xD;
      pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge&#xD;
      pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary vascular resistance, etc) are recorded&#xD;
      during the measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG and blood pressure monitoring system:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG and radial arterial blood pressure were recorded by an analog to digital converter system&#xD;
      (National Instrument Inc.). The analog signals were digitized in a rate of 500Hz and were&#xD;
      stored in a hard disk. The data were then analyzed by a program written with MATLAB language&#xD;
      (version 5.2, MATHWORK Co.). QRS complexes were automatically classified and manually&#xD;
      verified as normal sinus rhythm, arterial or ventricular premature beats, or noise by&#xD;
      comparison of the adjacent QRS morphologic features. The N-N interval time series were then&#xD;
      transferred to a personal computer and post-processed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data acquisitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after induction of anesthesia, the patient was intubated. Routine indwelling&#xD;
      catheters, like CVP and SG catheter were inserted. Prior to skin incision, the depth of&#xD;
      anesthesia was monitored by BIS system using bispectral index (60~70) and adjusted by&#xD;
      inhalation agents. Digital ECG and BP signals were recorded for 15 min without any mechanical&#xD;
      or pharmacological interference. After completion of surgical procedures, the data&#xD;
      acquisition was repeated once again in the operation room under the same level of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baroreflex sensitivity analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of BRS was conducted by both the sequence method and the spectral (α-index)&#xD;
      method. Sequence method: In brief, the beat-by-beat time series of systolic arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure and ECG R-R intervals were scanned to identify sequences of over three consecutive&#xD;
      beats in which the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and R-R intervals of the next beat changed&#xD;
      concomitantly in increasing or decreasing sequence. Such beat-to-beat sequences were&#xD;
      identified as baroreflex sequences. A linear regression was applied to the individual&#xD;
      sequence and only r2 values &gt;0.85 were accepted. The measure of each type of the integrated&#xD;
      spontaneous BRS was obtained by averaging all accepted slopes of the same type during a&#xD;
      5-minute recording. Spectral (α-index) method: The α-index (α) was obtained by means of the&#xD;
      simultaneous spectral analysis of the R-R intervals and the SBP variabilities, with the&#xD;
      calculation being made from the square root of the ratio between the R-R intervals and the&#xD;
      SBP variability in low frequency (LF) band (αLF, 0.04 to 0.15 Hz). The coherence between the&#xD;
      R-R intervals and SBP was assessed by a cross-spectral analysis. The α-index was calculated&#xD;
      only when the magnitude of squared coherence (K2) between the RR and the SBP signals exceed&#xD;
      0.5 in LF band.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate variability analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The missing intervals of the raw N-N data were linearly interpolated and resampled at 4 Hz by&#xD;
      the Ron-Berger method. Each 5-minute segment of N-N intervals was taken for HRV analysis. The&#xD;
      time domain measurements of HRV included SDNN, r-MSSD. The frequency-domain measurements of&#xD;
      HRV included LF and HF, which were calculated by Welch's averaged periodogram of the N-N&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
