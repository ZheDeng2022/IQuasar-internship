  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is an important cause of death and serious illness among Mozambican children.&#xD;
      Although the risk of malaria can be reduced by drugs and by impregnated bed nets, it would be&#xD;
      helpful if children could be protected against malaria by a vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GSK Biologicals is developing in partnership with Malaria Vaccine Initiative at PATH a&#xD;
      candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS02 for the routine immunization of infants and children&#xD;
      living in malaria endemic areas. The vaccine would offer protection against malaria disease&#xD;
      due to the parasite Plasmodium falciparum and also would provide protection against infection&#xD;
      with hepatitis B virus. Previous studies have shown the candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS02&#xD;
      to be safe when administered in adults and children aged 1-11 years. However, to assess if&#xD;
      this vaccine could provide protection against malaria in children, this study has been&#xD;
      undertaken.&#xD;

      In this study, the participating children will either receive either 3 doses of the new&#xD;
      malaria vaccine or the control vaccine which has been selected because of its benefit to the&#xD;
      children in preventing important childhood diseases. The control vaccines include the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the child is of 24 months or older, he/she may receive 3 doses of a vaccine, called&#xD;
           Engerix-B™, which protects against hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the child is less than 24 months, he/she may receive: two doses of a vaccine called&#xD;
           Prevnar® and one dose of a vaccine called Hiberix™. Prevnar® prevents pneumonia and&#xD;
           meningitis caused by some Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. Hiberix™ prevents severe&#xD;
           infections such as pneumonia and meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b&#xD;
           bacteria (Hib). All children will be monitored for the development of malaria disease&#xD;
           over an 18-month period extending from the third vaccination. All participants will also&#xD;
           be monitored for vaccine safety from first vaccination to study close.&#xD;
