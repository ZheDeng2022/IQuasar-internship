      Rational of the study: for macular holes larger than 400 µm the rate of failure is of more&#xD;
      than 20%. It is for these eyes that it is necessary to show the benefit of internal limiting&#xD;
      membrane (ILM) peeling in term of vision and success rate. In order to test the benefit of&#xD;
      this gesture, it is necessary to make a randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To show that the percentage of success (anatomical closing, confirmed by&#xD;
      OCT) at third postoperative month is higher in the ILM peeling group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study: Randomized multicentric study, in parallel groups, with individual&#xD;
      benefit for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tested Hypothesis: The success rate of the surgery of idiopathic macular holes larger than&#xD;
      400 µm is increased by the peeling of the MLI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Awaited results: To show that the success rate of the surgery of idiopathic macular holes&#xD;
      larger than 400 µm is improved by ILM peeling. This category could then have a success rate&#xD;
      similar to the small holes. If this difference is not proven, it will remain no justification&#xD;
      to continue this procedure which represents little risk but which is not either without&#xD;
      consequence.&#xD;

      membrane (ILM) peeling in term of vision and success rate. In order to test the benefit of&#xD;
      this gesture, it is necessary to make a randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To show that the percentage of success (anatomical closing, confirmed by&#xD;
      OCT) at three postoperative months is higher in the ILM peeling group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study: Randomized multicentric study, in parallel groups, with individual&#xD;
      benefit for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tested Hypothesis: The success rate of the surgery of idiopathic macular holes larger than&#xD;
      400 µm is increased by the peeling of the MLI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: - Percentage of success according to the effective success of peeling&#xD;
      (failure, partial peeling, peeling 360°) in the peeling group of the MLI. - Gain of ETDRS&#xD;
      visual acuity in the third postoperative month.- Progression of cataract - Frequency of the&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects and duration of the study: 80 patients older than 18 yo , presenting a&#xD;
      macular hole &gt; 400 µm, divided into two parallel groups will be included and followed up 3&#xD;
      months. The estimated total duration of the study is 27 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The percentages of success in the 2 groups will be compared by a Chi ²&#xD;
      or Fisher exact test. The test Q of COCHRAN will be used to take into account the ordered&#xD;
      character of the categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermediate Analysis: An intermediate analysis is envisaged. The procedure of adjustment of&#xD;
      the risk of Lan and DeMets will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Awaited results: To show that the success rate of the surgery of idiopathic macular holes&#xD;
      larger than 400 µm is improved by ILM peeling. This category could then have a success rate&#xD;
      similar to the small holes. If this difference is not proven, it will remain no justification&#xD;
      to continue this procedure which represents little risk but which is not either without&#xD;
      consequence.&#xD;
