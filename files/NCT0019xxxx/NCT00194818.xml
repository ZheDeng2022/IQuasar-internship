  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We, the investigators at University of Washington, plan on evaluating the effect of open&#xD;
      label Asacol at a dose of 4.8 grams/day divided BID (twice per day) or TID (three times per&#xD;
      day) on its ability to induce remission in patients with mild to moderately active ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis. We hypothesize that both regimens will have the same efficacy and no difference in&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We plan to perform an open label, efficacy and safety pilot study with Asacol (a mesalamine&#xD;
      product) for mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis. An investigator, to confirm the&#xD;
      diagnosis of ulcerative colitis will review the medical records of potentially eligible&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least one week prior to enrollment, potentially eligible patients will be evaluated to&#xD;
      score the Ulcerative colitis clinical activity index (UCAI). This index incorporates eight&#xD;
      items: stool frequency, blood in stools, general well being, abdominal pain, fever,&#xD;
      extra-intestinal manifestations, sedimentation rate and hemoglobin. Scores range from 0-32. A&#xD;
      score of more than 4 on this index is considered clinically significant. A total score of&#xD;
      4-12 represents mild to moderate activity of colitis. A routine clinic visit will be&#xD;
      scheduled before entry, at which time a standard physical examination, stool samples to&#xD;
      evaluate for infections and blood tests will be performed. Base-line demographic information,&#xD;
      scores on the UCAI, and data on medication use will be obtained at this visit. Quality of&#xD;
      life will be measured one week prior to randomization with the Inflammatory Bowel Disease&#xD;
      Questionnaire, a previously validated instrument with four parts (on bowel function,&#xD;
      emotional status, systemic symptoms, and social function); the total score on this index&#xD;
      ranges from 32 to 224, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. The scores of&#xD;
      patients in remission usually range from 170 to 190.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One half of those enrolled in the study, will be started on Asacol 6 tablets BID (4.8&#xD;
      grams/day). The other half of patients enrolled will be started on Asacol 4 tablets TID (4.8&#xD;
      grams/day). If patients do not tolerate the starting dose they will be titrated down until&#xD;
      they reach a tolerable dose. During the first 6 weeks of the study all other medications will&#xD;
      be held at stable doses. Patients will be seen at week 2 for symptom evaluation and undergo a&#xD;
      standard physical exam and basic laboratory tests. At week 4 the patients will again be&#xD;
      evaluated and undergo a standard physical examination, and standard blood tests will be&#xD;
      performed. All patients will be asked to provide a stool sample at visit 1 and their final&#xD;
      visit, to measure a fecal lactoferrin, which provides an objective measure of inflammation in&#xD;
      the colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 6 other disease modifying medications may be used or altered accordingly. All&#xD;
      patients will be seen for week 8 or 2 weeks after being considered a study failure (i.e. if&#xD;
      patients drop out at week 2 they would be seen at week 4) for re-evaluation of symptoms. At&#xD;
      week 12 if patients have failed to show improvement, achieve remission or if they have&#xD;
      require other medications, they will have been considered to fail the study. Participants&#xD;
      have achieved remission, defined as a UCAI of more than 4 or had a response defined as a&#xD;
      reduction in CAI score of less than 4, they will be considered to have responded to the&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure of the trial will be the presence of clinical improvement by week&#xD;
      12, as defined by decrease in the UCAI score of more than 4. The proportion of patients in&#xD;
      each arm who achieve clinical response in arm of the trial will be compared. The proportion&#xD;
      of patients in each arm who achieve remission to therapy as measured by a reduction in UCAI&#xD;
      score of less than 4 will be examined as a secondary outcome measure. Other secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include improvement in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) scores,&#xD;
      time to clinical response, self-reported patient satisfaction, patient compliance based on&#xD;
      pill count, and time to failure. The number of patients in each arm requiring the addition of&#xD;
      disease modifying medication will be evaluated. The primary endpoint will be adjusted for&#xD;
      disease modifying agents should there be a significant difference between the groups in use&#xD;
      of these medications, but the power to do so may be limited based on the sample size of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of patients achieving clinical remission or response in each arm will be&#xD;
      compared using Fisher's exact test. Comparisons of continuous variables such as UCAI scores&#xD;
      and IBDQ scores will be performed using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Because the&#xD;
      goal of the proposed study is to generate pilot data to support a larger randomized trial,&#xD;
      the power to detect a clinically important difference between the two dosing regimens will be&#xD;
      limited. Assuming a 75% rate of clinical remission in the TID group, the proposed sample size&#xD;
      of 10 patients per group will allow us to detect a 25% decrease in the rate of remission in&#xD;
      the BID group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is an open label study, investigators will have access to all clinical information&#xD;
      concerning adverse events and response rates throughout the study. We will assess safety and&#xD;
      efficacy differences between the two groups after 5 patients have been randomized to each&#xD;
      arm. Should more than 20% (n=2) of the patients develop serious adverse events necessitating&#xD;
      the discontinuation of Asacol, the study will be stopped. In addition, we will halt the study&#xD;
      if there is greater than a 40% difference in efficacy between the treatment groups at the&#xD;
      midway point of the trial.&#xD;
