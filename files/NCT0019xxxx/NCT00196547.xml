  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if Montelukast added to other therapy, if any, will&#xD;
      reduce the severity of asthma symptoms in children during the high incidence of respiratory&#xD;
      viral infections that occur in children in the post Labor Day school return period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 1990- and 2003, we identified in Ontario, and subsequently across Canada, a striking&#xD;
      increase in hospital admissions for asthma in children occurring predictably in the third&#xD;
      week of September every year.1 In 2000 we undertook a retrospective case-control study&#xD;
      comparing the clinical characteristics of children using local emergency rooms for asthma in&#xD;
      September, with those of children presenting during the non-epidemic months of July-August.&#xD;
      Based on that pilot study of 169 children, we developed a larger prospective case-control&#xD;
      study of clinical and biological characteristics of children recruited as they presented to&#xD;
      an emergency room for asthma during September 2001. The control group for this study were&#xD;
      children recruited from the community who had symptomatic asthma but did not have a September&#xD;
      exacerbation requiring emergency room utilization. We identified the presence of rhinovirus&#xD;
      in the majority of children attending an ER with acute asthma, and also found rhinovirus in a&#xD;
      substantial proportion of the community based controls. We also found a highly significant&#xD;
      difference in use of medications for asthma, with the ER cases being much less likely to be&#xD;
      receiving adequate anti-inflammatory medication. In September 2004 we conducted a pilot&#xD;
      randomized controlled blinded clinical trial of the efficacy of montelukast in reducing&#xD;
      morbidity caused by asthma exacerbations associated with respiratory viral infections (RVI)&#xD;
      in children aged 2 to 14. We found a highly significant reduction in reported symptom free&#xD;
      days in the montelukast group. The current study is a randomized placebo-controlled trial of&#xD;
      montelukast, during September 2005 to confirm the results of our pilot study and to examine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of montelukast in reducing asthma morbidity during RVIs in different age&#xD;
      and sex groups with a range of risk of exacerbations. We also wish to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of montelukast to placebo in reducing asthma morbidity during RVIs between&#xD;
      groups of children concurrently taking no or other classes of asthma control medications.&#xD;
