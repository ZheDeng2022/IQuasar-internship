  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to determine the proportion of subjects, seronegative&#xD;
      to all three strains of influenza, as defined by a serum hemagglutination inhibition&#xD;
      antibodies (HAI) antibody titer of &lt;1:10, who shed each vaccine virus strain following a&#xD;
      single dose of CAIV-T.&#xD;
