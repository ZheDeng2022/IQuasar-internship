  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanism involved in the development of tardive dyskinesia (TD) is complicated. It now&#xD;
      seems that several neurotransmitter systems may be affected, including dopaminergic,&#xD;
      noradrenergic, gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) ergic, cholinergic and peptidergic pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Piracetam (2-oxo-pyrrolidone) is a nootropic drug structurally related to GABA. It has been&#xD;
      used clinically to treat a wide range of diseases and conditions, mainly in treatment of&#xD;
      organic brain syndrome, myoclonus, memory impairment, post-concussional syndrome, vertigo,&#xD;
      alcohol withdrawal, cerebrovascular insufficiency, hypoxia, intoxications of different&#xD;
      origins or mechanic brain injures. Piracetam is cerebral homeostatic normalizer,&#xD;
      neuroprotectant, cerebral metabolic enhancer and brain integrative agent. It enhances brain&#xD;
      energy, especially under deficit condition: hypoxia, chemical toxicity or impaired cerebral&#xD;
      microcirculation; preserve, protect and enhance synaptic membrane and receptor structure and&#xD;
      plasticity. It has various effects on glutamate neurotransmission on micromolar levels&#xD;
      piracetam potentiates potassium-induced release of glutamate from hippocampal nerves. It is&#xD;
      an oxidant agent and may be useful for treatment TD. Piracetam is among the toxicologically&#xD;
      safest drugs ever developed even in mega doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data derived from some clinical reports have suggested that piracetam can improve symptoms&#xD;
      and is effective agent for treatment of different movement disorders including acute&#xD;
      neuroleptic induced extrapyramidal symptoms and TD. The doses that used for TD treatment&#xD;
      varied from 800 mg/day to 24000 mg/day. According to these findings the symptoms of TD&#xD;
      disappeared in the period of 3-7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date there was only one double-blind crossover study regarding use of piracetam for&#xD;
      treatment TD that was conducted almost 20 years ago. The findings of this study were&#xD;
      impressive, but to our knowledge nobody reproduced these results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We intend to examine 40 inpatients, aged 18-75 years old, suffering from TD and its variants.&#xD;
      Criteria for inclusion into the study will be: a) DSM-IV diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia; b)&#xD;
      stable psychotropic regimen of a month prior to entry into the study; c) duration of TD of at&#xD;
      least 1 year; d) all patients had to be hospitalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will be: a) evidence of family history of Huntington's disease; b)&#xD;
      evidence of substance or alcohol abuse; c) patients who received any form of vitamin&#xD;
      medication; d) patients with concurrent medical illness or neurological disorders that may&#xD;
      have influenced up the diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design will be a double blind, randomized crossover group study and will be last&#xD;
      for 8 weeks. This period provided an opportunity to exclude the influence of spontaneous&#xD;
      fluctuations in the severity of TD. Full physical and laboratory examinations were performed&#xD;
      on all inpatients in the beginning and at the end of the trial. Psychotropic medication will&#xD;
      be maintained at fixed doses throughout the duration of study. The capsules preparations will&#xD;
      be made by a professional pharmacist in the same size and color capsules in individual&#xD;
      number-coded packages. The capsules will be added to the patients' usual medications and will&#xD;
      be given by nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments for tardive dyskinesia and its variants will be done using Extrapyramidal Symptom&#xD;
      Rating Scale (ESRS) at baseline and repeated every week, prior crossover, and then every&#xD;
      week. This scale was developed by G. Chouinard and A. Ross-Chouinard (15) and was designed to&#xD;
      rate three types of extrapyramidal symptoms: parkinsonian, dystonic and dyskinetic. Although&#xD;
      the scale may be applied to non-drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms, its sensitivity has&#xD;
      been most often assessed in the evaluation of drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. The dose&#xD;
      of piracetam or placebo will be increased every week on 2000 mg up to 8000 mg/day in&#xD;
      dependence on the changes of movement disorders. The doses of their neuroleptic medications&#xD;
      not will be change a month before and during the research. The patients will take piracetam&#xD;
      or placebo as addition to their constant medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be emphasized again that improvement of TD symptoms after piracetam addition was&#xD;
      appeared through very short period (3-7 days) in comparison to other medications used for&#xD;
      treatment of TD. Moreover, if efficacy of piracetam will be proved in our study, clinicians&#xD;
      obtain a new, effective, safe drug for TD treatment with rapid onset of the action.&#xD;
