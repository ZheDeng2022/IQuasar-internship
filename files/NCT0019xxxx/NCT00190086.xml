      Cardiac syndrome X is characterized by angina, positve stress test, and patent coronary&#xD;
      angiography, and its probable mechanism is microvascular dysfunction associated with&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction. We used brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation to assess the&#xD;
      endothelial function of the patients with syndrome X, coronary artery disease, and controls.&#xD;
      Methods: We enrolled 28 patients with syndrome X, 11 healthy volunteers and 11 coronary&#xD;
      artery disease patients. All subjects underwent a 2-step brachial artery flow-related&#xD;
      vasodilation test: ultrasound artery diameter was measured at rest and after occlusion to&#xD;
      assess endothelium-dependent vasodilation and after sublingual nitroglycerin to determine&#xD;
      endothelium-independent condition. Serum endothelin-1 assay was performed for all&#xD;
      participants. Results: The cardiac syndrome X patients had lower brachial artery dilation&#xD;
      ratio (diameter after test/ diameter before test) than controls (1.10 +/- 0.09 versus 1.27&#xD;
      +/- 0.11, p=0.013), but the ratio is still higher than CAD patients (1.10 +/- 0.09 versus&#xD;
      1.02 +/- 0.07, p&lt;0.001). After sublingual nitroglycerin, all 50 subjects had adequate&#xD;
      vasodilation. Besides, normal controls have higher endothelin-1 level than the others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We concluded that syndrome X patients have worse endothelial function than healthy control,&#xD;
      but patients of CAD had even worse endothelium function than cardiac syndrome X patients.&#xD;

      Cardiac syndrome x (CSX), which is defined as the combination of typical chest pain,&#xD;
      electrocardiography or nuclear medicine evidence suggesting myocardial ischemia, and patent&#xD;
      coronary arteriogram, comprises approximately 10-30% of the patients undergoing coronary&#xD;
      angiogram.1,2 However, since it was first introduced in 1973, the pathogenesis of CSX has&#xD;
      remained an enigma.1, 2 Among all the hypothetic explanations of CSX, including abnormal pain&#xD;
      perception and non-cardiogenic origin of pain, the coronary microvascular dysfunction&#xD;
      (microvascular angina), which represents reduced microvascular dilatory response and&#xD;
      increased resistence, has been consistently found in CSX patients. 2, 3 This microvascular&#xD;
      angina is believed to bridge the gap between the ischemic evidence and the normal-looking of&#xD;
      coronary tree of CSX, and seems attributed to the endothelium dysfunction (ED), another&#xD;
      frequently reported abnormality in CSX.2.3 By definition, ED is characterized by the&#xD;
      endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDVD) impairment, which is believed to be caused by&#xD;
      decreased release of NO activity and/or activity, while the endotheliumindependent&#xD;
      vasodilation (EIVD) remains preserved. 2,3,4 Therefore, it is asserted that&#xD;
      endothelium-dependent dilatation of the resistance coronary arteries is defective in patients&#xD;
      with CSX, and such defects may contribute to the altered regulation of myocardial perfusion&#xD;
      in these patients.5 On the other hand, ED play a pivotal role in the development,&#xD;
      progression, and clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis, as well as in the development of&#xD;
      ischemia and thrombosis in the late stages of the disease, by promoting coronary&#xD;
      vasoconstriction and thrombosis.4 Instead of using invasively intravascular measuring method&#xD;
      used for endothelial function assessment, Celermajer et al first introduced the non-invasive&#xD;
      measurement of the flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of forearm brachial artery in the&#xD;
      assessment of EDVD and EIVD.6 This method was reported to have good correlation to the&#xD;
      invasively intravascular studies in coronary systems.4 In this study, we want to compare the&#xD;
      difference of forearm FMD, which respond to specially programmed stimuli, in three patient&#xD;
      groups: CSX, coronary artery disease (CAD), and normal volunteers. A two-staged stimulation&#xD;
      strategy is utilized to assess the EDVD (with cuff occlusion) and EIVD (with sublingual&#xD;
      nitroglycerin) consecutively. A baseline plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) concentration is also&#xD;
      checked for each patient enrolled.&#xD;
