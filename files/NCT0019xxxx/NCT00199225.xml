      This phase I trial will evaluate the effects of rupatadine, at a dose of 10 mg OD (authorised&#xD;
      and marketed dose) and the 100mg/day (supratherapeutic dose) on the ECG parameters with a&#xD;
      special focus on its effect on cardiac repolarisation (QTc interval duration).Furthermore,&#xD;
      the study is performed to assess the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship between&#xD;
      plasma concentration of rupatadine and its effects, if any, on cardiac repolarisation mainly&#xD;
      in the QTc interval).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess whether administration of a repeated dose of 10 and 100&#xD;
      mg/day , has the potential to cause QT prolongation in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

      Recently, as FDA as EMEA provides recommendations to sponsors concerning the design, conduct,&#xD;
      analysis and interpretation of clinical studies to assess the potential for delaying cardiac&#xD;
      repolarisation. This paper recommends to perform a 'through Qt/QTc' study to expand ECGs&#xD;
      safety evaluation during later stages of drug development. It was recomended that the study&#xD;
      was randomized, blind and placebo controlled. Moreover, as a high sensitivy is necessary in&#xD;
      order to detect differences in the QTc measure, it was essential a positive control included.&#xD;
      On that basis, the positive control should be well-characterized and consistently produce an&#xD;
      effect corresponding to the largest change in the QT/QTc interval that is currently viewed as&#xD;
      clinically not important to detect (a mean change of around 5 ms. Because of this, we decide&#xD;
      select as positive control: moxifloxacin, used in the most of similar phase I clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these type of studies, as recommended by the guidelines, there should be a caracterization&#xD;
      to ensure that the dose-response and generally the concentration-response relationship for&#xD;
      QT/QTc prolongation, including exploration of concentrations that are higher than those&#xD;
      achieved following the therapeutic doses. So, thererfore, we decided use 100 mg/daY (10 times&#xD;
      the therapeutic dose) as supratherapeutic dose to be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We decide propose a new phase I study as recommended guidelines (a single-blind, randomised,&#xD;
      placebo and active-controlled, parallel design). With this, we've tried complet the&#xD;
      rupatadine effects over QTc and another electrocardiographic parameters and valued the&#xD;
      risk-benefit relationship for this new antiH1 and PAF antagonist&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. In good health as determined by the principal investigator based on medical history,&#xD;
             physical examination, ECG, and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Body Mass Index between 19 and 27 kg/m2.&#xD;
