      The purpose of this study is to develop a better tolerated and more effective pharmacologic&#xD;
      treatment for individuals with Asperger's Disorder and Pervasive Developmental Disorder. This&#xD;
      is an open-label investigation of aripiprazole in the management of the maladaptive behaviors&#xD;
      of autistic disorder. We hypothesize that aripiprazole will be effective for reducing&#xD;
      aggression and repetitive behavior.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) are characterized be severe impairments in social&#xD;
      interaction and communication in addition to restricted patterns of interests and activities.&#xD;
      Research suggests that a dysregulation of the dopamine and serotonin systems contributes to&#xD;
      these interfering behaviors in individuals with PDD. After benefits of typical neuroleptics&#xD;
      were reported in subjects with PDD's, research shifted to the atypical antipsychotics, which&#xD;
      have been shown to be better tolerated and effective in this population. However, the&#xD;
      atypical antipsychotics have also been associated with adverse effects. Thus there remains a&#xD;
      need for a novel pharmacotherapy that would be safe and effective for children and&#xD;
      adolescents with PDD's including Asperger's disorder and PDD Not Otherwise Specified (PDD&#xD;
      NOS). We hypothesize that aripiprazole will be effective for reducing aggression and&#xD;
      repetitive behavior. We also hypothesize that aripiprazole will be well tolerated, with low&#xD;
      risk for extrapyramidal symptoms, hyperprolactinemia, weight gain, or corrected QT interval&#xD;
      (QTc) prolongation. In addition, this open-label study will serve to stimulate more&#xD;
      definitive, controlled research.&#xD;
