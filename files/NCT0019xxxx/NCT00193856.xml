  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal objectives of the RADAR trial is to address the hypotheses; 1) that 18 months&#xD;
      androgen deprivation in conjunction with radiotherapy is superior to 6 months androgen&#xD;
      deprivation prior to and during radiotherapy; 2) that 18 months Bisphosphonate therapy will&#xD;
      prevent bone loss caused by androgen deprivation therapy and further reduce relapse risk by&#xD;
      impeding the development of bony metastases.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally androgen deprivation (by orchidectomy, or more recently by medication) has been&#xD;
      reserved for the palliative treatment of men with advanced, incurable prostate cancer.&#xD;
      However, evidence from large scale trials is beginning to suggest that androgen deprivation&#xD;
      (AD) may be helpful in preventing relapse in patients with more localised disease who are&#xD;
      treated surgically or by radiotherapy. Of the 8000 patients per annum who are treated with&#xD;
      curative intent, one half (4000) have cancers where 'adjuvant' AD may be prescribed according&#xD;
      to interpretation of the registered indications. There are, however, enormous variations in&#xD;
      prescribing practices which reflect uncertainty as to the appropriate indications. An&#xD;
      important issue is osteopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increasing use of AD in men with earlier stages of cancer, whose life expectancies exceed&#xD;
      3 years, has exposed many unwanted metabolic sequelae of prolonged AD, the most important&#xD;
      being osteopenia. In 1996, with the funding support of the NHMRC and the pharmaceutical&#xD;
      industry, TROG therefore launched a large randomised three-arm trial. Two of the arms&#xD;
      repeated the two arms of the US Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 86.01 trial which, at&#xD;
      the time, was showing early indications of benefit for the addition of two months maximal&#xD;
      androgen deprivation (MAD), using Goserelin (Zoladex) and Flutamide, before radiation therapy&#xD;
      and one month during. Since work from Canada had indicated that continued AD for periods&#xD;
      longer than three months produced additional shrinkage of the prostatic tumour, the TROG&#xD;
      96.01 trial incorporated a third arm: six months MAD prior to and during radiotherapy. The&#xD;
      trial completed its recruitment target of 800 eligible patients in early 2000. Although in&#xD;
      August 2001 the median follow up time was still very short, a preliminary analysis indicated&#xD;
      that significant increases in time to biochemical relapse had been produced by AD. In fact,&#xD;
      the benefits of AD were independent of stage, tumour grade and initial PSA value which were&#xD;
      confirmed also to predict time to biochemical failure. The hazard of relapse reduced to 0.75&#xD;
      (0.55 - 0.97, 95% confidence intervals) with 3 months AD, and still further to 0.6 (0.45 -&#xD;
      0.82) with six months AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent international developments in this area of research encouraged the design of a&#xD;
      'follow on' trial. A European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial&#xD;
      reported that 3 years of adjuvant ('post hoc') AD (using Goserelin alone), administered after&#xD;
      radiotherapy, reduced relapse and improved survival in patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      prostate cancer. The US Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 85.31 trial indicated that&#xD;
      indefinite Goserelin administration after radiotherapy reduced treatment failure rates at all&#xD;
      sites when compared with radiotherapy alone. The RTOG 92.02 trial showed that 24 months of&#xD;
      adjuvant Goserelin also reduced failure rates in patients treated with 4 months of MAD prior&#xD;
      to and during radiotherapy. Subset analyses of the RTOG trials, suggested that patients who&#xD;
      gain most from prolonged AD in terms of survival are those with high grade cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was therefore logical for TROG to propose a second trial with the intention of finding out&#xD;
      whether an additional 12 months of AD administered after radiotherapy (aka 'intermediate&#xD;
      term' AD [ITAD]) would reduce relapse and mortality in patients treated with six months of AD&#xD;
      prior to and during radiotherapy (aka 'short term' AD [STAD]) as in the 'best' arm of its&#xD;
      first (96.01) trial. The availability of the potent bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid, also&#xD;
      made it possible to find out whether or not osteopenia induced in the two arms of the&#xD;
      proposed second trial would be prevented by a second random assignment to 18 months'&#xD;
      bisphosphonate therapy (BP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised phase III multicentre clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent is given and eligibility is checked patients will be randomised to one&#xD;
      of four trial arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 6 months of androgen blockade with an LH-RH analogue (5 months before start of&#xD;
           radiotherapy) (STAD),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 18 months of androgen blockade with an LH-RH analogue (starting 5 months before start of&#xD;
           radiotherapy) (ITAD),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 18 months of therapy with zoledronic acid 4 mg by intravenous infusion every 3 months&#xD;
           for 18 months beginning concurrently with STAD&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 18 months of therapy with zoledronic acid beginning concurrently with ITAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification will be according to the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2 / T3, 4 Gleason score 2 - 6 / 7+ Presenting PSA &lt;10 / 10 - 20 / &gt;20 Treatment centre&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Treatment will be delivered using a conventional technique, unless the treatment&#xD;
      centre of the participating clinician demonstrates an ability to deliver the treatment using&#xD;
      a CRT, IMRT, or HDRB technique verified by the trial TACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      LH-RH analogue (LH-RHa) (Leuprorelin acetate 22.5 mg) will be delivered as a depot injection&#xD;
      every 3 months. This will be administered as an Intramuscular injection (IMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zoledronic acid 4 mg will be delivered as an intravenous infusion over 15 minutes once every&#xD;
      3 months for 18 months, in patients randomised to this therapy. No placebo therapy will be&#xD;
      given to patients randomised to 'no bisphosphonate therapy' treatment arm.&#xD;
