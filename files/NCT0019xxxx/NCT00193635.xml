    <textblock>
      Congenital or hereditary structural anomalies of the genitourinary tract account for&#xD;
      approximately half of all cases of end stage renal disease in the pediatric population.&#xD;
      Despite optimal medical management, when the GFR falls below 50 ml/min/1.73 M2, nearly 40% of&#xD;
      affected children will require dialysis or a renal transplant within 2 years. At present,&#xD;
      there is no specific treatment for patients with congenital uropathies that can retard the&#xD;
      progressive loss of kidney function and forestall the need for renal replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence in experimental animals and in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF)&#xD;
      that immunoeffector mechanisms are activated within the renal parenchyma. Infiltration of the&#xD;
      kidney by macrophages, monocytes, and lymphocytes, activation of renal tubular epithelial&#xD;
      cells, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines result in fibrosis and irreversible organ&#xD;
      damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a new immunosuppressive agent that is used to prevent acute&#xD;
      rejection in kidney transplant recipients. It attenuates renal damage in the remnant kidney&#xD;
      model of CRF in which there is no primary immunological injury. Therefore, this pilot study&#xD;
      is designed to test the hypothesis that immunosuppressive treatment with MMF in children with&#xD;
      structural causes of CRF will be safely tolerated and that this therapy will retard&#xD;
      progressive decline in renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with congenital uropathy, 3-16 years of age and with a GFR less than 50 ml/ml/1.73&#xD;
      M2, will be treated with MMF for 24 months. The two primary endpoints are: (1) safety and&#xD;
      tolerance of the drug; and (2) need for dialysis or kidney transplantation. It is anticipated&#xD;
      that the MMF will be free of significant toxicity and that administration of the drug will&#xD;
      reduce the frequency of progression to end stage renal disease from 38% to 19%. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed at 3-month intervals and they will undergo serial assessment of proteinuria,&#xD;
      estimated GFR and iothalamate clearance, urinary cytokine excretion, urine flow cytometry,&#xD;
      and immunologic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significance of this pilot study is that it may provide evidence in support of a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of immunological treatment of congenital&#xD;
      structural causes of CRF in children&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sustained activation of the immune system may contribute to progressive renal injury in all&#xD;
      forms of chronic kidney disease. There is extensive proliferation of renal tubular epithelial&#xD;
      cells and fibroblasts within the kidney of patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). The&#xD;
      fibroblasts manifest an activated myofibroblast phenotype, evidenced by expression of alpha&#xD;
      smooth muscle actin. This change is accompanied by infiltration of the renal interstitium&#xD;
      with macrophages, lymphocytes, and other immunocompetent cells. The cells are also activated&#xD;
      and release numerous cytokines and inflammatory mediators. These substances exacerbate the&#xD;
      injury process by recruiting additional immunoeffector cells into the kidney parenchyma and&#xD;
      stimulating the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules. These findings&#xD;
      suggest that immunosuppressive medications may be beneficial in the treatment of congenital&#xD;
      uropathies. In fact, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (10-30 mg/kg/day) has been given to rats&#xD;
      that had been subjected to a 5/6 nephrectomy. Uremia in this remnant kidney model is not the&#xD;
      consequence of primary immunological disease. MMF treatment for 30-60 days did not prevent&#xD;
      intraglomerular hypertension or the alterations in renal hemodynamics that characterize the&#xD;
      adaptation to reduced renal mass. However, the extensive infiltration of the renal&#xD;
      interstitium by proliferating lymphocytes was markedly attenuated by MMF treatment. Moreover,&#xD;
      despite the relatively selective anti-metabolic effect of MMF on lymphocytes, there was a&#xD;
      significant reduction in macrophage infiltration in the tubulointerstitium. This beneficial&#xD;
      change was associated with a significant reduction in albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis&#xD;
      after 60 days of MMF treatment. Combined treatment with the MMF and the angiotensin&#xD;
      converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, lisinopril, to rats with reduced renal mass diminished&#xD;
      tubulointerstitial infiltration by macrophages and T cells even more than MMF therapy alone&#xD;
      and nearly normalized urinary protein excretion. Thus, pharmacological treatment with MMF&#xD;
      attenuated the progression of &quot;nonimmunological&quot; renal disease in the remnant kidney model&#xD;
      without favorably impacting on intraglomerular hemodynamics or the hypertrophic response to&#xD;
      peptide growth factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MMF is a well-tolerated, safe, and effective immunosuppressive medication in adult and&#xD;
      pediatric recipients of cadaveric and living-related renal transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS AND SPECIFIC AIMS This open-label pilot study is designed to test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that there is sustained activation of immunoeffector systems that mediate progressive loss of&#xD;
      renal function in children with congenital uropathies. Immunosuppressive therapy can inhibit&#xD;
      this process and retard the rate of decline in kidney function in pediatric patients with&#xD;
      structural, non-immunological kidney conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim#1: Determine whether administration of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to pediatric&#xD;
      patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;50 ml/min/m2 due to congenital uropathies&#xD;
      such as dysplasia/hypoplasia, obstructive uropathy, and reflux nephropathy is safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim#2: Determine whether administration of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) diminishes&#xD;
      the rate of progressive decline in GFR and the frequency of ESRD in pediatric patients with a&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;50 ml/min/m2 due to congenital uropathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Clinical Definitions CRF: GFR &lt;50 ml/min/1.73 m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Congenital uropathy: One of the following categories of kidney disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dysplasia/hypoplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Congenital obstructive uropathy: This category will include children born with&#xD;
           structural abnormalities that are associated with renal parenchymal damage, e.g.&#xD;
           Prune-Belly syndrome, posterior urethral valves, myelomeningocele.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reflux nephropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hereditary non-immunological tubular disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      The threshold for CRF has been selected to enable recruitment of a sufficient number of&#xD;
      patients into this pilot study in a timely fashion. In addition, at this stage in the disease&#xD;
      course, renal function can be expected to decline during a relatively short follow-up period.&#xD;
      Patients with this degree of CRF have nearly a 40% chance of requiring dialysis or a&#xD;
      transplant within 2 years. This will increase the possibility of demonstrating a therapeutic&#xD;
      benefit secondary to treatment with MMF. The diagnosis of the congenital urological disease&#xD;
      will be established based upon appropriate use of radiological imaging tests and, if&#xD;
      necessary, surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age: 3-16 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Congenital uropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Presence of CRF&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lower age limit will enable enrollment of children who are reasonably cooperative, are&#xD;
      able to take a liquid MMF preparation orally twice a day, and in whom an iothalamate&#xD;
      clearance can be performed without requiring bladder catheterization. The upper limit on age&#xD;
      will enable all of the subjects to complete the 2-year study protocol prior to 18 years of&#xD;
      age, the standard cut-off for enrollment into pediatric clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diagnosed primary hepatic, hematological, or immunological disease such as HIV infection&#xD;
           that may increase the potential risks of MMF&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Known sensitivity to MMF&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Glomerular disease defined on clinical or histopathological grounds&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of decline in estimated GFR during the 6 months prior to entry into the study will&#xD;
      be recorded in all patients. However, this value will not serve as an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
      Even patients with evidence of rapid decline in GFR, i.e. &gt;25% in the previous 6 months, will&#xD;
      be eligible. Such a rapid deterioration is unlikely to occur in the children with congenital&#xD;
      uropathy who are enrolled in this pilot study, based on the natural history of this form of&#xD;
      kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Population It is anticipated that 12 patients will be enrolled at approximately 4&#xD;
      centers in this multicenter open-label pilot study of MMF in children with CRF due to&#xD;
      congenital uropathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Intervention with MMF All patients will be treated with MMF in this open-label pilot&#xD;
      study. Study Phases&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two phases in this open-label pilot study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. RUN-IN (2 months): Informed consent will be obtained from parents of eligible patients&#xD;
           before beginning this phase of the study. Assent will be obtained according to IRB&#xD;
           regulations at each participating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the 2-month Run-In period, eligible patients will be taken off all medications&#xD;
           that are contraindicated by the protocol (see below, Adjunctive Treatments). At the&#xD;
           discretion of the attending pediatric nephrologist, children may be placed on an ACE&#xD;
           inhibitor drug. The dose must be stabilized 4 weeks prior to the onset of the Treatment&#xD;
           Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. TREATMENT (24 months): GFR will be measured by iothalamate clearance at the start of and&#xD;
           at the end of the 12-month Treatment Period. Patients whose estimated GFR is &lt;50&#xD;
           ml/min/1.73 M2 during the Run-in Period will be included regardless of the GFR&#xD;
           determination using the iothalamate clearance at the beginning of the Treatment Period.&#xD;
           This will reflect the prevailing clinical practice in which GFR is routinely determined&#xD;
           using formula estimates rather than more precise clearance methods. HIV testing will be&#xD;
           done at the first visit of the Treatment Period and MMF treatment will not be commenced&#xD;
           until the HIV-negative status of each eligible patient is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MMF Dosing The target therapeutic dosage of MMF will be 600 mg/m2 body surface area/dose,&#xD;
      maximum dose 1 g, given orally twice a day. MMF will be started at 200 mg/m2 BID and&#xD;
      increased at biweekly intervals. The full treatment dose, 600 mg/m2 BID, will be achieved at&#xD;
      4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety parameters The dose will be adjusted downward by 200 mg/m2/BID if a child develops&#xD;
      gastrointestinal complaints, anemia (hematocrit &lt;25%), or an absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&#xD;
      1,000-1,500. If after 1 week GI toxicity continues or any of the laboratory studies remain&#xD;
      abnormal, the dose will be further reduced in decrements of 200 mg/m2/BID. If any of these&#xD;
      problems persist subsequently, the drug will be stopped. In a case of severe toxicity, more&#xD;
      rapid reduction of MMF is allowed at the attending pediatric nephrologist's discretion. If&#xD;
      ANC is less than 1000, the drug will be stopped. The need to discontinue MMF treatment in&#xD;
      more than 20% of the study patients will be considered an unacceptable high frequency of MMF&#xD;
      intolerance in this pilot trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjunctive treatments The use of ACE inhibitors will not be contraindicated in patients who&#xD;
      are enrolled in this study. However, these agents must be started prior to enrollment into&#xD;
      the trial and the initial dose will not be increased during the remainder of the 2-year study&#xD;
      protocol. Administration of recombinant human growth hormone to children who enroll in this&#xD;
      pilot study will be permitted if the attending pediatric nephrologist has already prescribed&#xD;
      it. In addition, patients may receive erythropoietin to treat anemia and to prevent the need&#xD;
      for red blood cell transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplemental doses of antioxidants such as vitamin E will be contraindicated for study&#xD;
      participants. In addition, patients in this trial will not be give any other&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy. All other treatments will be left to the discretion of the&#xD;
      attending pediatric nephrologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-enrollment, interval and final visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL: BP, urine protein:creatinine ratio (Upr/c), microalbuminuria (Ualb/cr), iothalamate&#xD;
      clearance IMMUNOLOGICAL: HIV testing at the initial visit. NUTRITION: Counseling to provide&#xD;
      RDA for protein and 125% RDA for calories&#xD;
&#xD;
      All serum and urine samples will be stored at -70 degrees C after analysis for future testing&#xD;
      if new clinical research findings indicate the value of performing a novel assay to assess&#xD;
      disease progression in children with congenital uropathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency of interval assessment Run-in Period: Monthly x 2 Treatment Period: Monthly x 3&#xD;
      Then every 3 months for duration of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety of MMF in children with congenital uropathies&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Frequency of ESRD in children with congenital uropathies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated findings It is predicted that MMF will be well tolerated by at least 80% (10 out&#xD;
      of 12) of the children with a congenital uropathy and a GFR &lt;50 ml/min/1.73m2. It is also&#xD;
      anticipated that MMF will reduce the incidence of ESRD by 50% and, thus, at most 2 out of 12&#xD;
      patients treated with MMF in this protocol will require dialysis or transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline of pilot study It is anticipated that it will take 3 months to set up an&#xD;
      Administrative Center at Schneider Children Hospital, design Clinical Reporting Forms, and&#xD;
      create a database at a Data Coordinating Center. Patients would be recruited over the next 3&#xD;
      months. In order to complete a 2-year Treatment Period, the entire study would last for 3½&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
