    <textblock>
      This study is designed to gain experience with the HealtheTech measurement system&#xD;
      (BalanceLog) in the context of a clinical trial and to develop the related treatment&#xD;
      protocols. In this study the aim is to evaluate two interventions, one moderate and the other&#xD;
      intensive behavioral management. The development and evaluation of a HealtheTech protocol&#xD;
      across these two treatment settings will provide useful data about implementation (e.g.,&#xD;
      technical issues, clinical issues, participant satisfaction) and outcomes (weight loss,&#xD;
      retention). These data can provide empirical and clinical support for practice guidelines.&#xD;

      Study Duration: The duration of the study is approximately one year (51 weeks), divided into&#xD;
      four phases: 1) Pre-study, 2) Baseline, 3) Intervention, and 4) Maintenance. Participants&#xD;
      will be oriented to the procedures and equipment during the pre-study phase (first 3 weeks).&#xD;
      During the baseline and intervention phases (24 weeks), participants will be undergoing&#xD;
      weight loss treatment. Participants will maintain their weight loss during the maintenance&#xD;
      phase (24 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Recruitment and Selection : Participants will be 80 participants (BMI of 25 to 43&#xD;
      kg/m2) age &gt; 21 years who have access to a personal computer (PC). The anticipated gender&#xD;
      balance in the study group will be 80% females and 20% males. Forty participants will be&#xD;
      recruited at the University of Pennsylvania and 40 at St. Luke's Hospital in New York City.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to a moderate or intensive intervention (described&#xD;
      below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design : This study is divided into four phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (Pre-study): Screening medical and nutritional evaluation, RMR measurement, Balance&#xD;
      Log orientation. There will be 3 weeks in which participants learn how to use the BalanceLog&#xD;
      Pro technology, including transferring information to the clinic (i.e., at week -3 become&#xD;
      familiar with logging and establish a Balance Log Pro account, log meals and activity and&#xD;
      upload data to the Balance Log Pro at week -2, learn how to use special Balance Log functions&#xD;
      such as adding foods and receive feedback via email concerning Balance Log Pro upload at week&#xD;
      -1). In order to be randomized, participants will need to be proficient in the use of&#xD;
      technology so that that treatment can focus on inducing weight loss rather than learning the&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (Baseline): All participants will participate in weekly individual meetings with the&#xD;
      dietitian (R.D.) for 6 weeks. This is designed to establish a solid base for the study and&#xD;
      provide a good start on weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 (Intervention): Individuals will be randomized to either a moderate or intensive&#xD;
      intervention. Paricipants in the moderate intervention will meet individually with the RD&#xD;
      once per month. Individuals in the intensive intervention will meet with the RD twice per&#xD;
      month. This Phase continues for 18 weeks - this makes the weight loss phase of the study 6&#xD;
      months in length. A second DEXA scan will be completed at the end of this study phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4 (Maintenance): From 6 to 12 months all participants will shift to a maintenance phase&#xD;
      and be contacted and measured at 9 and 12 months. At these timepoints, participants will meet&#xD;
      individually with the RD. All individuals use the same HETC tools (MedGem, BalanceLog, and&#xD;
      BalanceLog Pro).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral treatment will be based on the LEARN Program for Weight Control Manual.&#xD;
      Participants will be encouraged to consume a low-calorie, low-fat diet (i.e., 30% of calories&#xD;
      from fat, 15% of calories from protein and 55% of calories from carbohydrate). The Balance&#xD;
      Log, a software tool, will be used to establish a calorie prescription based on a variety of&#xD;
      individual factors like RMR, lifestyle activity, and physical activity level as described in&#xD;
      the Balance Log software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Moderate Frequency. Participants in this condition will be provided information about&#xD;
           the treatment program (LEARN Manual, schedule) and how to use Balance Log (version 2.1.1&#xD;
           and professional web-based program) to log food intake and activity. Participants in&#xD;
           this group will meet with a dietitian individually on a weekly basis for the first 6&#xD;
           weeks, then once a month for the remaining 18 weeks of the weight loss phase. During the&#xD;
           last 6 months of the study (i.e., weight maintenance phase), participants will meet with&#xD;
           a dietitian for quarterly follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intensive Frequency. Participants in this condition will be provided information about&#xD;
           the treatment program (LEARN Manual, schedule) and how to use Balance Log (version 2.1.1&#xD;
           and professional web-based program) to log food intake and activity. Participants in&#xD;
           this group will meet with a dietitian individually on a weekly basis for the first 6&#xD;
           weeks, then biweekly for the remaining 18 weeks of the weight loss phase. During the&#xD;
           last 6 months of the study (i.e., weight maintenance phase), participants will meet with&#xD;
           a dietitian for quarterly follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program materials. The materials will be based on the current weight management program at&#xD;
      the University of Pennsylvania. Additional materials will be developed or altered to reflect&#xD;
      HealtheTech messaging (RMR, energy balance, self-monitoring, etc.). HealtheTech will provide&#xD;
      some support for content and layout (graphics and professional reproduction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete set of Program Guideline materials will be developed as a result of the study. The&#xD;
      principal investigators will develop materials such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Topical outline of the 20 sessions for clinicians • Talking point summaries for each&#xD;
      session • &quot;What to do&quot; summaries for the participants • Skill builders to be used in each&#xD;
      session • Key messages sequenced throughout the program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: The following assessments will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests. Routine blood work, including a comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood&#xD;
      count and lipid panel, will be performed during baseline and week 24. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      discarded following analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waist circumference. Waist circumference will be measured at baseline and on weeks 2, 4, 8,&#xD;
      12, 16, 20, 24, 38 and 52. Waist circumference will be measured at the mid-point between the&#xD;
      right iliac crest and the bottom of the right rib cage using a Gulick measuring tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition. Body composition will be measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at&#xD;
      baseline and week 24. DEXA will provide estimates of total body fat (and fat free mass) and&#xD;
      bone mineral density (hip, spine and total body). The body composition unit will be performed&#xD;
      at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) body composition laboratory which is&#xD;
      located on 3550 Market, 4th floor. A urine pregnancy test will be given to all women prior to&#xD;
      each DEXA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight. Weight will be measured at screening, baseline, and at each treatment visit using a&#xD;
      digital scale with subjects dressed in light clothing and without shoes. Height will be&#xD;
      measured using a stadiometer at screening and at weeks 52 and 104.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Pressure. Blood pressure will be measured at screening, baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12,&#xD;
      16, 20, 24, 38 and 52. On each occasion, two readings will be taken, 1 minute apart after you&#xD;
      have been seated for 5 minutes. All measurements will be performed at the WEDP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting Metabolic Rate. The MedGem will be used for all RMR measurements. RMR measurements&#xD;
      will be conducted at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 38 and 52. All participants&#xD;
      will have their RMR measured once during the pre-study phase to develop familiarization with&#xD;
      the test. RMR measurements will be repeated when the opinion of the clinician is there has&#xD;
      been a problem or the result is outside of reasonable, Harris-Benedict (the traditional RMR&#xD;
      prediction formula) + 15% range. The MINIMUM rate of weight loss will be calculated based on&#xD;
      10% weight loss divided over 24 weeks. (Examples: 240 lb participant: 24 lb weight loss over&#xD;
      24 weeks, 1 lb/week, 500 kcal deficit per day; whereas a 180 lbs. participant would have a&#xD;
      target of 18 lbs over the 24 weeks or 0.67 lbs/week or a daily caloric deficit of 367&#xD;
      kcal/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caloric Budget Adjustments Based on RMR: Adjustments to calorie budgets will be done monthly&#xD;
      when appropriate. Although we are measuring RMR at week 2, calorie budgets will not be&#xD;
      adjusted at this time. The investigators will provide a recommendation for the number of&#xD;
      kcal/day that a RMR must change before the Individualized Energy Balance Prescription (IEBP)&#xD;
      is recalculated. For example, if there is a 50 kcal/day difference, then it may not be&#xD;
      meaningful to change the IEBP, that only represents a change of about 3%, whereas if the&#xD;
      change is 150 or more kcal/day it is reasonable to change the recommended intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting metabolic rate will be measured under strict resting conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 hour fast (including caffeine) 12 hours post-exercise 30 minute rest prior to the&#xD;
      measurement A 2 to 3 minute familiarization will be done with the device during the resting&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Intake and Activity. Individuals will be required to log their food and exercise&#xD;
      daily for 6 months. They will log using BalanceLog on their PC. One of the inclusion&#xD;
      criterions will be daily access to a PC. The BalanceLog will be used to establish an Energy&#xD;
      Balance Prescription for all participants. Macronutrient composition will be chosen by the&#xD;
      participant, however the recommendation will be to use a relatively standard low (&lt;30 %) fat&#xD;
      diet with a minimum of 40% carbohydrate. BalanceLog Pro is a web-based program allowing&#xD;
      professionals to review individuals' BalanceLog records and reports remotely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires. A qualitative assessment of logging will be conducted at two time points (3&#xD;
      months and 6 months). Process measures including ease and frequency of use, participant&#xD;
      satisfaction, ratings of professional staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks: The program of weight loss treatment presents few risks to participants.&#xD;
      Psychological risks include subjective distress in participants who regain their weight. We&#xD;
      will acknowledge participants' disappointment and discuss their experiences from the&#xD;
      perspectives of others who have regained weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential risks of the study are primarily associated with the assessment measures,&#xD;
      specifically the DEXA and blood testing. The blood tests present a minor risk of bruising.&#xD;
      Every effort will be made to minimize these risks including a review of participants' health&#xD;
      before the testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent : Participants will be recruited from public service announcements, notices&#xD;
      in local newspapers, and referrals from physicians' offices at the three sites. Applicants&#xD;
      will be screened by phone to determine that they meet the recruitment criteria, have no&#xD;
      obvious contraindications to treatment, and remain interested in the study after it has been&#xD;
      described. Screenings will be conducted by research coordinators following a written&#xD;
      protocol. Persons who appear appropriate to participate will be scheduled for an initial&#xD;
      interview. In the face-to-face interview, applicants will be informed of the nature and&#xD;
      requirements of the study, including randomization to treatment conditions. They will be&#xD;
      provided a written description of all study details and asked to give their informed consent&#xD;
      to participate in further assessment and treatment. Candidates not wishing to participate, or&#xD;
      who do not meet criteria, will be offered a referral to an appropriate program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protection of Participants: Risks of complications will be reduced by carefully selecting&#xD;
      participants for treatment. We have clearly defined the contraindications and will inform the&#xD;
      participants' primary care physicians of these contraindications. Participants will receive&#xD;
      blood tests at frequent intervals, and results of these tests will be monitored by a&#xD;
      physician to ensure participant safety during weight loss. Both participants and their&#xD;
      primary care physicians will be made aware of any abnormal findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be kept in a locked file cabinet to ensure confidentiality. In addition, guidelines&#xD;
      concerning the confidentiality of group treatment sessions will be reviewed with participants&#xD;
      at the initial interview and at the first treatment session. Code numbers will be assigned to&#xD;
      each participant to maximize anonymity while entering data.&#xD;
