      Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute promyelocytic leukemia is defined by a characteristic morphology (AML FAB M3/M3v), by&#xD;
      the specific translocation t(15;17) and its molecular correlates (PML/RARa and RARa/PML).&#xD;
      Thereby it can be separated from all other forms of acute leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By all-trans retinoic acid in combination with chemotherapy cure rates of 70 to 80% can be&#xD;
      reached. On average, about 10% of patients still die in the early phase of the treatment and&#xD;
      about 20 to 30% relapse. Molecular monitoring of the minimal residual disease (MRD) by&#xD;
      qualitative nested RT-PCR and quantitative REAL-time PCR of PML/RARa allows to follow the&#xD;
      individual kinetics of MRD and to identify patients with an imminent hematological relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized treatment for patients with relapsed APL has not yet been established. With&#xD;
      arsenic trioxide (ATO) monotherapy remission rates over 80% were achieved and long-lasting&#xD;
      molecular remissions are described. The drug was mostly well tolerated. ATO exerts a dose&#xD;
      dependent dual effect on APL blasts, apoptosis in higher and partial differentiation in lower&#xD;
      concentrations. ATO was also successfully administered before allogeneic and autologous&#xD;
      transplantation. ATO is approved for the treatment of relapsed and refractory APL in Europe&#xD;
      and in the USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present protocol, ATO is given for remission induction:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. in patients with hematological or molecular first or subsequent relapse of APL and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. in patients who do not reach a hematological or molecular remission after first line&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction therapy with ATO is the mandatory part of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After remission induction, there are several options for postremission therapy. Factors which&#xD;
      have influence on the treatment decision in the individual case are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the eligibility for allogeneic transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the eligibility for autologous transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the presence or absence of contraindications against intensive chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the PCR status after induction and during follow up (RT-PCR of PML/RARa, sensitivity&#xD;
           10-4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mandatory form of post-remission therapy is not defined in the protocol. Data and outcomes&#xD;
      of any post-remission therapy should be documented in order to collect data of treatment&#xD;
      after ATO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following stratification of post-remission therapy can be performed according to the&#xD;
      decision of the treating physician:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a HLA-compatible donor who are suitable for allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation should be transplanted. In patients with a positive PCR one cycle of&#xD;
      intensive chemotherapy (HAM) before transplantation should be considered and patients with a&#xD;
      negative result are immediately transplanted without preceding chemotherapy. In patients who&#xD;
      do not qualify for allogeneic, but for autologous transplantation, the intensity of the&#xD;
      chemotherapy (Ara-C dose of the HAM cycle) is scheduled according to the PCR status after ATO&#xD;
      and to the patient's age. In patients under 60 years, the recommended single Ara-C dose is&#xD;
      scheduled to 3 g/m² in case of a positive PCR result and to 1 g/m² in case of a negative PCR&#xD;
      result after ATO. In all patients aged over 60 years, the Ara-C dose should be uniformly&#xD;
      reduced to 1 g/m² independent of the PCR status. Patients who are not eligible for allogeneic&#xD;
      or autologous transplantation (too old, no stem cells collected, PCR positive stem cell&#xD;
      transplant, contraindications against intensive chemotherapy) receive three further cycles&#xD;
      with ATO and ATRA. The group of patients not qualifying for autologous transplantation, but&#xD;
      without contraindications against intensive chemotherapy should receive an age adapted HAM,&#xD;
      whenever a positive PCR persists or reappears after the three maintenance cycles of ATO. A&#xD;
      close monitoring of the PCR of PML/RARa after each treatment cycle is part of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the protocol is to take advantage of the expected low toxicity of ATO&#xD;
      and to keep the part of chemotherapy as low as possible.&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Expected noncompliance&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  No informed consent of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
           Diagnostic measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Confirmation of relapse by RT-PCR of PML/RARa and by cytogenetics. Follow up PCRs with&#xD;
           quantitative nested RT-PCR and qualitative REAL-time PCR of PML/RARa.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment plan&#xD;
&#xD;
           Induction therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - 3 cycles of ATO with the aim to induce a hematological or a molecular remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Options for postremission therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           · Allogeneic transplantation (PBSCT) in suitable patients with a related or unrelated&#xD;
           donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The administration of chemotherapy preceding allogeneic transplantation is stratified&#xD;
           according to the PCR status after ATO. Chemotherapy (HAM) should be considered in PCR&#xD;
           positive patients according to the individual situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           No chemotherapy is given in PCR negative patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           · Autologous PBSCT in patients without a donor qualifying for autologous&#xD;
           transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The intensity of chemotherapy (HAM with either 3 or 1 g/m²) is proposed according to the&#xD;
           PCR status of PML/RARa (sensitivity 10-4) after ATO and to patient's age.&#xD;
&#xD;
           · 3 maintenance cycles of ATO. This is followed by HAM in patients with persistence or&#xD;
           reappearance of a positive PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients not eligible for allogeneic or autologous transplantation, but without&#xD;
           contraindications against intensive chemotherapy. · 3 maintenance cycles of ATO in&#xD;
           patients not eligible for allogeneic or autologous transplantation (no suitable donor,&#xD;
           too old, no stem cells collected, positive stem cell transplant) and with&#xD;
           contraindications against intensive chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Monitoring of MRD is mandatory after each ATO cycle and further treatment step. (Details&#xD;
           of the treatment plan are shown in the overview of the study design, Paragraph 2.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Criteria for evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
           The effectiveness of the therapy is assessed by the evaluation of the rate of&#xD;
           hematological and molecular remission and of the duration of remission according to the&#xD;
           commonly used definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The safety of the therapy is assessed by a close study monitoring using the criteria of&#xD;
           toxicity according to WHO.&#xD;
