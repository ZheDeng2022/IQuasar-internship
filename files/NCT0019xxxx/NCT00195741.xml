        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject and subject's legal representative have voluntarily signed and dated an&#xD;
             IRB-approved informed assent form and an IRB-approved informed consent form,&#xD;
             respectively, before any study-specific procedures or tests are performed, including&#xD;
             the discontinuation of any prohibited medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is male or a non-pregnant, non-lactating female;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is between 12 and 17 years of age, inclusive, at randomization;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject weighs between 77 lbs (i.e., 35 kg) and 220 lbs (i.e., 100 kg) inclusive;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject currently has migraine headaches diagnosed according to the International&#xD;
             Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria occurring at an average frequency of at&#xD;
             least 3, but no more than 12, migraine headaches per month during the 3 months prior&#xD;
             to screening. Migraine headaches separated by a headache-free interval of &lt; 48 hours&#xD;
             will be considered one migraine headache in assessing this criterion;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject's initial onset of migraine headache precedes the Screening Visit by at least&#xD;
             12 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is judged to be in generally good health based on the results of a medical&#xD;
             history, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory&#xD;
             profile. When the Screening and Baseline Visits are combined as described in Section&#xD;
             5.1, continuing participation in the Baseline Phase will be contingent upon laboratory&#xD;
             and ECG results. Any repeat laboratory testing must be completed in consultation with&#xD;
             the Abbott Medical Monitor prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;

             headache-free intervals of at least 48 hours), diagnosed according to the IHS&#xD;
             diagnostic criteria,6 during the 4-week Baseline Phase of the study; and&#xD;
&#xD;
