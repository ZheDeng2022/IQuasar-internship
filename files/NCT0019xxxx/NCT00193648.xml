  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current management of primary FSGS is predicated on the assumption that the disease is&#xD;
      caused by an immune-mediated disturbance in glomerular barrier function. Therefore, most&#xD;
      treatment protocols have involved immunosuppressive drugs given singly or in combination.&#xD;
      However, the efficacy of this type of therapy has been disappointing and the long-term&#xD;
      prognosis for renal survival in patients with resistant FSGS is poor. An alternative approach&#xD;
      that targets the fibrosis pathway may represent a novel approach to the treatment of&#xD;
      resistant FSGS. In this R21, the investigators will test the hypothesis that two novel agents&#xD;
      - a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) antagonist and a peroxisome proliferator activator&#xD;
      receptor-gamma (PPARγ) agonist - can be administered safely to patients with resistant FSGS.&#xD;
      In the R21 feasibility/pilot phase, pharmacokinetic studies will be conducted to assess the&#xD;
      impact of proteinuria on the kinetics of the novel drugs in children and adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: To assess the safety and tolerability of two novel drugs - a TNF-α&#xD;
      antagonist and a PPARγ agonist - in patients with resistant FSGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: To conduct a pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment of the selected agents to&#xD;
      enable selection of medication regimens for investigation in a randomized Phase II study.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study Medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication will be shipped in a single batch sufficient to complete the 4-month&#xD;
      treatment period. A supply will be shipped to the participating site for each individual&#xD;
      patient that is enrolled. Please complete the Site Registration Form and provide a complete&#xD;
      and accurate shipping address for receipt of study medication during the week, Monday though&#xD;
      Friday 9 AM - 5 PM. This information will be forwarded to the pharmaceutical companies to&#xD;
      enable timely shipment of drug to each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formulation and administration of experimental novel therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adalimumab (Humira®): TNF-α antibody BB-IND #11714:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This medication will be provided by Abbott Laboratories and will be available as a liquid. It&#xD;
      will be administered as a subcutaneous injection every other week. The therapeutic dose of&#xD;
      adalimumab will be 24 mg/m2 to a maximum of 40 mg/dose every other week for the entire&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should be instructed to rotate the site of injection. In order to reduce the pain&#xD;
      associated with the biweekly adalimumab injections, patients can apply EMLA crème or steroid&#xD;
      inhaler spray prior to administration of the medication. After the injection is completed,&#xD;
      the patient can take Tylenol as needed or apply ice to the site for symptomatic pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving Humira® will be required to write down dates and times of drug&#xD;
      administration and bring the administration log to each study visit. In addition, when a&#xD;
      patient is assigned to the Humira® arm, a per protocol dose schedule listing the week and the&#xD;
      optimal date of drug administration will be sent with the medication to the site. This sheet&#xD;
      can be used to facilitate scheduling of visits and it can be shared with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rosiglitazone (Avandia®): PPARgamma agonist IND69,782:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This medication will be provided by Glaxo Smith Kline and will be available as pills. It will&#xD;
      be administered orally in two divided daily doses. The therapeutic dose of rosiglitazone will&#xD;
      be 3 mg/m2/day administered in two divided doses to a maximum of 4 mg twice a day. The twice&#xD;
      daily dosing schedule is based on studies indicating greater antiproteinuric effect of&#xD;
      rosiglitazone in type 2 diabetes when administered in this manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) Studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Scheme:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood and urine collection scheme for the PK analysis will be conducted over 48 hours in&#xD;
      a GCRC when the patient is scheduled to receive the first dose (single dose PK assessments)&#xD;
      of adalimumab or rosiglitazone and after the 8th dose of adalimumab (~steady state of 105&#xD;
      days) or during the 4th month of rosiglitazone therapy for multiple dose PK assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample, 2.5-4 ml/sample (1-2.5 ml plasma/serum), will be drawn at each time point.&#xD;
      For adalimumab, a total of 6 serum samples (4 ml each, 24 ml of blood in total) will be&#xD;
      obtained. For rosiglitazone a total of 11 plasma samples (2.5 ml each, 25 ml of blood in&#xD;
      total) will be obtained during the 48-hour PK study. The total amount of blood drawn should&#xD;
      be &lt; 3 ml/kg over this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine will be collected at the following intervals: 0-2, 2-12, 12-24, 24-36, and 36-48 hours.&#xD;
      The total volume of urine for each time interval should be recorded in mL and an aliquot&#xD;
      should be analyzed for protein:creatinine ratio in the local laboratory. The measurements of&#xD;
      urinary protein excretion over the 48 hour period will be used to correlate PK parameters of&#xD;
      the study medication with concurrent level of proteinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An aliquot of the urine sample collected during each time interval should be saved in the&#xD;
      specimen kit for determination of urinary excretion of rosiglitazone. However, because&#xD;
      adalimumab cannot be measured in the urine, urinary excretion of the monoclonal antibody will&#xD;
      not be performed and an aliquot of urine will NOT be saved in the specimen kit for&#xD;
      measurement of Humira®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients must go home after the first day of testing, then they will return to the GCRC on&#xD;
      day 2 for repeat blood draws and to return urine collections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact sampling times (hours) for the 48-hour PK studies for each novel therapy, which&#xD;
      coincide with the midpoint of the urine collections (see below), are outlined in the&#xD;
      following Table:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DRUG 0 0.5 1 2 4 6 8 12 18 30 42 Adalimumab X X X X X X Rosiglitazone* X X X X X X X X X X X&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum glucose concentration will be measured at each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trough serum adalimumab levels should be drawn at 1 week after the first dose of the drug as&#xD;
      part of the PK study but not as part of a formal patient visit. In addition to the PK&#xD;
      studies, trough serum adalimumab levels will also be drawn prior to the dose at the 2-, 4-,&#xD;
      8-, and 12-week visits.&#xD;
