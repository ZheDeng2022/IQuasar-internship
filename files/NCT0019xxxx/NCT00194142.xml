  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in amniotic&#xD;
      fluid collected in the second trimester of pregnancy is associated with pregnancy&#xD;
      complications such as preterm delivery or severe preeclampsia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CMV infection in adults with a normal immune system is rarely a serious event. Once a person&#xD;
      has been infected with CMV, they may have recurrences (relapses) of the infection. If a&#xD;
      mother is infected with the virus or relapses during pregnancy, her fetus may be at risk for&#xD;
      infection. Unlike infection in adults, congenital infection may result in serious&#xD;
      complications (congenital infection). The effects of fetal infection with CMV are well&#xD;
      understood and many efforts have been made to potentially reduce the risk of congenital&#xD;
      infection. However, the effect of CMV infection on the pregnancy itself (when the fetus is&#xD;
      not affected by CMV) is less understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of CMV detection in amniotic fluid collected in the second trimester is thought&#xD;
      to be low. However, the association between detection of CMV infection in the second&#xD;
      trimester and ultimate pregnancy outcome is poorly described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we plan to determine if CMV detection in amniotic fluid collected in the&#xD;
      second trimester is associated with pregnancy complications.&#xD;

        The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection&#xD;
        in amniotic fluid specimens obtained at 16 to 18 weeks of pregnancy and to determine if CMV&#xD;
        infection of amniotic fluid supernatant and/or amniocytes is associated with adverse&#xD;
        obstetric outcomes. Amniotic fluid will be obtained from an already established registry.&#xD;
        and analyzed in conjunction with a chart review under a HIPAA Waiver of Authorization.&#xD;
