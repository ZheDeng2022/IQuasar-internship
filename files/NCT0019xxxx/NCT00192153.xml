  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate immune responses measuring antibodies in&#xD;
      serum and secretions and cellular immune responses generated by CAIV-T vaccine in healthy&#xD;
      adults aged 18 years and older as a means to develop assays for application in investigating&#xD;
      potential immunological correlates of protection and/or establishing assays to measure&#xD;
      vaccine take.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy adults aged 18 to 59 years or &gt; 60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential who had a negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             result prior to study vaccination. Females who were surgically sterile or&#xD;
             post-menopausal did not require pregnancy testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adults who were determined by medical history, physical examination and clinical&#xD;
             judgment eligible for this study. Subjects with stable pre-existing disease, defined&#xD;
             as disease not requiring change in therapy or hospitalization within 12 weeks before&#xD;
             receipt of study vaccination, will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who provided written informed consent after the nature of the study was&#xD;
             explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who were available for the duration of the study (from enrollment to study&#xD;
             completion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who could be reached by study staff for the post-vaccination contact [via&#xD;
             telephone, clinic or home visit].&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects &gt; 60 years of age only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who resided in a nursing home or long-term care facility or other institution&#xD;
             receiving skilled or semi-skilled nursing care. An ambulatory subject who resided in a&#xD;
             retirement home or village was eligible for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with evidence of dementia or other severe cognitive impairment based on Mini&#xD;
             Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Note: Prior to study vaccination, all subjects&#xD;
             &gt;60 years of age must have completed a MMSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For all study subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who were perceived to be unavailable or difficult to contact for evaluation&#xD;
             of study visits during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a known or suspected disease of the immune system or those receiving&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy, including systemic corticosteroids; or cytotoxic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who resided in the same household as an immunosuppressed or immunocompromised&#xD;
             individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a documented history of hypersensitivity to egg or egg protein or any&#xD;
             other component of the study vaccine, placebo or TIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who had a current wheezing episode that was considered a change from the&#xD;
             subject's usual clinical state.&#xD;
