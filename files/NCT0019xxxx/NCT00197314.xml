  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing two methods of exercise for the treatment of&#xD;
      stress incontinence ( loss of urine after physical exertion) in women. We are comparing the&#xD;
      Paula method of circular muscle exercise, in which circular muscles controlling sphincters of&#xD;
      the body (such as the eyes, mouth and rectum) are exercised, with pelvic floor training&#xD;
      (Kegel exercises) in women in the community. The study hypothesis is that the effectiveness&#xD;
      of circular muscle exercises is equivalent to pelvic floor training among women with this&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;

      Background: Urinary stress incontinence(SI) is defined as involuntary urinary loss which&#xD;
      appears during increased intra-abdominal pressure which can be measured objectively. It is an&#xD;
      important social and hygienic problem. Its prevalence varies fron 12-55% depending on age,&#xD;
      and geography. The economic costs of this condition were estimated to reach 24 billion&#xD;
      dollars in the US in 1995. The objectives of this study are to evaluate two non-invasive&#xD;
      methods of treatment of stress incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 200 women who chosen from the community and suffering from SI will enter the study&#xD;
      and will be randomized to one of two arms. The first arm is the Paula method of circular&#xD;
      muscle exercises: these women will receive private lessons from a registered Paula&#xD;
      instructor. The system is based on activating circular muscles in the body. The second arm&#xD;
      will receive instruction in pelvic floor muscle training by a physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial will compare the efficacy of the methods for the treatment of SI. The&#xD;
      candidates for inclusion in the trial will undergo a gynecological exam and a &quot;Pad Test&quot;. The&#xD;
      efficacy will be measured in terms of changes in the Pad test (quantity of urinary leakage)&#xD;
      and subjective reports of the participants on leakage, quality of life and sexual function.&#xD;
