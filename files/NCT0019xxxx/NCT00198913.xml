  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of this research demonstrated that type II diabetics are lacking in knowledge of how&#xD;
      to best treat their illness with dietary controls. Most had little nutrition or diabetes&#xD;
      knowledge. Part 2 demonstrated that providing a 40% reduction in fat intake across three&#xD;
      meals versus all at one meal was more effective in glycemic control. Part 3 is designed to&#xD;
      incorporate these findings into a long-term free living setting through education and&#xD;
      behavior/dietary modification.&#xD;

      Participants will be randomized into either the test group or the control group. Both groups&#xD;
      will complete a one-week run-in period and then be followed over a 16 week period. This study&#xD;
      will be conducted in two cohorts of 50 participants with 25 test participants and 25 control&#xD;
      participants in each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in Week - On the first day, participants will report to the laboratory for initial&#xD;
      orientation to the study and methods. Baseline body measurements, height, weight and body&#xD;
      composition analysis (using Bioelectrical Impendance), and a fasting blood sample, blood&#xD;
      pressure and pulse will be taken. Participants will also complete additional study&#xD;
      questionnaires and records. (Table 1 provides a summary of all measures at baseline and&#xD;
      across the 16 week test period). Participants will also taste and rate various fat-replaced&#xD;
      foods and complete a log of any changes in health over the next 3 days to determine&#xD;
      palatability and tolerance of fat-replaced foods. Before trying foods, a survey will be&#xD;
      administered to check for common food allergies. Finally, participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      complete food diaries for 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day. Participants will return the food&#xD;
      diaries and logs the following week. Participants who: 1) do not complete all parts of the&#xD;
      run-in phase, 2) do not like and are not willing to eat at least 80% of the tested foods, or&#xD;
      3) have negative health effects following consumption of the foods will be dismissed from the&#xD;
      study. No manipulations to participants' diets will occur during this phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      16-Week Test Phase - During this phase, the test group will be given fat-replaced foods and&#xD;
      instructed in a detailed diet plan to create a low-fat (&lt;25% kcal from fat), weight&#xD;
      maintenance diet providing optimal glycemic control. The test group will attend a 1h&#xD;
      educational session (didactic and discussion) every 2wks. (Appendix 2 lists course topics.)&#xD;
      Academic and professional staff will lead the sessions. Participants will be required to keep&#xD;
      logs of certain behaviors and food records (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day over the 2wk&#xD;
      period). Prior to the educational meetings, participants will submit data collection sheets&#xD;
      (questionnaires and logs), be weighed and scheduled measures. Following the meeting,&#xD;
      participants will be given fat-replaced foods for use over the next 2 weeks. Participants&#xD;
      will be instructed to keep a log of usage of the provided foods, explicitly told that the&#xD;
      foods are not for use by other members of their household and will be required to return all&#xD;
      remaining or unused foods to the laboratory at the next meeting. In addition, at 8 weeks and&#xD;
      16 weeks, a blood sample, body composition, psychometrics, waist/hip measurements, blood&#xD;
      pressure and pulse will be taken. The control group will receive vouchers for local&#xD;
      supermarkets to offset the cost of the foods provided to the test group but will not be given&#xD;
      actual food. This group will come to the laboratory every 2 weeks for identical data&#xD;
      collection including blood draws but will not attend educational sessions. Instead, the&#xD;
      control group will receive a newsletter every two weeks about the importance of a low-fat&#xD;
      diet in the management of type II DM; however this newsletter will not give specific&#xD;
      information about the use of fat-replaced foods in a low-fat diet. This newsletter will be&#xD;
      sent to the test group as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet The test group diet plan will be designed to be a weight maintenance diet which derives&#xD;
      no more than 25% kcal from fat (no more than 10% from saturated fat). A Registered Dietitian&#xD;
      will design an individually tailored, 7d rotating suggested meal plan which includes the&#xD;
      detailed use of fat-replaced foods according to the optimal strategy identified in Experiment&#xD;
      2. The individual prescriptions will be based upon the Mifflin-St.Joer equation and baseline&#xD;
      intake obtained from the diet records from the run-in week.&#xD;
