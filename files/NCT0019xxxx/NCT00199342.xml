      This is a dose escalating cohort study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      KW-2871 (in dose cohorts of 60, 80, and 100 mg/m2) when administered with a specified&#xD;
      premedication regimen (ranitidine, diphenhydramine, and dexamethasone). KW-2871 will be&#xD;
      administered at 14-day intervals.&#xD;

      This open label study consists of two parts. Part I, the Phase I component of the study, will&#xD;
      be conducted at a single center, and will enroll up to 18 patients with histologically&#xD;
      documented Stage IV melanoma (per the American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] criteria)&#xD;
      that is not currently amenable to surgical resection or other therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specified premedication regimen consisting of ranitidine, diphenhydramine, and&#xD;
      dexamethasone will be administered to all patients 30 minutes prior to infusion of any dose&#xD;
      of KW-2871.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned doses of KW-2871 are 60 mg/m2, 80 mg/m2, 100 mg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      After identification of the MTD, 30 patients will be enrolled at that dose level in Part II&#xD;
      of the study. If no MTD is identified after treatment with the 100 mg/m2 dose level, the dose&#xD;
      administered in Part II of the study will be 100 mg/m2. If the MTD is determined as 60 mg/m2,&#xD;
      this study will be closed to further patient accrual and will not proceed to Part II.&#xD;

          2. Patients with documented Stage IV melanoma (histologically- or cytologically-proven,&#xD;
             as per AJCC criteria) that is not currently amenable to surgical resection (due to&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Patients may have measurable or non-measurable disease, in accordance with the RECIST&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
