      The primary objective of the trial is to determine, in patients who have undergone surgery&#xD;
      with curative intent for high-risk CSCC of the head and neck, whether there is a difference&#xD;
      in time to loco-regional relapse between patients treated with post-operative concurrent&#xD;
      chemo-radiotherapy ,consisting of Carboplatin, and post-operative radiotherapy alone. The&#xD;
      target sample size for the trial is 266 patients and will take 3-4 years to accrue, based on&#xD;
      an anticipated accrual of 80 patients/year. A further 2 years follow up is required.&#xD;

      Two in every 3 Australians will be affected by skin cancer over their lifetime. The&#xD;
      prevalence of skin cancer will continue to increase due to the ageing population and&#xD;
      represents a significant problem in our community. Cure of early (T1-2) de novo cutaneous&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) treated with either curative intent surgery or radiotherapy is&#xD;
      85-100%. However, the cure rate for locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic disease to&#xD;
      regional nodes following surgery alone are much lower, in the order of 20-70%. Metastatic&#xD;
      CSCC is the most common malignancy of the parotid region in Australia. The 5 year&#xD;
      loco-regional control with surgery alone is in the order of 40%-45%. The addition of&#xD;
      post-operative radiotherapy improves loco-regional control by 15-20%, and is therefore&#xD;
      considered the standard of care in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data have shown that synchronous post-operative chemo-radiotherapy is superior to&#xD;
      post-operative radiotherapy alone in &quot;high-risk&quot; mucosal head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (HNSCC). However, to date, there is no evidence from randomised trials that such a&#xD;
      benefit exists in CSCC of the head and neck. At present there is little consensus amongst&#xD;
      clinicians in Australia as to who should receive post-operative chemo-radiotherapy in CSCC.&#xD;
      Although tumour control rates may be improved, the addition of chemotherapy may also&#xD;
      significantly increase treatment related toxicity. Nonetheless, some centres have adopted the&#xD;
      use of post-operative chemo-radiotherapy in selected patients with CSCC based on&#xD;
      extrapolation from mucosal sites. This has resulted in a wide variability in practice for&#xD;
      this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Australia is uniquely placed to perform such a trial comparing post-operative&#xD;
      chemo-radiotherapy to post-operative radiotherapy alone in high-risk CSCC due to the high&#xD;
      rate of skin cancer. Currently there are limited data to guide management of patients with&#xD;
      resected CSCC who are at high risk for recurrence. While it is reasonable to hypothesize that&#xD;
      concurrent chemotherapy in this setting will confer a similar benefit to that seen in mucosal&#xD;
      HNSCC, this can only be established by a randomized trial as proposed. If the addition of&#xD;
      chemotherapy is shown to be beneficial and safe, then these results are likely to be&#xD;
      translated into standard practice both nationally and internationally quite rapidly. On the&#xD;
      other hand, if the treatment is found to be ineffective then patients will be spared the&#xD;
      unnecessary toxicity and inconvenience associated with the addition of chemotherapy. A&#xD;
      further important aspect of this trial will be the assessment of patient-related outcomes&#xD;
      using a validated quality of life questionnaire. It will be important to ascertain whether&#xD;
      any improvement in locoregional control due to the addition of chemotherapy, is also&#xD;
      associated with improvement in quality of life compared to the control arm.&#xD;
