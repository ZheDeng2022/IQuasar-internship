      The purpose of this observational registry is to collect a continuum of meaningful clinical&#xD;
      data on the ARCHIMEDES implantable pump in pain management&#xD;

      Pain management has been a long-standing challenge to the medical community, specifically for&#xD;
      the treatment of chronic pain. Chronic Pain is defined by the American Chronic Pain&#xD;
      Association as &quot;pain that continues a month or more beyond the usual recovery period for an&#xD;
      illness or injury or pain that goes on over months or years as a result of a chronic&#xD;
      condition.&quot; Chronic pain affects the patient's quality of life, work performance and&#xD;
      attendance, mental health, social interactions and overall activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implantable pumps were used for cancer and non-cancer patients, who had pain, which was&#xD;
      resistant to conventional therapy. Intrathecal morphine administration is now accepted as a&#xD;
      safe and effective method of controlling or reducing pain and its impact on the sufferer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Codman ARCHIMEDES Implantable Constant-Flow Infusion Pump is CE marked, and has been&#xD;
      commercially available in Europe for intrathecal delivery of morphine and baclofen since&#xD;
      August 1997. ARCHIMEDES is intended for the treatment of chronic intractable (cancer or&#xD;
      non-cancer) pain, which requires chronic intrathecal infusion of preservative-free morphine&#xD;
      sulfate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a European, multicenter, prospective, single arm, observational registry conducted on&#xD;
      a total of 150 Subjects at up to 10 centers in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post Archimedes implant to assess their&#xD;
      pain management and quality of life.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Subject has been suffering from chronic (benign and/or malignant) intractable pain&#xD;
             for at least 2 or more months duration (pending national laws) with a pre-implant&#xD;
             value equal or more than 7 on the Visual Analog Pain Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject does not tolerate oral pain medication at the required therapeutic dose to&#xD;
             treat his/her pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Subject has a minimum reasonable life expectancy of at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Subject has given written Informed Consent prior to enrollment into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The body size of the Subject is sufficient to accept the pump bulk and weight, per the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Subject is willing to participate in this registry for 1 year post implant and is&#xD;
             willing to comply with the investigational plan requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It is the Principal Investigator's judgment, based on the knowledge of the Subject,&#xD;
             and Subject's condition, as well as the features of the implantable system that the&#xD;
             Subject is an appropriate candidate for pain management utilizing an implantable pump&#xD;
             for continuously delivering preservative-free morphine sulfate via an intrathecal&#xD;
             route.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Subject has a skin condition (i.e., scleroderma, psoriasis, rash, or open wound)&#xD;
             at the site chosen for implantation that would compromise the integrity or access to&#xD;
             the injection port.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Subject has previously enrolled in or participated in an investigational drug or&#xD;
             device trial within the preceding 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Subject has any known contraindication to preservative-free morphine sulfate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Subject has a suspected or documented allergy to preservative-free morphine&#xD;
             sulfate or related drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Subject has a suspected or documented allergy to the materials of the infusion&#xD;
             pump or catheter(s) (for example, silicone).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Subject has a history of drug and/or alcohol abuse per Principal Investigator&#xD;
             discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Subject is a female who is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
