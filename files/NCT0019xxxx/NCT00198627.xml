      The purpose of this study is to determine what are the major types of bacteria that cause&#xD;
      newborn infections in the community in rural Bangladesh and whether providing an obstetric&#xD;
      and neonatal care package will reduce neonatal deaths by 40%.&#xD;

      The study seeks answers to two questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What are the major bacterial pathogens responsible for serious neonatal infections in&#xD;
           the community in rural Bangladesh?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can provision of a package of obstetric and neonatal care, including active surveillance&#xD;
           for serious neonatal illness and referral to hospital, and identification of barriers to&#xD;
           care-seeking and design of strategies to address them reduce neonatal mortality rates by&#xD;
           at least 40% compared to communities in which such services are not provided?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite significant decline in infant and child mortality rates in recent decades, neonatal&#xD;
      mortality rates remain unacceptably high. Of the 8 million infant deaths that occur worldwide&#xD;
      each year, approximately 4 million occur in the neonatal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the specific aims of the study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. identifying the principal agents of serious bacterial infections in Bangladeshi neonates&#xD;
           in the community&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. evaluating the impact of introducing a package of essential obstetric and neonatal care&#xD;
           practices in the community, including identifying barriers to care-seeking and design of&#xD;
           strategies to address those barriers and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. building capacity within Bangladesh by training Bangladeshi scientists in&#xD;
           epidemiological and microbiological techniques, clinical research methods and best&#xD;
           clinical practice through an on-going collaboration with Dhaka Shishu (Children)&#xD;
           Hospital and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh.&#xD;
