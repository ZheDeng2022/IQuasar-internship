  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of using a modified virus to transfer a&#xD;
      gene called GAD into a region of the brain called the subthalamic nucleus in patients with&#xD;
      advanced Parkinson's disease. The overall goal of this approach is to ultimately normalize&#xD;
      the flow of information in several brain regions responsible for movement, to ultimately&#xD;
      improve function in patients with this disorder. The current study is primarily designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of this approach, but patients are also being monitored for possible&#xD;
      signs of effectiveness as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study involves treatment of patients with medically refractory Parkinson's disease (PD)&#xD;
      with gene therapy. The patients are chosen from a population of patients who would normally&#xD;
      be candidates for standard deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery for PD. These patients&#xD;
      respond to medical therapy, but develop substantially reduced responses over time, often with&#xD;
      severe fluctuations in their condition between a functional and severely non-functional&#xD;
      state. Some patients also develop dose-limiting side effects from medication, including&#xD;
      involuntary movements called dyskinesias and nightmares. When there are no medical&#xD;
      contraindications, DBS is often performed in these patients to try to quiet hyperactive brain&#xD;
      regions such as the subthalamic nucleus (STN). In PD, the STN is overactive due to a loss of&#xD;
      GABA inputs to this region, which normally reduces neuronal firing. In turn, the STN drives&#xD;
      other brain regions, including the globus pallidus (GPi) and substantia nigra (SNr), which&#xD;
      are also hyperactive and which also have reduced GABA inputs. The goal of this gene therapy&#xD;
      trial is to introduce the gene for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) into the STN using an&#xD;
      adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, in order to permit the STN to produce it's own GABA, as&#xD;
      well as release GABA into the GPi and SNr targets, which also have reduced GABA inputs. This&#xD;
      is anticipated to restore a more normal pattern of information flow from this basal ganglia&#xD;
      circuit to the thalamus and higher cortical structures in order to reduce the motor symptoms&#xD;
      of PD, while eliminating complications arising from inserting DBS electrodes and batteries&#xD;
      into the human body.&#xD;
