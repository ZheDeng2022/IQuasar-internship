      The purpose of this study is to investigate, by means of a temporary sympathetic nerve block,&#xD;
      the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system in Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS).&#xD;
      This study may also result in a new therapeutic approach for male CPPS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male pelvic pain is a common urological complaint. Oftentimes patients are given the&#xD;
      diagnosis of chronic prostatitis. Although the term &quot;chronic prostatitis&quot; is commonly&#xD;
      associated with infection, less than 5% of men presenting with pelvic pain are found to have&#xD;
      evidence of urogenital infection with common pathogens. Because no etiology can usually be&#xD;
      associated with the pain, chronic idiopathic prostatitis is now called male chronic pelvic&#xD;
      pain syndrome (CPPS). Options proposed for the treatment of male CPPS have had limited and&#xD;
      variable success rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although several abnormalities of the nervous system have been proposed as possible causes of&#xD;
      CPPS, the clinical nature of the disease suggests involvement of the sympathetic nervous&#xD;
      system. The sympathetic nervous system may be involved in many regional pain syndromes, and&#xD;
      in such situations, the term &quot;sympathetically maintained pain&quot; has been used with complex&#xD;
      regional pain syndromes. Block of the sympathetic nerves supplying this region is commonly&#xD;
      used to detect sympathetic nervous system involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sympathetic nerve blocks have been used in some clinical studies involving pelvic pain but&#xD;
      most of these studies included cancer patients with pelvic pain. The type of sympathetic&#xD;
      blocks used for pelvic pain is superior hypogastric plexus block and it involves instillation&#xD;
      of neural blocking agents such as local anesthetic agents in the region of the plexus,&#xD;
      usually under fluoroscopic control. Nociceptive afferent transmission from pelvic viscera is&#xD;
      probably via the superior hypogastric plexus. This treatment option has not been&#xD;
      systematically used for male CPPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a temporary block of the superior hypogastric plexus with bupivacaine will be&#xD;
      used to assess the degree of sympathetic block with some electrodiagnostic tests. After the&#xD;
      temporary nerve block, the analgesic efficacy will be monitored. Therefore, in this study, we&#xD;
      hope not only to explain the sympathetic nature of the disease in more concrete terms but&#xD;
      also propose a new therapeutic approach for male CPPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men with a diagnosis of non-bacterial chronic pelvic pain who have not responded to treatment&#xD;
      will be asked to participate in this study. The subjects will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      either active medication as the sympathetic plexus block or placebo. All other study elements&#xD;
      will be identical for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 will take approximately 4 hours at the University of Washington Medical Center&#xD;
      Urology Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First, the study will be explained in detail to the subject. Any questions he has will&#xD;
           be answered and he will be given the study consent to read and sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Next, the subject will be asked to fill out baseline questionnaires. They are&#xD;
           Demographic Questionnaire, Baseline Symptom Questionnaire, NIH Symptom Index-Baseline,&#xD;
           AUA Symptom Score, short version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Pain Drawing. A&#xD;
           sexual function questionnaire, the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) will&#xD;
           also be administered. After completing the questionnaires, the subject will have a&#xD;
           physical and neurological exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw: An 20 gauge needle will be inserted to antecubital vein and fixed with tape.&#xD;
           The subject will lie down on the examination table for 20 minutes and then have&#xD;
           approximately 10 cc of blood drawn, via the needle, to be used for baseline plasma&#xD;
           catecholamine, corticosteroid and acetylcholine levels. Plasma catecholamine measurement&#xD;
           is a biochemical parameter to evaluate sympathetic nervous system. Corticosteroids are&#xD;
           stress-related hormones and acetylcholine is an important neurotransmitter related to&#xD;
           autonomic nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will next ask the patient to stand. After he has been standing for 5 minutes, another&#xD;
           10cc of blood will be drawn then the needle removed. This blood will be used to measure&#xD;
           the same hormonal parameters, as above, but after the nervous system has been activated&#xD;
           by standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prostate massage and rectal/prostate exam: The subject will undergo a rectal and&#xD;
           prostate examination with massage of the prostate and expressions of prostatic fluids.&#xD;
           The subject will be asked to come with a full bladder and asked to urinate about 5 cc&#xD;
           into a small container. He will then be asked to urinate 20 cc into a second container&#xD;
           and save the rest in his bladder. The subject will then undergo a rectal examination and&#xD;
           prostate massage and if possible obtaining expressed prostatic secretions from the tip&#xD;
           of the penis. The subject will then be asked to urinate a third time approximately 10 cc&#xD;
           into a sterile container. Specimens will be used for microbiologic and biochemical&#xD;
           studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Semen analysis: We will ask the subject to provide a semen sample through masturbation.&#xD;
           A private room, with a lockable door, will be provided for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some of the specimens collected at this visit will be saved for future use for possible&#xD;
           biochemical studies. These studies will be available only to the investigators involved&#xD;
           in this study and given to no one else. If in the future, it is deemed by the&#xD;
           investigators to be scientifically and clinically valuable, these specimens may be used&#xD;
           for genetic testing for genes that make one susceptible to pelvic pain syndromes such as&#xD;
           prostatitis. If genetic testing is ever considered in the future, the subject will be&#xD;
           contacted and asked to sign another consent form. The consent will state the exact&#xD;
           nature of the testing and clearly explain why it is being done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrodiagnostic tests: These are the tests to evaluate the sympathetic nervous system&#xD;
           tone and also sensations in several parts of the body including the genital area. The&#xD;
           first electrodiagnostic test will involve a battery controlled instrument called&#xD;
           Episcan. It measures the skin conductivity response on several sites of the body. We&#xD;
           will apply this test on penis, scrotum, genital area, perineum, hands and feet. It is a&#xD;
           painless and non-invasive test and it does not require any stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second part of the electrodiagnostic tests will involve use of another battery&#xD;
           controlled instrument called Neurometer. This is a painless procedure that detects and&#xD;
           localizes abnormalities of sensation in several body parts. We will apply this test on&#xD;
           both feet, hands, penis, scrotum, genital area and perineum. Three different types of&#xD;
           stimuli with different frequencies will be delivered to determine the sensory threshold&#xD;
           in each of these areas tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The third test will be the measurement of temperature sensations in the painful area,&#xD;
           the perineum and left hand. In order to measure temperature sensation, a small probe&#xD;
           capable of changing temperature will be placed on these areas. The ability to&#xD;
           discriminate temperature changes will be determined as well as the subjective discomfort&#xD;
           produced by the temperature changes. A computer assisted device called Thermal Sensory&#xD;
           Analyzer will be used for that purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then, the subject will have sympathetic skin response and evoked cavernous activity&#xD;
           measurements. These tests reflect the state of the sympathetic nervous system in the&#xD;
           evaluated body part. The subject will be in the supine position throughout. Two 28 ga.&#xD;
           concentric needle electrodes will be placed into the side of the penis. Six surface&#xD;
           electrodes will be placed on the penile skin, on scrotum, on perineum and on abdominal&#xD;
           skin as recording electrodes. Eight other surface electrodes will be placed on the back&#xD;
           and inner sides of both feet and both hands. After the electrodes are placed,&#xD;
           spontaneous electrical activity will be recorded for 5 minutes. After obtaining&#xD;
           spontaneous surface and needle electrode recordings, the right wrist (median nerve) will&#xD;
           be stimulated a small amount of current. Median nerve stimulation is a routine method&#xD;
           used to stimulate the nervous system in order to record electrical skin responses. After&#xD;
           the stimulation of the median nerve, evoked responses will be acquired through the&#xD;
           existing electrodes. The stimulus to the median nerve will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After this test, all the electrodes will be taken out and two needle electrodes as used&#xD;
           in the penis will be inserted into the cremasteric muscles on both sides. These are the&#xD;
           muscles surrounding the vessels that supply testicles. Then, inner side of right thigh&#xD;
           will be stimulated a small amount of current to evoke cremasteric muscle reflexes. This&#xD;
           reflex shows the state of sympathetic nerves that supply testicles and scrotum. These&#xD;
           tests will be useful to assess the degree of sympathetic nerve blockage by comparing to&#xD;
           the tests after the instillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the visit, the subject will be given a voiding diary and plastic urinal.&#xD;
           We will ask him to measure and record his urine output for any 3 consecutive days during&#xD;
           the coming week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 2 will take approximately 4 hours at the University of Washington Medical Center&#xD;
      Urology Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this visit, the subject will be taken into fluoroscopy unit in the Urology clinic.&#xD;
           The subject will lie in the prone position and will receive a subcutaneous injection of&#xD;
           1% lidocaine without epinephrine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then, under radiologic guidance, two needles (22-G Chiba) will be placed via a bilateral&#xD;
           posterior approach such that the tips of both needles lie anterior to the L5/S1&#xD;
           vertebrae. Placement of the needle will be monitored closely in order to avoid any other&#xD;
           anatomical structures. The exact locations of needles will be confirmed with injection&#xD;
           of radiopaque solution (Isovue-200) under fluoroscopy. After ensuring correct needle&#xD;
           placement, 0.5% levobupivacaine, 10ml will be injected in each needle in the study group&#xD;
           and 0.9% NaCl solution, 10ml in the control group. Routine monitoring (ECG/blood&#xD;
           pressure, pulse oximetry) will be used throughout the procedure and for 30 minutes after&#xD;
           the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One hour following the procedure, the blood draw, urine collection (without prostate&#xD;
           massage) and the electrodiagnostic tests as in the first visit will be repeated in order&#xD;
           to assess the degree of block. The subjects will be given another copy of the voiding&#xD;
           diary to fill out during the next week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 3 will take about 4 hours and will take place one week following the procedure. The&#xD;
      sympathetic blockage will be assessed for its side effects on sexual and voiding function&#xD;
      with a through physical and neurological examination. The pain questionnaires NIH&#xD;
      SX-Follow/up, AUA-Symptom Score, IIEF, PSS and Pain Drawing and the electrodiagnostic tests&#xD;
      will be repeated.&#xD;
