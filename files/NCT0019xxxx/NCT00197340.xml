  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-eclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are common and important&#xD;
      disorders of pregnancy. Both disorders are associated with an impairment of uteroplacental&#xD;
      blood flow (UPBF). No effective therapy has been identified to reliably improve UPBF in these&#xD;
      patients and typically, obstetric management involves interventional delivery, particularly&#xD;
      problematic when remote from term. This study assess the hypothesis that epidural local&#xD;
      anesthetics may improve UPBF in these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women with sonographic uterine artery flow abnormalities and either PE or IUGR (or both) were&#xD;
      randomized to either ACET or non ACET control. Both groups were able to receive standard&#xD;
      therapies (in-hospital monitoring, magnesium and anti-hypertensives as appropriate). The&#xD;
      first five days of the therapeutic arm (ACET) consisted of a dose-finding trial, where&#xD;
      epidural ropivacaine infusions (10ml/hr for 24 hours) of 0•04%, 0•06%, 0•08% and 0•1% and a&#xD;
      saline placebo were each administered via tunneled epidural catheters in a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blinded, cross-over design over five consecutive days; all three women received all&#xD;
      doses. Doppler measurement of flow in the uterine artery was performed at baseline and at the&#xD;
      end of each dose period. The ideal dose for an individual was determined to be lowest dose of&#xD;
      drug giving maximal effect without side effects; in the second stage of the study, this dose&#xD;
      was administered until delivery with the addition of a second placebo day to during this&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Reliable gestational age based upon an ultrasound crown-rump length performed&#xD;
             between 7 to 14 completed weeks gestation. If the ultrasound date matches the date of&#xD;
             the last menstrual period (LMP) within 7 days, the LMP date is used, otherwise the&#xD;
             ultrasound date is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Gestational age at the time of enrollment between 28 to 32 weeks (based upon 1.)&#xD;
             and need for in-hospital observation or treatment REGARDLESS of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Presence of uterine artery notching in ultrasound scan. 4. EITHER 4a or 4b (if&#xD;
             both, the patient is enrolled as for 4a): 4a. Pre-eclampsia: Women must have criteria&#xD;
             #1 and #2 Criterion #1: Hypertension (&gt; 140/90) at rest, measured twice, at least 6&#xD;
             hours apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criterion #2: Proteinuria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        EITHER: At least 0.1 g/l in two random samples at least 6 hours apart. OR: At least 0.3g in&#xD;
        a 24 hour collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4b Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR): Women must have criteria #1 and #2. Criterion&#xD;
        #1: Ultrasound abdominal circumference below 10th percentile. Criterion #2: Established&#xD;
        IUGR for at least 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  at the time of enrollment: active labor, severe pre-eclampsia, (resting blood pressure&#xD;
             ≥ 160mmHg systolic or 110 diastolic, recorded on at least two occasions 6 hours&#xD;
             apart), known fetal anomaly, intrauterine infection, placental anomalies (previa,&#xD;
             abruption, circumvallate, infarction), twins, and refusal of consent.&#xD;
