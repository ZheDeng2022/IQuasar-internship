        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female patients, of any race, 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have at least one bleeding site within the operative field that is mild&#xD;
             (oozing or capillary bleeding) to moderate (gradual or steady bleeding) in intensity&#xD;
             and which cannot be managed by surgical modalities because they are ineffective or&#xD;
             impractical (Change 15, Amend 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients scheduled for any of the following elective surgical procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Cardiovascular Procedures - aortic surgery such as aneurysmectomy,&#xD;
                  aneurysmoplasty, aneurysmorrhaphy, aneurysmotomy and bypass procedures involving&#xD;
                  the aorta; major coronary bypass procedures including primary bypass surgery and&#xD;
                  re-do procedures. Peripheral vascular procedures to include femoral-popliteal&#xD;
                  bypass, femoral-femoral bypass, or other peripheral vascular procedures requiring&#xD;
                  vessel grafting with native or prosthetic grafts including&#xD;
                  Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts; carotid endarterectomies. The sternum is&#xD;
                  excluded as a Target Site. Bleeding sites evaluated during these procedures may&#xD;
                  include soft tissues (e.g. mammary bed, retroperitoneal fat/connective tissues&#xD;
                  and adhesions) and needle hole bleeding of prosthetic graft material (Change 6,&#xD;
                  Amend 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Neurosurgical (spine) Procedures- primary lumbar laminectomy and laminectomy with&#xD;
                  fusion (fusion must be done after the time to hemostasis assessment). Re-do&#xD;
                  laminectomy, removal of tumors/lesions during laminectomy, cervical, or thoracic&#xD;
                  laminectomy procedures will be excluded. Bleeding sites evaluated may include&#xD;
                  periosteum, bone marrow, venous plexus (Change 7, Amend 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. General Surgery or Post-Traumatic (hemodynamically stable and non-coagulopathic)&#xD;
                  procedures: bowel and colon resections, retroperitoneal dissections/resections,&#xD;
                  and procedures involving the resection of any solid abdominal organ such as a&#xD;
                  splenectomy, liver resection, nephrectomy, splenorrhaphy, and pancreatectomy.&#xD;
                  Bleeding sites evaluated may include soft tissues (e.g. bowel mesentery,&#xD;
                  adhesions, lymph node beds, sacral venous plexus, etc.) and parenchymal organ&#xD;
                  bleeds (cut surface of resected liver, spleen, etc., excluding cut surface of&#xD;
                  kidney) (Amendment #2, Change 44). Bowel anastomoses sites will not be included&#xD;
                  (Change 8, Amend 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient, or the patient's legally authorized representative, must provide legally&#xD;
             effective informed consent prior to any participation in the study. (Amendment #2,&#xD;
             Change 41)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with bleeding diathesis, pathologic coagulopathy, systemic disorders, or&#xD;
             autoimmune, immunodeficiency diseases or any other disorder that may interfere with&#xD;
             hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had a pre-operative laboratory finding that was considered&#xD;
             clinically significant (as determined by the Investigator) for CBC (HCT, Hgb, white&#xD;
             blood cell differential, platelet count, and Red Blood Cell (RBC) indices (MCH, MCV,&#xD;
             MCHC)), prothrombin time (PT), or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have used anticoagulant, antiplatelet or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
             analgesic (NSAID) within 5 days prior to surgery (the use of ASA or aprotinin is&#xD;
             permitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known antibodies to bovine thrombin preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving an organ transplant (liver, heart, kidney, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are morbidly obese (Body Mass Index &gt; 35).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with acute or chronic liver failure (Amendment #2, Change 42).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with all severe (brisk or forceful) bleeding site(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an ongoing infection at the operative site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are known alcohol and/or drug abusers.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who have participated in another investigational drug or device research&#xD;
             within 30 days of enrollment.&#xD;
