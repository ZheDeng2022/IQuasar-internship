  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, we plan to evaluate further the role of arsenic trioxide in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with refractory multiple myeloma. Arsenic trioxide will be used in combination with&#xD;
      thalidomide. Although both drugs have a similar mechanism of action, it is likely that the&#xD;
      mechanisms may be additive or synergistic. Since neither drug produces much myelosuppression,&#xD;
      this combination regimen should be tolerable in patients with compromised marrow function due&#xD;
      to involvement with myeloma and/or previous cytotoxic chemotherapy&#xD;
