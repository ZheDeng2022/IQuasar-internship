  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with chronic kidney failure often do not grow well. This study examines the possible&#xD;
      causes of growth failure in these children and the response to recombinant human growth&#xD;
      hormone. The growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor axis will be studied in relation to&#xD;
      biochemical and immunological parameters as well as body compositional changes pre- and post&#xD;
      recombinant human growth hormone therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with chronic renal failure (CRF; estimated creatinine clearance less than&#xD;
      75ml/min/1.73 m2) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD; dialysis dependent) have marked growth&#xD;
      retardation and often do not achieve their expected height based on genetic potential despite&#xD;
      adequate caloric supplementation, and more recently, rhGH treatment. Resistance to both&#xD;
      endogenous and rhGH has been proposed to account for much of this growth failure, although&#xD;
      the specific mechanisms remain unknown. Possibilities include insensitivity to GH and an&#xD;
      inappropriate production of IGF-I and/or a reduced bioavailability secondary to an altered&#xD;
      GH-IGF axis. Abnormalities in the GH/IGF-I axis may result in an inability of the growth&#xD;
      plate chondrocyte to respond appropriately. Studies combining data on nutritional parameters,&#xD;
      changes in body composition and bone density, bone turnover and the GH-IGF axis-related&#xD;
      proteins in children with CRF and ESRD are lacking. We propose to further characterize the&#xD;
      specific mechanisms underlying impaired growth in pre-pubertal and pubertal children with CRF&#xD;
      or ESRD and growth failure prior to and after the initiation of rhGH therapy. The Specific&#xD;
      Aims of this proposal are designed to allow a more efficacious use of rhGH in maximizing&#xD;
      growth in these children. In this study measurements of total body composition, i.e., lean&#xD;
      body mass, fat mass and bone mineral content will be made using dual photon X-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry. Bone mineral density will also be determined. These studies will be&#xD;
      correlated with anthropometric, biochemical and nutritional assessments of patients before&#xD;
      and during rhGH treatment. Letin and cytokines will be concomitantly measured. Bone collagen&#xD;
      turnover will be quantitated using pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline cross-links excretion&#xD;
      (in CRF patients) and serum levels of collagen type I C-terminal propeptide (CICP)&#xD;
      concomitant with the above measurements. Bone turnover will be further assessed by looking at&#xD;
      additional biochemical markers of bone metabolism such as osteocalcin and bone alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase. Serum levels of IGF-I, IGF-II, intact and fragmented IGFBP-1, -2,-3, and GH and&#xD;
      GH-binding activity will be determined before and during rhGH therapy and correlated to&#xD;
      measurements made in the other studies. These studies will help elucidate the differences in&#xD;
      rhGH responsiveness in this population. Taken together, the above studies will substantially&#xD;
      advance our understanding of how rhGH improves growth in children with CRF and ESRD.&#xD;
