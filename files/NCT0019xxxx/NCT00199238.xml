      Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rupatadine for the treatment of CIU&#xD;
      symptoms.To assess the clinical efficacy of a dose ranging of rupatadine fumarate (5mg, 10mg,&#xD;
      and 20 mg) compared with placebo for relief of CIU symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: A dose-finding multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group study Number of patients (planned and analysed): 248 patients. 62 patients&#xD;
      will be allocated to each treatment group. 283 patients were randomised and analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion: Man or woman aged between 12 and 65. Documented history&#xD;
      of active CIU (urticaria wheals) with or without an associated angioedema for at least three&#xD;
      days per week over the last 6 weeks prior to Day 0 . Active CIU (score ³2 labelled as&#xD;
      moderate pruritus) for at least 3 days (not necessarily consecutive days) in the week before&#xD;
      inclusion with a total score of active CIU ³6 labelled as moderate pruritus for these 3 days.&#xD;
      Results of standard laboratory biochemistry and haematology tests obtained at screening&#xD;
      within acceptable limits as assessed by investigator. Patient who signed the informed consent&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test product, dose, mode of administration, batch N°: Rupatadine 5,10 and 20 mg tablets; oral&#xD;
      dose of 1 tablet/day for 4 consecutive weeks; batch 0102 (France) and batch 0203 (Hungary,&#xD;
      Romania and Argentina). Expiry date: 12/2003 (France) and 10/2004 (Hungary, Romania and&#xD;
      Argentina).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment: Oral administration of test formulation (5, 10, 20 mg) or placebo&#xD;
      daily, for 4 consecutive weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference therapy: Placebo tablets, 1 tablet/day for 4 consecutive weeks. Criteria for&#xD;
      evaluation (efficacy): Primary efficacy measure of each treatment will compare the frequency&#xD;
      and severity of symptoms of CIU as measured by the patient in terms of change in mean&#xD;
      pruritus score (MPS) over the 4-week treatment period.Secondary efficacy measures include&#xD;
      change from baseline over the 4-week treatment period in the mean number of wheals (MNW)&#xD;
      score; mean total symptoms score (MTSS), calculated as the sum of the MPS (Mean pruritus&#xD;
      symptoms) and the MNW (Mean number of wheals) scores and the interference with sleep and&#xD;
      daily activities due to urticaria symptoms Criteria for evaluation (safety): AEs, laboratory&#xD;
      tests and vital signs&#xD;
