      This study will examine the feasibility and short and-long-term efficacy of a web-based&#xD;
      telehealth intervention with community-dwelling older adults who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes. Effectiveness will be evaluated using multiple measures within three&#xD;
      different domains: 1) physical (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1C], weight, and lipid levels);&#xD;
      2) behavioral (monitoring blood glucose levels, feet inspections, diet, and exercise&#xD;
      frequency), and 3) psychosocial (depression, quality of life, social support, and adjustment&#xD;
      to diabetes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial of a web-based telehealth intervention designed to&#xD;
      improve self-management behaviors in a group of community dwelling older diabetics. Two&#xD;
      groups of participants will be recruited and randomized over a four-month period during years&#xD;
      01 and 02. Participants in the control group will receive standard diabetic care provided by&#xD;
      their provider. Participants in the intervention group will receive computer training in the&#xD;
      participant's home in how to access and utilize the web-based telehealth study webpage. The&#xD;
      intervention will consist of a program designed and delivered via the Internet to improve the&#xD;
      participants' diabetes self-management behaviors using behavioral and motivational strategies&#xD;
      and cues to modify perceptions of self-efficacy and beliefs regarding the ability to affect&#xD;
      the progress of the disease and change personal behavior.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This one year study plans to enroll 62 individuals into two groups. One group will receive&#xD;
      the standard diabetic care provided and the second group will receive the standard diabetic&#xD;
      care and training on how to use a computer to access the Internet. Participant assignment&#xD;
      into either group is random (like flipping a coin). Study procedures will include the&#xD;
      completion of questionnaires; a blood pressure reading, weight and a finger prick to obtain a&#xD;
      blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a total of three visits. One visit will occur before the study starts and at a&#xD;
      six-month interval during the study period. The time to complete the study procedures by the&#xD;
      research staff is approximately 1 to 1Â½ hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Questionnaires: Participants will meet with a research staff person who will ask&#xD;
           questions about dietary intake, exercise activity, blood glucose levels, feet&#xD;
           inspections, past and current Internet activity, and psychosocial well-being&#xD;
           (depression, quality of life, self-efficacy, social support, readiness to change, and&#xD;
           adjustment to diabetes). The time estimated for completion is about 45 to 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physiologic Measures: Participants will have their blood pressures taken, weight&#xD;
           measured using a scale, and asked to provide 4-5 drops of blood from the fingertip to&#xD;
           measure glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), Cholesterol (HDL:LDL ratio) will be measured to&#xD;
           evaluate improvement in short-and-long term (3 months to one year) management of&#xD;
           diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants selected to participate in the computer/Internet study group will be&#xD;
           contacted by research staff within one month to schedule a time to set-up the study&#xD;
           computer equipment and receive computer training. Three 2 hour sessions of computer&#xD;
           training over a three-week period in participants' homes will be scheduled. Participants&#xD;
           will also be expected to participate in following Internet study procedures, available&#xD;
           via the Internet from their homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Maintaining a daily personal log of diabetes self care activities (blood sugar&#xD;
                readings, diet, exercise, feet inspections, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Participating in nurse led peer support question and answer chat sessions twice a&#xD;
                month.&#xD;
&#xD;
           d). Read and respond to e-mail sent from the study nurse. e) Read health information on&#xD;
           diabetes management, depression, and psychosocial well being that will be provided by&#xD;
           the study nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Computer Training Training will be provided on how to use the computer, access the study&#xD;
           web page resources, and participate in the nurse-led peer support group conference&#xD;
           forum, use e-mail, and how to prepare and send a daily log of self-management activities&#xD;
           (blood sugar monitoring, diet, feet inspections, and exercise). Training will also be&#xD;
           provided on how to use the study web site's bulletin board, and the electronic prompt to&#xD;
           verify completion of the weekly health reading assignment, and how to develop and post&#xD;
           an action plan on-line.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The amount of time for the above Internet activities will vary depending on&#xD;
           participants' degree of interest in accessing the Internet resources provided.&#xD;
           Approximately 1-4 hours per week or more will be needed to complete the Internet&#xD;
           activities. Participants who are assigned to the intervention group who fail to respond&#xD;
           to e-mail or to use any of the intervention resources for a one-week period will be&#xD;
           contacted by telephone to determine the reason for not participating in the study&#xD;
           activity (technical, knowledge deficit, medical, lack of ability, lack of interest,&#xD;
           etc.).&#xD;
