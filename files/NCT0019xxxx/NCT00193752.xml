    <textblock>
      18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) Imaging has been extensively&#xD;
      used in the evaluation of various malignancies and is rapidly being recognized as a mandatory&#xD;
      investigations. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) Imaging has&#xD;
      also been tried in cervical cancers with excellent results for detection of both pelvic and&#xD;
      extra-pelvic disease in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Till date, PET Imaging has been&#xD;
      reported to have highest sensitivity and specificity for detection of disease and treatment&#xD;
      failures compared to other non-invasive investigations available. Treatment decisions&#xD;
      (Localized RT Vs Extended RT) will be according to the results of PET Scans. The treatment&#xD;
      response, outcome and follow-up will be labelled according to the PET Scan results and will&#xD;
      be directed for treatment accordingly.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carcinoma Cervix is the commonest malignancy and a leading cause of cancer mortality seen in&#xD;
      Indian women. At Tata Memorial Hospital, Carcinoma Cervix constitutes approximately 10% of&#xD;
      all cancers (1). Nearly 85% of the patients present with advanced stages (FIGO Stage II/III).&#xD;
      The main stay of treatment has traditionally been radical radiation therapy with 80-90% of&#xD;
      patients requiring radiation in their lifetime and over decades the survival rates have&#xD;
      achieved a plateau of 30 - 55% at 5 years. In patients with advanced stages (stages IIB to&#xD;
      IVA), 15 - 38% have para-aortic lymph nodal metastases (2). Identification of para-aortic&#xD;
      nodal status allows modification of radiation therapy fields to include this nodal disease,&#xD;
      which, because of intestinal morbidity, is not routinely included in the treatment field by&#xD;
      most of the Radiation Oncologists. Extended field radiation therapy that includes the&#xD;
      para-aortic nodes is associated with a 31% to 50% 5 year-survival, depending on the location&#xD;
      and extent of para-aortic nodal metastasis and the likelihood of controlling the pelvic&#xD;
      disease (3-5) Therefore, in advanced cervical cancer, it has been reported that&#xD;
      progression-free survival is significantly related to para-aortic lymph node metastasis&#xD;
      (6-8). In a collective series of Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols, Para aortic nodal&#xD;
      status was the most significant indication of recurrence (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of noninvasive modalities have been used to evaluate the status of para-aortic nodal&#xD;
      metastasis. The introduction of Computed Tomographic (CT) Scanning in the mid-1970s provided&#xD;
      a method of para-aortic nodal disease evaluation (9). CT Scanning has been widely used for&#xD;
      clinical staging, but its sensitivity for nodal metastasis is only 44% (10). In contrast to&#xD;
      CT, which primarily relies on the morphologic criteria, FDG-PET can non-invasively assess&#xD;
      metabolic activity in cancers and metastatic lesions. The differentiation capability for&#xD;
      malignant lesions of FDG-PET is not compromised by using morphologic size criteria. Even&#xD;
      malignant lesions less than 1 cm in diameter that manifest high FDG uptake can be&#xD;
      differentiated from nonmalignant tissue by using PET. Therefore, FDG-PET can detect&#xD;
      metastatic para-aortic lymph nodes in patients with advanced cervical cancer whose lymph&#xD;
      nodes have not been abnormally enlarged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many published data have previously reported the clinical value of 18F FDG PET for imaging&#xD;
      the primary tumor, staging the nodal and visceral involvement, and also detecting a recurrent&#xD;
      disease (11-19). Rose et al. (11) used FDG-PET for evaluating nodal metastasis in locally&#xD;
      advanced cervical cancer before surgical staging, with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity&#xD;
      of 92% to detect the metastases of para-aortic lymph nodes. They found that the accuracy of&#xD;
      FDG-PET was greater than that of CT in detecting the para-aortic lymph nodal metastasis. In a&#xD;
      similar series, Wu et al. have reported a sensitivity of 85.7%, a specificity of 94.4%, and&#xD;
      an accuracy of 92% with FDG PET to detect para-aortic lymph nodal metastasis in patients with&#xD;
      advanced cervical cancer and negative abdominal CT findings. Grigsby et al. (12) demonstrated&#xD;
      that FDG-PET detects more abnormal lymph node regions than does CT, and that FDG-PET findings&#xD;
      are a better predictor of survival than those of CT in patients with cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has also been reviewed in evaluating both the primary&#xD;
      disease at cervix and also para-aortic nodal staging. MRI has been recognized as an important&#xD;
      imaging modality for the management of cervical cancer because of its multiplanar capability,&#xD;
      distinct tissue contrast characteristics using various pulse sequences, and excellent tissue&#xD;
      contrast, particularly between tumor and surrounding normal tissues. However, PET findings&#xD;
      were most often compared to CT results, while MRI is nowadays considered as the modality of&#xD;
      choice for staging the primary tumor (20,21). Only one study by Narayan et al. has compared&#xD;
      the respective value of MRI and PET for staging loco-regionally advanced cervical cancer&#xD;
      (22). Their study found that the primary tumor was similarly detected by the two imaging&#xD;
      techniques with a sensitivity of 100%. On the other hand, except for small-volume metastases,&#xD;
      PET had a sufficiently high positive predictive value (91%) in the pelvis and para-aortic&#xD;
      region, to obviate lymph node sampling. More recent studies have shown that the 3D&#xD;
      quantitative imaging-based method of tumor size assessment using MRI is highly accurate in&#xD;
      determining actual tumor size and extent (23-27) and may be superior to clinical palpation in&#xD;
      predicting local tumor control (23,25,28) Conversely, MRI accuracy was insufficient for nodal&#xD;
      management. If MRI remains the modality of choice for evaluating the loco-regional status of&#xD;
      the primary tumor, metabolic imaging i.e FDG PET seems particularly useful for staging, in&#xD;
      one session, extra pelvic nodal metastases. Thus, PET may have a significant impact on&#xD;
      treatment decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of para-aortic nodal status allows modification of radiation therapy fields to&#xD;
      include this nodal disease. Stehman et al. previously demonstrated the prognostic importance&#xD;
      of para-aortic nodal status in locally advanced cervical carcinoma (6). In advanced cervical&#xD;
      cancer, it has been reported that progression-free survival is significantly related to&#xD;
      para-aortic lymph node metastasis (6-8). Recent studies have shown a survival benefit in&#xD;
      patients with positive para-aortic nodes treated by extended-field irradiation and concurrent&#xD;
      radio-sensitizing chemotherapy (29-31).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET is also of great value for optimally confirming a complete remission and detecting a&#xD;
      recurrence non-invasively in post-treatment follow-up. More recently, positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) with the glucose analogue, 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has demonstrated&#xD;
      promising results in evaluating tumor response and predicting survival after primary&#xD;
      treatment with radiation therapy or chemotherapy for several tumor types, including&#xD;
      head-and-neck cancer, breast cancer, seminoma, colorectal cancer, lymphoma, and lung cancer&#xD;
      (33-40). Recently, Grigsby et al have reported the role of FDG PET in posttherapy&#xD;
      surveillance monitoring in a series of 75 patients with cervical cancer. They have concluded&#xD;
      that FDG-PET is a valuable tool to evaluate the response of both at primary and its lymph&#xD;
      node disease after radiation therapy and chemotherapy and for the Post-Rx surveillance of&#xD;
      patients to detect asymptomatic recurrence (41).&#xD;
