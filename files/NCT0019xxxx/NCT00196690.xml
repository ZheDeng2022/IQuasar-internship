  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Aphasia (impairment of language function due to brain damage)may be treated with&#xD;
           speech-language therapy and drugs. Several drugs have been studied but with limited&#xD;
           success.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent data suggest that the neurotransmitter acetylcholine may be reduced in brain&#xD;
           damaged subjects and that drugs that stimulates acetylcholine activity may help recovery&#xD;
           of aphasic deficits particularly when paired with speech-language therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent evidence indicates that medicaments acting on the neurotransmitter acetylcholine&#xD;
           may promote improvement of aphasic deficits and our previous open-label study of&#xD;
           donepezil in post-stroke aphasia showed benefits in all patients and observed benefit&#xD;
           were long-lasting (6 months).This study will test the safety and efficacy of donepezil&#xD;
           (an agent acting on acetylcholine)in subjects with stroke-related chronic aphasia (more&#xD;
           than 1 yr of evolution).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Prior clinical information of donepezil treatment of post-stroke aphasia comes from&#xD;
           single-case studies, small case-series and an open-label study. In addition, an&#xD;
           extension phase of a small open-label study also suggest that the efficacy of donepezil&#xD;
           in chronic post-stroke apahsia is maintained at long-term follow-up. These data&#xD;
           collectively suggest that in post-stroke donepezil is effective and well-tolerated with&#xD;
           a limited potential for causing clinically significant interactions when prescribed with&#xD;
           other medications. However, these results are preliminary and should be judged&#xD;
           parsimoniously until randomized controlled trials will be performed.Moreover, recent&#xD;
           data by our group also showed that donepezil may improve sensorimotor deficits&#xD;
           (hemiparesis)in some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil in post-stroke may be&#xD;
           justified because in vivo and postmortem studies have shown that patients with vascular&#xD;
           dementia and lesions in subcortical and cortical structures have deficient cholinergic&#xD;
           neurotransmission that results from interruption of cholinergic pathways linking the&#xD;
           basal forebrain with the cerebral cortex, including the perisylvian language area.In&#xD;
           addition, two large-scale randomized controlled trials in patients pure vascular&#xD;
           dementia and vascular cognitive impairment found that donepezil was significantly&#xD;
           superior to placebo on cognition, global function and activities of daily living.And the&#xD;
           most noticeable benefits of donepezil over placebo at doses of 5-mg and 10-mg were found&#xD;
           on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog/11), an&#xD;
           assessment instrument highly reliant upon language variables (6 out of 11 items).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We evaluated the efficacy of donepezil in patients with chronic aphasia associated with&#xD;
           stroke.This is a 20-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel study&#xD;
           that enrolled aphasic patient with more than one year of evolution. During the study all&#xD;
           patients continued receiving two hours weekly of conventional speech-language therapy.&#xD;
           Patients were randomized in an 1:1 ratio to donepezil, 5-mg/day, for the first 4 weeks,&#xD;
           followed by forced dose escalation to 10-mg/day thereafter (n =13), or placebo (n = 13)&#xD;
           and then a 4 week washout period. The primary efficacy measures were the Aphasia&#xD;
           Quotient (AQ) of the Western Aphasia Battery and the Communicative Activity Log.&#xD;
           Secondary efficacy measures included selected subtests of the Psycholinguistic&#xD;
           Assessment of Language Processing in Aphasia that examined phonological and&#xD;
           lexical-semantic domains and the Stroke Aphasia Depression Questionnaire.&#xD;
