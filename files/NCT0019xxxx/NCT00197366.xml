  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that treatment of HIV-positive women with antiretroviral medication during&#xD;
      pregnancy reduces the risk of HIV transmission to the child. However, such treatment could&#xD;
      lead to the selection of resistant virus strains in the mother. The object of this study is&#xD;
      to check HIV+ pregnant women for resistance mutations in HIV before and after the&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy they receive during pregnancy. HIV-positive newborns will also be&#xD;
      tested, to see if a resistant virus strain was transmitted from mother to child.&#xD;

      The project will be performed in collaboration with the Israeli National HIV Reference Center&#xD;
      Laboratory, which maintains a national bank of HIV-positive blood samples, and with HIV/AIDS&#xD;
      treatment centers located throughout Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial survey will identify retrospectively those HIV+ women who were given&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy while pregnant and stopped treatment after delivery. The list of HIV+&#xD;
      deliveries over the past five years in each participating hospital will be reviewed, and all&#xD;
      HIV-positive women who received antiretroviral treatment during pregnancy will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study project. Women who are currently pregnant, or become pregnant during&#xD;
      the study, will be invited to participate when pregnancy is diagnosed. After obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent, two blood samples will be obtained: one before the initiation of perinatal&#xD;
      treatment, and the other following delivery. (Due to technical limitations, only samples with&#xD;
      viral loads above 1000 cp/ml can be genotyped. It is expected that HIV loads will rise&#xD;
      following cessation of antiretroviral treatment, and that almost all samples will be eligible&#xD;
      for resistance testing.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, after obtaining maternal informed consent, samples from newborns infected&#xD;
      perinatally with HIV will also be tested for resistance mutations, and these will be compared&#xD;
      with the resistance pattern found in the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples obtained will be tested for genotypic resistance mutations. The results will be&#xD;
      transmitted to the treating physician to assist in choice of antiretroviral therapy for the&#xD;
      women and their children, if needed. The data will also be used to establish a national&#xD;
      database to evaluate and improve existing protocols for perinatal antiretroviral treatment,&#xD;
      and will be used to contribute to international databases of HIV resistance. All resistance&#xD;
      data, except that given to the health care provider(s), will be transmitted without&#xD;
      additional identifying information.&#xD;
