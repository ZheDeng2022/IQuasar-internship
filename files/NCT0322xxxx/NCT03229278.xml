      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of trigriluzole in combination with&#xD;
      nivolumab and pembrolizumab in treating patients with solid malignancies or lymphoma that has&#xD;
      spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Trigriluzole may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread. Giving trigriluzole in combination with nivolumab and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      may work better at treating patients with solid malignancies or lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of trigriluzole in&#xD;
      combination with PD-1 inhibiting antibodies, and to define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      trigriluzole in combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the efficacy of the combination therapy. II. To identify markers of&#xD;
      response to trigriluzole in the tumor microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of trigriluzole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trigriluzole orally (PO) every other day (QOD), twice daily (BID), every&#xD;
      morning (QAM) or every bedtime (QHS) on days -14 to -1. Patients then receive nivolumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes every 2 weeks beginning week 1 and trigriluzole PO QOD,&#xD;
      BID, QAM or QHS. Once the MTD of trigriluzole with nivolumab is identified, patients receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks beginning week 1 and trigriluzole PO.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for up to 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
