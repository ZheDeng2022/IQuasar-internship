  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory rheumatoid disease in France,&#xD;
      affecting 0.3% of the general population. Without effective treatment, the persistent&#xD;
      inflammation causes invalidating pain and joint destruction, leading to major functional&#xD;
      disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological agents have been proposed for patients with RA who have the most severe form of&#xD;
      the disease and that are inadequate responder patients to conventional synthetic&#xD;
      Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). TNF inhibitors (TNFi) are historically&#xD;
      proposed as the first biological DAMRD for inadequate responder patients to csDMARDs. A&#xD;
      diverse therapeutic arsenal has become available in recent years with the development of&#xD;
      non-anti-TNFα drugs whose mechanisms of action are different from the classical TNFi. This&#xD;
      new biotherapy class includes tocilizumab and abatacept, two drugs recently available for&#xD;
      subcutaneous administration that enables ambulatory care for patients who would otherwise&#xD;
      require repeated in-hospital care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of these new treatments in the therapeutic strategy has been emphasized by studies&#xD;
      that demonstrated their efficacy as first-line treatments. However, in clinical practice,&#xD;
      TNFi remain the most common first-line treatment for the majority of patients, non-anti-TNFα&#xD;
      biological agents being reserved for inadequate responder patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In second line, several studies have investigated therapeutic strategies for inadequate&#xD;
      responder patients to TNFi. Current data suggest that it could be wise to change the&#xD;
      therapeutic target after failure of a first-line treatment with TNFi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data about the comparative efficacy of different biologics proposed after failure of a&#xD;
      first-line treatment with TNFi are in progress. Meta-analyses from registries and academic&#xD;
      trials conducted in France and The Netherlands suggest that non-anti-TNFα agents would have&#xD;
      equivalent or superior efficacy compared with a second TNFi. This finding suggests clinicians&#xD;
      to switch for an alternate therapeutic target after failure of a first-line TNFi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data comparing different non-anti-TNFα biologics in inadequate responder patients to TNFi are&#xD;
      scare. Industrial trials have demonstrated sustained biological efficacy of non-anti-TNFα&#xD;
      biologics after failure of a TNFi. However, there is very little solid data on the direct&#xD;
      comparison between them.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory rheumatoid disease in France,&#xD;
      affecting 0.3% of the general population. Without effective treatment, the persistent&#xD;
      inflammation causes invalidating pain and joint destruction, leading to major functional&#xD;
      disability as well as progressive structural damage resulting in major joint deformity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biologic agents are taking on an increasingly important role in the management of patients&#xD;
      with an inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs&#xD;
      (csDMARDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological DMARD (bDMARD) therapy consists in the use of monoclonal antibodies or fusion&#xD;
      proteins, administered intravenously or subcutaneously. The earliest developed biologic&#xD;
      agents have been available for more than 15 years. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), a&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokine, was the first cytokine successfully targeted by a biologic agent&#xD;
      for RA treatment. TNF inhibitors (TNFi) are historically proposed as the first bDAMRD for&#xD;
      inadequate responder patients to csDMARDs. More recently non-anti-TNFα drugs have emerged,&#xD;
      with other biological targets such as interleukin-6 receptor (tocilizumab) or B- (rituximab)&#xD;
      and T-lymphocytes (abatacept) that are implicated in the inflammatory response. Initially&#xD;
      administered strictly intravenously, these drugs are now available in formulations adapted to&#xD;
      subcutaneous administration, which allows ambulatory care for patients who otherwise would&#xD;
      require repeated in-hospital care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National and international guidelines, especially those issued in 2013 by the European League&#xD;
      Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and also in 2013 by the French Society of Rheumatology now&#xD;
      recommend first-line treatment not only with TNFi but also with non-anti-TNFα biologic&#xD;
      agents. However, in routine practice, most clinicians preferably prescribe TNFi for the&#xD;
      first-line regimen, reserving non-anti-TNFα drugs to TNFi inadequate responder patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing body of research focusing on first-line biologic agents but there is very&#xD;
      little solid data on the direct randomized comparison between them. Actually, all three of&#xD;
      the published studies have systematically compared a non-anti-TNFα biomedication versus TNFi&#xD;
      (one study with a blinded design and two open studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic strategy that should be adapted after failure of a TNFi regimen has also been&#xD;
      investigated. Those studies favor non-anti-TNF drugs over an alternate TNFi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is adequate evidence of the efficacy of the different non-anti-TNFα biologic agents&#xD;
      versus placebo after TNFi failure. In other hands, industrial trials have not provided any&#xD;
      comparative data between drugs. An academic trial from The Netherlands using medico-economic&#xD;
      performance as the primary outcome found no difference in efficacy between abatacept and&#xD;
      rituximab (a non-anti-TNFα drug administered exclusively intravenously) after failure of a&#xD;
      TNFi. Meta-analyses using data from care networks have not reported any difference between&#xD;
      different non-anti-TNFα drugs after failure of a TNFi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from national registries have provided interesting complementary information since in&#xD;
      everyday practice these agents are generally used after failure of at least one TNFi. The&#xD;
      Danish registry thus suggests that the therapeutic response would be better with tocilizumab&#xD;
      than with abatacept. This observation was confirmed by an analysis of French registries data&#xD;
      presented at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) congress in November 2016 showing&#xD;
      that tocilizumab exhibits superiority for treatment persistence over 2 years. These results&#xD;
      were fully in agreement with the findings of the French ROC trial comparing intravenous&#xD;
      administration of a second anti-TNFα drug versus a non-anti-TNFα agent after failure of an&#xD;
      anti-TNFα drug that suggested a superiority of tocilizumab over abatacept in the subgroup of&#xD;
      patients given a non-anti-TNFα agent. A recent Bayesian network meta-analysis showed better&#xD;
      efficacy in the non-anti-TNFα groups for ACR20 in patients who responded insufficiently to an&#xD;
      anti-TNFα.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subcutaneous formulations have been recently developed for both tocilizumab and abatacept.&#xD;
      Subcutaneous administration is important because it enables ambulatory care for a substantial&#xD;
      number of patients who to date are recurrently hospitalized in day-care units for their&#xD;
      intravenous infusions. Excepting specific situations, the subcutaneous formulation will be&#xD;
      favored for a large majority of patients because of economic as well as practical&#xD;
      considerations. Phase III trials have demonstrated the equivalence of the intravenous versus&#xD;
      subcutaneous routes of administration focusing on efficacy and tolerance. The subcutaneous&#xD;
      formulation is now also available for routine administration of both tocilizumab and&#xD;
      abatacept. Nevertheless, despite large-scale industrial trials on drug equivalence, data&#xD;
      issuing from clinical practice suggest a potential difference in the behavior of these two&#xD;
      formulations which needs to be explored. Rituximab is apart in the treatment strategy because&#xD;
      of its exclusive intravenous administration at spaced intervals and because it is used for&#xD;
      specific patient profiles (extra-articular involvement, history of neoplasia, rheumatoid&#xD;
      factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) positivity). There is no&#xD;
      perspective for the development of a subcutaneous formulation of rituximab for RA patients.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the routine treatment schedule for rituximab (one-time injections at a mean&#xD;
      interval of 9 months) would compromise comparison, especially short-term comparison, with&#xD;
      other subcutaneous treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings illustrate the need for a new multicentric, prospective, randomized trial&#xD;
      designed to demonstrate the superiority of tocilizumab over abatacept in patients exhibiting&#xD;
      inadequate response to a first anti-TNFα. A direct comparison of subcutaneous formulation is&#xD;
      the need for the promising route of administration for future ambulatory care.&#xD;
