    <textblock>
      Hip replacement surgery is an effective option for treating pain and functional impairment in&#xD;
      chronic hip conditions. Various surgical approaches have been developed to expose the hip&#xD;
      joint for the procedure, each with advantages and disadvantages. The posterior approach (PA)&#xD;
      to total hip replacement is a commonly used exposure method. This approach involves a large&#xD;
      incision and requires multiple cuts through muscle and other soft tissues to expose the hip&#xD;
      joint. Despite excellent outcomes, the PA is known to have an increased rate of dislocation&#xD;
      compared to other exposures. The direct superior (DS) approach has been developed to improve&#xD;
      the PA by decreasing the amount of soft tissue injury at the time of surgery and improving&#xD;
      postoperative stability. The DS approach involves a much shorter incision and reduces the&#xD;
      need to damage as much soft tissues surrounding the hip joint during exposure. Specialized&#xD;
      equipment developed for this technique allows the surgeon to place the hip replacement&#xD;
      components. The proposed research study is designed to address a deficit in knowledge&#xD;
      regarding outcomes on patients who have had a DS approach for total hip arthroplasty. This&#xD;
      study will provide much needed insight into the advantages and disadvantages of the DS&#xD;
      approach as compared to PA for total hip arthroplasty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the health status and functional outcomes&#xD;
      of patients who have undergone total hip arthroplasty (THA) utilizing the direct superior&#xD;
      (DS) approach to those who have undergone THA utilizing the posterior approach (PA). The aim&#xD;
      is to quantify changes in functional status using accelerometer-based gait analysis and&#xD;
      self-reported questionnaires, and to assess peri-operative recovery including narcotic use,&#xD;
      length of stay, blood loss, complications and readmission for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that patients who undergo THA utilizing the DS approach will have more&#xD;
      favorable results in terms of health status and functional outcomes when compared to those&#xD;
      who receive the PA approach. It is expected that patients in the DS group will display an&#xD;
      earlier improvement in gait postoperatively, will have a shorter length of stay in hospital,&#xD;
      and will have decreased postoperative pain as measured by narcotic use. No measurable&#xD;
      difference in the position of the THA implants is expected between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed clinical study is a prospective randomized trial of 80 patients undergoing total&#xD;
      hip arthroplasty utilizing either a PA or DS approach. Postoperative outcomes including&#xD;
      narcotic use, length of stay and complications will be abstracted from the chart and any&#xD;
      readmissions will be documented. Follow-up exams will occur at 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months&#xD;
      and 24 months from time of surgery. Radiographic evaluation will be performed at each&#xD;
      interval to assess the position of the implants. Gait symmetry data will be collected&#xD;
      pre-operatively as well as at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months and will be assessed for&#xD;
      longitudinal changes in characteristics such as stride frequency, envelope, surge, lurch and&#xD;
      functional leg length discrepancy. Health status, functional outcome, and patient quality of&#xD;
      life measures will be recorded at all follow-up intervals. Joint function will be assessed&#xD;
      before and after surgery using the EuroQol questionnaire, Oxford 12 Hip questionnaire,&#xD;
      Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire (SCQ), visual analogue scales (VAS) for pain and&#xD;
      satisfaction, and UCLA Activity Level Scale. Rates of infection, instability and revision for&#xD;
      any cause will be monitored for the duration of the 2 year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative subject characteristics will be compared between groups using Student's t-tests&#xD;
      (unpaired, two-sided). For the post-operative follow-up questionnaire and radiographic data,&#xD;
      two-way repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) for group differences will be used to&#xD;
      analyze data collected at multiple time points. Gait data will be analyzed using Gaitview&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
