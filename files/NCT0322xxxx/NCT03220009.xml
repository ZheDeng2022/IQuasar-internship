    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well nivolumab or expectant observation following&#xD;
      ipilimumab, nivolumab, and surgery work in treating patients with high-risk mucosal melanoma&#xD;
      that is restricted to the site of origin without evidence of spread, has spread to a local&#xD;
      and regional area of the body, or has come back. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Sometimes the&#xD;
      mucosal melanoma may not need more treatment until it progresses. In this case, observation&#xD;
      may be sufficient. It is not known if nivolumab or expectant observation following&#xD;
      ipilimumab, nivolumab, and surgery may be better in treating patients with mucosal melanoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Recurrence free survival (RFS) in patients with mucosal melanoma (MM) treated with&#xD;
      neoadjuvant ipilimumab plus nivolumab and surgery followed by adjuvant nivolumab and&#xD;
      expectant observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Pathologic complete response with neoadjuvant ipilimumab plus nivolumab. II. Distant&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival (DRFS) with adjuvant nivolumab and expectant observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Overall survival (OS) with adjuvant nivolumab and expectant observation. IV.&#xD;
      Safety/toxicity as measured by maximum grade adverse event in (a) the neoadjuvant setting,&#xD;
      (b) the adjuvant nivolumab cohort after randomization, and (c) the observation cohort after&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Rate of delayed primary surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Demonstrate that baseline tumors harboring a higher neoepitope burden have superior median&#xD;
      RFS than those who have a lower neoepitope burden in the arm receiving adjuvant nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Demonstrate that tumors with higher CD8+ infiltration at the tumor invasive margin at&#xD;
      surgical resection have superior median RFS than those with lower CD8+ infiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Demonstrate that tumors harboring a &quot;T cell inflamed&quot; ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression&#xD;
      signature at surgical resection following neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab have a&#xD;
      superior distant RFS than those harboring a &quot;non-T cell inflamed&quot; signature, both in the&#xD;
      overall group and within those who receive adjuvant nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Identify recurrent genetic alterations at baseline that are associated with higher&#xD;
      CD8+/PD1+ infiltration at baseline and following 1 dose of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus&#xD;
      ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Tumor response rate will be estimated based on patients whose imaging are captured and&#xD;
      submitted during the neo-adjuvant portion of the study (imaging is not required).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and ipilimumab IV over&#xD;
      30 minutes on day 1. Within 3-6 weeks after receiving nivolumab and ipilimumab, patients&#xD;
      undergo surgery per standard of care. Within 84 days of last surgical resection, patients may&#xD;
      also undergo adjuvant radiation therapy (RT), if clinically appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART II: Within 84 days of last surgical resection, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo active surveillance for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes once every 2 weeks for 4 doses.&#xD;
      Patients then continue to receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes once every 4 weeks for up to&#xD;
      11 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 90 days for 2 years,&#xD;
      every 180 days for 3 years or until disease progression, whichever is first, and every 6&#xD;
      months thereafter until a maximum of 5 years following registration.&#xD;

          -  Surgical resection of all gross disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  This assessment will be made by the local investigator based on review of the&#xD;
                  operative report, pathology results, and/or radiology reports; microscopically&#xD;
                  positive margins (e.g. R1 resection) are permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completion of PD-L1 testing&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients will be stratified as PD-L1 &gt;= 5% versus (vs) &lt; 5% OR inevaluable;&#xD;
                  baseline tumor will be utilized; if this returns inevaluable, efforts should be&#xD;
                  made to utilize the resected specimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Randomization within 112 days of completion of surgical&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The primary region must be included on cross-sectional imaging (e.g. sinus/neck&#xD;
                  if arising from sinonasal primary; pelvis if genitourinary); radiographic changes&#xD;
                  considered nonspecific or possibly due to surgery or radiation are not considered&#xD;
                  evidence of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No significant immune-related adverse event due to the nivolumab plus ipilimumab dose&#xD;
             received in the neoadjuvant setting, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any grade myocarditis, including an asymptomatic troponin elevation felt to be&#xD;
                  related to nivolumab plus ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any grade neurologic complication (e.g. meningitis, encephalitis, neuropathy);&#xD;
                  study chair should be contacted if there is any question whether an adverse event&#xD;
                  (AE) was neurologic in nature&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Grade 2 or higher pneumonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Grade 2 colitis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Grade 2 or higher anemia (due to drug; unrelated anemia is not exclusionary)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Thyroid/adrenal AEs regardless of grade that have stabilized or are clinically&#xD;
                  asymptomatic are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fatigue, regardless of grade, is not a contraindication to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Grade 4 AST or ALT elevation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Asymptomatic elevated amylase and lipase, regardless of grade, are not&#xD;
                  contraindications to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Grade 4 rash; grade 3 rash is not a contraindication to randomization; any&#xD;
                  oropharyngeal lesions or bullous skin lesions that are suggestive of toxic&#xD;
                  epidermal necrolysis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome are contraindications to&#xD;
                  randomization regardless of the grade of rash&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  If not specified above, other Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
                       (CTCAE) grade 3 or higher AEs deemed possibly related to the nivolumab plus&#xD;
                       ipilimumab are exclusions to randomization; AEs that were attributable to&#xD;
                       surgery or adjuvant RT would not be contraindications to randomization&#xD;
