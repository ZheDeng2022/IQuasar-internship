    <textblock>
      This proposal relates to the testing of several specific hypotheses in a subset of 500&#xD;
      participants in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study. These 500&#xD;
      now have complete data from the time of recruitment (in pregnancy) to age 1 year. The primary&#xD;
      purpose of this proposal is to identify risk factors for early allergic outcomes and&#xD;
      biomarkers that may predict future disease. These 500 infants will provide critical&#xD;
      preliminary data, not only related to early outcomes, but also to inform analytical plans for&#xD;
      the full CHILD cohort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of Project 500 is to carefully analyze a complete set of multiple clinical and&#xD;
      environmental questionnaires and selected infant biological samples pertinent to early&#xD;
      clinical outcomes (up to age 1 year). The primary clinical outcomes are recurrent episodes of&#xD;
      wheezing and development of atopy by age 1 year. Atopy is defined by skin allergen responses.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include atopic dermatitis or eczema, and reported food allergy. The&#xD;
      investigators propose detailed exploration of patterns of clinical illnesses and will&#xD;
      correlate these with analysis of multiple biomarkers to determine their predictive power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is good evidence from longitudinal epidemiological studies and from clinical trials&#xD;
      that allergy is both a common precursor to childhood asthma and also a predictor of&#xD;
      persistence of childhood asthma into adulthood. The &quot;atopic march&quot; is a well recognized&#xD;
      phenomenon in which children develop atopic dermatitis and/or food allergy in early&#xD;
      childhood, and then go on to have recurrent wheezing and persistent atopic asthma in later&#xD;
      childhood and adulthood. The selection of specific hypotheses for examination in Project 500&#xD;
      reflects this phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four specific hypotheses will be tested in &quot;Project 500&quot;:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Maternal diet in pregnancy influences food sensitization in infancy; specifically&#xD;
           avoidance of foods (e.g. peanuts) is associated with intolerance to that food.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Research on diet and interventions to prevent atopic disease have focused on foods with&#xD;
           anti-inflammatory properties (e.g. n-3 fatty acids), antioxidants (vitamin E and zinc),&#xD;
           and vitamin D. Recent meta-analyses suggest beneficial effects for pre-natal vitamins A,&#xD;
           D, and E, zinc, fruits and vegetables, and the Mediterranean diet. Nutrients may impact&#xD;
           development of asthma through immune modulation or the child's intestinal microbiome. In&#xD;
           spite of, or possibly because of, recommendations for early life avoidance of specific&#xD;
           'highly allergenic' foods including peanut in the 1990s from many national expert&#xD;
           organizations (e.g. Canadian and British Pediatric Societies, American Academy of&#xD;
           Pediatrics) there has been an explosion of food allergy, particularly to peanut in most&#xD;
           high income countries (Miles and Buttriss, Nutrition Bulletin 2010). Intriguingly,&#xD;
           studies have shown a very low prevalence of peanut allergy in Israel where peanut is&#xD;
           commonly introduced in the first year of life compared with England where it is seldom&#xD;
           introduced before the first birthday. This study accounted for a general heritable risk&#xD;
           using children from a similar background (Ashkenazi Jewish) in both countries. (DuToit&#xD;
           et al, JACI 2008). In the Danish National Birth Cohort maternal peanut (RR: 0.66; 95%&#xD;
           CI: 0.44-0.98) and tree nut (RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.70-1.00) intake during pregnancy was&#xD;
           associated with decreased risk of asthma in the child at 18 months of age. Intriguingly,&#xD;
           there was no comment on the development of allergy in this cohort. The data being&#xD;
           collected in the CHILD Study will allow the investigators to examine the link between&#xD;
           maternal intake of specific foods such as peanut and the outcome of allergy to that food&#xD;
           in the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values in infancy are associated with development of early&#xD;
           childhood wheezing. Most, but not all, studies have demonstrated a relationship of&#xD;
           maternal vitamin D insufficiency with wheezing in pre-school children. A meta-analysis&#xD;
           of four large cohort studies found that high maternal vitamin D intake during pregnancy&#xD;
           was protective against wheeze in children. However, a recent publication from the ALSPAC&#xD;
           cohort shows an association of increased wheeze with increased vitamin D levels. One&#xD;
           issue may well be polymorphisms of the Vitamin D receptor in the mother (associated with&#xD;
           vitamin D levels during pregnancy) and in their offspring during the few years of life.&#xD;
           The data obtained in the CHILD Study will provide the opportunity to confirm or negate&#xD;
           the associations between levels of vitamin D and wheezing syndromes in early childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sensitization to cow's milk, egg or peanut, together or separately, at 1 year is a major&#xD;
           risk factor for wheezing episodes in early infancy. Sensitization to foods has been&#xD;
           associated with an increased risk for asthma (Rhodes et al, J Allergy Clin Immunol.&#xD;
           2001;108:720-5 and has recently been included in a modified Asthma Predictive Index&#xD;
           (mAPI) (NEJM 2006;354:1985-97). The mAPI and an m2API have been validated in a small&#xD;
           cohort as good predictors for persistent asthma at school age (Chang T et al, J Allergy&#xD;
           Clin Immunol: In Practice 2013; 1:152-156). As yet unpublished data from a Canadian&#xD;
           cohort show a substantial increased risk (OR 8-10) of persistent asthma in children with&#xD;
           sensitization to a food in the first year of life (verbal communication, Becker A). The&#xD;
           investigators will be able, using CHILD Study data, to examine these early life&#xD;
           sensitization patterns in relation to the occurrence of wheezing episodes, and not only&#xD;
           determine immediate relationships but also follow the children for several years to&#xD;
           validate (or not) the Asthma Predictive Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Exposures to oxidizing agents in the prenatal period and during the first 3 months of&#xD;
           life influence the development of atopy and wheeze at 1 year. Infants raised in Canada&#xD;
           spend a large majority of time indoors at home. Multiple indoor air exposures have been&#xD;
           associated with wheeze and asthma, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) being the most&#xD;
           widely recognized. Oxides of nitrogen, associated with gas cooking and heating, are&#xD;
           linked with worsening asthma. Innate immune inflammatory response can be activated by&#xD;
           common indoor exposures, including trichloramines, aldehydes (e.g., formaldehyde) and&#xD;
           other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in home furnishings and cleaning products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies suggest that early-life exposure to ambient air pollution may also contribute&#xD;
      to the development of asthma, with traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) likely playing an&#xD;
      important role. TRAP represents a complex mixture of pollutants (particulate matter, nitrogen&#xD;
      oxides, carbon monoxide, organic compounds) in concentrations that are variable over short&#xD;
      distances, but that also build-up over parts of the city contributing to a variable urban&#xD;
      background. Respiratory health risks are generally highest among those living close to busy&#xD;
      roads with significant truck traffic, but concentration variations across urban areas have&#xD;
      also been associated with incident asthma. The effects of TRAP on airways disease likely also&#xD;
      depend on poorly understood interactions with a range of endogenous or exogenous factors such&#xD;
      as genetics, co-exposures such as allergens and environmental tobacco smoke, and psychosocial&#xD;
      stress. The CHILD Study provides an opportunity to study TRAP in four major cities with&#xD;
      highly variable and well-characterized concentrations, and to examine relationships between&#xD;
      TRAP, indoor air contaminants, and development of wheeze and atopy in early childhood with&#xD;
      the intent of following these children through childhood to determine asthma outcomes.&#xD;
