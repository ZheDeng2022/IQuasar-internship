      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug. It is used to treat head and neck squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      (HNSCC) and other cancers. It can cause hearing loss for some people. It is not known how&#xD;
      many people will get hearing loss from cisplatin. It is also not known what other factors&#xD;
      might influence who gets hearing loss. Factors could include age, sex, noise exposure, and&#xD;
      other drugs the person is taking. Statins are drugs used to lower cholesterol. Statins may&#xD;
      also reduce cisplatin-induced hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if statins reduce hearing loss in people getting cisplatin therapy to treat HNSCC. To&#xD;
      find out how many people taking cisplatin get hearing loss from it. To find out if other&#xD;
      factors might influence whether cisplatin causes hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who are getting treatment with cisplatin for HNSCC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 3 visits. These will be before the onset of cisplatin therapy, at&#xD;
      about 4 weeks after they finish therapy, and about 6 months after they finish therapy. Each&#xD;
      visit will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audiogram/hearing tests. Participants will wear headphones and indicate when they hear&#xD;
      different sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about their noise exposure history and whether they have ringing in the ears&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary: Determine whether head and neck cancer patients taking statin drugs for&#xD;
           hyperlipidemia are at decreased risk of cisplatin-induced hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary: Determine the incidence and severity of hearing loss in head and neck cancer&#xD;
           patients undergoing low-dose, weekly cisplatin chemotherapy with concurrent radiation.&#xD;
           Hearing loss with this more recent cisplatin regimen has not been thoroughly evaluated&#xD;
           in the literature. Examine whether age, gender, pre-existing hearing loss, other&#xD;
           medications, or comorbid medical conditions may be risk factors for cisplatin-induced&#xD;
           hearing loss and/or the acquisition or progression of tinnitus in this patient&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Subjects will be adult patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of the upper&#xD;
      aerodigestive tract who will undergo cisplatin chemotherapy with concurrent radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observational study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  334 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will complete a questionnaire to estimate the degree of prior noise exposure&#xD;
           and impact on baseline hearing. Information on medical comorbidities, names and doses of&#xD;
           current medications will be obtained from the medical record and verified at each&#xD;
           subject visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will complete self-administered audiograms using FDA-approved software from&#xD;
           SHOEBOXTM Audiometry on a portable tablet (iPad) computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Audiograms will be completed prior to commencing chemoradiation, within 4 weeks of&#xD;
           completing treatment, and 6 months after completing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will also complete a validated tinnitus questionnaire with each audiogram. A&#xD;
           noise exposure history will be collected during the initial study visit and verified&#xD;
           during subsequent visits. Any indicated changes to the subject s noise exposure history&#xD;
           will be added to record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No investigational or experimental therapy will be given as part of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Audiograms will be performed at the Johns Hopkins Suburban Outpatient Center or the NIH&#xD;
           Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two interim analyses will be conducted prior to study completion (after N=88 and N=176&#xD;
           subjects completing the protocol) to determine whether there are statistically&#xD;
           significant differences in severity or incidence of hearing loss in subjects taking&#xD;
           concurrent statin drugs vs. subjects who are not taking statin drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary outcome measure: The primary outcome measure is the change in hearing&#xD;
           sensitivity (as measured by the self-administered audiogram) between the pre-treatment&#xD;
           (before cisplatin therapy) hearing test and the post-treatment (after completion of&#xD;
           cisplatin therapy) audiogram. Hearing loss will be defined according to TUNE and ASHA&#xD;
           criteria and will be compared in subjects taking statin drugs vs. subjects not taking&#xD;
           statin drugs. Hearing status will be compared between audiograms collected at baseline&#xD;
           (prior to treatment) to a repeated audiogram at the end of treatment (within 4 weeks of&#xD;
           cisplatin protocol cessation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary outcome measure: Secondary outcome measures include 1) changes in hearing&#xD;
           sensitivity between the first post-cisplatin audiogram and the second post-cisplatin&#xD;
           audiogram, and 2) changes in scores on the tinnitus questionnaire between the&#xD;
           pre-treatment audiogram and the two post-treatment audiograms.&#xD;
