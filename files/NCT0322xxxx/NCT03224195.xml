    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore the patient experience of acute rehabilitation after hip&#xD;
      fracture surgery. We also aim to identify patient perceived barriers to rehabilitation and&#xD;
      recovery after hip fracture surgery. More specifically, the objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. describe the rehabilitation experience of patients who underwent hip fracture surgery&#xD;
           with respect to the frequency, intensity, type, and timing of rehabilitation and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. identify patient perceived barriers to rehabilitation and recovery related to the&#xD;
           patient, their injury and their health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this qualitative study will inform a future feasibility cluster randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial aimed at optimising acute rehabilitation after hip fracture surgery. The&#xD;
      findings will help to strengthen the patient and carergiver centred approach when developing&#xD;
      the intervention to optimise rehabilitation and potentially improve outcomes after hip&#xD;
      fracture surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year, UK hospitals admit 75,000 older men and women with fracture of the hip. The injury&#xD;
      has been dubbed the &quot;hip attack&quot;, due to its clinical severity and adverse consequences. In&#xD;
      fact, hip fracture is one of the most detrimental events in an older adult's life. Even with&#xD;
      treatment, 30% of patients die within a year.Among survivors, 25% never walk again, and 22%&#xD;
      transition from independent living to long-term care. Further, up to one third of patients&#xD;
      develop new-onset depressive symptoms post fracture. Many fear admission to a nursing home,&#xD;
      in fact a recent study noted that 80% would rather be dead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most hip fractures are treated surgically with the goals of reducing pain and re-establishing&#xD;
      mobility. Allied health professionals develop rehabilitation interventions targeting the&#xD;
      frequency, intensity, type and timing of rehabilitation to improve survival, recovery and&#xD;
      quality of life after hip fracture surgery. Evaluation of these interventions rarely offer&#xD;
      insight into the patient and caregiver experience. This insight is essential to determine&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and ultimately adherence to a new rehabilitation intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an example, clinicians and researchers suggest the timing of mobilisation will reduce&#xD;
      complications and improve recovery after hip fracture surgery, particularly among older&#xD;
      patients. The evidence to support these claims is inconsistent. Further, there is limited&#xD;
      understanding of the patient experience of early mobilisation after hip fracture surgery.&#xD;
      Indeed, for some patients the experience may be improved with a delay to first mobilisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maximise adherence, it is important to also gauge patient's perceptions of perceived&#xD;
      barriers to rehabilitation and recovery after hip fracture surgery. These barriers may&#xD;
      present in the form of patient characteristics such as motivation. Alternatively, they may&#xD;
      present in the form of injury characteristics such as perceived injury severity. Lastly,&#xD;
      patient's may perceive healthcare barriers to rehabilitation such as perceived benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN AND METHODS Design Qualitative study. Semi-structured interview The research assistant&#xD;
      will first collect participant demographics - age, sex, previous functional status, previous&#xD;
      place of residence - home or long-term care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then complete a semi-structured face-to-face interview delivered by a&#xD;
      research assistant. The interview will be on an interview topic guide comprised of 3 core&#xD;
      topics related to our aims. The questions are flexible, open-ended and broad, while focused&#xD;
      on the topic to elicit rich responses from participants. The interviews will explore the&#xD;
      experiences of patients who underwent rehabilitation after hip fracture surgery. Each&#xD;
      semi-structured interview will last 30-45 minutes and will be recorded with an audio&#xD;
      recorder. The research assistant will take reflective field notes to assist interpretation of&#xD;
      the interview data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data preparation Participant demographics (age, sex, previous functional status, previous&#xD;
      place of residence - home or long-term-care) and field notes will be entered into a Microsoft&#xD;
      Excel Spreadsheet on a secure controlled access server at Kings College London on the same&#xD;
      day as the interview by the research assistant. This server is accessible only to staff at&#xD;
      Kings College London. The data will be password-protected and accessible only to the research&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recording of semi-structured interviews will be downloaded onto the secure server on the same&#xD;
      day as the interview by the research assistant. Recordings will then be permanently deleted&#xD;
      from the voice recorder. Interviews will be transcribed verbatim into Microsoft Word&#xD;
      documents on the server by the research assistant. Transcripts will then be checked by a&#xD;
      Kings College London supervisor, de-identified (by removal of names/locations) and uploaded&#xD;
      into the NVivo software. On completion of the transcription the audio recordings will be&#xD;
      deleted permanently from the server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spreadsheet and transcriptions will be archived on the secure controlled access server&#xD;
      for 3 years to allow for analysis, journal submission, response to reviewer's comments, and&#xD;
      publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis The resulting data will be open coded and thematically analysed using a constant&#xD;
      comparative approach with the software package NVivo. Analysis will take place iteratively&#xD;
      throughout the project with ongoing coding completed to identify themes and subthemes as they&#xD;
      emerge. This will entail the identification of common themes in the data through the reading&#xD;
      and re-reading of transcripts first for a descriptive and then an analytic account. Matrices&#xD;
      will be used to compare the occurrence of themes across participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon writing materials for publication, anonymized quotations from the data set will be used&#xD;
      to support and illustrate the emergent themes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting George Perkins Ward (trauma orthopaedics), St Thomas's Hospital. The interview will&#xD;
      take place in a confidential, private room on the Ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size We will recruit 20 participants. We based the sample size on qualitative analysis&#xD;
      sample size recommendations. Further, a recent Canadian qualitative study on patient&#xD;
      perspective to guide recovery reached data saturation with no new themes emerging after 19&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample technique We will use purposeful-criterion sampling to recruit participants. The first&#xD;
      20 patients/caregivers admitted to George Perkins Ward, St Thomas's Hospital who meet&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria and give informed consent to participate will be included.&#xD;
      We chose criterion sampling as we have a predetermined criterion of importance (i.e. adults&#xD;
      (and their caregivers) who sustained hip fractures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of potential participants A member of the clinical team will identify&#xD;
      potential participants at the daily multidisciplinary team handover on George Perkins ward,&#xD;
      Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. During handover, each patient case is discussed&#xD;
      including admitting diagnosis, surgery, Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS), functional&#xD;
      status, caregiver involvement, and any communication difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the research team not involved in direct clinical care will be notified by the&#xD;
      clinical team of potential participants on attendance at George Perkins Ward. The member of&#xD;
      the research team not involved in direct clinical care will then complete the recruitment and&#xD;
      consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Consent We will adopt a previous published recruitment strategy developed by&#xD;
      the Warwick Hip Trauma Evaluation. As part of usual care patients are assessed for capacity&#xD;
      to consent using the 10-item AMTS preoperatively. A score below 8 suggests cognitive&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those with a score of 8 or more will be approached in hospital after their hip fracture&#xD;
      surgery. They (and their caregiver) will be provided with an information sheet and given the&#xD;
      opportunity to ask questions. At least 24 hours later they will be given the opportunity to&#xD;
      ask any additional questions, and if they wish to take part, to provide written consent.&#xD;
      Caregivers who participate will also sign a consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On approach, potential participants and their caregiver will be invited to take part in the&#xD;
      study. They will be provided with an information sheet and given the opportunity to ask&#xD;
      questions. At least 24 hours later they will be given the opportunity to ask any additional&#xD;
      questions, and if they wish to take part, will sign an agreement form and we will aim to&#xD;
      interview a caregiver as well as the patient (patient/carer dyad). Caregivers who participate&#xD;
      will also sign a consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant declines to participate, we will record the reason offered.&#xD;
