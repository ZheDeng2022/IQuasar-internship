  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a life-long inflammatory bowel disease disease with an unknown&#xD;
      pathogenesis. The ultimate goal of therapy is to modify the natural history of CD thus&#xD;
      reducing complications. Thalidomide is a small molecule with immunomodulatory and&#xD;
      anti-angiogenetic properties. It is currently approved for the treatment of erythema nodosum&#xD;
      leprosum, an immunological complication of leprosy and multiple myeloma. It has also been&#xD;
      used in several other inflammatory diseases of the skin and of the mucosal membranes, such as&#xD;
      Behcet disease, oropharyngeal ulcers in AIDS, cutaneous lupus, and graft versus host disease.&#xD;
      Many case series and one pediatric randomized controlled trial proved the efficacy of&#xD;
      thalidomide in the treatment of children with CD refractory to standard treatments. In these&#xD;
      patients, clinical remission was achieved in about 50% of the cases and was maintained for a&#xD;
      mean time superior of 3 years. Mucosal healing after 52 weeks of treatment was observed in&#xD;
      40% of the patients in clinical remission. Moreover, thalidomide was found to have a&#xD;
      steroid-sparing effect and to decrease the need for surgical interventions. The clinical and&#xD;
      endoscopic efficacy of thalidomide was also observed in children with failure to respond or&#xD;
      intolerance to anti-TNF biological drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this multicentric prospective randomized controlled is to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of thalidomide vs infliximab in changing the natural history of CD in patients&#xD;
      with poor prognostic outcome. Moreover, the study will evaluate the immunological and&#xD;
      genetical mechanisms of CD, the mechanisms of action thalidomide in CD and will the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, metabolomics and pharmacogenomics of thalidomide, and their impact on&#xD;
      thalidomide safety and effectiveness.&#xD;
