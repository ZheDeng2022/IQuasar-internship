  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is associated with numerous complications. Hence,&#xD;
      patients should be weaned from the ventilator as early as possible. A number of randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials have addressed whether noninvasive ventilation (NIV) can facilitate weaning&#xD;
      in patients failing spontaneous breathing trials (SBT)s. Compared to invasive weaning, NIV&#xD;
      weaning strategy showed reduced mortality, greater weaning success, less&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia, shorter length of ICU and hospital stay and less&#xD;
      re-intubation rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the previous studies used pressure support ventilation with fixed pressure support,&#xD;
      but no studies published on hybrid NIV modes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intelligent Volume Assured Pressure Support (iVAPS) is a recent NIV mode, which achieves a&#xD;
      target alveolar ventilation by adjusting pressure support and respiratory rate automatically.&#xD;
      In iVAPS, the target is alveolar ventilation not the tidal volume, taking into account a&#xD;
      predicted dead space . This new mode has been investigated in stable chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with domiciliary NIV and it was comparable to pressure&#xD;
      support ventilation (PSV) regarding improvement in oxygenation, carbon dioxide (CO2) wash and&#xD;
      therapy compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet, less numerous studies have been performed on this mode when used for acute respiratory&#xD;
      failure. These studies found that i-VAPS was comparable to PSV as regards PaCO2 and pH&#xD;
      improvements, minute volume, pressure support and respiratory rate. No published data so far&#xD;
      about the role of i-VAPS as a weaning mode in mechanically ventilated patients. So, this&#xD;
      study aims to investigate this new mode in comparison to the standard S/T mode in weaning&#xD;
      COPD patients using NIV.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is associated with numerous complications. Hence,&#xD;
      patients should be weaned from the ventilator as early as possible . Approximately 25% and&#xD;
      (14-22) % of mechanically ventilated patients experience difficult and prolonged weaning&#xD;
      respectively. A number of randomized controlled trials have addressed whether NIV can&#xD;
      facilitate weaning in patients failing SBTs. The most recent systemic review included 16&#xD;
      trials -mainly COPD patients- found that patients weaned with NIV had reduced mortality,&#xD;
      greater weaning success, less ventilator-associated pneumonia, shorter length of ICU and&#xD;
      hospital stay and less reintubation rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the previous studies used pressure support ventilation with fixed pressure support,&#xD;
      but no studies published on hybrid NIV modes. Intelligent Volume Assured Pressure Support&#xD;
      (iVAPS) is a recent NIV mode, which achieves a target alveolar volume by adjusting pressure&#xD;
      and respiratory rate automatically. In iVAPS, the target is alveolar ventilation not the&#xD;
      tidal volume. taking into account a predicted dead space. This new mode has been investigated&#xD;
      in stable COPD patients with domiciliary NIV and it was comparable to pressure support&#xD;
      ventilation (PSV) regarding improvement in oxygenation, CO2 wash and therapy compliance.&#xD;
      Other studies focused on sleep quality and found that iVAPS was comparable to PSV regarding&#xD;
      sleep quality, arousal, O2 de-saturation index, increase in therapy adherence and decrease in&#xD;
      median PS needed with iVAPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet, less numerous studies have been performed on this mode when used for acute respiratory&#xD;
      failure. These studies investigated the outcomes in acute hypercapnic respiratory failure and&#xD;
      found that iVAPS was comparable to PSV as regards PaCO2 and logarithm of hydrogen ion&#xD;
      concentration (pH) improvements, minute volume, pressure support and respiratory rate. No&#xD;
      published data about the role of iVAPS as a weaning mode in mechanically ventilated patients.&#xD;

A) Extubation to NIV: SBT will be attempted once the patients achieve stability regarding clinical, neurological and biochemical parameters.Failure of SBT is considered if:pH &lt; 7.35,PaCO2 &gt; 15-20% increase above baseline,PaO2 &lt; 50 mmHg.Heart rate &gt; 100 bpm or respiratory rate &gt; 35 cycle/min.&#xD;

B) The patients will be randomized to receive NIV using either ST or iVAPS mode.&#xD;
C) The patients will be categorized in analysis into 3 groups,Group I: Simple weaning ,Group II: Difficult weaning and Group III: Prolonged weaning.&#xD;
-The following parameters will be recorded for the patients at the beginning of the study and at 1, 2, 12, 24 and 48 hours after initiation of NIV therapy:GCS,Vital signs (HR, SBP&amp; DBP,RR), ABG analysis and Patient's comfort.</intervention_model_description>
