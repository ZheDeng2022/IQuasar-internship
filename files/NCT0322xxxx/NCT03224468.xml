      This study will use a randomized controlled design to test whether patients who use medical&#xD;
      marijuana, compared to a waitlist control group, experience a change in health outcomes&#xD;
      (relief of symptoms, or adverse health outcomes such as new-onset symptoms of cannabis use&#xD;
      disorders, neurocognitive impairments) or brain-based changes.&#xD;

      This trial is a randomized, longitudinal study of medical marijuana (MM) that will: (1)&#xD;
      characterize the impact of MM on indices of addiction, such as CUD, escalation of use,&#xD;
      tolerance, and withdrawal among those who stop using, (2) assess, via dosing diaries, the&#xD;
      effect of MM use patterns on use of other medications, and perception of underlying disease&#xD;
      symptomatology, (3) characterize the impact of MM on neurocognitive performance, including&#xD;
      executive function, memory, attention, and decision-making and (4) examine evidence for&#xD;
      impact of MM on brain structure and function. This study will enroll 200 adults with no prior&#xD;
      history of CUD or heavy marijuana use, who express interest in using MM to treat pain,&#xD;
      insomnia, anxiety, and/or depression. Participants will be randomly assigned to either an&#xD;
      active MM arm (n = 100), or to a waitlist control arm (WLC) (n = 100). Participants will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline, regularly for 3 months, and at a 6-month and 12-month follow-up for MM&#xD;
      use behaviors, development of CUD, perception of disease symptomatology, and neurocognitive&#xD;
      performance. Urine collected at each visit will be assessed with quantitative assays. MRI&#xD;
      scans will be collected to longitudinally investigate possible brain changes associated with&#xD;
      MM use.&#xD;

             alcohol use is permitted (defined as 16 or less on the AUDIT), and nicotine dependence&#xD;
             is permitted because of the high co-use of nicotine and marijuana. Participants cannot&#xD;
             meet current SCID criteria for a use disorder on any illicit substance other than&#xD;
             nicotine.&#xD;
