      We conduct the clinical trial to further explore the efficacy and safety of Apatinib combined&#xD;
      with chemotherapy in treating recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      after the failure of conventional treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumor and esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma is the main pathological type of esophageal carcinoma in China. Treatment of&#xD;
      recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is usually poor. New treatments&#xD;
      were needed. Apatinib, which was approved by CFDA (China Food and Drug Administration) for&#xD;
      the treatment of advanced gastric cancer, is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It&#xD;
      competes with intracellular VEGFR-2's ATP binding sites highly and selectively, thereby&#xD;
      blocking downstream signaling to achieve the goal of inhibiting neovascularization in tumor&#xD;
      tissue. We have observed in clinical practice that some patients with esophageal squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma have benefited from the treatment of apatinib. So we conduct a phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial to explore the efficacy and safety of Apatinib combined with chemotherapy&#xD;
      (platinum and fluorouracil) in treating recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma after the failure of conventional treatments.&#xD;
