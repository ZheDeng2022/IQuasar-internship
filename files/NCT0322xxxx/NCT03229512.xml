  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin toxicities are a major complication to cancer therapies. They can be painful and limit&#xD;
      the amount of drug that can be received by cancer patients, preventing the patients from&#xD;
      receiving optimal doses of drug. One such cutaneous toxicity, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR),&#xD;
      is caused by next generation targeted agents that are in routine use for the treatment of&#xD;
      kidney and liver cancer. HFSR is characterized by swelling, redness, and pain of the palms&#xD;
      and soles, in addition to the development of painful or thickened callus-like plaques with&#xD;
      fissures in areas of friction and pressure. The investigators have identified a topical&#xD;
      skin-directed therapy, 1% topical sildenafil cream, that the investigators believe will be&#xD;
      useful in preventing and ameliorating this painful, skin side effect associated with the&#xD;
      targeted agents sorafenib and sunitinib. This project proposal aims to conduct an open-label&#xD;
      pilot study to assess whether pre-medication with this cream can be an effective way of&#xD;
      preventing or decreasing the severity of hand-foot skin reaction, improving their quality of&#xD;
      life on therapy and enabling the patients to receive optimal amounts of their anti-cancer&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of topical sildenafil as a pre-treatment&#xD;
      regimen for HFSR in patients naïve to anti-cancer therapy who will be initiated on treatment&#xD;
      with sorafenib or sunitinib. The study endpoint will be the onset and calculated incidence of&#xD;
      any grade of HFSR. Skin toxicity grading per National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v4.03 will be performed by the investigator at each&#xD;
      visit (every 2 weeks) until the end of the study (12 weeks total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether HFSR can be prevented with topical sildenafil as pre-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine whether topical sildenafil can reduce the incidence of HFSR in patients&#xD;
           treated with sorafenib or sunitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine whether topical sildenafil can delay the onset of HFSR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine whether topical sildenafil can reduce the severity of skin lesions if HFSR&#xD;
           does occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population for this study is patients with clinically-diagnosed cancer who will be&#xD;
      treated with sorafenib or sunitinib. A total of 20 subjects will be needed for this trial.&#xD;
      There is no placebo group for this study. Subjects must meet all of the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      and none of the exclusion criteria to be registered to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to apply the treatment cream to both hands and both feet twice a&#xD;
      day for 12 weeks. After the initial visit to enroll and obtain consent, patient assessment&#xD;
      will occur in clinic every 2 weeks. At each clinic visit, a skin toxicity grading per&#xD;
      NCI-CTCAE v4.03 will be performed, any visual skin changes will be documented with&#xD;
      photography, treatment cream will be refilled, and patient medication diaries will be&#xD;
      reviewed. A follow up visit will occur within 30 days of the last study treatment. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators will collect information to ensure compliance with drug therapy&#xD;
      (in the form of a subject medication diary).&#xD;

             are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking Viagra must have a 1 day washout period prior to treatment. Note:&#xD;
             patients must agree to discontinue Viagra while on study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are pregnant or nursing are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have any condition or situation which, in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion, puts the patient at significant risk, could confound the study results, or&#xD;
             may interfere significantly with the patient's participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to communicate or cooperate with the investigator due to&#xD;
             language problems, poor mental development, or impaired cerebral function are not&#xD;
