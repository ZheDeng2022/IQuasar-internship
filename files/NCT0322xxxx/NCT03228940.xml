  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fabry Disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) caused by mutations in&#xD;
      the GLA gene which translates into decreased activity or lack of function of the enzyme&#xD;
      alpha-galactosidase A (α-GAL A) and accumulation of the enzymes substrate, i.e., Gb3,&#xD;
      throughout the body. Cardiovascular and renal complications are among the leading causes of&#xD;
      death in FD patients. RVX000222 is a BET inhibitor which modulates the expression of a&#xD;
      variety of genes and, due to its effects on pathways downstream of substrate accumulation and&#xD;
      reduction of major cardiac events, holds promise as a potential add-on therapy to accompany&#xD;
      enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in FD patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fabry Disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) caused by mutations in&#xD;
      the GLA gene coding for the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (α-GAL A). As a consequence&#xD;
      globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), the enzyme's substrate, is not metabolized efficiently. The&#xD;
      result is progressive accumulation of Gb3 and related glycosphinglolipids, particularly in&#xD;
      blood vessels of the skin, kidney, heart and brain, causing severe complications such as&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy and other cardiovascular related issues, as well&#xD;
      as renal failure and end stage renal disease, ischemic stroke and peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RVX000222 is a BET inhibitor which modulates the expression of a variety of genes; in a&#xD;
      number of Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials RVX000222 significantly affected markers of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase, components of the complement and coagulation cascades, and markers of reverse&#xD;
      cholesterol transport in patients with CVD. Due to its beneficial effects on several pathways&#xD;
      downstream of Gb3 accumulation and MACE reduction, RVX000222 holds promise as a potential&#xD;
      add-on therapy to accompany enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in FD patients. In addition to&#xD;
      regulating disease related pathways, RVX000222 treatment significantly affects putative&#xD;
      markers associated with FD such as Afamin and intercellular and vascular adhesion molecules&#xD;
      in cell cultures.&#xD;
