      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macular degeneration can cause permanent loss of central vision. This vision is important for&#xD;
      seeing details. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in&#xD;
      people over 55 in the United States. Researchers want to follow people with AMD to study the&#xD;
      early to middle stages of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To follow for another 5 years participants who completed NIH study 11-EI-0147.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant was enrolled in and completed study 11-EI-0147.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have at least 6 study visits over 5 years. Each visit takes about 5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 1, participants will be asked about their medical and eye disease history. They will&#xD;
      have an eye exam. The exam will test vision, eye pressure, and eye movements. The pupil will&#xD;
      be dilated with eye drops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have baseline exams. These include a health history and questions about&#xD;
      problems that affect their eyes under different lighting. They will answer these questions&#xD;
      each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, participants will have some or all of these tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dark adaptation protocol. This measures how fast the eyes recover when exposed to decreasing&#xD;
      levels of light. The pupil will be dilated with eye drops. Participants will sit in front of&#xD;
      a metal box with a camera inside. They will push a button when they see a light in the&#xD;
      machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      View a bright background light for 5 minutes. After the light is turned off participants will&#xD;
      push a button when a blue or red light is seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sit in the dark for about 30 minutes. Participants will push a button when they see a blue or&#xD;
      red light.&#xD;

      Objective: The Dark Adaptation Extension study allows us to continue with the follow-up of&#xD;
      participants who were enrolled in the clinical trial, 11-EI-0147, Longitudinal Investigation&#xD;
      of Dark Adaptation in Participants with Age-Related Macular Degeneration, investigating&#xD;
      long-term changes in dark adaptation in participants with a range of age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration severity who have already been characterized and followed under that protocol.&#xD;
      To that aim, correlating structural features (obtained from multimodal imaging) as well as&#xD;
      genetic and systemic factors obtained from biospecimens with functional measures (including&#xD;
      dark adaptation, visual acuity and low luminance) will be done to understand the relationship&#xD;
      of disease relevant factors and to create a model of disease pathogenesis and progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Participants will be recruited from participants already enrolled in&#xD;
      11-EI-0147. Participants will have varying degrees of severity of AMD (Groups 0, 1, 2, 3 and&#xD;
      4). Group 0 (N=40) is defined as participants without AMD meaning no large drusen (&gt;= 125&#xD;
      microns) or advanced AMD in either eye. Group 1 (N=40) is defined as participants with large&#xD;
      drusen (&gt;= 125 microns) in the study eye and no large drusen or advanced AMD (choroidal&#xD;
      neovascularization (CNV) or geographic atrophy (GA)) in the fellow eye. Group 2 (N=40) is&#xD;
      defined as participants with bilateral large drusen (&gt;= 125 microns) with or without retinal&#xD;
      pigment epithelial hypo/hyperpigmentary changes. Group 3 (N=40) is defined as participants&#xD;
      with large drusen (&gt;= 125 microns) in the study eye and advanced AMD (CNV or GA) in the&#xD;
      fellow eye. Group 4 (N=40) is defined as participants with findings of reticular pseudodrusen&#xD;
      (RPD) in the study eye, without advanced AMD in the study eye, and any level of AMD in the&#xD;
      fellow eye. RPD is defined as having (1) the presence of reticular inter-lacing patterns on&#xD;
      at least one en face imaging method (color photography, autofluorescence or infrared) and (2)&#xD;
      confirmation of previously described findings of hyper-reflective material located between&#xD;
      the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the photoreceptor ellipsoid zone on SD OCT in those&#xD;
      areas. Up to 40 diabetic&#xD;
&#xD;
      participants will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a single center, exploratory, observational, longitudinal evaluation of dark&#xD;
      adaptation response in AMD participants who have been followed over five years and will be&#xD;
      followed over an additional five years to determine long-term evaluation of dark adaptometry&#xD;
      (DA) change as a predictor for AMD progression and visual acuity (VA) loss. For the second&#xD;
      five-year study period, participants will have six required study visits (baseline, 12, 24,&#xD;
      36, 48 and 60), continuing on an annual basis following exit from 11-EI-0147, for a total&#xD;
      follow-up period of 11 years across both protocols. The windows surrounding each study visit&#xD;
      will be plus and minus 6 weeks, except for the baseline visit which will be plus and minus 8&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary objective will be to determine mean change, including&#xD;
      distribution of change in dark adaptation response between baseline and months 12, 24 and 48&#xD;
      in participants with varying degree of severity of AMD (Groups 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4). Primary&#xD;
      outcome data collected at Month 48 will be compared to the initial baseline testing done in&#xD;
      11-EI-0147 which will be 10-year data across both protocols. Dark adaptation parameters will&#xD;
      be measured using the AdaptDxTM technology and also using the Medmont dark adaptation&#xD;
      perimeter. The secondary outcomes include the mean change in dark adaptation and other&#xD;
      characteristic parameters of the dark adaptation response from baseline at months 12, 24, 36,&#xD;
      48 and 60 from the two methods, and the mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of&#xD;
      the study eye from baseline and months 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures for the genetic testing and RNA sequencing performed on participants&#xD;
      co-enrolled in the Biobank protocol (12-EI-0042) include the interaction of key parameters of&#xD;
      phenotype (such as visual acuity, dark adaptation, and retinal features on ocular imaging)&#xD;
      with genetic variants and other biomarkers identified from biospecimens, and the&#xD;
      characterization of new experimental models of eye health and disease.&#xD;
