  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a hypothesis driven, open label, single-arm, multiple centers, Phase II trial. The&#xD;
      trial has been designed to prove or disprove whether a rechallenge with panitumumab can&#xD;
      achieve an objective response rate (ORR= CR+PR) of 30% or more in a population of RAS wild&#xD;
      type mCRC patients selected on the basis of RAS extended clonal evolution in their plasma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world and the second leading&#xD;
      cause of cancer death in the United States and the European Union. In the last decade,&#xD;
      substantial advances in the treatment of the metastatic disease (mCRC) have more than doubled&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) from 12 months to 30 months due to the refinement of&#xD;
      fluoropirimidine-based chemotherapy and the introduction of antiangiogenics and targeted&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacologic blockade of the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) with specific&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, namely, cetuximab and panitumumab, represents the mainstay of tumour&#xD;
      targeted therapy for mCRC in patients with tumors not harboring extended RAS pathway&#xD;
      mutations (KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF). Such alterations, which constitutively activate typical EGFR&#xD;
      downstream transducers, have been shown to trigger substitute survival pathways that bypass&#xD;
      therapeutic blockade of EGFR signalling, thus abating the efficacy of anti-EGFR antibodies&#xD;
      (&quot;primary resistance&quot;). Even when response to anti-EGFR therapy occurs in the context of&#xD;
      appropriate molecular selection, acquired (&quot;secondary&quot;) resistance inevitably arises in all&#xD;
      cases. Our group has extensively studied this phenomenon and has shown that extended-RAS&#xD;
      alterations are the principal culprit of anti EGFR acquired resistance, and that altered RAS&#xD;
      clones decay upon anti-EGFR treatment withdrawal, while tumor cells regain sensitivity to&#xD;
      anti EGFR treatment. We have also documented that ctDNA profiles of individuals who benefit&#xD;
      from multiple challenges with anti-EGFR antibodies, exhibit pulsatile levels of mutant KRAS.&#xD;
      Collectively, these results indicate that the CRC genome adapts dynamically to intermittent&#xD;
      anti-EGFR drug schedules, and provide a molecular explanation for the efficacy of&#xD;
      re-challenge therapies based on EGFR blockade. Our results also give experimental support to&#xD;
      the empirical-based clinical benefit observed, following cetuximab or panitumumab rechallenge&#xD;
      in two small series of originally KRAS exon 2 wild type mCRC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to assess the efficacy and safety of re-challenging with panitumumab RAS-extend&#xD;
      wild type mCRC patients with ctDNA-confirmed secondary resistance to anti EGFR treatment,&#xD;
      after progression on second or further lines chemotherapy. As proof-of-concept, patients will&#xD;
      be blood monitored throughout their therapeutic itinerary for the presence of extended-RAS&#xD;
      alterations and EGFR-ectodomain mutations by ctDNA determination (liquid biopsy). We also&#xD;
      include in our ddPCR panel 7 different EGFR extracellular domain (ECD) mutations as they&#xD;
      occur in 15-20% of patients who acquired resistance to anti-EGFR drugs.&#xD;
