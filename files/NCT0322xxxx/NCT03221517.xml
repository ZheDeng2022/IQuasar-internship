      The investigators hypothesize that disruptions to the microbiome of shift-workers represent a&#xD;
      hitherto unexamined factor contributing to disease risk. The investigators will therefore&#xD;
      define time-of-day dependent fluctuations of the microbiome in night shift workers and&#xD;
      matched daytime workers deeply phenotyped for behavioral, clinical, and metabolomic outputs&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Though several epidemiological studies have demonstrated that working night shift schedules&#xD;
      are a risk factor for developing metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, the mechanisms&#xD;
      through which this is conferred is not yet understood. Shift-work schedules alter employee's&#xD;
      patterns of activity, light exposure and dietary intake in a manner incongruent with the&#xD;
      endogenous clock. This circadian clock ensures that our metabolic activity occurs at&#xD;
      maximally beneficial times of the day, but is largely unable to adapt to rapidly shifting&#xD;
      schedules or sustained night-work. In mice, the investigators' lab has previously shown that&#xD;
      genes relevant to all aspects of the metabolic syndrome are subject to circadian oscillation&#xD;
      and that the gut microbiome is also subject to control by the host molecular clock. Despite&#xD;
      the large contribution of our microbiome to host metabolism, the microbiome has been scarcely&#xD;
      studied in the shift-working population. The investigators hypothesize that disruptions to&#xD;
      the microbiome of shift-workers represent a hitherto unexamined factor contributing to&#xD;
      disease risk. The investigators will therefore define time-of-day dependent fluctuations of&#xD;
      the microbiome in night shift workers and matched daytime workers deeply phenotyped for&#xD;
      behavioral, clinical, and metabolomic outputs using integrated remote sensing. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess core body temperature, sleep/activity cycles, cortisol and&#xD;
      melatonin as outputs determined by the host clock, and postprandial glucose and insulin&#xD;
      levels as well as nocturnal blood pressure dipping as risk-related outputs. Through&#xD;
      antibiotic-induced suppression, The investigators will determine the microbiome's specific&#xD;
      contribution to these outputs. This has major implications for refining shift-work schedules&#xD;
      and exploring therapeutic strategies in this population.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate the linear relationships between every pairwise combination of variables in the integrated dataset, the R^2, or coefficient of determination, will be calculated for each pair using linear regression. A heat map of the proportion of variance in each variable (e.g. mobility, light exposure, systolic blood pressure) explained by each other variable will then be constructed to allow an integrative exploration of these data. Here, the advantage is that multiple assessments with different units of measure can be integrated to generate deep phenotypes.</description>
