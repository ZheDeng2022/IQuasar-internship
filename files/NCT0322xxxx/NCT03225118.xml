    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune system helps the body fight off disease. Most people infected with HIV cannot&#xD;
      control the infection and need daily medicine. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) are&#xD;
      drugs taken to prevent HIV infection from damaging the immune system. Researchers want to&#xD;
      study why some people develop resistance to the drugs or have permanent side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the impact of a short-term treatment stop on HIV that persists even while taking&#xD;
      cART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18-65 years old with HIV who are being treated with cART&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will first be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They may&#xD;
           have a chest x-ray. They will have heart, blood, and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the baseline visit, participants will repeat the screening tests except the x-ray.&#xD;
           They will get counseling about HIV and risk behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in one arm.&#xD;
           A machine will separate white blood cells from the rest of the blood. The remainder of&#xD;
           the blood will be returned to the body by a different needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will stop their current treatment on day 0. They will visit the clinic each&#xD;
           week until they meet the criteria to restart cART. These visits will have the same&#xD;
           procedures as the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before restarting cART, most participants will have leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After restart, participants will be seen weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly for about&#xD;
           11 months. Participants will have blood drawn, physical exam, and medical history. They&#xD;
           will have leukapheresis 2 more times over 1 year.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      While antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved the clinical outcome for HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals, persistence of viral reservoirs in the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues&#xD;
      remains a hurdle to the eradication of virus. The vast majority of HIV-infected individuals&#xD;
      treated with ART experience plasma viral rebound within weeks of cessation of therapy.&#xD;
      Considering that current research regarding treatment has been heavily focused on developing&#xD;
      strategies aimed at achieving sustained virologic remission in the absence of ART, it is of&#xD;
      crucial importance to investigate the impact of short-term treatment interruption and&#xD;
      re-initiation of ART on transcriptional, immunologic, and virologic parameters in&#xD;
      HIV-infected individuals. Currently, much of our knowledge regarding the mechanism of viral&#xD;
      rebound is based on investigations using structured treatment interruptions in supervised&#xD;
      clinical settings dating back to 1999. Subsequent studies, performed primarily in chronically&#xD;
      infected patients to minimize treatment exposure and toxicity, revealed poor outcomes in&#xD;
      terms of viral rebound, clinical events and mortality 3-11 leading to the abandonment of this&#xD;
      genre of investigation. However, various aspects have been identified as potential&#xD;
      contributors to the observed negative outcomes including outmoded ART regimens, infrequent&#xD;
      post-interruption monitoring, and repeated cycles of prolonged analytical treatment&#xD;
      interruption (ATI). While long-term ATI was found to be associated with a decrease in CD4+ T&#xD;
      cells, persistent plasma viremia, and an increased risk of opportunistic infections, it is&#xD;
      unclear whether short term ATI elicits similar immunologic and virologic consequences in&#xD;
      those receiving modern and efficacious ART. Furthermore, the mechanism, kinetics, degree, as&#xD;
      well as immunologic and virologic predictors, of plasma viral rebound in patients receiving&#xD;
      contemporary antiretroviral drug regimens after cessation of ART have not been explicitly&#xD;
      investigated. Nor has the impact of persistent HIV reservoir size been fully correlated to&#xD;
      the dynamics of plasma viral rebound in patients receiving modern drug regimens. As we&#xD;
      develop clinical trials aimed at therapeutic and curative interventions, an integral&#xD;
      component in design will require an ATI phase. Characterizing the corollaries of brief&#xD;
      treatment cessation and re-initiation of ART on the dynamics of immunologic parameters and&#xD;
      HIV reservoirs will provide valuable information for the design of future trials essential to&#xD;
      our interpretation of the results as well as to ensuring the safest environment for the&#xD;
      patients. We propose to examine the effect of ATI on plasma viral rebound, changes in&#xD;
      immunologic parameters and the dynamics of viral reservoirs in HIV-infected individuals&#xD;
      receiving state-of-the-art antiretroviral drug regimens following discontinuation and&#xD;
      reinitiation of therapy.&#xD;
