           administration Three daily doses boost radiotherapy (XRT) at 6-12 Gy to at least 1, and&#xD;
           up to a maximum of 5, metastatic fields, will be administrated on days -4 -3 -2 or -3 -2&#xD;
           -1 before the first and the third cycle of vaccine+IL-2. The first day of administration&#xD;
           of vaccine is day +1 and of IL-2 is day +2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intradermal autologous dendritic cell vaccine loaded with autologous tumor homogenate&#xD;
      plus IL-2 (dose 18 MIU/m2/day in 500cc by continuous IV infusion for 72 hours) will be&#xD;
      administered every 3 weeks up to 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Proof of Principle trial with a minimax two stage design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Step 1: 12 patients enrolled; A 5% response rate will preclude further study, whereas a 20%&#xD;
      response rate will indicate that further study would be warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using alfa and beta errors of 0.10, if an objective response is observed in at least 1 of the&#xD;
      12 patients enrolled during the first stage the study will go on with a:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Step 2: recruitment of an additional 25 patients The treatments will be considered active&#xD;
      if an objective response is observed in 4 out of 37 patients treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolment period will be 24 months. To ensure patients' safety, a continued safety&#xD;
      evaluation by an independent DSMB will be performed and formal rules will be planned to&#xD;
      continue or stop the recruitment; in particular, the enrollment will be interrupted when six&#xD;
      patients completed at least one cycle of the combo treatment and they will be evaluated for&#xD;
      safety: if grade ≥3 AEs (except for fever and rash that will be consider only for grade 4) in&#xD;
      2 (two) or more patients will be observed within 30 days after completion of the first dose&#xD;
      of combo treatment, the study will be interrupted.&#xD;
