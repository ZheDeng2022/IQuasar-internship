    <description>FE 999049 was administered as single daily subcutaneous injections in the abdomen. Participants randomized to FE 999049 had their individual dose determined on the basis of their anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) level at screening and their body weight at randomization. The daily FE 999049 dose was fixed throughout the stimulation period. The minimum allowed daily FE 999049 dose was 6 μg and maximum allowed daily dose was 12 μg. Dosing continued until the criterion for triggering of final follicular maturation was met. Participants could be treated for a maximum of 20 days.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 17 investigational sites in Japan randomized participants to the trial between 29 July 2017 to 08 July 2019.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 373 participants were screened. Of these, 25 were screening failures and 348 participants were randomized: 170 participants were exposed to FE 999049 &amp; 177 participants were exposed to FOLLISTIM. One participant was randomized to FOLLISTIM but not exposed to investigational medicinal product (IMP) was considered a randomization failure.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>FE 999049 (Follitropin Delta)</title>
          <description>FE 999049 was administered as single daily subcutaneous injections in the abdomen. Participants randomized to FE 999049 had their individual dose determined on the basis of their anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) level at screening and their body weight at randomization. The daily FE 999049 dose was fixed throughout the stimulation period. The minimum allowed daily FE 999049 dose was 6 μg and maximum allowed daily dose was 12 μg. Dosing continued until the criterion for triggering of final follicular maturation was met. Participants could be treated for a maximum of 20 days.</description>

          <description>FOLLISTIM was administered as single daily subcutaneous injections in the abdomen. The starting dose of FOLLISTIM was 150 IU and fixed for the first five stimulation days, after which it could be adjusted by 75 IU based on the individual response. The maximum allowed daily dose was 375 IU. Dosing continued until the criterion for triggering of final follicular maturation was met. Participants could be treated for a maximum of 20 days.</description>

            <description>FE 999049 was administered as single daily subcutaneous injections in the abdomen. Participants randomized to FE 999049 had their individual dose determined on the basis of their AMH level at screening and their body weight at randomization. The daily FE 999049 dose was fixed throughout the stimulation period. The minimum allowed daily FE 999049 dose was 6 μg and maximum allowed daily dose was 12 μg. Dosing continued until the criterion for triggering of final follicular maturation was met. Participants could be treated for a maximum of 20 days.</description>

            <description>FE 999049 was administered as single daily subcutaneous injections in the abdomen. Participants randomized to FE 999049 had their individual dose determined on the basis of their AMH level at screening and their body weight at randomization. The daily FE 999049 dose was fixed throughout the stimulation period. The minimum allowed daily FE 999049 dose was 6 μg and maximum allowed daily dose was 12 μg. Dosing continued until the criterion for triggering of final follicular maturation was met. Participants could be treated for a maximum of 20 days.</description>

The intensity of AE was classified using the following 3-point scale: mild = awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity); moderate = event sufficient to affect usual activity (disturbing); or severe = inability to work or perform usual activities (unacceptable).</description>

The daily FE 999049 dose was fixed throughout the stimulation period. The minimum allowed daily FE 999049 dose was 6 μg and maximum allowed daily dose was 12 μg. Dosing continued until the criterion for triggering of final follicular maturation was met. Participants could be treated for a maximum of 20 days.</description>
