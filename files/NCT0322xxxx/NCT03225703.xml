  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) and osteoporosis (OP) affect large numbers of the population. Around 8&#xD;
      million people in the UK are affected by OA and over 300,000 people present with fragility&#xD;
      fractures in the UK each year. High impact exercise has been shown to improve markers of bone&#xD;
      health but the effect of this exercise on the cartilage is less well understood. A six month,&#xD;
      one leg, exercise program based on hopping will be carried out by a group of post-menopausal&#xD;
      women. Post-menopausal women are particularly at risk from OP and the research should give&#xD;
      information on the feasibility of this type of exercise program in this age group and the&#xD;
      effect on cartilage. Participants will be aged between 55 and 70 (at least five years post&#xD;
      menopause) with no conditions that would limit their ability to complete the exercise&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess changes in participants' cartilage and bone properties they will be asked to attend&#xD;
      several meetings at Loughborough University. Before and after the exercise program&#xD;
      participants will have bone density scans and MRI scans of the knee joint. A subset (n=4)&#xD;
      will undergo high resolution bone scans that can demonstrate changes in bone structure. The&#xD;
      intervention is a home based exercise programme lasting approximately 10 minutes per day.&#xD;
      Initially this will be individualised to each participant with the end goal being daily&#xD;
      exercise sessions. The programme will last for six months with supervised sessions offered&#xD;
      throughout the trial. Using an intervention affecting just one leg will allow the research&#xD;
      team to use the other leg as a control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team hypothesise that in a population of post-menopausal women, a six month,&#xD;
      unilateral exercise intervention will improve bone mineral density at the proximal femur with&#xD;
      no negative effects on articular cartilage.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research is a 6 month, intervention study of unilateral (single limb) exercise with the&#xD;
      changes in a randomly chosen exercise leg being compared to those in the other (control) leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants (women aged 55-70) will be approached via existing links in the&#xD;
      community, at local community centres, through local media, posters and flyers. After initial&#xD;
      contact to determine whether they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria they will be invited&#xD;
      to join the study and sent the participant information sheet (PIS). If they then wish to aid&#xD;
      in the research they will be invited to a first meeting at Loughborough University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial meeting the participant can further discuss the project and PIS with the&#xD;
      research team. If they fully understand the project and are happy to take part they will be&#xD;
      invited to sign the informed consent form. At this stage each participant will be anonymised&#xD;
      using a project code. Screening and baseline measurements will then be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening questionnaires will be taken following consent to the study. These include a&#xD;
      demographic questionnaire, health screen questionnaire, calcium intake questionnaire,&#xD;
      physical activity readiness questionnaire (PAR-Q) and bone physical activity questionnaire&#xD;
      (BPAQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans of the whole body, anterior-posterior (AP) spine and&#xD;
      dual femur will be taken for each participant to give baseline measurements of bone mineral&#xD;
      density.Standard positioning procedures for the measurement being taken will be utilised to&#xD;
      allow the calculation of the T-score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional tests will be performed to investigate hopping and balance ability. Unilateral&#xD;
      balance will be analysed by measuring postural sway using a force platform. Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to balance on one leg for up to 30 seconds. Amplitude of displacement will be&#xD;
      calculated, this is the distance between the maximum and minimum centre of pressure (COP) in&#xD;
      both directions. COP path length is the total distance travelled and will be calculated and&#xD;
      divided by the trial time to give the COP velocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal hop height will be measured by recording the vertical displacement of a marker placed&#xD;
      on the lumbar spine of each participant whilst conducting a maximal hop. This will be&#xD;
      repeated for each leg. The ground reaction force (GRF) of the maximal hop will be recorded&#xD;
      using a force platform. Participants will be asked to remain still on the platform for 5&#xD;
      seconds to determine body weight. From this position participants will be asked to lift one&#xD;
      leg from the platform and perform a counter movement, maximal hop using their arms to help&#xD;
      with propulsion and ensure maximal hop height. After one or two familiarisation attempts the&#xD;
      participant will be asked to complete three maximal hops. Allowing for repeats if they do not&#xD;
      land fully on the force platform. The peak GRF recorded from these three attempts will be&#xD;
      used in the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ground reaction forces during a set of ten hops, which is the end goal of the exercise&#xD;
      programme, will be recorded on a force platform. Participants will be asked to remain still&#xD;
      on the platform for 5 seconds to determine body weight. From this position participants will&#xD;
      be asked to lift one leg from the platform and perform ten counter movement hops using their&#xD;
      arms to help with propulsion if able. At the baseline measurements participants will be asked&#xD;
      to perform ten hops to the best of their ability, with a rigid support available for them to&#xD;
      lean on&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second appointment will be arranged to acquire baseline MRI scans of each knee joint. This&#xD;
      will involve the safety checks, conversation with the radiographers and scan times of up to&#xD;
      one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the MRI scans the exercise leg will be randomly assigned using opaque envelopes.&#xD;
      Each envelope will contain a note saying either 'left leg' or 'right leg'. The envelopes will&#xD;
      be split into smaller subgroups of eight for minimisation. This will remove the possibility&#xD;
      of the first half of volunteers choosing the same leg and removing the randomisation effect&#xD;
      on the second half. Participants will be presented with a training diary and instructions on&#xD;
      how to complete the exercise programme over six months. The first day of exercise will be&#xD;
      completed with the research team at this appointment and the intervention considered started.&#xD;
      This second meeting should last for approximately 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The required exercise lasts for no longer than 10 minutes each session and can be performed&#xD;
      at home. The intervention will be personalised to the individual's ability and the frequency&#xD;
      of the exercise will steadily increase as the participant improves, until the exercise is&#xD;
      completed daily. Regular group sessions at Loughborough University will be offered to all&#xD;
      participants. The exercise time will remain at ten minutes but the session will be longer,&#xD;
      allowing for discussion and check-ups with participants. These will be weekly sessions for&#xD;
      the first two months and then once a month for the remaining time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up measurements will take place six months after the commencement of the exercise&#xD;
      programme. Repeat DXA, MRI and functional outcome tests will be carried out on all&#xD;
      participants, following the same protocol as at baseline. Again this will occur over two&#xD;
      meetings at Loughborough University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset (n=4) will undergo high resolution bone scans (HR-pQCT) that can demonstrate changes&#xD;
      in bone structure. This measurement will be taken at the distal tibia and lasts around three&#xD;
      minutes per leg. Measurements will be taken pre and post the six month exercise intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be calculated to give information on mean values and variation&#xD;
      (standard deviation) of the cohort. This will include age, height, body mass, BMI and time&#xD;
      since last menstruation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using Levene's test when comparing the exercise to control leg and Mauchly's test of&#xD;
      sphericity to compare from baseline to end of study, the variance of the data will be&#xD;
      analysed. Normal distribution will be analysed using Shapiro-Wilks test and visual&#xD;
      examination of Q-Q plot. If variance is shown to be homogenous and distribution normal within&#xD;
      the population then a repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA)will be used to detect&#xD;
      any significant differences between leg (exercise versus control, time (baseline versus&#xD;
      post-intervention) or leg x time interaction in the outcome variable described previously. If&#xD;
      any of the outcome measures do not meet the assumptions to conduct parametric tests i.e.&#xD;
      ANOVA then Kruskal-Wallis H test will be used to detect any significant change in&#xD;
      differences.&#xD;
