  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Late preterm infants, who are born at 34, 35 or 36 weeks gestation, often have difficulty&#xD;
      feeding, establishing growth, and fighting off infection. Breastfeeding provides improved&#xD;
      nutrition to help fight infection, in part because breast milk encourages the growth of&#xD;
      healthy bacteria (microbiota) in the infant's intestine. However, when mothers give birth&#xD;
      preterm, their breasts are usually not quite ready to make milk; it can take several days to&#xD;
      have enough breast milk to match a baby's nutritional needs. If there is not yet enough&#xD;
      breast milk, formula is often used. However, formula can interfere with the growth of healthy&#xD;
      intestinal bacteria. An alternate nutritional option is donor milk from a certified milk&#xD;
      bank, which is available in all neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in San Francisco.&#xD;
      However, no scientific studies have yet studied donor milk for late preterm infants, so&#xD;
      currently all San Francisco NICUs (as well as the large majority of NICUs nationwide) reserve&#xD;
      donor milk for infants born at &lt;34 weeks. This study's investigators therefore propose the&#xD;
      &quot;Milk, Growth and Microbiota (MGM) Study,&quot; a randomized controlled trial to compare banked&#xD;
      donor milk to formula for breastfeeding late preterm infants born in San Francisco. Once&#xD;
      enrolled in MGM, infants will be randomly assigned to receive either formula or banked donor&#xD;
      milk if they need additional nutrition until their mothers are making enough milk. After&#xD;
      enrolling the babies, investigators will weigh them daily to assess their growth. The&#xD;
      investigators will also collect infant bowel movements at baseline, 1 week and 1 month to&#xD;
      determine whether donor milk vs. formula impacts the type of bacteria in the baby's&#xD;
      intestine. If the study's results show that donor milk optimizes growth while helping&#xD;
      establish healthy bacteria in the baby's intestine, donor milk might be postnatal strategy to&#xD;
      bolster neonatal nutrition for late preterm infants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the U.S., 8% of all births occur between 34 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks gestation and are&#xD;
      regarded as late preterm birth. Compared to term newborns, late preterm newborns have a much&#xD;
      higher risk of morbidity and mortality, in part because of difficulty establishing feeding&#xD;
      and growth. Breastfeeding optimizes the nutrition of these infants by supporting growth and&#xD;
      establishing a healthy intestinal microbiota. However, maternal breast milk production is&#xD;
      often delayed after preterm birth, which can hamper optimal growth. When this occurs,&#xD;
      clinicians may use formula to supplement breastfeeding. However, formula alters neonatal&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota and can impede some of the benefits of a human milk diet. Donor milk&#xD;
      from a certified milk bank could possibly be used instead of formula for supplementation&#xD;
      prior to the onset of copious maternal milk production. However, the use of banked donor milk&#xD;
      has never been studied in late preterm infants. The aim of this proposal is to report the&#xD;
      effects of banked donor milk vs. formula on growth and on intestinal microbiota among late&#xD;
      preterm, breastfeeding newborns who require additional nutrition before copious maternal milk&#xD;
      is available. This study's investigators therefore propose a randomized, controlled trial&#xD;
      enrolling late preterm newborns. Newborns will be randomly assigned either to breastfeed with&#xD;
      additional formula feedings, or to breastfeed with additional donor milk feedings. The&#xD;
      study's outcomes will be: (1) growth (rate of weight change), and (2) intestinal microbiota.&#xD;
      If the study finds that temporary use of donor milk supports growth and maintains healthy&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota until copious maternal milk becomes available, temporary use of donor&#xD;
      milk might be a postnatal strategy to bolster neonatal nutrition and optimize nutritional&#xD;
      support and growth for late preterm infants.&#xD;
