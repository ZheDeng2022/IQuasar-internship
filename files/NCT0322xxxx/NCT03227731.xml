      An Open Label randomized control study. To explore the safety of Truvada when used as PrEP&#xD;
      during pregnancy and lactation. Pregnant women considered at risk for HIV infection and&#xD;
      willing to participate in this randomized control study will be randomized to commencing PrEP&#xD;
      in pregnancy and continued use throughout breastfeeding or deferred PrEP until breastfeeding&#xD;
      cessation. All women will receive the standard of care for prevention of HIV and other&#xD;
      sexually transmitted infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: (Intervention): Standard HIV Prevention strategy plus a once daily dose of Truvada&#xD;
      (FTC 200mg/TDF 300mg tablet) initiated in pregnancy, continuing until cessation of&#xD;
      breastfeeding or 18 months postdelivery whichever is earliest and thereafter the option to&#xD;
      continue PrEP post breastfeeding cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: (Control): Standard HIV Prevention strategy throughout pregnancy until cessation of&#xD;
      breastfeeding plus the offer to initiate PrEP post breastfeeding cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard HIV prevention strategy includes risk reduction counselling, sexually transmitted&#xD;
      infection (STI) screening and treatment, condom promotion and inviting the sexual partner to&#xD;
      receive HIV counselling and testing (HCT) and referral for antiretroviral therapy (ART) if he&#xD;
      tests positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measure: Renal function, pregnancy outcomes, bone health and infant growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Outcome Measure: Incident HIV infections, adherence to PrEP, drug resistance and&#xD;
      mother-to-child transmission of HIV.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is becoming increasingly evident that women remain vulnerable to HIV infection during&#xD;
      pregnancy and even more so postdelivery. In a meta-analysis, using data from 19 international&#xD;
      cohorts, Drake et al concluded that the pooled HIV incidence rate during pregnancy/postpartum&#xD;
      was 3.8/100 per woman years (PWY) (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 3.0-4.6): 4.7/100 PWY during&#xD;
      pregnancy and 2.9/100 PWY postpartum. In earlier South African studies (2005-2009)&#xD;
      investigators reported HIV seroconversion rates ranging from 1.3% to 3.0% in pregnancy [4-6].&#xD;
      Dinh et al in 2010-2012 reaffirmed the high seroconversion rate among pregnant women&#xD;
      attending public health facilities in South Africa; 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.8%) women&#xD;
      seroconverted in pregnancy [7]. In an evaluation of PMTCT program indicators in KwaZulu-Natal&#xD;
      in 2015 the HIV seroconversion rate among 78 906 pregnant HIV uninfected women was estimated&#xD;
      as 1.8% (95%CI 1.0-2.9) in pregnancy and 5% (among 26 455 breastfeeding women) in the&#xD;
      postnatal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Truvada, an antiretroviral agent containing emtricitabine (200 mg) and tenofovir disoproxil&#xD;
      fumarate (300 mg) in a fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet formulation is widely used in&#xD;
      pregnant women as part of a combination treatment regimen and as prophylaxis to prevent&#xD;
      mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Truvada is also the drug of choice in PrEP and currently&#xD;
      recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for people at substantial risk of HIV&#xD;
      infection (incidence &gt;3%). Pregnant women were excluded from participating in PrEP trials&#xD;
      because of the lack of safety data in pregnancy. Available human and animal data suggest that&#xD;
      TRUVADA does not increase the risk of major birth defects overall compared to the background&#xD;
      rate and there are limited safety data for TDF/FTC when used in HIV uninfected pregnant&#xD;
      women. In the past five years, PrEP trials have explored the use of Tenofovir alone or in&#xD;
      combination with Emtricitabine in a once daily regimen, resulting in varying efficacy&#xD;
      outcomes that have been largely associated with adherence. Much of the safety data have been&#xD;
      generated in studies involving ART in HIV infected pregnant women. The majority of these&#xD;
      studies indicate no added adverse effect of TDF on pregnancy outcomes. The few studies of TDF&#xD;
      use in HIV uninfected women are treatment studies to prevent mother-to-child transmission of&#xD;
      Hepatitis B and only 2 studies of TDF as PrEP use among women who subsequently fell pregnant&#xD;
      post enrolment. However, exposure to TDF during pregnancy in these PrEP studies is limited&#xD;
      since TDF was halted once pregnancy was diagnosed. Only a handful of studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated the excretion of TDF into breastmilk and have concluded that these are&#xD;
      relatively low doses of exposure to the infant. When women were given TDF 300mg/FTC 200mg as&#xD;
      part of the triple drug regimen in Option B+ program in Malawi the Tenofovir concentrations&#xD;
      in breastmilk were very low (breast milk/maternal plasma ratio = 0.08) [59]. Additional&#xD;
      studies are needed to explore the effect of long term TDF exposure during breastfeeding on&#xD;
      child growth and child health. Considering HIV uninfected women are encouraged to breastfeed&#xD;
      for at least a year, studies exploring the long term effect of breastmilk exposure to TDF&#xD;
      when used as PrEP in the mother, are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the safety of Truvada when used as PrEP in combination with current&#xD;
      recommendations for prevention of sexually transmitted infections in young women at&#xD;
      substantial risk of HIV acquisition during pregnancy and lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women, at their first antenatal visit, HIV uninfected, without evidence of maternal&#xD;
      or fetal complications and at risk for HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the frequency and seriousness of adverse events in women receiving&#xD;
      tenofovir/emtricitabine in pregnancy as opposed to women not receiving&#xD;
      tenofovir/emtricitabine in pregnancy, we have based our sample size on the main clinically&#xD;
      relevant pregnancy outcome. Although all pregnancy outcomes will be compared between the&#xD;
      intervention (immediate PrEP) and control (deferred PrEP) groups, we based our sample size on&#xD;
      the expected preterm delivery proportion among HIV uninfected women (South Africa 18.5%,&#xD;
      Botswana 19%). A sample size of 421 in the Immediate PrEP group and 421 in the Deferred PrEP&#xD;
      group (i.e. 842 in total) achieves 80% power to detect a non-inferiority margin difference&#xD;
      between the group proportions of 0.075 or 7.5%. The reference group proportion (deferred&#xD;
      PrEP) of pre-term delivery pregnancy outcome as a main clinically-relevant adverse event is&#xD;
      0.185 or 18.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: An Open Label randomized control study. Pregnant women considered at high risk&#xD;
      for HIV infection will be randomized to commencing PrEP in pregnancy with continued use&#xD;
      throughout breastfeeding or deferred PrEP until breastfeeding cessation. Women in either&#xD;
      group will receive the standard of care for prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mother: From the first antenatal visit in pregnancy until 18 months post-delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infant: From birth until 18 months of age. Approximately 12 months for planned accrual and 24&#xD;
      months for complete follow-up. The study period is expected to span 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Products:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Truvada (emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300mg) is in a fixed-dose&#xD;
      combination (FDC) tablet formulation and is proven safe for the prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      HIV in non-pregnant and non-lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: (Intervention) Standard HIV Prevention strategy plus a once daily dose of Truvada (FTC&#xD;
      200mg/TDF 300mg tablet) initiated in pregnancy and continuing until cessation of&#xD;
      breastfeeding or 18 months postdelivery whichever is earliest and thereafter the option to&#xD;
      continue PrEP post breastfeeding cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: (Control) Standard HIV Prevention strategy throughout pregnancy until 18 months&#xD;
      postdelivery plus the offer to initiate PrEP post breastfeeding cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To compare the frequency and seriousness of specific adverse events related to TDF/FTC in&#xD;
      women and their children in Arm A (exposure to TDF/FTC) and Arm B (no exposure to TDF/FTC)&#xD;
      during pregnancy until breastfeeding cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate HIV incidence in women in Arm A with Arm B at delivery and at 18 months&#xD;
           post-delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the interdependency of adherence to a once daily oral TDF/FTC regimen and&#xD;
           standard HIV prevention methods during pregnancy and postdelivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure antiretroviral drug (TDF/FTC) level in women and their infants in association&#xD;
           with adherence, safety and level of protection (plasma and breastmilk)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To detect drug resistance among women who acquire HIV infection and correlate the&#xD;
           treatment outcomes (after initiating immediate antiretroviral (ARV) treatment) with drug&#xD;
           resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine mother-to-child transmission of HIV among women who acquire incident&#xD;
           infections during pregnancy and breastfeeding and the frequency of drug resistance in&#xD;
           their infected babies&#xD;
