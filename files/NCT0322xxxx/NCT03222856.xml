    <textblock>
      This a multicenter, open-label, phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in combination with eribulin in female patients older than 18 years old with&#xD;
      hormone receptor-(HR)positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) previously treated&#xD;
      with at least one, but not more than two, prior chemotherapeutic regimens for treatment of&#xD;
      locally recurrent and/or metastatic disease. Prior therapy must have included an&#xD;
      anthracycline and a taxane and prior anti-hormonal therapy is mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients to be included is 44 patients at 11 sites. All eligible patients will&#xD;
      be treated with MK3475 (pembrolizumab) 200 mg on day 1 of each 21-day cycle and eribulin 1.23&#xD;
      mg/m2 (equivalent to eribulin mesylate at 1.4 mg/m2) on days 1 and 8 of every 21-day cycle.&#xD;

      This a multicenter, open-label, phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in combination with eribulin in female patients older than 18 years old with&#xD;
      hormone receptor-(HR)positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) previously treated&#xD;
      with at least one, but not more than two, prior chemotherapeutic regimens for treatment of&#xD;
      locally recurrent and/or metastatic disease. Prior therapy must have included an&#xD;
      anthracycline and a taxane in any combination or order and either in the early or metastatic&#xD;
      disease setting unless contraindicated for a given patient. Prior anti-hormonal therapy is&#xD;
      mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients to be included is 44 patients at 11 sites. The primary objective is to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy -as determined by the clinical benefit rate (CBR) (total number of&#xD;
      objective responses plus stable disease for at least 24 weeks) based on RECIST v.1.1- of&#xD;
      MK3475 (pembrolizumab) in combination with eribulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is CBR based on RECIST v.1.1. All eligible patients will be treated with&#xD;
      MK3475 (pembrolizumab) 200 mg on day 1 of each 21-day cycle and eribulin 1.23 mg/m2&#xD;
      (equivalent to eribulin mesylate at 1.4 mg/m2) on days 1 and 8 of every 21-day cycle.&#xD;
      Treatment with MK3475 (pembrolizumab) and eribulin will continue based on physician criteria.&#xD;
      No maximum duration of treatment is specified. Study follow-up will be performed 12 months&#xD;
      after last study dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available tumor tissue for PD-L1 biomarker analysis from a newly obtained core or excisional&#xD;
      biopsy since last progression of a metastatic tumor lesion not previously irradiated is&#xD;
      requested for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translational research of this protocol involves the collection, processing, temporary&#xD;
      storage, and shipment of samples from consenting patients enrolled in centers selected for&#xD;
      participation in the study. The study plan includes collection and initial processing of&#xD;
      tumor tissues and blood samples to the central laboratory of Institut Hospital del Mar&#xD;
      d&quot;Investigacions Mèdiques (IMIM), that will be used to identify dynamic biomarkers that may&#xD;
      be predictive of response to MK3475 (pembrolizumab) and eribulin treatment.&#xD;
