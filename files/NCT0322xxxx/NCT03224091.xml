  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PROLED study is a prospective and longitudinal study of patients with Eating Disorders.&#xD;
      Annual interviews and collection of biological samples are done, as well as during changes in&#xD;
      disease course e.g. during hospitalization. Included are qualitative interviews, psychometric&#xD;
      tests, questionnaires which are used to collect data on psychopathology. There is also&#xD;
      collection of blood, urine and faeces.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to increase the understanding of the psychopathology and pathophysiology of&#xD;
      Eating Disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically, the aim is to identify biomarkers that relate to prognosis, disease course&#xD;
      and response to treatment as usual of Eating Disorders, and, to improve the understanding of&#xD;
      the pathophysiology of Eating disorders in order to identify novel molecular targets for&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale The etiology of Eating Disorders (ED's) is unknown. Previous studies have&#xD;
      identified genes that link Anorexia Nervosa to other psychiatric (e.g. schizophrenia) and&#xD;
      somatic disorders (e.e. diabetes). Association studies have also suggested genetic causes&#xD;
      underlying Bulimia Nervosa and Binge Eating Disorders. The PROLED study aims to improve the&#xD;
      understanding of both the psychopathology and pathophysiology of Eating Disorders. No&#xD;
      experimental drug will be used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a great need for an increased biological understanding of ED's in view of the&#xD;
      prevalence, the costs, the severity and high mortality rates, and the lack of efficient&#xD;
      treatments. The PROLED study aims to answer questions related to these unmet medical needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is prospective and longitudinal. Qualitative interviews, psychometric tests,&#xD;
      questionnaires are used to collect data on psychopathology. There is also collection of&#xD;
      blood, urine and faeces.&#xD;
