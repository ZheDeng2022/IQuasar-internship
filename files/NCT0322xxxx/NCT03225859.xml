  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans who complete trauma-focused therapies (TFTs) report improvements in posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder symptoms, quality of life, and social and role functioning. However, many&#xD;
      also report uncertainty regarding their ability to maintain and build upon progress made&#xD;
      during TFTs following the end of treatment. Veterans who recently completed a course of TFT&#xD;
      believe the likelihood of their ongoing success would be bolstered by mental health services&#xD;
      that support additional practice and reinforcement of skills learned in TFT. Currently no&#xD;
      evidence-based approach for post-TFT care exists; however, Veterans' reported treatment needs&#xD;
      are well-suited to a therapist-assisted self-management approach. The objective of this&#xD;
      project is to complete Stage 1 (intervention refinement and piloting) of the Stage Model of&#xD;
      Treatment Development for a post-TFT therapist-assisted self-management program designed to&#xD;
      help Veterans maintain or build upon gains made in TFT, increase self-efficacy for managing&#xD;
      their PTSD symptoms, and enhance community engagement. The aims of the project are to: 1)&#xD;
      Refine a self-management treatment protocol through eliciting feedback from experienced TFT&#xD;
      providers on a draft of the self-management program, 2) Conduct a pilot open trial to assess&#xD;
      the acceptability and feasibility of the self-management program, and 3) Explore the effects&#xD;
      of the program on Veterans' confidence in managing their PTSD and Veterans' functioning,&#xD;
      quality of life, community engagement, and mental health symptoms.&#xD;

      Impact: Findings from this project will improve the mental health and well-being of Veterans&#xD;
      with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by refining and evaluating the first post-trauma&#xD;
      focused therapy (TFT) intervention designed to help Veterans increase self-efficacy for&#xD;
      managing their PTSD symptoms, maintain or build upon gains made in TFT, and increase&#xD;
      community engagement. The current VA / Department of Defense PTSD clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines recommend decreasing the frequency and intensity of care (e.g. stepping-down)&#xD;
      following successful TFT completion; this project is the initial step in developing the first&#xD;
      evidence-based intervention for this important process. The project will advance RR&amp;D's&#xD;
      missions of evaluating interventions designed to maximize psychological recovery and&#xD;
      prioritizing functional outcomes and societal engagement. Finally, the project will advance&#xD;
      the scientific literature by being the first examination of a self-management intervention&#xD;
      designed to be used to step down from an intensive course of therapy for PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: TFTs reduce the suffering associated with PTSD; a majority of Veterans who&#xD;
      complete prolonged exposure or cognitive processing therapy report improvements in PTSD&#xD;
      symptomology, quality of life, and functioning. Despite their effectiveness, emerging data&#xD;
      suggest that Veterans who complete TFTs continue to perceive a need for mental health&#xD;
      treatment; the investigators' pilot data demonstrated that the primary post-TFT mental health&#xD;
      treatment need among completers who experienced at least a partial improvement in PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms is support for additional practice and reinforcement of skills learned in TFT.&#xD;
      Veterans expressed low self-efficacy for maintaining or building upon their existing gains&#xD;
      and believed continued contact with their TFT therapist would increase their likelihood of&#xD;
      success. These treatment needs are particularly well-suited to a therapist-assisted&#xD;
      self-management approach. Self-management protocols teach patients to be responsible for the&#xD;
      day-to-day management of their symptoms, thereby emphasizing patients' roles in wellness. The&#xD;
      existing literature on self-management interventions for PTSD has demonstrated that such&#xD;
      approaches are acceptable, safe, and effective; however, they have exclusively been used as&#xD;
      stand-alone treatments or as the first step up in a stepped-care model. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators are proposing the first examination of a self-management intervention designed&#xD;
      to be used to step down from an intensive course of TFT for PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objective of this study is to complete stages 1A and 1B of the Stage Model of&#xD;
      Treatment Development for the self-management program for Veterans who have recently&#xD;
      completed a course of TFT for PTSD. Specifically, the investigators will: (1) Refine a&#xD;
      self-management treatment protocol through eliciting feedback from experienced TFT providers,&#xD;
      (2) Conduct a pilot open trial to assess the (a) acceptability of the self-management program&#xD;
      components, structure, and materials and (b) feasibility of the self-management program&#xD;
      (retention and intervention fidelity) and study approach (screening, recruitment, assessment&#xD;
      process), and (3) Explore the effects of the program on Veterans' confidence in managing&#xD;
      their PTSD (self-efficacy), functioning, quality of life, community engagement, and mental&#xD;
      health symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: To achieve Aim 1, the investigators will conduct semi-structured individual&#xD;
      interviews with a sample of TFT providers (n = 10-12), during which participants will be&#xD;
      asked to provide feedback on the planned components and structure of the self-management&#xD;
      program. To achieve Aims 2 and 3, the investigators will enroll twelve Veterans in a&#xD;
      non-randomized, open-trial pilot test of the intervention at the Minneapolis VA Healthcare&#xD;
      Systems (VAHCS). Enrolled Veterans will complete survey batteries immediately post-TFT, and&#xD;
      survey batteries and qualitative interviews two weeks after the final self-management program&#xD;
      therapist contact. Findings from this project will strongly position us to apply for Merit&#xD;
      funding to conduct a randomized clinical trial (Stage 2 of the Stage Model of Treatment&#xD;
      Development) of this innovative self-management program.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>We identified 23 eligible patients. Twelve (52%) veterans enrolled, five (22%) declined participation, five (22%) were eligible but not contacted because they were not identified prior to their final PE/CPT session, and one (4%) veteran was unreachable. Eighty Veterans who were not eligible for EMPOWER were also identified in our screening procedures; failure to complete PE/CPT (n = 41; 51%) and participation in co-occurring studies (n = 12; 29%) were the most common reasons for exclusion.</recruitment_details>

Self-Management Program: This therapist-assisted self-management program will increase Veterans' self-efficacy for managing their PTSD, enable the maintenance or building upon gains made in trauma-focused therapy, and encourage engagement in meaningful activities. Patients will have four contacts with their providers over the ten weeks following trauma-focused therapy completion. The intervention will help patients: 1)self-monitor symptoms, 2) continue to practice skills learned in trauma-focused therapy, 3) acquire and apply additional coping skills, 4) engage in meaningful activities, and 5) set goals</description>
