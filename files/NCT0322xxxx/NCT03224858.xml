  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized wait-list control study to determine whether a stand-alone,&#xD;
      co-located team of physician, mental health behaviorist, and care coordinators with decreased&#xD;
      panel size (aka &quot;intensive primary care&quot;) will reduce inpatient and emergency care&#xD;
      utilization, inpatient costs of care, and improve patient activation and experience for&#xD;
      medically and socially complex patients, compared to enhanced usual care at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
      Participants with multiple co-morbidities, and meet utilization criteria will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to enroll; half the participants will start the intervention immediately, while&#xD;
      half will continue enhanced usual care for 6 months before beginning the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to conduct an evaluation of an &quot;Ambulatory-ICU&quot; model of primary&#xD;
      care for &quot;high utilizer&quot; patients with medical, behavioral, and social complexity. A small&#xD;
      proportion of patients use &gt; 50 % of healthcare resources. It is currently unknown what&#xD;
      interventions can help reduce inappropriate utilization due to lack of studies with rigorous&#xD;
      study design, particularly in patients with high rates of homelessness, mental illness and&#xD;
      substance use. The use of high-risk teams for select patients is a promising model of primary&#xD;
      care that removes barriers to accessing usual care services by centralizing medical and&#xD;
      behavioral clinical services, promotes ability to outreach beyond the clinic, and promote&#xD;
      continuity of care and trust-building between patient and provider teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the hypothesis that a stand-alone clinic based intervention of a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary, co-located physician, mental health behaviorist, nursing, pharmacist, and&#xD;
      care coordinators with reduced panel size, and focus on patient capacity building and&#xD;
      decreasing treatment burden will improve health outcomes at 6 and 12 months in a low-income&#xD;
      high utilizer population with history of homelessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhanced usual care comprises of care delivered at Old Town Clinic (OTC) a Federally&#xD;
      Qualified Health Center (FQHC) that is modeled on the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH)&#xD;
      model. Patients have a designated primary care physician and care team with access to chronic&#xD;
      disease education, mental health, social work, and substance abuse programs through referral&#xD;
      system. In addition, participants thought to have difficulty engaging in primary care have&#xD;
      access to a Health Resilience Specialist, a community health worker intervention who conducts&#xD;
      outreach and assists the patient in care navigation.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a pragmatic &quot;wait-list&quot; control design. Participants will be consented and baseline survey administered after which patient will be randomized by computer generated algorithm into 2 arms: immediate or 6-month 'wait-list.' Immediate group will start intervention and be followed at 6 month intervals for 12 months. 'Wait-list' group will resume usual care for 6-months, after which they will cross-over to the intervention group for 12 months.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>This group will transfer primary care to the SUMMIT team, which consists of: 1 primary care provider, 1 clinical nurse, 1 team manager, 2 care-coordinators, 2 behavioralists, 1 clinical pharmacist. This interdisciplinary team will have reduced patient panel load and increased flexibility in time and scheduling in order to foster trust and continuity with the patient with a goal of decreasing treatment burden and increasing patient capacity. Specific activities that participants will receive include: 1) comprehensive initial intake and care plan development that incorporates patient goal setting; 2) flexible scheduling of appointments with outreach; 3) transitional care coordination; 4) built-in behavioural counselling and case management; 5) regular review of care plan by team members.</description>

This includes care provided by the patient's existing primary care provider, access to a clinic's Health Resilience outreach worker, mental health consultation, and other services provided by usual care. After 6 months, the baseline survey is administered and the participant will transfer care to the intervention as described above in the SUMMIT intervention group.</description>
