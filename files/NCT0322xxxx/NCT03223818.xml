  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver cancer was the third leading cause of cancer death in both sexes in Hong Kong and liver&#xD;
      resection remains the mainstay of curative treatment. Post-operative recovery from liver&#xD;
      resection has historically been fraught with a high incidence of complications, ranging from&#xD;
      15-48%, and the high incidence of complications leads to prolonged hospital stay, ranging&#xD;
      from 9 - 15 days, and increase costs of hospitalization. Recent advancement in the&#xD;
      perioperative surgical and anesthetic management of patients undergoing liver resection has&#xD;
      led to improvement in these outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators department had previously studied the impact and confirmed the benefit of&#xD;
      fast-track peri-operative programs after laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      studies regarding its adoption in liver resection are limited. The investigators group had&#xD;
      previously reported, in a retrospective cohort, that successful implementation of ERAS&#xD;
      protocol was associated with a significantly shorten hospital stay. However, the&#xD;
      peri-operative management in that study incorporated a small proportion of components&#xD;
      described in ERAS programs for liver resection and there was no direct comparison with&#xD;
      conventional peri-operative program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical and immunological outcomes of Hong Kong&#xD;
      Chinese patients undergoing liver resection for liver cancer with a &quot;conventional&quot; vs a&#xD;
      &quot;fast-track&quot; perioperative program.&#xD;

      Liver cancer was the third leading cause of cancer death in both sexes in Hong Kong and liver&#xD;
      resection remains the mainstay of curative treatment. Post-operative recovery from liver&#xD;
      resection has historically been fraught with a high incidence of complications, ranging from&#xD;
      15-48%, and the high incidence of complications leads to prolonged hospital stay, ranging&#xD;
      from 9 - 15 days, and increase costs of hospitalization. Recent advancement in the&#xD;
      perioperative surgical and anesthetic management of patients undergoing liver resection has&#xD;
      led to improvement in these outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since its formal introduction in 1990s, fast-track or enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS)&#xD;
      peri-operative programs have gained territory quickly because of the associated cost&#xD;
      efficiency derived from the reduction in hospital stay, an important issue in today's context&#xD;
      of rapidly increasing health care costs and the consequent need for optimization. The&#xD;
      benefits of fast-track peri-operative programs have been well proven in colectomy. Our&#xD;
      department had previously demonstrated the feasibility and impact of fast-track&#xD;
      peri-operative programs after laparoscopic colorectal surgery, which leads to the potential&#xD;
      for application to other subspecialties. Nevertheless, studies evaluating fast-track&#xD;
      peri-operative programs in liver resection are scarce. Most of them were carried out in&#xD;
      Western countries and almost all of them used epidural analgesia for post-operative pain&#xD;
      control. While most of the livers in Western patients are non-cirrhotic, the main challenge&#xD;
      of liver resection in Chinese Hong Kong patients is the background liver cirrhosis as&#xD;
      hepatitis-related hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common indication for liver resection.&#xD;
      Although epidural analgesia has been showed to be effective after liver resection without&#xD;
      complication, the debate on epidural analgesia continues. Coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia and&#xD;
      other haematological abnormalities may impose additional risks of epidural hematoma formation&#xD;
      following removal of the epidural catheter postoperatively. Especially there is a much&#xD;
      greater incidence of co-existing liver cirrhosis in Chinese Hong Kong patients with&#xD;
      hepatocelluar carcinoma. This group of patients is coagulopathic even before liver resection&#xD;
      and the risk of bleeding complications related to epidural analgesia is a particular concern.&#xD;
      Continuous wound instillation with local anesthetic agent by the ON-Q PainBuster System&#xD;
      (I-Flow Corporation, Lake Forest, CA, USA) provides an attractive alternative for this group&#xD;
      of patients. We had previously demonstrated its analgesic efficacy after open hepatic surgery&#xD;
      in a randomized controlled trial. Recently, our group had reported, in a retrospective&#xD;
      cohort, that successful implementation of ERAS protocol was associated with a significantly&#xD;
      shorten hospital stay. However, there was no direct comparison with convention peri-operative&#xD;
      program in a randomized controlled manner. Moreover, the peri-operative management in that&#xD;
      study incorporated only a small proportion of components described in ERAS programs for liver&#xD;
      surgery, namely pre-operative counselling, no premedication, normothermia during surgery, no&#xD;
      nasogastric tube and no routine abdominal drain. Furthermore, patient-controlled morphine&#xD;
      analgesia was the method for post-operative pain control, which might not be enough for open&#xD;
      hepatectomy and might have restricted the mobilization.&#xD;
