  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends that resistance exercise performed&#xD;
      at greater than 70% one repetition maximum (1 RM) is necessary to induce strength gains and&#xD;
      muscular hypertrophy (ACSM, 2009). However, previous work has shown resistance exercise at&#xD;
      high intensity increases the rate of injury. Blood flow restriction (BFR) exercise is a&#xD;
      method that is used to compress the blood vessels to the exercising muscle in order to reduce&#xD;
      blood flow to the limb with the use of low-intensity resistance. Researchers have suggested&#xD;
      that resistance exercise at intensities as low as 20-30% 1-repetition maximum with BFR&#xD;
      increases in muscle mass, muscular endurance, and gains in strength. However, the acute heart&#xD;
      and blood vessel changes in response to BFR are not clear. Work by our laboratory (Tai et&#xD;
      al., 2016) has demonstrated that immediately following acute resistance exercise at moderate&#xD;
      intensity (75% 1 RM) without BFR, there are no changes in aortic and brachial systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure (BP), but there are increases in the pressure of the reflective wave&#xD;
      (augmentation pressure). This suggests that the arterial wall is stiff, and may in turn&#xD;
      result in thickening of the arterial wall. However, the data are limited and these responses&#xD;
      may not be universally accepted. In addition, these studies used primarily lower-body&#xD;
      resistance exercises (squat, leg extension, and leg flexion), and did not assess changes in&#xD;
      heart and blood vessel function. Previous researchers have demonstrated that upper-body&#xD;
      exercise induces higher BP and heart rate (HR) than lower-body exercise. However, the effects&#xD;
      of upper- and lower-body resistance exercise with BFR on heart and blood vessel function are&#xD;
      still unclear. Therefore, understanding the effects of upper- and lower-body resistance&#xD;
      exercise with BFR on heart and blood vessel function using weight machines, specifically the&#xD;
      chess press, latissimus dorsi pulldown, knee extension, and knee flexion may significant&#xD;
      impact how the resistance training program is prescribed.&#xD;

      Participants will come to the Cardiovascular Dynamics Laboratory at Kent State University for&#xD;
      4 separate visits. On the first visit, participants will undergo an orientation and decide if&#xD;
      they want to sign the informed consent. If they decide to consent, they will be assigned&#xD;
      randomly to either upper- or lower-body group, and fill out Physical Activity Readiness&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PAR-Q) and Health Participant Questionnaire then be measured for height,&#xD;
      weight, body composition (7-sites skin fold), arterial occlusion pressure (determine the&#xD;
      pressure that occlude blood flow using a doppler device on brachial or femoral artery, and a&#xD;
      13-cm nylon cuff at the proximal end of right arm or right leg then inflate the cuff to 50&#xD;
      mmHg and increases by 1 mmHg per second until the doppler device cannot detect blood flow)&#xD;
      and 1 RM which they will move maximum amount of weight 1 time through a full range of motion&#xD;
      on the chess press and latissimus dorsi pulldown or knee extension and knee flexion. A&#xD;
      certified strength and conditioning specialist will adjust the form, spot the lifts, and&#xD;
      provide feedback if needed. The second visit consists of 1-repetition maximum verification&#xD;
      that participants will be measured 1-repetition maximum on the chess press and latissimus&#xD;
      dorsi pulldown or knee extension and knee flexion again to ensure their maximal strength. For&#xD;
      the third and fourth visits, the participants will come to the Cardiovascular Dynamics&#xD;
      Laboratory to have their responses to either acute upper- or lower-body resistance exercise&#xD;
      with and without BFR quantified. Participants will arrive at the laboratory having avoided&#xD;
      caffeine, alcohol, and strenuous exercise for 24 hours, and at least 3 hours without food&#xD;
      before data collection. Participants will have their hemodynamics and vascular function&#xD;
      measured before and after either acute upper- or lower-body resistance exercise with or&#xD;
      without BFR. Hemodynamic measurements will include pulse wave analysis (PWA) using a&#xD;
      SphygmoCor (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia) device. Heart rate and blood pressure will be&#xD;
      monitored using 3 leads electrocardiograph (ECG) and on the middle finger of the right hand,&#xD;
      respectively. A 5-minute ECG will be collected, and participants will be breathing with a&#xD;
      metronome at the rate of 12 breaths/minute. PWA provides information about aortic and&#xD;
      brachial systolic and diastolic BP, as well as measures of wave reflection that give insight&#xD;
      into central arterial modulation such as augmentation pressure and the augmentation index. BP&#xD;
      will be measured twice separated by 1 minute by an oscillometric device. After that the&#xD;
      investigators will assess vascular function via pulse wave velocity. During PWA measurements,&#xD;
      there will be cuffs on right arm and right leg, and a tonometer will be placed on the carotid&#xD;
      artery on the neck. Peripheral arterial mechanics will be measured by strain gauge&#xD;
      plethysmography (EC-6; DE Hokanson Inc., Bellevue, WA, USA) on the forearm close to the elbow&#xD;
      in order to determine forearm blood flow and vasodilatory capacity (peak blood flow). There&#xD;
      will be cuffs on the upper left arm and on the left wrist. The wrist Cuff will be inflated to&#xD;
      220 mmHg 1 minute prior to data collection and throughout. The Upper arm cuff will be&#xD;
      inflated to 50 mmHg to occlude venous flow for measurement of arterial flow. Ninety seconds&#xD;
      of measurement of flow will occur. Once this is completed, the cuff on the upper arm will be&#xD;
      inflated to 220 mmHg for 5 minutes to occlude blood flow. After that, the pressure in the&#xD;
      cuff will be released and measurements of blood flow will be taken for the next 3 minutes&#xD;
      with the wrist cuff will be inflated to 220 mmHg 1 minute prior to data collection and&#xD;
      throughout. The upper-(chess press and latissimus dorsi pulldown) and lower-body (knee&#xD;
      extension and knee flexion) resistance exercise with BFR will consists of 4 sets of 30, 15,&#xD;
      15, and 15 repetitions at 30% 1 RM with 30 seconds rest between sets and 2 minutes rest&#xD;
      between exercises. The upper- and lower-body resistance exercise without BFR will consists of&#xD;
      4 sets of 8 repetitions at 70% 1 RM with 60 seconds rest between sets and 2 minutes rest&#xD;
      between exercises. Participants' arms or legs will be wrapped using elastic cuffs at the most&#xD;
      proximal limbs. At 40% of arterial occlusion pressure will be used to induce BFR. Three&#xD;
      minutes warm up and three minutes cool down on the cycle ergometer will be given before and&#xD;
      after resistance exercise. Immediately after completion of the acute bouts of resistance&#xD;
      exercise, the investigators will assess PWA and ECG at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes&#xD;
      post exercise, and BF at 20 and 60 minutes post exercise.&#xD;
