  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among the possibilities of intervention to minimize the effects of cancer treatment, the&#xD;
      exercises are efficient in improving the physical fitness and quality of life of the elderly&#xD;
      in treatment. The goal is to compare the effects of two home physical exercise protocols on&#xD;
      quality of life and physical fitness of elderly people with breast cancer who are in hormone&#xD;
      use. A study was carried out at the Institute of Integral Medicine Professor Fernando&#xD;
      Figueira (IMIP) within the Professional Master Program in Palliative Care Associated with the&#xD;
      Residency Program in Health, which evaluated the effectiveness of a protocol of 29 exercises&#xD;
      with walking sessions, performed at home , In the quality of life and physical fitness of the&#xD;
      elderly in the treatment of breast cancer. The results of the mentioned research showed that&#xD;
      the elderly showed improvement both in quality of life and physical fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the results and the clinical and functional kinetic observation of these patients,&#xD;
      the hypothesis was that a shorter intervention protocol, with fewer exercises with fewer&#xD;
      repetitions and a lower degree of difficulty can bring results similar to those found,&#xD;
      requiring a shorter time In the accomplishment of the exercises, which can favor the&#xD;
      adherence to the protocol by the patients, still achieving positive results in their quality&#xD;
      of life and physical fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elderly will undergo evaluations to characterize the sample through questionnaires, the&#xD;
      physical fitness assessment will be performed through the Senior Fitness Test (SFT) and&#xD;
      anthropometric evaluation before (beginning of the research), in the 6th week and after the&#xD;
      12th week of the research. It will be offered the elderly, instructional material developed&#xD;
      for this research - printed manual. It will consist of a routine of 12 exercises to be&#xD;
      performed autonomously for range of motion and muscular fitness, using the environmental&#xD;
      resources of the home. All control and training guidelines for using the manual will be&#xD;
      offered through an introductory lecture and subsequent weekly telephone contacts (twice a&#xD;
      week). Participants should complete their respective program for a total period of 12 weeks&#xD;
      and mark in the manual how often they performed the exercises. The control group used a&#xD;
      protocol with 29 home exercises in a longer manual. The results will be obtained from the&#xD;
      statistical package SPSS 10.0 for Windows and a p &lt;0.05 will be accepted.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For the calculation of the sample size, performed in the program Stata 12 version 12, the&#xD;
      results presented in the dissertation of Souza Filho and collaborators were considered. The&#xD;
      results of the &quot;Raise&quot; test at the end of the study presented a mean of 14.55 ± 3.12 in the&#xD;
      intervention group and a mean of 11.16 ± 2.66 in the control group. A 99% power and a type I&#xD;
      error of 5% would require 27 patients In each group. Predicting eventual losses, this number&#xD;
      was estimated for 33 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elderly will be considered in two groups, one group will participate in a program of 29&#xD;
      exercises and a second group will participate in a short program with 12 exercises, will be&#xD;
      developed according to the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: A manual will be offered, consisting of 29 exercises to be performed at home. The&#xD;
      guideline is to perform each exercise 6 to 8 times in a gentle manner keeping your attention&#xD;
      on movement. The first 19 exercises were of range of motion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stretching of buttocks in dorsal decubitus position&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Trunk side chain elongation in dorsal decubitus&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stretching of hip adductors adopting the &quot;butterfly posture&quot;&#xD;

&#xD;
       16. Abduction and flexion of the shoulder&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. Internal and external rotation of the shoulder&#xD;
&#xD;
       18. Arms at the front of the body at the shoulder line, the movement consists of performing&#xD;
           scapular abduction and lengthening of the flexors at the same time&#xD;
&#xD;
       19. Mobilization of hand and fingers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The 10 subsequent exercises are muscular fitness:&#xD;
&#xD;
       20. Sit-up to strengthen mainly of the musculature of the quadriceps and glutes&#xD;
&#xD;
       21. Sits-ups modified&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
       26. Exercise of balance and coordination&#xD;
&#xD;
       27. Strengthening of the brachial and iliopsoas triceps&#xD;
&#xD;
       28. Brachial triceps strengthening&#xD;
&#xD;
       29. Brachial triceps strengthening This Manual guides its implementation in a progressive&#xD;
           way and at the end it totals about 30 to 45 min of physical exercises per day. All&#xD;
           control and training guidelines for use of the manual will be offered through an&#xD;
           introductory lecture and subsequent weekly telephone contacts (twice a week).&#xD;
           Participants should complete their respective program for a total period of 12 weeks and&#xD;
           mark in the manual how often they performed the exercises. Therefore, it guides the&#xD;
           implementation of daily walks with cumulative effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention Group: the elderly will be offered, instructional material developed for&#xD;
           this research - printed manual. It will consist of a routine of 12 exercises to be&#xD;
           performed autonomously for range of motion and muscular fitness, using the environmental&#xD;
           resources of the home. It will be suggested a daily frequency in the execution of this&#xD;
           exercise routine. Also, stimuli and guidelines will be given for the practice of active&#xD;
           movement (walking) so that they accumulate at least 10 to 20 minutes of this activity&#xD;
           daily. All control and training guidelines for use of the manual will be offered through&#xD;
           an introductory lecture and subsequent weekly telephone contacts (twice a week).&#xD;
           Participants should complete their respective program for a total period of 12 weeks and&#xD;
           mark in the manual how often they performed the exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Procedures related to the production of the instructional manual: a literature review&#xD;
           was carried out in the databases BIREME, PUBMED and in websites of organizations of&#xD;
           great influence with the theme Physical Activity and Cancer, in specific breast cancer.&#xD;
           In addition to interviews and theoretical-practical conceptions of professionals with&#xD;
           significant time in the area in question. This stage lasted three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Within this context, the main exercises of amplitude of movement and muscular aptitude&#xD;
           were shown in which the realization was easier, reproducible and similar to movements&#xD;
           performed within the Activities of Daily Life. From there, the photos of the original&#xD;
           manual were reused for their reduced version and served as illustrations for the&#xD;
           exercises. This step lasted 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the same period, the researchers conducted the textbook production that provides&#xD;
           a brief explanation with simplified language about the importance of adopting physical&#xD;
           exercise in patients with breast cancer under treatment and its impact on the quality of&#xD;
           life and physical fitness of the patients. Individuals and some guidelines to get into&#xD;
           the habit of regular walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the development process, it was diagrammed to proceed with its printing in reduced&#xD;
           version. This step lasted 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The elderly will undergo evaluations for characterization of the sample (questionnaires,&#xD;
           physical fitness assessment and anthropometric evaluation) before (beginning of the&#xD;
           research), in the 6th week and after the 12th week of the research. In addition, in the&#xD;
           6th week, the patient will attend the sector and demonstrate the accomplishment of any&#xD;
           manual for possible corrections of movement pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The collection for characterization of the sample, evaluations and tests, will be&#xD;
           performed at the IMIP on days agreed with the elderly soon after signing the TCLE. It&#xD;
           will follow the following structuring:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Steps: First step: Characterization data of the sample. Anamnesis and questionnaires&#xD;
           will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Second stage: Anthropometric evaluation. Measurements of weight, height, BMI and body&#xD;
           composition will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Third stage: Screening Pre-evaluation of Signs and Symptoms Acute (Annex 5).&#xD;
           Measurements of resting blood pressure, resting heart rate, and questioning of possible&#xD;
           signs of discomfort will be performed before releasing the patient to perform the&#xD;
           assessments and tests for physical fitness. Patients who present an alteration that&#xD;
           prevents them from proceeding to the next station will be marked a new date for the same&#xD;
           to complete the evaluation procedure, in order to enable participation in the research&#xD;
           and avoid any type of risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fourth stage: Assessment and tests for physical fitness FTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Used tools&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Functional Evaluation For the variables of functional physical fitness, the Senior&#xD;
                Fitness Test (SFT) will be used, in the test and retest regime (minimum interval of&#xD;
                3 and maximum of 8 days between the tests) that is constituted by seven Specific&#xD;
                tests that can measure performance in motor functional abilities on a continuous&#xD;
                range of wide range, from the condition of greater fragility to the highest degree&#xD;
                of functional physical fitness. It assesses the ability to perform functional&#xD;
                movements, such as walking, climbing stairs and getting up, as well as checking the&#xD;
                muscular fitness, endurance, flexibility and balance of the elderly. It is easy to&#xD;
                administer by the evaluators, does not require medical authorization and is very&#xD;
                safe. Each item in the test has follow-up performance standards for men and women&#xD;
                aged 60-94 years. In addition, the FTS provides reference values in each test item&#xD;
                that help identify whether the individual is at risk of loss of mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Anthropometric evaluation The following anthropometric data will be collected A)&#xD;
                Body weight: body mass measurement using TANITA® electronic balance. B) Stature:&#xD;
                greater distance between the vertex and the soil, the individual being in the&#xD;
                orthostatic position; C) Perimeter of abdomen: greater abdominal circumference,&#xD;
                measured with anthropometric tape; D) Percentage of fat: measure of the relative&#xD;
                amount of fat contained in the body. It will be obtained by perimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
           E) Lean body mass index: is the ratio of the lean mass to the square of the height.&#xD;
&#xD;
           F) Body composition shall be measured using bio-impedance&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Quality of life assessment Quality of life will be assessed using the questionnaire of&#xD;
           the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life&#xD;
           Questionnaire &quot;core&quot; 30 items (EORTC-QLQ-C30) 30, version 3.0. This instrument has 30&#xD;
           questions, consisting of five functional scales: physical, cognitive, emotional, social&#xD;
           and role performance; A scale of quality of life and global health; Symptoms of fatigue,&#xD;
           pain, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, lack of appetite, insomnia, constipation and diarrhea&#xD;
           and an item that assesses financial difficulties. The possible responses are: no,&#xD;
           little, moderately and a lot, scored respectively from 1 to 4. Thus the QLQ-C30&#xD;
           generates a score of 0 to 100 on the functional and symptom scales according to the&#xD;
           EORTC score manual. In the functional scale, zero denotes the worst functioning and 100&#xD;
           the best, while the scale of symptoms is the opposite. Being zero with no symptoms and&#xD;
           100 is the maximum of symptoms present.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All data will be collected by the researcher and other properly trained collaborating&#xD;
           professionals who are part of the IMIP Oncology program and IMIP's Postgraduate Program&#xD;
           stricto sensu.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quality control will be done through a variety of mechanisms: standardized forms and&#xD;
           questionnaires, detailed instructions for interviewers and / or evaluators, training of&#xD;
           interviewers and evaluators, review of all forms and questionnaires by fieldwork&#xD;
           supervisors, repetition of questions Of questions that present inconsistency after&#xD;
           review and meetings with all interviewers and / or evaluators whenever questions arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary data that will be used have already been collected and are part of the&#xD;
           research by Souza Filho et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After collecting the data, the collection script will be reviewed and then organized and&#xD;
           entered into a spreadsheet for statistical analysis. After an exploratory analysis of&#xD;
           the data in order to identify if they met normality, using the Kolmogorov Smirnoff test,&#xD;
           the statistical characteristics of the sample and the physical fitness variables will be&#xD;
           performed. If the comparison is normal distribution, Between the two groups will be&#xD;
           performed through the student t test, otherwise the Mann-Withey test will be performed.&#xD;
           To evaluate the pre and post in each group will be performed t Student test paired in&#xD;
           case of normality or the Wilcoxon test. For the comparison between the different groups,&#xD;
           in order to identify the homogeneity between the groups, the equivalence test (Levene&#xD;
           test) will be performed. The results will be obtained from the statistical package SPSS&#xD;
           10.0 for Windows and a p &lt;0.05 will be accepted.&#xD;
