  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients with a significant deficiency of skin sensitivity and reduced mobility are&#xD;
      potentially at risk of Pressure Ulcers (PUs), in particular the persons affected by Spinal&#xD;
      Cord Injury (SCI), also due to their frequent alteration or loss of subcutaneous skin&#xD;
      sensitivity. Pressure sores are one of the most common and fearful complications in SCI, with&#xD;
      a severe impact on quality of life and on care health costs. They are often the cause of&#xD;
      lengthening the time of hospitalization, slowing down clinical and rehabilitation programs&#xD;
      and re-hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PUs, when arisen, heal slowly and, despite the protracted conservative medical therapies,&#xD;
      sometimes they do not come to complete healing. Sometimes plastic surgery is needed, although&#xD;
      even after it recurrence rates remain high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further treatments have been proposed in addition to the usual medication, however they are&#xD;
      characterized by a certain degree of invasiveness and are often conditioned by the&#xD;
      availability of specific and sometimes expensive equipment, as well as by the presence of&#xD;
      highly qualified personnel. In general, there is also a lack of good quality clinical trials&#xD;
      for assessing their effectiveness and safety and they are often not decisive, especially for&#xD;
      severe and recalcitrant ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among alternative techniques for the healing of skin ulcers in general, the adhesive elastic&#xD;
      bandage, also known as &quot;kinesio taping&quot; and already recognized for the treatment of edema,&#xD;
      hematoma and scarring, has been proposed. However, specific protocols and published studies&#xD;
      are not available for PUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Montecatone Rehabilitation Institute, that hosts the largest Spinal Unit in Italy, pays&#xD;
      great attention to the prevention and treatment of PUs in both acute and chronic patients.&#xD;
      The rationale for the taping positioning around PUs investigated in this study is to improve&#xD;
      lymphatic drainage and reactivation of the superficial bloodstream by increasing interstitial&#xD;
      spaces and reducing skin and subcutaneous compression, notoriously compromised in the areas&#xD;
      of onset of pressure sores. The total shortage in the literature and in user manuals of&#xD;
      taping protocols for PUs supports this preliminary, exploratory, descriptive and uncontrolled&#xD;
      pilot study with the primary aim of verifying the safety of a taping treatment for&#xD;
      medium/severe grade PUs, &quot;add-on&quot; to the usual care. The choice of the ulcer sites selected&#xD;
      (sacral and heel) has been affected by the feasibility of tape positioning.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All patients with a significant deficiency of skin sensitivity and reduced mobility are&#xD;
      potentially at risk of Pressure Ulcers (PUs), in particular the persons affected by Spinal&#xD;
      Cord Injury (SCI), also due to their frequent alteration or loss of subcutaneous skin&#xD;
      sensitivity. More than one-third of individuals hospitalized in Spinal Units for&#xD;
      rehabilitative treatments following a SCI develop PUs during acute hospitalization and it was&#xD;
      also estimated that up to 85% of SCI persons develop at least one PU in the course of their&#xD;
      lives. Pressure sores are therefore one of the most common and fearful complications in SCI,&#xD;
      with a severe impact on quality of life and on care health costs. They are often the cause of&#xD;
      lengthening the time of hospitalization, slowing down clinical and rehabilitation programs&#xD;
      and re-hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PUs, when arisen, heal slowly and, despite the protracted conservative medical therapies,&#xD;
      sometimes they do not come to complete healing. Sometimes plastic surgery is needed, although&#xD;
      even after it recurrence rates remain high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional treatment of PUs consists in the use of advanced dressings that may vary&#xD;
      depending on the degree of staging of the lesion, its extent and the presence of clinical&#xD;
      signs of necrosis and/or deep soft tissue infection. In addition to dressings, treatment&#xD;
      cycles with intermittent negative pressure therapy can be indicated and the surgical approach&#xD;
      (toilets + plastic reconstruction) could be reserved to chronic lesions with no response to&#xD;
      traditional dressings or in the case of underlying osteomyelitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative treatments (e.g. electrotherapy, pulsed electromagnetic fields, ultraviolet&#xD;
      light, infrared radiation, laser therapy, ultrasound, shock waves) have been proposed in&#xD;
      addition to the usual medication, however they are characterized by a certain degree of&#xD;
      invasiveness and are often conditioned by the availability of specific and sometimes&#xD;
      expensive equipment, as well as by the presence of highly qualified personnel. In general,&#xD;
      there is also a lack of good quality clinical trials for assessing the effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of such techniques that are often not decisive for healing, especially for severe and&#xD;
      recalcitrant lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among alternative techniques for the healing of skin ulcers in general, the adhesive elastic&#xD;
      bandage, also known as &quot;kinesio taping&quot; or &quot;neuro taping&quot; and already recognized for the&#xD;
      treatment of edema, hematoma and scarring, has been proposed. However, specific protocols and&#xD;
      published studies are not available for PUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Montecatone Rehabilitation Institute hosts the largest Spinal Unit in Italy as for number&#xD;
      of beds and patients admitted. In addition to the intensive rehabilitation of SCI patients,&#xD;
      great attention is paid to the prevention and treatment of PUs in both acute and chronic&#xD;
      patients, involving physicians, physiotherapists and nurses. Some Physical Therapists of the&#xD;
      Hospital are trained and experienced in the use of adhesive elastic bandage for various&#xD;
      neuromuscular applications and a physiotherapy/nursing team has conceived, under medical&#xD;
      supervision, the taping protocol for the PUs therapy proposed in this study. The rationale&#xD;
      for such a taping positioning around PUs is to improve lymphatic drainage and reactivation of&#xD;
      the superficial bloodstream by increasing interstitial spaces and reducing skin and&#xD;
      subcutaneous compression, notoriously compromised in the areas of onset of pressure sores.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is considered that, thanks to the normalization of blood and lymphatic flow,&#xD;
      the proposed protocol may have a facilitating action to heal such lesions, especially if they&#xD;
      are severe and recalcitrant to normal therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total shortage in the literature and in user manuals of taping protocols for PUs supports&#xD;
      this preliminary, exploratory, descriptive and uncontrolled pilot study with the primary aim&#xD;
      of verifying the safety of a taping treatment for medium/severe grade PUs, &quot;add-on&quot; to the&#xD;
      usual care. The choice of the ulcer sites selected (sacral and heel) has been affected by the&#xD;
      feasibility of tape positioning.&#xD;
