    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well nivolumab with or with ipilimumab&#xD;
      works in treating patients with liver cancer that can be removed by surgery. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of therapy with nivolumab alone or nivolumab +&#xD;
      ipilimumab in resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the context of presurgical&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of therapy with nivolumab + ipilimumab in&#xD;
      potentially resectable HCC in the context of pre-biopsy therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy of presurgical nivolumab alone or nivolumab + ipilimumab therapy in&#xD;
      HCC by estimating the objective response rate (ORR) and time to progression (TTP) per&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the conversion rate to surgery for arm 3 potentially resectable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the immunological/biomarker changes in tumor tissues and peripheral blood in&#xD;
      response to nivolumab alone or nivolumab + ipilimumab in HCC therapy (pre- versus [vs]&#xD;
      post-treatment), and explore any potential association between these biomarker measures and&#xD;
      antitumor response and immune-related response criteria (iRC) assessed by MD Anderson&#xD;
      department of diagnostic imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients with resectable tumors are randomized to 1 of 2 arms and patients with&#xD;
      potentially resectable tumors are assigned to Arm C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 2 weeks for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo liver surgery on day 1 of week 7. Beginning 4 weeks&#xD;
      after surgery, patients continue nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 4 weeks for up to 2 years&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and nivolumab as Arm A.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 3 cycles for nivolumab in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo liver surgery on day 1 of week 7.&#xD;
      Beginning 4 weeks after surgery, patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes every 6 weeks&#xD;
      and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 4 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C: Patients receive ipilimumab and nivolumab as in Arm B. Patients undergo post-treatment&#xD;
      biopsy on day 1 of week 7, then receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes every 6 weeks and&#xD;
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 4 weeks for up to 3 additional cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 4 weeks after surgery, patients&#xD;
      receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes every 6 weeks and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 4&#xD;
      weeks up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 100 days, then every&#xD;
      9 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
