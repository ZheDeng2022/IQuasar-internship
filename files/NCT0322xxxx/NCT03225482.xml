  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of older Veterans with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) seeking care within the&#xD;
      Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system is increasing and is expected to increase more&#xD;
      rapidly as Vietnam era Veterans age. The cognitive effects of MCI and subsequent&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disorders can adversely affect a Veteran's ability to function&#xD;
      independently and failure to provide appropriate intervention can result in an increased need&#xD;
      for healthcare services and VA benefits in the future. The VA currently spends over $19,000&#xD;
      annually per patient to care for Veterans with dementia (Zhu et al., 2009), and delaying the&#xD;
      onset of dementia even by one to two years will result in substantial financial savings to&#xD;
      the VA and quality of life gains for the Veteran. Since present pharmacological interventions&#xD;
      have demonstrated limited efficacy, alternative treatments are needed. Therefore, an&#xD;
      evidence-based cognitive training intervention that optimally addresses the needs of older&#xD;
      Veterans with MCI is of critical importance to the VA patient care mission.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the aging of the United States population, age-related cognitive problems resulting&#xD;
      from Alzheimer's disease and other causes of dementia are increasingly prevalent. Before&#xD;
      individuals are diagnosed with dementia, they typically exhibit a period of &quot;mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment&quot; (MCI). Mild cognitive problems associated with MCI frequently impact an&#xD;
      individual's ability to perform everyday tasks, including working, independent living, and&#xD;
      medication adherence. Veterans are at increased risk of cognitive decline, and the Veterans&#xD;
      Healthcare Administration (VA) is now providing health care to surging numbers of older&#xD;
      Veterans with MCI who report significant cognitive complaints, difficulties with everyday&#xD;
      functioning, and concerns about impending dementia. Despite high patient demand, few&#xD;
      cognitive rehabilitation interventions exist that specifically address the needs of older&#xD;
      Veterans with MCI that are widely accessible, patient-centered, and evidence-based. To the&#xD;
      investigators' knowledge, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted that evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of manualized, brief and inexpensive, yet comprehensive (multi-modal) cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation interventions for older Veterans with MCI. Hence, the primary objective of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Motivationally Enhanced Compensatory Cognitive&#xD;
      Training (ME-CCT), a manualized cognitive rehabilitation group treatment for older Veterans&#xD;
      with MCI. The study's specific aims are to determine whether ME-CCT is effective for: 1)&#xD;
      improving objective cognitive performance and functional capacity, 2) improving subjective&#xD;
      cognitive complaints, subjective functioning, and collateral measures of everyday function,&#xD;
      and 3) increasing modifiable protective factors (e.g., diet, exercise) associated with&#xD;
      reduced risk for MCI. The investigators will also explore mediators and moderators of&#xD;
      treatment effects. The overall goal is to evaluate a manualized group treatment for the&#xD;
      symptoms of MCI that can be readily implemented in VA treatment settings. The study design&#xD;
      makes use of the convergent availability of resources at the two participating VA Healthcare&#xD;
      Systems in San Diego, California and Portland, Oregon to conduct a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial of ME-CCT. The study will recruit a sample of 216 Veterans (108 at each site) who meet&#xD;
      criteria for MCI. Inclusion criteria will be: 1) Veterans 55 years old or older enrolled at&#xD;
      one of the participating VAs who are able to provide informed consent, 2) Independently&#xD;
      living, 3) Meet criteria for MCI based on previously published criteria (Petersen, 2004;&#xD;
      Petersen, 2011), and 4) Willingness to participate in audio-recorded group sessions.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will be: 1) Current substance use disorder with less than 30 days&#xD;
      abstinence, 2) History of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or other primary psychotic&#xD;
      disorder, 3) History of significant head trauma with loss of consciousness &gt;30 minutes, and&#xD;
      4) Auditory or visual impairments that would prevent ability to participate in the cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation group. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either the ME-CCT or&#xD;
      an active control group, Goal-focused Supportive Contact (SC). The SC group will provide the&#xD;
      same frequency and amount of therapist and peer contact as ME-CCT, but without specific&#xD;
      training in cognitive strategies, lifestyle strategies, or motivational enhancement. 8 2-hour&#xD;
      long weekly sessions will be delivered in both conditions. Both groups will undergo&#xD;
      evaluations at baseline, 4 weeks (midway through the intervention), 8 weeks (immediately&#xD;
      following the end of the intervention), and 21 weeks (3 months after completion of the&#xD;
      intervention).&#xD;
