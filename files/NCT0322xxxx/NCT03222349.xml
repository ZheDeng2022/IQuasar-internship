      Open-label study to assess the pharmacokinetics of a single diazepam buccal film (DBF) dose&#xD;
      in 3 age cohorts of pediatric patients with epilepsy (age 2-5 years, age 6-11 years, and age&#xD;
      12-16 years). Subjects in the 6-11 years and 12-16 years age cohorts received a single DBF&#xD;
      dose during the interictal period (Period A) and ictal/peri-ictal period (Period B) with at&#xD;
      least 14 days washout between doses. Subjects in the age 2-5 years age cohort received a&#xD;
      single DBF dose only during the ictal/peri-ictal period (Period B).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2 multicenter, open-label, two-way study conducted in male and female&#xD;
      pediatric subjects (aged 2 to 16 years) with a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy who were&#xD;
      scheduled to be admitted to an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU), a general clinical research&#xD;
      center (GCRC), or similar facility for evaluation of seizures and who complied with all&#xD;
      remaining protocol eligibility criteria. To ensure that 16 to 18 subjects would complete the&#xD;
      study across 3 age ranges (2 to 5 years, 6 to 11 years, and 12 to 16 years), a minimum of 24&#xD;
      subjects were to be enrolled (8 in each age cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the 6 to 11 years and 12 to 16 years age cohorts received a single dose of DBF&#xD;
      during the interictal period (Period A) and ictal/peri-ictal period (Period B) with at least&#xD;
      14 days washout between doses. Subjects in the age 2 to 5 years age cohort received a single&#xD;
      dose of DBF only during the ictal/peri-ictal period (Period B). DBF was provided in a range&#xD;
      of doses from 5 to 17.5 mg. The appropriate dose of DBF was assigned on the basis of age and&#xD;
      weight using an interactive web response system during check-in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period A (interictal administration): Subjects were considered to be in an interictal state&#xD;
      if an interval of at least 3 hours had elapsed since any clinically observable postictal&#xD;
      signs or symptoms (from the last observed seizure) and the subject had been seizure-free over&#xD;
      this period. Subjects on electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring were to be considered to be in&#xD;
      an interictal state if an interval of at least 3 hours had elapsed since there were any&#xD;
      postictal electrical findings on EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period B (ictal/peri-ictal administration): For the purpose of this study, the ictal state&#xD;
      was defined as an ongoing clinically observable seizure or seizure activity as verified via&#xD;
      EEG. The peri-ictal state was defined clinically as the subject's immediate postictal state&#xD;
      following a generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizure or focal seizure with impaired awareness,&#xD;
      and within 5 minutes following the last clonic jerk. For subjects on EEG monitoring, the&#xD;
      peri-ictal state was to be defined as less than 5 minutes after cessation of seizure activity&#xD;
      as verified via EEG.&#xD;

             marijuana product was part of the subject's treatment plan as recommended by a&#xD;
             physician for treatment of a medical condition. In such case, the subject was to be&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Planned enrollment was 24 male and female subjects with 8 subjects in each of 3 age ranges (2 to 5 years, 6 to 11 years, and 12 to 16 years) with a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy (generalized tonic clonic seizures or focal seizures with impaired awareness) currently receiving at least one epileptic medication who were scheduled for admission to an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU), General Clinical Research Center (GCRC), or similar facility for evaluation.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 24 subjects were enrolled and received at least 1 dose of study drug based on age and weight during the interictal and the ictal/peri-ictal period in either order as determined by seizure occurrence.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Interictal State, Then Ictal/Peri-ictal State</title>
          <description>The interictal state was defined as a period of time during which 3 hours had elapsed since any clinical postictal signs or symptoms (from the last observed seizure). If clinical and/or electroencephalogram monitoring showed no seizure activity, the subject received DBF single dose determined by age and body weight.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Ictal/Peri-ictal State, Then Interictal State</title>
          <description>The ictal/peri-ictal state was defined as an ongoing clinically observable seizure or seizure activity as verified via EEG. The peri-ictal state was defined as the subject's immediate postictal state following a generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizure or focal seizure with impaired awareness, and within 5 minutes after the last clonic jerk. For subjects on EEG monitoring, the peri-ictal state could be defined as less than 5 minutes after cessation of seizure activity (GTC or focal seizure with impaired awareness) as verified via EEG.</description>
