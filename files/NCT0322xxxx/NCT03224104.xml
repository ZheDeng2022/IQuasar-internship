  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Group A will be composed of newly-diagnosed, elderly patients with IDH1R132H-non mutant and&#xD;
      MGMT promoter-unmethylated anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma who will receive TG02 and&#xD;
      RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B will be composed of newly-diagnosed, elderly patients with IDH1R132H-non mutant and&#xD;
      MGMT promoter-methylated anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma who will receive TG02 and&#xD;
      temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both Groups A and B, there will be a classical 3+3 dose escalation and an expansion phase&#xD;
      in the study. Up to a total of 24 evaluable patients in Group A and up to a total of 12&#xD;
      evaluable patients in Group B (up to 36 evaluable patients for Groups A and B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C patients will be composed of patients initially diagnosed with IDH1R132H-non-mutant&#xD;
      anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma at first relapse post TMZ/RT--&gt;TMZ therapy who will&#xD;

             immunohistochemistry locally assessed, with FFPE tissue available for central MGMT&#xD;
             testing and optional biomarker studies (treatment allocation will be performed based&#xD;
             on centrally assessed MGMT result)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor debulking surgery, including partial resection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 65 and considered non-eligible for combination therapy (TMZ/RTâ†’TMZ) in&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Brain MRI within 14 days before the first dose of TG02&#xD;
&#xD;
        Specifics for group C&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IDH1R132H-non-mutant glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse with&#xD;

             than 55 years of age at diagnosis with a histological diagnosis of glioblastoma,&#xD;
             without a pre-existing lower grade glioma and with non-midline tumor location,&#xD;
             immunohistochemical negativity for IDH1R132H suffices for classification as&#xD;
             glioblastoma. In all other instances of diffuse gliomas, lack of IDH1R132H&#xD;
