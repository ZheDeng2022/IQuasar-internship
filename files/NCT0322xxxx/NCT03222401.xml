  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 24 healthy male volunteers between the ages of 18 and 35 years will be enrolled&#xD;
      at a single center for a duration of two months for each subject. Subjects who meet the&#xD;
      enrollment criteria will be randomized to one of four open-label groups: Control (no&#xD;
      treatment) or treatment with F598 at one of three doses. Following F598 administration or&#xD;
      assignment to the Control group, subjects must return to the study site for inoculation with&#xD;
      N. gonorrhoeae within 2 weeks. Once subjects have been inoculated with N. gonorrhoeae, they&#xD;
      will enter the observation phase and will return to the study site daily for up to 5 days. At&#xD;
      the end of the observation phase, definitive antibiotic therapy will be administered. A&#xD;
      follow-up visit will be conducted 3-5 days after definitive antibiotic and a confirmatory&#xD;
      interaction will occur with the subjects 7-10 days after the follow-up to confirm the&#xD;
      subject's response. A final visit will occur approximately 8 weeks after inoculation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is comprised of 8 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening (Visits 1 and 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. F598 administration (Visit 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Inoculation (Visit 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Observation (Visits 5 - 8, as needed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Definitive antibiotic treatment (Visit 9)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Test of cure (Visit 10)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Confirmatory interaction (Visit 11)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Final pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD)/anti-drug antibody determination (Visit&#xD;
           12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of standardization, Day 1 of the study will be considered the day of&#xD;
      inoculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Screening phase, prospective subjects will undergo informed consent and will be&#xD;
      reviewed for their compatibility with the eligibility criteria. Those subjects who meet all&#xD;
      of the Inclusion criteria and none of the Exclusion criteria will be enrolled. Following&#xD;
      enrollment, subjects must undergo a repeat urine screen for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae&#xD;
      and T. vaginalis (Days -17 to -4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the second urine screening test is negative, subjects will enter the F598 administration&#xD;
      phase. Subjects will return to the study site and will be randomized to one of four&#xD;
      open-label groups: Control (no treatment) or treatment with F598 at one of three doses.&#xD;
      Following F598 administration or assignment to the Control group, subjects must return to the&#xD;
      study site for inoculation with N. gonorrhoeae within 2 weeks. Thus, F598 will be&#xD;
      administered on any one of Days -12 to -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the inoculation phase, subjects will return to the study site and receive an inoculum&#xD;
      of N. gonorrhoeae in the anterior urethra. A third and final urine screen for C. trachomatis,&#xD;
      N. gonorrhoeae and T. vaginalis will be obtained immediately before inoculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once subjects have been inoculated with N. gonorrhoeae, they will enter the observation phase&#xD;
      and will return to the study site daily for up to 5 days for a physical examination (in&#xD;
      particular, for evidence of urethral discharge) and a urine sample for evidence of infection&#xD;
      (NAAT and culture) as well as blood for F598 PK/PD and safety labs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observation phase will end and definitive antibiotic therapy will be administered when&#xD;
      any one of four criteria is met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The subject requests antibiotic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The subject is found to by symptomatic (discharge, urethral discomfort)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The subject has reached Day 6 of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, depending on the circumstances, definitive antibiotic therapy can be administered&#xD;
      between Days 2 - 6, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up visit at the study site will be conducted 3 - 5 days after definitive antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy has been administered to ensure treatment response. Thus, depending on when the&#xD;
      subject received antibiotics, this visit could occur between Days 5 - 11, inclusive. A&#xD;
      physical examination will be performed and urine for evidence of infection (NAAT) as well as&#xD;
      blood for F598 PK/PD will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A confirmatory interaction with the subject will occur at the study site 7 - 10 days after&#xD;
      the follow-up visit to confirm the subject's response and answer any questions the subject&#xD;
      may have. Thus, depending on when the subject had his follow-up visit, the confirmatory visit&#xD;
      could occur between Days 12 - 21, inclusive. Blood for F598 PK/PD, anti-F598 antibodies and&#xD;
      safety labs will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final visit will occur approximately 8 weeks after inoculation (days 52 - 60) to obtain&#xD;
      serum for PK/PD and anti-F598 antibodies.&#xD;
