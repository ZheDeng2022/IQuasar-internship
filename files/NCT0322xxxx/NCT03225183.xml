      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) was initiated by the U.S Public Health Service in 1948 and&#xD;
      turned over to the newly established National Heart Institute in 1951. The FHS is now jointly&#xD;
      led by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Boston University. The FHS currently&#xD;
      studies risk factors, and the genetics of heart and blood vessel disease, and other health&#xD;
      conditions in three generations of study participants. Scientists want to use the data&#xD;
      collected from this study to do more research. They want to use a technique that determines&#xD;
      the sequence of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study genes related to certain diseases and health conditions. These include heart and&#xD;
      blood vessel diseases, lung and blood diseases, stroke, memory loss, and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People in the FHS Third Generation cohort who already attended exam 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will study samples that have already been collected in the FHS. There will be no&#xD;
      active examination or burden to participants. During FHS visits, participants gave blood&#xD;
      samples. They gave permission for the blood to be used for genetic research. RNA will be&#xD;
      generated from the samples. They will be given a new ID separate from any personal data. They&#xD;
      will be stored in a secure FHS lab. The samples will be analyzed. Only certified researchers&#xD;
      can access them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study participants will be contacted in relation to this project.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful tool to evaluate the transcriptome with incredible&#xD;
      depth and clarity. As compared to gene expression arrays, RNA-seq allows the identification&#xD;
      and quantification of a larger set of known transcripts (including long non-coding RNAs&#xD;
      [lncRNAs]), novel transcripts, alternative splicing events, and allele-specific expression&#xD;
      (including parent-of-origin allele-specific expression); all with a vastly higher&#xD;
      signal-to-noise ratio compared to gene expression profiling via microarrays. The relations of&#xD;
      these transcriptomic features to health and disease in very large population studies is&#xD;
      underexplored. It is our belief that this proposed project will identify new biomarkers of&#xD;
      disease risk and provide insights into disease pathogenesis. The Framingham Heart Study (FHS)&#xD;
      is uniquely suited to conduct RNA-seq because of the wealth of existing phenotype resources&#xD;
      in conjunction with whole genome sequence (WGS) data from TOPMed and methylomic data, data&#xD;
      and other omics data that can be leveraged at extremely low cost to maximize the impact of an&#xD;
      investment in RNA-seq.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advent of high-throughput RNA-seq technology has revolutionized transcriptomic profiling&#xD;
      at an unprecedented scale, leading to the discovery of new RNA species and deepening our&#xD;
      understanding of transcriptomic dynamics. Compared to microarray-based RNA profiling, RNA-seq&#xD;
      is appreciated for its ability to reveal the complexity of the transcriptome, encompassing&#xD;
      previously unknown coding and lncRNA species, novel transcribed regions, alternative&#xD;
      splicing, allele-specific expression, and fusion genes This project proposes to build upon&#xD;
      and extend the work conducted using gene expression arrays in the FHS by examining complex&#xD;
      transcriptomic features that cannot be determined using microarray-based expression data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposal we focus on expression levels of protein-coding RNAs, lncRNAs, alternative&#xD;
      splicing, and allele-specific expression. There are ~18,000 mRNA transcripts at the&#xD;
      gene-level for protein-coding RNAs. Alternative splicing is a tightly regulated process that&#xD;
      produces different mRNA isoforms from genes that contain multiple exons. One major&#xD;
      application of RNA-seq is to detect even subtle differences in exon splicing. lncRNAs are&#xD;
      non-protein coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides and have been implicated in many&#xD;
      biological process. For example, some lncRNAs impact the expression of nearby protein-coding&#xD;
      genes, some can bind to enzymes regulating transcription patterns, and other lncRNAs are&#xD;
      precursors of small RNAs. A number of computational methods have been developed to detect&#xD;
      alternative splicing and lncRNAs from RNA-seq data. Identification of alternative splicing&#xD;
      and lncRNAs will be standardized across TOPMed studies and we will conduct analyses on&#xD;
      centrally called splice data as well as lncRNAs. Allele-specific expression (ASE), which&#xD;
      cannot be measured using microarrays, allows the differentiation between transcripts from the&#xD;
      two haplotypes of an individual at heterozygous sites. ASE enables a more granular&#xD;
      understanding of how a disease-related genotype affects gene expression. ASE has been linked&#xD;
      to human disease in small sample sets but has not been examined fully in large populations.&#xD;
      Standard&#xD;
&#xD;
      bioinformatics tools have been developed to study ASE. In addition, with TOPMed WGS data on&#xD;
      parents from the FHS Offspring cohort, it will be possible to study parent-of-origin ASE,&#xD;
      thus furthering our ability to dissect factors that contribute to the transgenerational&#xD;
      inheritance of cardiometabolic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this Application, we propose to extend the investigation of transcriptomics in FHS Third&#xD;
      Generation cohort exam 2 participants. The aims of conducting RNA-seq in the FHS Third&#xD;
      Generation cohort mirror and extend those of our original microarray-based gene expression&#xD;
      profiling. Specifically, we will examine the association of complex transcriptomic variation&#xD;
      to: 1) cardiometabolic disease outcomes, 2) genetic sequence variation, and 3) multiple&#xD;
      layers of omic data (Aims 1-3). With the proposed RNA-seq data, investigators as well as the&#xD;
      general scientific community (via dbGaP access) will have the ability to study&#xD;
      transcriptomics from different perspectives always leveraging existing resources to advance&#xD;
      the scientific value of this project. To maximize the return on investment, sequencing will&#xD;
      be performed by a designated TOPMed RNA-seq laboratory, and the aims of this project will be&#xD;
      coordinated with other&#xD;
&#xD;
      TOPMed studies that are conducting RNA-seq.&#xD;

&#xD;
        To accomplish the Aims of this project we propose to conduct RNA-seq on FHS Third&#xD;
        Generation cohort participants with WGS as part of TOPMed. This can only be accomplished in&#xD;
        FHS Third Generation cohort participants who attended exam 2 when PaxGene tubes were&#xD;
        collected for RNA isolation. Therefore, we propose to conduct RNA-seq on FHS Third&#xD;
        Generation cohort exam 2 attendees with PaxGene tubes (total n=3300) and in whom we will&#xD;
        have direct or imputed WGS from TOPMed (n=1700).&#xD;
