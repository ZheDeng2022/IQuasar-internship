  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares two methodologies for improving access to medication assisted treatment&#xD;
      (MAT) in Ohio courts where MAT is currently restricted or prohibited. All participating&#xD;
      courts are asked to view two educational modules. Module 1 addresses the nature of opioid&#xD;
      addiction and treatment. Module 2 addresses concerns specific to criminal justice such as&#xD;
      misuse and diversion of medications. Courts selected for the experimental group also receive&#xD;
      a hands-on change team initiative in which specially trained professionals work with court&#xD;
      staff to provide education and instrumental assistance in order to improve access to MAT for&#xD;
      court supervisees who are opioid-dependent.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there is robust evidence for the efficacy of medication assisted treatment (MAT),&#xD;
      e.g., buprenorphine, extended-release naltrexone, methadone, this evidence-based treatment&#xD;
      (EBT) is not available for the majority of opioid dependent clients (ODCs) in the criminal&#xD;
      justice (CJ) population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent survey of drug courts our group found that less than half include MAT as a&#xD;
      treatment option for their ODCs. Moreover among the minority of courts that do permit MAT, it&#xD;
      is typically restricted. Responses by drug court personnel revealed serious concerns about&#xD;
      diversion, misuse, and uncertainty about the efficacy of MAT, especially among courts in&#xD;
      which MAT was unavailable. Despite these barriers, 70% of the courts indicated that with&#xD;
      proper evidence MAT could be considered or expanded as a treatment option. To increase court&#xD;
      professionals' understanding of MAT and facilitate decisions on whether MAT would be an&#xD;
      appropriate treatment, we proposed a Stage I study to develop and test the feasibility of&#xD;
      using an eLearning and an eLearning + a behavioral change team intervention, an Addiction&#xD;
      Technology Transfer Center - ATTC - Technology Transfer [TT] model, to advance knowledge and&#xD;
      facilitate inclusion of MAT as a treatment option in the criminal justice system (CJS) for&#xD;
      ODCs. To enhance the eLearning modality we included testimonials from opinion leaders/early&#xD;
      adopters of MAT (e.g., a drug court judge, a representative from the National Association of&#xD;
      Drug Court Professionals, and treatment providers) who addressed specific concerns such as&#xD;
      methods to identify qualified MAT providers, appraise treatment plans, and prevent and&#xD;
      minimize negative effects of diversion and misuse. The behavioral change intervention will be&#xD;
      based on a model of process improvement developed by the ATTC Network5 to expand treatment&#xD;
      options for the management of opioid dependence, in this case MAT. The planned program&#xD;
      represents the first study to: 1) include testimonials by opinion leaders in conjunction with&#xD;
      an eLearning approach to spur inclusion of an evidence-based intervention for the treatment&#xD;
      of opioid dependence within a criminal justice (CJ) setting and; 2) adapt the ATTC TT model&#xD;
      to the specific goal of facilitating inclusion of MAT as a treatment option. Specific aims of&#xD;
      the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Develop an eLearning (web-based) intervention that will provide information about&#xD;
      risks and benefits of MAT to help drug and felony court staff determine whether MAT is&#xD;
      suitable for their clients. The protocol will include group discussions with both&#xD;
      MAT-friendly and MAT-averse court personnel and inclusion of a MAT Advisory Panel (MAP), a&#xD;
      team of experts in the implementation of MAT in CJ settings. Through an iterative process&#xD;
      (review/revisions by MAT experts and court staff) we will develop a consensual outline&#xD;
      representing topics that would be addressed by our web-based intervention. The objective will&#xD;
      be to provide a balanced, thorough presentation of both benefits and risks of MAT provision&#xD;
      and will specifically seek to address concerns about MAT provision such as diversion and&#xD;
      misuse. Informed by diffusion of innovations theory, the eLearning modules will be enhanced&#xD;
      by including testimony of criminal justice professionals about their experiences with MAT in&#xD;
      their courtrooms, what their concerns had been prior to MAT adoption by their court, and how&#xD;
      ￼these concerns (and other obstacles that emerged) were addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ￼ Aim 2. Develop a TT intervention to facilitate Courts' readiness and resources to engage in&#xD;
      case-by-case inquiries to determine whether and under what circumstances to permit MAT.&#xD;
      Working with ATTC TT experts we will develop a change team (CT) intervention for court&#xD;
      representatives and treatment providers (including Judge, coordinator, administrator, and&#xD;
      case-managers). The objective of the proposed CT intervention will be to: 1) Broker&#xD;
      relationships between MAT providers and courts; ensuring that MAT providers will accept court&#xD;
      referred individuals; 2) Reinforce the educational objectives - including addressing in&#xD;
      substantive ways issues of availability, access (including cost), misuse, and diversion -&#xD;
      with court personnel in order to expand policy and practice to include MAT; 3) Work with&#xD;
      local MAT and other treatment providers to help create an environment in which MAT is&#xD;
      accepted as part of the constellation of available treatments; 4) help develop protocols such&#xD;
      as assertive ongoing monitoring and support to assure that MAT benefits are sustained once a&#xD;
      client has been referred to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Conduct a small-scale trial to evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of the eLearning&#xD;
      intervention, and the eLearning + change team intervention (TT-intervention). Targeting&#xD;
      courts that either do not place their ODCs in MAT or tightly restrict MAT access, 24 courts&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment conditions: 1. Treatment as usual, followed by&#xD;
      the eLearning intervention, or 2. eLearning intervention followed by the CT intervention.&#xD;
      Outcomes include 1) the rate of enrollment of clients in MAT; 2) rate of referral of clients&#xD;
      to MAT; 3) MAT Knowledge, 4) Willingness to use MAT, and 5) Barriers to MAT. We expect this&#xD;
      development/pilot project will lead to a protocol to implement an EBT in the CJS; a setting&#xD;
      with high numbers of ODCs.&#xD;
