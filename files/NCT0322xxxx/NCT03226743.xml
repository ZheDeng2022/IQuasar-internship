      The aims of COMET are the implementation and evaluation of effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness as well as processes of a collaborative and stepped care model for&#xD;
      depressive, anxiety, somatoform and/or alcohol abuse disorders within a multiprofessional&#xD;
      network in comparison to routine care. In a cluster-randomized controlled effectiveness trial&#xD;
      570 patients will be recruited by 38 general practitioner practices and followed with a&#xD;
      prospective survey at four time points. The primary outcome is the change in health-related&#xD;
      quality of life from baseline to 6-months follow-up. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      disorder-specific symptom burden, response, remission, functional quality of life,&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness, evaluation of processes and other clinical and psychosocial variables.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aims are a) the implementation and outcome evaluation, b) the process evaluation, and c) the&#xD;
      analysis of the cost-effectiveness of an innovative collaborative and stepped care model for&#xD;
      patients with depressive, anxiety, somatoform and/or alcohol abuse disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its novelty is the integration of these four disorders into one model. This approach is based&#xD;
      on a) the high comorbidity between these disorders, b) the fact that they share a common&#xD;
      etiological and diag-nostic basis, c) that similar evidence-based treatment options exist for&#xD;
      them (e.g., self-help and psychoeducation, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy), and d) that&#xD;
      health care providers need to manage them together very often.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conceptual basis follows the principles of evidence-based medicine with a specific focus&#xD;
      on guideline implementation and the principles of patient-centered care including access,&#xD;
      coordination and continuity of care, patient information, patient involvement and&#xD;
      empowerment. Based on a multi-professional cooperation of health care providers across&#xD;
      different care sectors an integrated health care network consisting of general practitioners&#xD;
      (GPs), mental health specialists (psychiatrists, psychotherapists) and inpatient facilities&#xD;
      will be established. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and pathways of care with&#xD;
      treatment options of varying intensity form the clinical and procedural basis of the network,&#xD;
      including low-intensity treatments and e-mental health technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned as a randomized controlled effectiveness trial of a consecutive sample&#xD;
      of patients with depressive and/or anxiety and/or somatoform and/or alcohol abuse disorders&#xD;
      drawn from primary care (GP practices) and followed with a prospective survey at four time&#xD;
      points. The study is intended to recruit a total of 570 patients from 38 GP practices. A&#xD;
      cluster-randomization at the level of participating GP practices divides GPs into the&#xD;
      intervention group, where patients are treated within a multi-professional collaborative and&#xD;
      stepped care approach (including low-intensity treatments, direct access to mental health&#xD;
      specialists, inpatient care etc., COMET), and the control group, where patients receive&#xD;
      standard care (treatment as usual, TAU). Data collection is carried out with questionnaires&#xD;
      as well as telephone interviews at four time-standardized measurement points within one year&#xD;
      (baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months). Additionally, independent research assistants perform&#xD;
      standardized diagnostic interviews (CIDI) with patients at baseline to allow an assessment of&#xD;
      diagnostic validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main research hypothesis is that the COMET model is more effective than TAU. Primary&#xD;
      outcome is the change in health-related quality of life measured by the SF-36 mental health&#xD;
      score from baseline to 6-months follow-up. Secondary outcomes include symptom burden of&#xD;
      depressive, generalized anxiety, panic, somatoform and alcohol abuse syndromes (PHQ-9; GAD-7;&#xD;
      PHQ-15; PHQ panic and alcohol abuse syndrome module; SSD-12), disorder-specific response and&#xD;
      remission, functional quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), duration of untreated illness, and other&#xD;
      clinical and psychosocial variables (outcome evaluation, Work Package 1). Furthermore, direct&#xD;
      and indirect costs and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be assessed (economic&#xD;
      evaluation, Work Package 2). Finally, feasibility and acceptance of the COMET model as well&#xD;
      as of the different treatment components are assessed, including the implementation process&#xD;
      (process evaluation, Work Package 3). To this end, semi-structured interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted at two measurement points, supplemented by standardized surveys among involved&#xD;
      patients and providers.&#xD;
