  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the use of MRI simulations to plan&#xD;
      different doses of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to the standard IMRT dose in&#xD;
      patients with low risk human papilloma virus positive oropharyngeal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. MRI simulations and radiation therapy are delivered using&#xD;
      FDA-approved and commercially available methods. The use of MRI imaging to plan the dose is&#xD;
      investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 75 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Baseline Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study and agree, you will have a&#xD;
      baseline visit. The following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a hearing test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a dental exam. During this exam, your saliva flow will be measured and you&#xD;
           will be checked for lockjaw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your swallowing function will be tested with a special type of x-ray called a modified&#xD;
           barium swallow (MBS). During the test, you will eat and drink foods and liquids mixed&#xD;
           with a &quot;contrast&quot; chemical called barium that will make your throat more visible in the&#xD;
           x-rays. A special x-ray tube will be connected to a television screen to allow the&#xD;
           doctor to watch the foods and liquids pass from your mouth and down your throat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a questionnaire about swallowing that should take about 5 minutes to&#xD;
           complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a video-strobe procedure to check your vocal cords. To perform a&#xD;
           video-strobe procedure, a small camera will be inserted into the throat through your&#xD;
           nose or mouth. You will be awake for this procedure and the study staff will give you&#xD;
           the option of receiving a numbing spray for your nose and/or throat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photos of the inside of your mouth will be taken to check for mouth sores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will fill out questionnaires about your quality of life, work status, medical&#xD;
           history, smoking status, and any symptoms you may have. Completing these questionnaires&#xD;
           should take about 10-15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are among the first 15 patients enrolled in the study, you will be in Group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you join the study after the first 15 patients have enrolled, you will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned (as a flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if&#xD;
      one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, an MRI will be used to plan your IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive standard-of-care IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No matter which group you are in, you may continue receiving radiation therapy for up to 6 ½&#xD;
      weeks. You will no longer be able to take part in this study if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your overall participation on the study will be over after 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Planning and Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive a standard CT simulation which will cover your head and neck for treatment&#xD;
      planning. You will also have a PET-CT to check the status of the disease and for treatment&#xD;
      planning purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are among the first 15 participants or are in Group 1, you also will have an MRI&#xD;
      simulation for treatment planning purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All groups will then receive radiation therapy 1 time each day, 5 days a week (Monday through&#xD;
      Friday) for up to 33 treatments (about 6 ½ weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week while you are receiving radiation therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will fill out the same questionnaires as before.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Weeks 3 and 6:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photos of the inside of your mouth will be taken to check for mouth sores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a dental exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are among the first 15 participants or are in Group 1, you will also have the MRI&#xD;
      simulation at the end of Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six (6) weeks after finishing radiation therapy, you will complete the same questionnaires as&#xD;
      before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 8-12 weeks after finishing radiation therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photos of the inside of your mouth will be taken to check for mouth sores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a hearing test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are among the first 15 participants or are in Group 1, you will have an MRI&#xD;
           simulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six (6) months, 1 year, and 2 years after finishing radiation therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will fill out the same questionnaires as before.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a mouth exam to check your swallowing function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photos of the inside of your mouth will be taken to check for mouth sores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will fill out the same questionnaires as before.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a video-strobe procedure to check your vocal cords.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 1 year only, you will have a dental exam and an MBS exam to test your swallowing&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 1 year and 2 years only, you will also have a hearing test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three to six (3-6) months, 1 year, and 18-24 months after finishing radiation therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an MBS exam to test your swallowing function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will fill out the same questionnaires as before.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have the video-strobe procedure to check your vocal cords.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two (2) years after finishing radiation therapy and if the disease gets worse, blood (about 3&#xD;
      teaspoons) will be drawn for circulating tumor cells (CTCs). This is a test of how many tumor&#xD;
      cells are in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five (5) years after finishing radiation therapy, you will have an MBS exam to test your&#xD;
      swallowing function and will complete the same questionnaires as before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed during follow-up, you will have a tumor biopsy for tumor&#xD;
      marker testing and a CT scan, MRI scan and/or PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Calls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 8-12 weeks while you are recovering from treatment, you will be called or emailed&#xD;
      by an automated system every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be to remind you to fill out a web-based form that asks about any side effects you&#xD;
      may have had. Completing the form should take about 10-15 minutes each time.&#xD;
