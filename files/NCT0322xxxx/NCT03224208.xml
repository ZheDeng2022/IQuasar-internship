  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the BRIM-3 trial, which was conducted in patients with previously untreated advanced&#xD;
      melanoma harboring the BRAF V600E mutation, vemurafenib, a potent inhibitor of mutated BRAF,&#xD;
      was associated with prolonged overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      compared to dacarbazine. In the same setting, combined use of vemurafenib and cobimetinib, a&#xD;
      selective inhibitor of MEK, yielded a significant improvement in PFS and response rate,&#xD;
      compared to vemurafenib monotherapy, along with an advantage in OS, which did not cross the&#xD;
      pre-specified significance bounderies (COBRIM trial). In treatment-naïve patients with&#xD;
      mutated BRAF, both anti PD-1-based immunotherapy and BRAF-targeted agents are feasible&#xD;
      therapeutic options, with the former and latter agents being associated with more durable and&#xD;
      earlier responses, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As suggested by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, the use of combined&#xD;
      BRAF and MEK inhibitors in patients with progressive disease after immunotherapy, is also&#xD;
      feasible, but it is not supported by category 1 evidence, in view of the lack of studies&#xD;
      conducted in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this phase II trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      combined use of vemurafenib plus cobimetinib in advanced melanoma patients who have received&#xD;
      first-line systemic immunotherapy for inoperable locally advanced / metastatic disease.&#xD;

      In the BRIM-3 trial, which was conducted in patients with previously untreated advanced&#xD;
      melanoma harboring the BRAF V600E mutation, vemurafenib, a potent inhibitor of mutated BRAF,&#xD;
      was associated with prolonged OS and PFS compared to dacarbazine. In the same setting,&#xD;
      combined use of vemurafenib and cobimetinib, a selective inhibitor of MEK, yielded a&#xD;
      significant improvement in PFS and response rate, compared to vemurafenib monotherapy, along&#xD;
      with an advantage in OS, which did not cross the pre-specified significance bounderies&#xD;
      (COBRIM trial). In treatment-naïve patients with mutated BRAF, both anti PD-1-based&#xD;
      immunotherapy and BRAF-targeted agents are feasible therapeutic options, with the former and&#xD;
      latter agents being associated with more durable and earlier responses, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As suggested by NCCN guidelines, the use of combined BRAF and MEK inhibitors in patients with&#xD;
      progressive disease after immunotherapy, is also feasible, but it is not supported by&#xD;
      category 1 evidence, in view of the lack of studies conducted in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this phase II trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      combined use of vemurafenib plus cobimetinib in advanced melanoma patients who have received&#xD;
      first-line systemic immunotherapy for inoperable locally advanced / metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As evidenced above, vemurafenib inhibits the BRAF V600E kinase, (this mutation is found in&#xD;
      50% to 60% of melanomas), and enables a remarkable clinical response rate, more than 50% and&#xD;
      a statistically significant improvement in OS in patients with unresectable stage III and IV&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the clinical utility of BRAF-I treatment is limited by the development of drug&#xD;
      resistance. Multiple mechanisms underlie the development of BRAF-I resistance in BRAF V600E&#xD;
      melanoma cells including point mutations in MEK1, amplification of mutant BRAF V600E,&#xD;
      elevated closely related serinethreonine kinase activity, activating NRAS mutations,&#xD;
      increased levels of COT/Tpl2, aberrantly spliced BRAF V600E and growth factor receptor&#xD;
      upregulation. Most of these alterations cause BRAF-I resistance by reactivating the MAPK&#xD;
      pathway which plays a major role in the proliferation, survival, and metastatic potential of&#xD;
      melanoma cells [Shi 2014a, Shi 2014b, Van Allen 2014].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhibition of MEK by the novel MEK-I, trametenib or cobimetinib, has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      overcome the reactivation of MAPK pathway which is induced by BRAF-I resistance and to&#xD;
      increase both OS and OvRR of melanoma patients when combined with BRAF-I [Flaherty 2012a,&#xD;
      Flaherty 2012b, Hoeflich 2012, Ribas 2014]. The above-described phase III study, 495 patients&#xD;
      with previously untreated unresectable locally advanced or metastatic BRAF V600&#xD;
      mutation-positive melanoma has shown that the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib, as&#xD;
      compared with vemurafenib alone, resulted in an improvement in PFS and objective responses,&#xD;
      with early evidence of improved OS and a somewhat increased toxicity profile [Larkin 2014].&#xD;
