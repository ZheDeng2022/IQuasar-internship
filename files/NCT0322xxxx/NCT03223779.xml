  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug in combination with radiation therapy as a possible&#xD;
      treatment for hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trifluridine (TAS-102)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation Therapy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. Patients are being asked to participate in the Phase I&#xD;
      portion of the study. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use&#xD;
      for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Trifluridine as a treatment&#xD;
      option for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved Trifluridine in combination with radiation therapy as a treatment&#xD;
      option for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are determining the safest and most effective dose&#xD;
      of Trifluridine in combination with radiation therapy in participants with hepatic metastases&#xD;
      from colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trifluridine stops DNA replication which may prevent the cancer cells from growing. Radiation&#xD;
      may help to kill the cancer cells while protecting normal tissue cells. Studies have shown&#xD;
      Trifluridine may make radiation more effective.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until 4 weeks after the end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>MTD will be determined using a 3 + 3 dose escalation. 3 participants enrolled at the starting dose of 20 mg/m2 BID (Bis in die, Latin for twice daily). Based on the number of dose limiting toxicities (DLT), the dose can be either be increased to 25 mg/m2 BID then 30 mg/m2 BID or it could be reduced to 15 mg/m2 BID.&#xD;
If 0 out of 3 have DLT, enroll 3 participants at next dose level&#xD;
If ≥ 2 DLT out of 3 or 6 participants in a dose cohort have DLT, this will be the MTD and 3 additional participants are enrolled at next lowest dose if only 3 were treated at that level so far.&#xD;
If 1 out of 3 have DLT, 3 more enrolled at current dose level. If no DLT in those 3, move to next dose level. If ≥ 1 DLT, declare this the MTD and enroll 3 additional at next lowest dose if only 3 treated so far.&#xD;
If ≤ 1 out of 6 DLT at highest dose level below maximally administered dose, MTD is generally the rerecorded phase 2 dose (RP2D). Dose level 3 is RP2D if MTD not reached.</description>

    <measure>The Duration of Local Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month post treatment, every 6 months for two years or until death</time_frame>
    <description>Local control is the absence of local failure defined as evidence of tumor growth/regrowth that meets Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria for progressive disease in any direction beyond that present in pre-treatment imaging studies of the treated lesion(s). The duration of local control will be measured from the start date of protocol treatment until the date of local failure.&#xD;
Marginal failure is defined as appearance of tumor growth at the margin of the target volume.&#xD;
Nodal failure is defined as failure in regional lymph nodes (i.e. porta-hepatis, para-aortic, diaphragmatic).&#xD;
Distant failure is defined as appearance of tumor at sites beyond marginal and regional nodal sites.&#xD;
Intrahepatic recurrence is defined as any new lesion elsewhere in the liver and separate from local failure.</description>

    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>from the start of treatment until 2 years, or until time of progression/death</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) will be measured from the start date of protocol treatment (first TAS-102 dose and/or first SBRT fraction) to the earlier date of first failure at any pre-treatment or new site (defined in 'Duration of Local Control' section) or death. PFS will be censored at the date of last follow-up for participants still alive who have not failed.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>from the start of treatment until 2 years, or until time of death</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) will be measured from the start date of protocol treatment (first TAS-102 dose and/or first SBRT fraction) to the date of death. OS will be censored at the date of last follow-up for participants who are still alive.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Association between KRAS or BRAF mutation status with local control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month post treatment, every 6 months for two years or until death</time_frame>
    <description>Association between KRAS or BRAF mutation status with local control will be assessed using Gray's test with death as a competing risk in the absence of local failure. Local control is defined in the 'Duration of Local Control' description.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have biopsy-proven diagnosis of a colorectal cancer with 1-4 liver&#xD;
             metastases. There is no upper size limit and participants must have at least 800 mL of&#xD;
             uninvolved liver. Liver metastases may be diagnosed by imaging alone, no liver biopsy&#xD;
             is required. Extrahepatic disease is allowed if 1) it has been stable for 3 months&#xD;
             prior to study entry, 2) the dominant disease burden is intrahepatic and 3) the&#xD;
             patient is referred for definitive radiation therapy to the disease in the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥&#xD;
             10 mm with spiral CT scan. See Section 13 for the evaluation of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may have had prior chemotherapy, targeted biological therapy (i.e.&#xD;
             sorafenib), surgery, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation,&#xD;
             or cryosurgery for their disease as long as the prior therapy occurred more than 3&#xD;
             weeks before the first radiation treatment. Patients may not have had prior liver&#xD;
             directed radiation, including radioembolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of high&#xD;
             dose liver radiation in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expected survival must be greater than three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1..&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have liver metastases deemed unresectable due to anatomy, medical&#xD;
             fitness, or presence of extrahepatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below. History of&#xD;
             transfusion is acceptable and transfusions may be given to meet eligibility&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hgb ≥ 9g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥ 75,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Calculated&#xD;
                  per Cockroft &amp; Gault formula) for subjects with creatinine levels above&#xD;
                  institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If patient has underlying cirrhosis, only Child-Pugh classification Group A patients&#xD;
             should be included in this study. Clinical assessment of ascites and encephalopathy is&#xD;
             required. Child-Pugh classification must be determined for all study participants at&#xD;
             the time of eligibility analysis. As albumin and PT/INR are required for Child-Pugh&#xD;
             classification; these labs should be drawn with other labs required for eligibility&#xD;
             analysis. See Appendix B for Child-Pugh classification table.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of radiation on the developing human fetus are known to be teratogenic and&#xD;
             the safety of TAS-102 in pregnant women and their fetuses has not been established.&#xD;
             Therefore, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after stopping study&#xD;
             treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to take oral medications (i.e. no feeding tube and able to swallow whole)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating. Patients must be either surgically sterile (via&#xD;
             hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation), post menopausal or using acceptable methods&#xD;
             of contraception if they are of child bearing potential. Female patients of child&#xD;
             bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days&#xD;
             prior to starting drug. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with radiation,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with gross ascites or encephalopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with local conditions or systemic illnesses that would reduce the local&#xD;
             tolerance to radiation treatment, such as serious local injuries, active collagen&#xD;
             vascular disease, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had prior liver directed radiation treatment, including&#xD;
             selective internal radiation (SIRspheres or Theraspheres)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a serious medical illness that may limit survival to less than 3&#xD;
             months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to starting study treatment or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 3 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents, or any other&#xD;
             anti-cancer therapy during study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with any uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to&#xD;
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or serious psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have previously received TAS-102&#xD;
