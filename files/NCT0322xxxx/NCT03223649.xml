      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have found that people can better process sugars when they take walking breaks.&#xD;
      Studies have also found that children's attention and memory may improve after exercise. It&#xD;
      is not known if short walking breaks have the same effects. Researchers want to study if&#xD;
      breaking up sitting with walking for 6 days helps children s bodies use sugars and improves&#xD;
      concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if breaking up sedentary (low-activity) time with short walking breaks over 6 days&#xD;
      affects how children s bodies use sugar. To learn if breaking up sedentary time changes&#xD;
      children s attention, memory, feelings, activity, or eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children ages 7-11 in general good health&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting blood tests. On 2 out of 7 total study visits, participants cannot eat or drink&#xD;
           after 10 p.m. the night before.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full-body X-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EKG (Electronic signals that record heart function through stickers)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treadmill exercise. Heart, blood pressure, and oxygen will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about the child s health, socialization, and activity, and parent s education&#xD;
           and economic status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Picture vocabulary test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietician meeting (Questions about eating habits)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have visits on 6 consecutive days. Over that time, they will wear 2 devices&#xD;
      to monitor blood sugar and activity (even while at home).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 5 after-school visits. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health check&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Snack plus food for the next 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activity monitored&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3-hour sitting tests. Participants will do non-active things. Some will have 3-minute&#xD;
           walks every 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive tests and questions about mood and anxiety are given on days #1 &amp; 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fast before the last visit in the morning. They will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  9 blood draws by IV catheter. Participants will drink sugar water.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sitting test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activity monitored&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meal (food buffet)&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedentary behavior is defined as a set of low-intensity activities involving limited body&#xD;
      movement (e.g.: TV viewing, prolonged sitting). Some studies have found higher levels of&#xD;
      childhood sedentary behavior predict higher body mass index (BMI) and metabolic&#xD;
      abnormalities. We and others have found that interrupting sitting with short, 2-3 minute&#xD;
      bouts of moderate activity (walking) can improve glucose tolerance during a single session.&#xD;
      Thus, interrupting sedentary behavior may be an intervention strategy to reduce health risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a randomized pilot study to assess whether interrupting sedentary&#xD;
      behavior for 6 consecutive days provides sustained improvement in carbohydrate metabolism&#xD;
      without negatively impacting executive function, attention, mood, anxiety, dietary&#xD;
&#xD;
      intake or usual physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design &amp; Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a randomized parallel group design, children, ages 7-11 years, will complete an&#xD;
      assigned randomized condition of either 6 consecutive days of 3 hours of monitored sedentary&#xD;
      activity (sitting) or 6 consecutive days of 3 hours of interrupted sitting (in which they&#xD;
      will be prompted to walk for 3 minutes every 30 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four-hour continuous glucose monitoring and postprandial insulin incremental area&#xD;
      under the curve (iAUC) on post-condition oral glucose tolerance testing will be the primary&#xD;
      measures. Secondary measures include: postprandial glucose iAUC, executive function,&#xD;
      attention, mood, anxiety, dietary intake, and free-living physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will investigate if consecutive daily interruption of sitting behaviors improves&#xD;
      glucose tolerance, a potential negative health consequences of sedentary behavior in&#xD;
      children. If repeatedly interrupting sitting with short bouts has sustained beneficial&#xD;
      effects among children, interventions examining the frequency, duration, and intensity of&#xD;
      such interruptions could be developed for use in the community setting. Thus, these results&#xD;
      have the potential to provide insight into novel behavioral intervention targets in youth.&#xD;

&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        (a) Participants will qualify for the study if they qualify for the primary Break It Up!&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Cannot have MRI scanning. Some of the reasons a child might not be able to have MRI&#xD;
             include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cochlear Implants&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ocular foreign body (e.g. metal shavings)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Embedded shrapnel fragments&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Central nervous system aneurysm clips&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Implanted neural stimulator&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Medical infusion pumps&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any implanted device that is incompatible with MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Is not likely to tolerate an MRI scan. Examples of medical conditions that would make&#xD;
             it difficult to undergo MRI include severe anxiety (nervousness) or hyperactivity&#xD;
             which make it hard for your child to lay flat for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Requires sedation for MRI studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has a condition that makes entry into the scanner difficult (e.g. weight over 550 lbs,&#xD;
             claustrophobia, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has severe back-pain or motion disorders that make it hard for a child to lie on&#xD;
             his/her back within the MRI scanner and hold still for the scan.&#xD;
