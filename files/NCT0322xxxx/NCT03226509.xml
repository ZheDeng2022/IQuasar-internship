  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several factors are barriers to effective Hepatitis C care: 1) The majority of Hepatitis C&#xD;
      Virus (HCV)-positive patients (45-85 percent) are unaware that they are infected; 2) Only a&#xD;
      small minority of those in need of treatment receive it; 3) Members of minorities and older&#xD;
      patients are even less likely to receive needed care; and 4) Until recently, even those who&#xD;
      were treated had a low chance of clearing the virus or achieving cure; 5) It is possible that&#xD;
      older attitudes and expectation of futility might continue to persist among patients and&#xD;
      provider in primary care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community Health Centers are often the most culturally appropriate and accessible choices,&#xD;
      particularly for underserved populations, with the benefit of ongoing trust and relationships&#xD;
      with patients. Therefore, these can be ideal places to deliver complex HCV care if they&#xD;
      possess the needed expertise. However, most community-based primary care and community health&#xD;
      centers lack access to Hepatitis C evaluation and treatment services, leading to a major&#xD;
      public health problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, investigators propose to implement and evaluate a pragmatic trial to implement and&#xD;
      evaluate a multi-disciplinary model for HCV treatment at Currently, the treatment initiation&#xD;
      rates at each of these sites is estimated as less than 10%. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that our project will increase the rate of participation in all the steps of the HCV care&#xD;
      cascade and ultimately lead to more than doubled rates of treatment uptake&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine uptake, effectiveness and safety of IFN-free, DAAs among &quot;real world&quot; patients,&#xD;
      including those with multiple comorbidities, in the primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demonstrate the transformation of the cascade of Hepatitis C Care at 3 primary care&#xD;
           clinics in terms of changes from baseline in rates for rates of access to HCV care&#xD;
           including HCV screening, evaluation, treatment consideration, treatment uptake,&#xD;
           completion, loss to follow-up, and treatment success rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Advance understanding of hepatitis C related decision-making in the era of Interferon&#xD;
           (IFN)-free Direct acting agents (DAAs) by examining the context, needs, motivators,&#xD;
           barriers, and preferences among patients and providers to the delivery of hepatitis C&#xD;
           treatment at primary care clinics&#xD;
