    <textblock>
      Liver diseases are worldwide problems. liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are mostly&#xD;
      concerned by clinicians. Radiomcis can improve diagnosis accuracy and evaluate disease&#xD;
      progression. Hence,investors try to combine radiomics and ultrasound images together in order&#xD;
      to improve diagnosis performances of liver fibrosis, benign and malignant tumor and&#xD;
      progression after liver ablations.&#xD;

      Liver diseases are worldwide problems including diffuse hepatitis disease and liver space&#xD;
      occupying lesions. Hepatitis B virus infection is the most important one among difuse&#xD;
      hepatitis disease. There are 240 million people infected with HBV globally, and more than&#xD;
      one-third of these patients (approximately 93 million) live in China. For them, a precise&#xD;
      estimation of the degree of liver fibrosis is important for estimation of prognosis,&#xD;
      surveillance, and treatment decisions in patients with HBV infection. Hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma is usually detected in liver space occupying lesions and leading to third common&#xD;
      death of cancer. Hence, precise diagnosis between benign and malignant tumor is of great&#xD;
      significance. Many guidelines recommend ablation as first line treatment to small&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma, especially to those less than 1mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver biopsy has been considered the gold standard for assessing liver diseases. However, it&#xD;
      is limited because of sample errors, interobserver variability and many complications, such&#xD;
      as pain, bleeding and even death. CT/MR are alternative ways with high cost and&#xD;
      complications. Ultrasound was a first optional tool to diagnose liver disease. However, there&#xD;
      are still some problems remained to solve:first, the diagnosis accuracy of liver fibrosis&#xD;
      remained to be improved. Second,the diagnosis performances for distinguishing benign and&#xD;
      malignant tumor were poor. Third, there were not objective way to assess progression after&#xD;
      liver ablations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiomcis refers to the extraction and analysis of large amounts of image features from&#xD;
      medical images. Previous studies showed that it can improve diagnosis accuracy and evaluating&#xD;
      disease progression. Hence,we tried to combined radiomics and ultrasound images together in&#xD;
      order to improve diagnosis performances of liver fibrosis, benign and malignant tumor and&#xD;
      progression after liver ablations.&#xD;
