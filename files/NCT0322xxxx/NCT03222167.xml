      This is a multi-center, open-label trial of Elbasvir/ Grazoprevir 50/100 mg fixed dose&#xD;
      combination 12 week treatment aimed to evaluate SVR12 in treatment naïve patients with&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C (genotype 1b) infection, associated with of metabolic syndrome. The study&#xD;
      to be conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 subjects will be studied at 2 sites in the Republic of Kazakhstan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Males and Females treatment naïve patients with CHC genotype 1b infection associated with&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome (MS), 18-70 years of age, with or without severe fibrosis / compensated&#xD;
      cirrhosis will be enrolled. SVR 12 (primary endpoint) will be evaluated. Patients will be&#xD;
      stratified by fibrosis stage and presence of metabolic syndrome components. Interim Analysis&#xD;
      will be performed in order to estimate viral kinetics, applicability of SVR4 and durability&#xD;
      of SVR12 by evaluation of virologic response at week 4 and 8 of treatment and follow-up at&#xD;
      week 4 (SVR 4) and 24 will be performed - this will be a descriptive summary only without&#xD;
      hypothesis testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that 12-week therapy with MK-5172 in combination with MK-8742 for&#xD;
      treatment-naïve patients with HCV genotype 1b with metabolic syndrome is not notably worse&#xD;
      than the same course for treatment-naïve patients with HCV genotype 1b without metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;

      60 treatment-naïve subjects with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b infection associated with&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome (MS), with or without severe fibrosis/compensated cirrhosis will be&#xD;
      enrolled, males and females of 18-70 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will fulfill the following study visits: Day 1 (screening), Day 7, Week 2, Week 4,&#xD;
      Week 8, Week 12, Week 24, Week 36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria re-checked, informed consent signed and medical history will be gathered&#xD;
      on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment allocation and review study medication diary will be made on Day 7. Physical&#xD;
      Examinations will be fulfilled on Day 1, Day 7, Week 4 and Week 12. Subject Confirmation of&#xD;
      Birth Control and Review (Serious) Adverse Events will be made on every visit of subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory evaluations will include common blood analysis, urinalysis, biochemical blood&#xD;
      analysis, Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and Т4 free, antigen testings (aHBs, HBsAg,&#xD;
      HbeAg, aHDV, aHAV, aHEV, ANA, AMA, aHIV), HCV RNA (quantitative), HCV genotyping, Urine&#xD;
      Pregnancy Test (females of child bearing potential only), Transient elastography, Calculation&#xD;
      of APRI, Ultrasonography (of liver, gall bladder, spleen, pancreas), Upper GI Endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified by fibrosis stage and presence of metabolic syndrome components.&#xD;
      Interim Analysis will be performed in order to estimate viral kinetics, applicability of SVR4&#xD;
      and durability of SVR12 by evaluation of virologic response at week 4 and 8 of treatment and&#xD;
      follow-up at week 4 (SVR 4) and 24 will be performed - this will be a descriptive summary&#xD;
      only without hypothesis testing.&#xD;
