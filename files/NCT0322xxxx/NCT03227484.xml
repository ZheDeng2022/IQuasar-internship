  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, various sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been approved for&#xD;
      the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Empagliflozin is a preparation of this class of&#xD;
      substances. SGLT2 inhibitors also lead to a reduction in body weight in addition to their&#xD;
      blood glucose lowering effect. The basis for this is probably the calorie loss by the&#xD;
      increased glucose excretion over the urine. However, this weight-reducing effect is lost&#xD;
      after a few weeks of treatment and the body weight subsequently stabilizes at a lower level&#xD;
      than before. However, patients continue to lose energy via the urine. Hence, the weight&#xD;
      stabilization could be due to an increased energy intake as a possible consequence of a&#xD;
      changed brain setpoint for the body weight. As the main weight loss is achieved during the&#xD;
      first 6-8 weeks of treatment, the investigators assume that the underlying central nervous&#xD;
      mechanisms will be present after this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, clinical-experimental observations show that treatment with empagliflozin&#xD;
      promotes endogenous glucose production in the liver. This presumably compensatory mechanism&#xD;
      also occurs after only a few weeks of treatment. The common mechanism, which could be based&#xD;
      both on energy intake and on the endogenous glucose production effect, is still unclear. The&#xD;
      investigators suspect that regulatory circuits in the brain contribute to these observed&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, several studies in animals as well as initial clinical studies in humans show that&#xD;
      the brain is involved in eating behavior and peripheral metabolism. In particular, effects of&#xD;
      the hormone insulin modulate the dietary intake via the brain, thereby affecting human body&#xD;
      weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of the experiments on the insulin sensitivity of the human brain used a specific&#xD;
      approach to the selective delivery of insulin into the brain: the application of insulin as a&#xD;
      nasal spray. Although this application route has no therapeutic value, this technique allows&#xD;
      the administration of insulin to the central nervous system with little effect on the&#xD;
      circulating insulin levels. By combining nasal insulin administration with functional MRI,&#xD;
      regional insulin sensitivity of the brain can be quantified. The investigators recently found&#xD;
      that the insulin action of the brain (stimulated by nasal insulin) regulates both endogenous&#xD;
      glucose production and peripheral glucose uptake during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose&#xD;
      clamps. The signals from the brain seem to reach the periphery via the autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system in order to modulate metabolic processes. A central brain area in this regard is the&#xD;
      hypothalamus. This brain region receives afferents over various systems such as the autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system and various endocrine systems (including insulin). The investigators recently&#xD;
      characterized the hypothalamus as an insulin-sensitive brain area in humans. The hypothalamus&#xD;
      is the key area for homeostatic control throughout the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the dietary intake and the endogenous glucose production are modulated by a&#xD;
      hypothalamic insulin effect in humans, we suspect that the observed effects of SGLT2&#xD;
      inhibitors on both processes could be due to altered insulin activity in the brain. Since the&#xD;
      SGLT2 inhibition by empagliflozin modulates the autonomic nervous system in the kidneys,&#xD;
      signals from the kidney may be transmitted to the brain via the autonomic nervous system,&#xD;
      thereby changing specific setpoints, including e.g. insulin sensitivity of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test this hypothesis, a precise phenotyping of prediabetic volunteers with regard&#xD;
      to regional brain insulin sensitivity as well as the brain effect on metabolism before and&#xD;
      after 8 weeks of treatment with empagliflozin compared to placebo is planned.&#xD;
