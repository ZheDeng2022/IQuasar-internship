      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukapheresis is a procedure to separate and collect white blood cells. It is the first step&#xD;
      in a treatment called CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T-cell therapy. CAR-T therapy may be&#xD;
      offered to people when their cancer comes back. The collected T-cells are used to make a&#xD;
      special version of T-cells called CARs. Researchers want to collect these cells from people&#xD;
      who may become eligible for a CAR T-cell study in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify people who have a high likelihood to benefit from CAR T-cell therapy early in&#xD;
      their disease course and collect and store a T-cell product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 4-39 with a form of leukemia or lymphoma that has not been cured by standard&#xD;
      therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
      Review of existing MRI, x-ray, pathology specimens/reports or CT images may be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this study, participants will have leukapheresis. A needle will be placed into the arm.&#xD;
      Blood will be collected and go through a machine. White blood cells will be taken out by the&#xD;
      machine. The plasma and red cells will be returned to the participant through a second needle&#xD;
      in the other arm. The procedure will take 4-6 hours. Some participants may have a central&#xD;
      line (catheter) inserted which is needed to do the leukapheresis procedure, instead of the&#xD;
      needles in the arms-especially if they are smaller. For a central line placement, a long thin&#xD;
      tube is inserted through a small incision into the main blood vessel leading into the heart&#xD;
      that would allow access to the blood to do the leukapheresis procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants cells will be processed and frozen for future use in a CAR T-cell therapy study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukapheresis is a necessary step to developing a &quot;CAR therapy&quot; or other adoptive&#xD;
           cellular therapy products. There are numerous clinical trials underway in the NCI&#xD;
           utilizing CAR therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The purpose of this protocol is to develop a streamlined process whereby patients&#xD;
           undergo apheresis for development of a CAR cell or other adoptive cell therapy product&#xD;
           on a subsequent therapeutic clinical trial, which can be administered when the patient&#xD;
           needs investigational therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emerging data suggests the critical importance of elements of the apheresis product in&#xD;
           outcomes following adoptive cell therapy. Evaluation of methodologies to optimize timing&#xD;
           and composition of the apheresis collection are imperative to the feasibility of&#xD;
           manufacturing and remains an active area of investigations. Patient specific elements&#xD;
           (e.g., presence of NK-cells/circulating leukemic blasts and/or inhibitory myeloid&#xD;
           derived suppressor cells) along with other parameters of the apheresis product itself&#xD;
           appear to influence efficacy and toxicity profiles of adoptive cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allowing for collection of the leukapheresis product in a protocol separate from the&#xD;
           therapeutic protocol would allow for the best optimization of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient care and disease burden&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Timing and coordination of cell infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collection in patients with high-risk disease who have no current detectable&#xD;
                disease but have a very high likelihood of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Comprehensive evaluation of apheresis products will facilitate enhanced&#xD;
                understanding of critical elements of the apheresis product in patients with cancer&#xD;
                and how this may impact outcomes of adoptive cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain via the leukapheresis process by which cells will be collected and stored for use&#xD;
      in CCR CAR or other adoptive cell therapy clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 3-39 years of age, at least 15 kg, with relapsed/refractory cancer that has recurred&#xD;
      after or not responded to one or more standard regimens and/or deemed incurable by standard&#xD;
      therapy and who meet all eligibility criteria are eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once a patient is determined to be a potential candidate for one of the NCI CAR or other&#xD;
           adoptive cell therapy clinical trials, they will undergo leukapheresis, as estimated by&#xD;
           recipient weight and target cell harvest dose in the Department of Transfusion Medicine&#xD;
           (DTM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatments, investigational or standard therapy will be administered on this&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 24 patients per year may be enrolled on this study. In planning for future CAR and&#xD;
           adoptive cell therapy trials, we expect this study to remain open for up to 5 years for&#xD;
           a total of 120 patients to be enrolled.&#xD;
