      This is a randomized, multicenter, two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Qapzola&#xD;
      in participants with low- to intermediate-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC),&#xD;
      assessed according to the 2016 American Urology Association (AUA) Guidelines. Specifically,&#xD;
      only participants with the following low-to intermediate-risk tumor characteristics were&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2016 American Urological Association Stratification for Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low Risk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low grade solitary Ta ≤3 centimeters (cm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (PUNLMP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermediate Risk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recurrence within 1 year, low-grade Ta&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Solitary low-grade Ta &gt;3 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low-grade Ta, multifocal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High-grade Ta, ≤3 cm (solitary tumor)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to other Screening assessments, participants underwent an assessment of&#xD;
      urothelial carcinoma of the bladder via cystoscopy for clinically apparent tumor of Ta&#xD;
      histology, including PUNLMP, although participants with strongly suspected PUNLMP at&#xD;
      Screening or transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) were not to be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. The qualifying cystoscopy could be performed up to 45 days prior to signing the&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1: One dose of 8 milligrams (mg) Qapzola&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2: One dose of placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once approved for randomization, participants underwent TURBT on Day 1 and the study drug&#xD;
      instillation occurred at 60 ± 30 minutes post-TURBT and was retained for 60 minutes (±5&#xD;
      minutes) in the bladder. All histology specimens were reviewed by a local pathology&#xD;
      laboratory and all clinical treatment decisions were based on the local pathology review.&#xD;
      Participant target disease was confirmed and efficacy analyses were performed based on the&#xD;
      pathology results. The target study population was low- to intermediate-risk participants who&#xD;
      had Ta histology, including PUNLMP, as confirmed by a pathology laboratory. Participants with&#xD;
      strongly suspected PUNLMP at Screening or TURBT were not to be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
      Participants whose tumor histology did not meet the criteria for eligibility, as confirmed by&#xD;
      pathology (Non-Target Population), were to be followed up for safety on Day 35 (±5 days)&#xD;
      (Safety Follow-up Visit) and were discontinued from the study. If the pathology results were&#xD;
      delayed beyond 35 days, the Safety Follow-up Visit was to be conducted when the results were&#xD;
      available for these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who had pathology-confirmed target histology did not receive additional&#xD;
      medications to treat NMIBC during the follow-up while on the study. All target disease&#xD;
      participants were to be followed until either a confirmed tumor recurrence, additional&#xD;
      bladder cancer treatments, or until the End-of-Study, whichever occurred first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis was conducted once the required number of recurrence events were&#xD;
      observed. A recurrence was defined as any pathologically confirmed disease of ≥Ta histology&#xD;
      or carcinoma in situ (CIS) post-treatment. The number of events needed to perform the final&#xD;
      primary endpoint analysis was estimated based on the recurrence rate at 24 months from&#xD;
      previous studies. The follow-up schedule is below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cystoscopic examination (all participants) and urine cytology (only participants with a&#xD;
           Baseline diagnosis of intermediate-risk NMIBC) every 3 months (±30 days) (calculated&#xD;
           from date of TURBT) for 2 years for tumor recurrence and progression and then every 6&#xD;
           months (±60 days) until either a confirmed tumor recurrence or the End-of-Study,&#xD;
           whichever occurred first.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If at any time during the study there was a histologically confirmed tumor recurrence,&#xD;
           the participants discontinued from the study at that time and could then be treated per&#xD;
           the Investigator's standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was to end (End-of-Study) when the required number of events for the primary&#xD;
      endpoint analysis was accrued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study: The duration of the study for each participant was as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening Period: up to 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment: Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety Follow-up: Day 35 (±5 days) after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up Period: No follow-up in non-Target Population. Until either a confirmed tumor&#xD;
           recurrence or the End-of-Study, whichever occurred first in the Target Population.&#xD;

Treatment-related AEs included TEAEs with relationship to study treatment (possible, probable, definite/missing). SAE was AE resulting in: death; initial/prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. TEAEs of special interest were AEs of grade ≥3 dysuria and hematuria per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03. Grade ≥3 hematuria included gross hematuria; transfusion, hospitalization indicated; elective endoscopy, radiologic or operative intervention indicated; limiting self-care activities of daily living (ADL), life-threatening events/death.

        <description>An AE was untoward medical occurrence in a participant who had study drug without possibility of causal relationship. TEAEs: AEs that occurred from dose of treatment until 35 days after study drug administration. Treatment-related AEs included TEAEs with relationship to study treatment (possible, probable, definite/missing). SAE was AE resulting in: death; initial/prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. TEAEs of special interest were AEs of grade ≥3 dysuria and hematuria per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03. Grade ≥3 hematuria included gross hematuria; transfusion, hospitalization indicated; elective endoscopy, radiologic or operative intervention indicated; limiting self-care activities of daily living (ADL), life-threatening events/death. Grade ≥3 dysuria included severe pain; pain/analgesics severely interfering with ADL and disabling.</description>

          <description>An AE was untoward medical occurrence in a participant who had study drug without possibility of causal relationship. TEAEs: AEs that occurred from dose of treatment until 35 days after study drug administration. Treatment-related AEs included TEAEs with relationship to study treatment (possible, probable, definite/missing). SAE was AE resulting in: death; initial/prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. TEAEs of special interest were AEs of grade ≥3 dysuria and hematuria per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03. Grade ≥3 hematuria included gross hematuria; transfusion, hospitalization indicated; elective endoscopy, radiologic or operative intervention indicated; limiting self-care activities of daily living (ADL), life-threatening events/death. Grade ≥3 dysuria included severe pain; pain/analgesics severely interfering with ADL and disabling.</description>
