  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is only open to sites in the Wessex CRN. The aim of diabetes treatment is to&#xD;
      achieve and maintain as optimal blood glucose levels as possible to prevent unpleasant&#xD;
      symptoms associated with high blood sugars and long-term complications of diabetes. This can&#xD;
      be achieved with oral tablets, subcutaneous injectable diabetes therapies such as insulin or&#xD;
      GLP-1 analogues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injectable therapies can significantly improve glucose control, but the counter to this might&#xD;
      be an increased treatment burden, patient and clinician's inertia to initiate injectable&#xD;
      treatments and the potential side effects of the medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These treatment aspects may critically affect patients' health related quality of life and&#xD;
      satisfaction with treatment which can powerfully influence patients' compliance and&#xD;
      self-management behaviours. This is an observational cohort study and its overall aim is to&#xD;
      compare the health status, quality of life (QOL) and treatment satisfaction in two cohorts of&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes - those treated with oral diabetes drugs (nonexposed group) and&#xD;
      those on subcutaneous injectable therapies (exposed group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The changes in the above parameters will be measured by applying three questionnaires to both&#xD;
      groups of participants at baseline and after 6 months of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ADDQoL measures diabetes specific quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. DTSQ measures treatment satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. SF-36 measures overall health status&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration is six months for each participant and over this period participants will&#xD;
      receive three telephone or face to face contacts (based on their preference) with the&#xD;
      research team. The questionnaires will be posted to participants at baseline and at 6 months&#xD;
      and will be completed in paper form and returned to research team in pre-paid selfaddressed&#xD;
      envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped that this study will provide valuable understanding of the effect of injectable&#xD;
      therapies on QOL and treatment satisfaction in our local population with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      which can then be carefully factored into clinical decisions when initiating or intensifying&#xD;
      diabetes treatments.&#xD;
