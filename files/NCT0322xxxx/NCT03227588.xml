      The use of fractional flow reserve (FFR) has improved outcomes in percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      interventions (PCI) in patients with symptomatic stable coronary artery disease (CAD) with&#xD;
      intermediate angiographic stenoses. It is a clinical tool used routinely in cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization laboratories throughout the world including the Little Rock VA Hospital. The&#xD;
      technique utilizes a pressure transducer constructed as part of an 0.014&quot; guidewire. An FFR&#xD;
      of &gt;0.80 has been linked with myocardial ischemia found with nuclear stress and dobutamine&#xD;
      echo stress testing. The FAME trial clearly demonstrated its value in improving long-term&#xD;
      outcomes as compared to use of angiography alone. As such, the use of FFR is incorporated&#xD;
      into both AHA ACC and European PCI guideline recommendations as part of routine care for&#xD;
      intermediate lesions. A &quot;work horse&quot; guide wire is so defined because it can be used in most&#xD;
      PCI cases. It combines a low tip load (to avoid intimal dissection, with excellent (ideally,&#xD;
      one to one) torque transmission and trackability through tortuous lesions. Recently the FDA&#xD;
      has approved an FFR guide wire, OptoWire, (Opsens, Quebec City, Quebec, CAN) which uses light&#xD;
      transmission to measure pressure rather than electrical transduction wires. The primary&#xD;
      purpose of the present study is to determine how effective this wire is as a work horse wire&#xD;
      in patients in whom FFR is required. The OptoWire may also have the advantage of less &quot;drift&quot;&#xD;
      occurring during the procedure. Drift refers to the change in pressure due to issues related&#xD;
      to the wire and measuring system, rather than a true change in pressure. All current FFR wire&#xD;
      systems demonstrate some degree of drift requiring measuring pressure of the wire in the&#xD;
      aorta after the procedure is completed to determine if, and to what extent, drift has&#xD;
      occurred. Thus, a secondary aim of this study will determine the degree of drift.&#xD;

      EVALUATION OF THE OPSENS FRACTIONAL FLOW RESERVE (FFR) WIRE AS A &quot;WORK HORSE&quot; WIRE&#xD;

&#xD;
      Introduction The use of fractional flow reserve (FFR) has improved outcomes in percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary interventions (PCI) in patients with symptomatic stable coronary artery disease&#xD;
      (CAD) with intermediate angiographic stenoses. It is a clinical tool used routinely in&#xD;
      cardiac catheterization laboratories throughout the world including the Little Rock VA&#xD;
      hospital. The technique utilizes a pressure transducer constructed as part of an 0.014&quot;&#xD;
      guidewire. The wire is passed distal to the stenosis. Under the condition of maximal&#xD;
      hyperemia induced by a drug, typically adenosine, the pressure proximal to the stenosis, i.e.&#xD;
      aortic pressure or Pa and the pressure distal to the stenosis, Pd, are measured. The ratio,&#xD;
      Pd/Pa, under maximal flow or hyperemia is known as the fractional flow reserve (FFR). An FFR&#xD;
      of &lt;0.80 has been correlated with observed myocardial ischemia using other diagnostic&#xD;
      methods, particularly nuclear stress and dobutamine echo stress testing. The FAME trial&#xD;
      clearly demonstrated its value in improving long-term outcomes as compared to use of&#xD;
      angiography alone (1). As such, the use of FFR is incorporated into both AHA ACC and European&#xD;
      PCI guideline recommendations as part of routine care for intermediate lesions (2,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the limitations of the use of the FFR pressure wire itself is that its handling&#xD;
      characteristics are somewhat inferior to a standard &quot;work horse&quot; guide wire used for PCI. A&#xD;
      &quot;work horse&quot; guide wire is so defined because it can be used in most PCI cases. It combines a&#xD;
      low tip load (to avoid intimal dissection) with excellent (ideally, one-to-one) torque&#xD;
      transmission and trackability through tortuous lesions. There are several different work&#xD;
      horse wires available. Although the wires may be different for different Cath Labs and&#xD;
      operators, the wires are universally used to maximize safety, efficacy, and efficiency of&#xD;
      PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients specifically requiring FFR to determine the value of PCI, it would be ideal if an&#xD;
      FFR wire was as effective as a work horse wire so it could be used in difficult-to-traverse&#xD;
      lesions. However, due to the complex electronics within current FFR wires, handling&#xD;
      characteristics of previously used wires are inferior to current work horse wires. Recently&#xD;
      the FDA has approved an FFR guide wire, OptoWire, (Opsens, Quebec City, Quebec, CAN) using&#xD;
      light transmission to measure pressure rather than electrical transduction (4). It is&#xD;
      commercially available in the United States. Its handling characteristics appear to approach&#xD;
      that of a work horse guide wire and may represent an improvement over electrical transduction&#xD;
      wires. The primary purpose of the present study is to determine how effective this wire is as&#xD;
      a work horse wire in patients in whom FFR is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OptoWire may also have the advantage of less &quot;drift&quot; occuring during the procedure. Drift&#xD;
      refers to the change in pressure due to issues related to the wire and measuring system,&#xD;
      rather than a true change in pressure. All current FFR wire systems demonstrate some degree&#xD;
      of drift requiring measuring pressure of the wire in the aorta after the procedure is&#xD;
      completed to determine if, and to what extent, drift has occurred. Thus, a secondary aim of&#xD;
      this study will determine the degree of drift.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, FFR is performed before, and often after, PCI. In a study of 574&#xD;
      patients treated at the Little Rock VA (IRB Study, #779601), teh investigators found that&#xD;
      approximately 20% of angiographically optimized PCI still had an ischemic FFR. The&#xD;
      investigators further found that this ischemic value could be improved by further treatments&#xD;
      including balloon angioplasty and stenting. Thus, the secondary purpose is to measure FFR&#xD;
      after successful PCI to ascertain the incidence of persistently ischemic FFR after optimized&#xD;
      angiographic stenting to confirm the result from out previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is descriptive. It will use means and standard deviation for continuous variables&#xD;
      and prevalence or incidence in percentages as appropriate to show results. As there is no&#xD;
      comparator group, comparative statistics will not be employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research aspect of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research aspect of the study is limited to the systematic collection and analysis of data&#xD;
      using the Opsens FFR wire with plan for publication. The other aspects of the study are&#xD;
      considered part of routine clinical care. They include passage of FFR wire, measurement of&#xD;
      FFR pre- and post-PCI, and performance of PCI itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wire that can be used as a workhorse as well as be able to measure FFR would be of great&#xD;
      value. The more effective and efficient is the FFR wire in not only measuring pre-PCI FFR but&#xD;
      being able to be used for PCI and be stable and durable enough to be used for post-PCI&#xD;
      optimization, the greater is the probability that this approach will be more generally&#xD;
      adopted into clinical practice. Demonstration that the Opsens FFR wire is effective in this&#xD;
      regard should further this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators previously demonstrated that 21% or about 1 in 5 patients had an ischemic&#xD;
      FFR after satisfactory angiographic result. This study will confirm previous results or&#xD;
      suggest either an over- or under-estimation of that incidence.&#xD;
