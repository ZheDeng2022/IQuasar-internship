      This research study is studying a combination of targeted therapies as a possible treatment&#xD;
      for multiple myeloma (MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elotuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pomalidomide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug combination to learn whether the combination&#xD;
      works in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug combination is&#xD;
      being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two parts. Each part tests a different combination of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Part 1 participants will be given elotuzumab and nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Part 2 participants will be given elotuzumab, nivolumab, pomalidomide, and&#xD;
           dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of these drugs works in a different way to help the body fight multiple myeloma. The&#xD;
      drugs are being tested in different combinations to see if they are more effective when taken&#xD;
      together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elotuzumab is an antibody, that stimulates the immune system to fight your disease. The FDA&#xD;
      (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved elotuzumab in combination with&#xD;
      lenalidomide as a treatment option for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the participant will receive pomalidomide which is an&#xD;
      immunomodulatory drug. This means that pomalidomide modulates the immune system to help fight&#xD;
      the disease. The FDA has approved pomalidomide as a treatment option for this disease after&#xD;
      receiving two other therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone, also FDA approved, is a type of steroid and is usually combined with other&#xD;
      chemotherapy for the treatment of blood cancers, such as myeloma and leukemias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved nivolumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for&#xD;
      other uses, specifically lung cancer. Nivolumab works by blocking an inhibitory signal within&#xD;
      immune cells, potentially allowing the immune system to fight the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study the investigators are looking to see if the combination of elotuzumab,&#xD;
      nivolumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone is effective in fighting the cancer.&#xD;
