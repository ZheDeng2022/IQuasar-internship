      We reviewed the records of 120 consecutive patients (male and female), aged 85 years and&#xD;
      above, who underwent pars plana vitrecromy in the Tel Aviv Medical Center during the years&#xD;
      01/01/2006 - 31/12/2013, and were followed by physicians in the ophthalmology department in&#xD;
      the center until December 2015.&#xD;

      We reviewed the records of 120 consecutive patients (male and female), aged 85 years and&#xD;
      above, who underwent pars plana vitrecromy in the Tel Aviv Medical Center during the years&#xD;
      01/01/2006 - 31/12/2013, and were followed by physicians in the ophthalmology department in&#xD;
      the center until December 2015. We will be measuring visual acuity, intra-ocular pressure,&#xD;
      demographics (age, gender), indication for surgery, ocular co-morbidities, surgical&#xD;
      parameters (time of surgery, type of anesthesia - general or local, type of suture), and&#xD;
      intraoperative and postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome - visual acuity will be measured at base line, after 1 week, 1 month, 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months / last follow up (until December 2015). visual acuity will be determined by&#xD;
      a standardized chart test (Snellen chart). For statistical analysis, all VA values were&#xD;
      converted to logMAR scale. According to Holladay and the University of Freiburg study group&#xD;
      results, blindness was set at 0.00125/2.9 (decimal/logMAR), light perception at 0.0025/2.6,&#xD;
      hand movements at 0.005/2.3 and counting fingers at 0.014/1.85. Data will be analyzed using&#xD;
      SPSS software. A p-value of 0.05 will be considered statistically significant and t-tests&#xD;
      analysis will be used to compare between means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes - demographics, Indication for surgery, ocular co morbidities will be&#xD;
      measured at baseline. Surgical parameters and intraoperative complications will be measured&#xD;
      at 1 week. Postoperative complications will be measured during follow up after 1 week, 1&#xD;
      month, 3 months, 6 months / last follow up (until December 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications will be measured by examination of intraocular pressure, slit-lamp and fundus&#xD;
      (Ophthalmoscopic Exam).&#xD;
