      RIAC - An Observational, Prospective, Multi-centre, Study of Epidemiology, Treatment, and&#xD;
      Outcome of Cardiac Arrest in Italy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Italian Registry of Cardiac Arrest (RIAC) has been established in Italy by the Italian&#xD;
      Resuscitation Council (IRC). It is a free web registry based on Utstein style data collection&#xD;
      for all EMS and ICU departments that want to participate to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project will include all events that occur between 00.00 on October 1st, 2014&#xD;
      and 23:59 on September 30th, 2019. The RIAC registry allows to follow and collect data from&#xD;
      consecutive patients with cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected outcomes of RIAC are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The implementation of an Italian registry of cardiac arrest that allows the prospective&#xD;
           data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study of the incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) among the general&#xD;
           population and related outcomes (hospital admission and long-term outcomes). An&#xD;
           observational, prospective, multi-centre study on patients assisted by EMS which collect&#xD;
           data on cardiac arrest using RIAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study of the incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) among hospitalized&#xD;
           patients, the quality level of treatments during the hospitalization period and the&#xD;
           long-term outcomes. An observational, prospective, multi-centre study on hospitalized&#xD;
           patients in hospitals which can efficaciously respond to an in-hospital emergency and&#xD;
           collect data on cardiac arrest using RIAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study of the quality of post-resuscitation treatments for patients who suffered a&#xD;
           cardiac arrest (OHCA-IHCA) admitted to ICUs. An observational, prospective, multi-centre&#xD;
           study on patients admitted to ICUs which collect data on cardiac arrest using RIAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A national database of cardiac arrest that will enable future participations to European&#xD;
           projects, such as EuReCa &quot;An international, prospective, multi-centre, three-month&#xD;
           survey of epidemiology, treatment and outcome of patients suffering an out-of-hospital&#xD;
           cardiac arrest in Europe&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the perspective incidence study of IHCA, OHCA and the quality of post-resuscitation&#xD;
      treatments, all cases with a cardiac arrest diagnosis aged ≥ 18 years old will be included.&#xD;
      All patients without a cardiac arrest diagnosis will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcomes for the study population are listed for each subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out-of-hospital Cardiac arrest:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the incidence of cardiac arrest among the representative general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the implemented interventions outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the cohort of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest arrived alive at the emergency&#xD;
           department and describe the in-hospital pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the quality of long-term outcomes (30-days survival; survival to discharge) of&#xD;
           patients discharged alive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-hospital cardiac arrest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • It is expected to enlist 10-20 patients per year per each participating hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of post-resuscitation treatments in ICUs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • It is expected to enlist a number of patients which is calculated as the number of survived&#xD;
      patients to IHCA and hospitalized in ICU plus the number of patients with OHCA arrived alive&#xD;
      at emergency unit and hospitalized in ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical data analysis will be based on three main objectives. The incidence of cardiac&#xD;
      arrest for OHCA will be evaluated as the ratio between the number of confirmed OHCA occurred&#xD;
      during the whole study and the referring population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of cardiac arrest for IHCA will be calculated using as denominator, the&#xD;
      population at risk (ordinary recovery other than day hospital and day surgery). For the&#xD;
      evaluation study of the quality level of treatments in Intensive Care Units, a multivariate&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to assess the connection between outcomes and treatments. In&#xD;
      particular, the relation between injury variable (duration of no-flow time and CPR defined as&#xD;
      flow &lt;20%), treatments (temperature, glycaemia, convulsions, hypothermia, serum potassium&#xD;
      levels, acidosis during the first 72 hours, etc.) and outcome to discharge defined using CPC&#xD;
      classification, will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of patients with CPC 3 and CPC 4 on the amount of IHCA an OHCA cardiac&#xD;
      arrests, will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participanting EMS/hospitals able to provide at least the core data, need to fill out a&#xD;
      letter of intent to participate in this study and must provide an ethical approval from the&#xD;
      local Ethical Committee.&#xD;
