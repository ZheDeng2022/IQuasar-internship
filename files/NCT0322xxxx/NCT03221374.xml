  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mind-Body Awareness Training (MBAT), in the forms of various yoga and meditative practices,&#xD;
      has become increasingly prevalent due to an increase in awareness of the potential health&#xD;
      benefits, and improvements in concentration that this training can provide to practitioners.&#xD;
      In the present study, the role of Mind-Body Awareness Training (MBAT) in the initial learning&#xD;
      of a sensorimotor (SMR) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is being investigated. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that MBAT will improve performance in SMR based BCI.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol, the following hypothesis will be tested; namely that MBAT including the&#xD;
      verified mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) course will improve the ability for&#xD;
      subjects to concentrate on the control of the SMR thus improving the performance of BCI.&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited for short term MBAT and then undergo BCI training. The performance&#xD;
      of subjects with MBAT will be compared with those without MBAT to test the hypothesis.&#xD;
      Procedures involved include a standard 8-week MBSR course, and an EEG brain noninvasive brain&#xD;
      computer interface study.&#xD;

    <description>During the course of the study over approximately 6 months/cohort of subjects (with approximately 10 projected cohorts), subject learning over time during the course of study will be examined in terms of performance change before/after the intervention as well as across sessions. The percent valid correct (percent correct over valid trials) metric will be used to evaluate learning.</description>
