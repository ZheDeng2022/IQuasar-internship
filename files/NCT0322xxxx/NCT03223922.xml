    <textblock>
      This is a trial that evaluates the preservation of cognition and neuropsychiatric function&#xD;
      following genu-sparing whole brain radiation in patients with brain metastases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efforts at treating radiation-induced cognitive and neuropsychiatric declines with&#xD;
      medications have shown only minimal preliminary cognitive benefit and do not affect quality&#xD;
      of life (QOL). Given the structural and functional brain alterations associated with WBRT,&#xD;
      preventing rather than treating these radiation-induced changes may produce more favorable&#xD;
      outcomes. Innovative radiotherapy techniques can limit the dose of radiation applied to&#xD;
      specific brain structures without compromising tumor coverage. In this light, Radiation&#xD;
      Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recently published a study evaluating the hippocampal avoidance&#xD;
      whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in patients with brain metastases. They suggest&#xD;
      potential preservation of cognitive function with this approach with no perceived detriment&#xD;
      in survival. This concept is currently undergoing investigation in a definitive randomized&#xD;
      controlled study (NRG-CC003) in patients receiving prophylactic cranial irradiation for small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer. However, no other studies to date have prospectively evaluated avoidance of&#xD;
      other particularly sensitive brain regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One brain region that has received little attention in the radiotherapy literature is the&#xD;
      corpus callosum. The genu of the corpus callosum contains thin, densely packed neural fibers&#xD;
      that primarily connect the prefrontal association areas and the anterior inferior parietal&#xD;
      regions of the brain. Damage or thinning of the genu is associated with reduced functioning&#xD;
      on tests of executive functioning, attention, working memory, processing speed, verbal&#xD;
      fluency and memory in a variety of healthy and patient groups including aging, cerebral small&#xD;
      vessel disease, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis , human immunodeficiency virus,&#xD;
      mild cognitive impairment secondary to Parkinson's disease, and euthymic bipolar disorder.&#xD;
      The limited existing data in adults receiving WBRT for brain metastases suggest that they&#xD;
      also perceive progressive declines in motivation following treatment. Given its apparent&#xD;
      involvement in a wide range of cognitive processes, the genu of the corpus callosum is an&#xD;
      excellent candidate for sparing in WBRT. This relatively small area has the potential to&#xD;
      preserve cognitive functioning across several domains if guarded from the damaging effects of&#xD;
      radiation. In this study patients will receive the standard whole brain radiation dose of&#xD;
      3000 centigray (cGy) in 10 fractions, but intensity modulated radiation therapy will be&#xD;
      utilized to limit radiation dose to the genu of the corpus callosum. Patients will undergo&#xD;
      cognitive testing at baseline and at 4-, 6- and 12-months following completion of brain&#xD;
      radiation to evaluate the study hypothesis.&#xD;
