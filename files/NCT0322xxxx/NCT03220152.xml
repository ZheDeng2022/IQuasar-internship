  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects preliminarily eligible who choose to receive PrEP will be included after obtaining&#xD;
      the informed consent and confirmation of eligibility within 45 days after the screening&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once included, participants will be examined in a follow-up visit performed four weeks later&#xD;
      and evaluated for evidence of seroconversion to HIV, medication compliance and clinical&#xD;
      toxicity. The second follow-up visit will occur at 12th week and every 12 weeks successively&#xD;
      (quarterly). Quarterly visits include HIV testing, serum creatinine and counseling on&#xD;
      medication compliance and risk reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a total of 6 visits plus 2 extra visits for those participants enrolled in the&#xD;
      PK study. In all visits will be assessed the risks, HIV testing will be performed, monitoring&#xD;
      of renal function and dispensing of the drug Truvada [emtricitabine 1 tablet (FTC) /&#xD;
      tenofovir (TDF) (200/300 mg) once a day orally for 12 months].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have completed 48 weeks of follow-up or prematurely discontinue a PrEP will&#xD;
      be encouraged to return for a follow-up visit after discontinuation of medication for&#xD;
      monitoring of the status and evaluation of HIV as the resolution of side effects.&#xD;
