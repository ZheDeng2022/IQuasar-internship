      A Phase II multi-center, double-blind, parallel group, randomized and placebo-controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial addressing the treatment of patients with active and symptomatic&#xD;
      Scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). Patients who are either treatment&#xD;
      naive or only recently started treatment (&lt;/= 6 months of prior treatment) will be randomized&#xD;
      in a 1:1 assignment to receive either oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and a placebo (Plac)&#xD;
      or a combination of oral MMF and oral pirfenidone (PFD), with both regimens administered for&#xD;
      18 months. The primary hypothesis is that the rapid onset and anti-fibrotic effects of PFD,&#xD;
      which have been observed in the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), will&#xD;
      complement the delayed antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of MMF, to produce a&#xD;
      significantly more rapid and/or greater improvement in lung function over time than occurs in&#xD;
      patients receiving control therapy with MMF and Plac.&#xD;

             clinical interest of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;

             (or equivalent) in doses &gt;10 mg/day.&#xD;

&#xD;
         21. Use of contraindicated medications, including medications with putative&#xD;
