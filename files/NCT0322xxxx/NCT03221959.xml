  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, observational study with a medical device which has Conformité&#xD;
      Européenne (CE) marking. The aim of the study is to demonstrate that patients with malignant&#xD;
      middle cerebral artery infarction (M-MCA) show an increased intra-cranial pressure (ICP)&#xD;
      compared to neurological patients without M-MCA infarction or other space-occupying&#xD;
      indications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Space-occupying, malignant middle cerebral artery (M-MCA) infarctions are still one of the&#xD;
      most devastating forms of ischemic stroke, with a mortality of up to 80% in untreated&#xD;
      patients.The term M-MCA is referred to a severe middle cerebral artery (MCA) syndrome with&#xD;
      typical clinical symptoms (hemiparesis to hemiplegia, severe sensory deficits, head and eye&#xD;
      deviation, hemi-inattention, and, if the dominant hemisphere is involved, global aphasia),&#xD;
      following a uniform clinical course (progressive deterioration of conscious within the first&#xD;
      24-48 h), and ending in herniation. An early diagnosis is essential and depends on CT&#xD;
      (Computed Tomography) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to aid the prediction of a&#xD;
      malignant course, but, until today there is no clear consensus to define and predict&#xD;
      radiologically a malignant evolution in early phases.Over the past 10 years, results from&#xD;
      randomised controlled trials and their pooled analyses have provided evidence that an early&#xD;
      hemicraniectomy leads to a substantial decrease in mortality at and months and is likely to&#xD;
      improve functional outcome. However, there are still important questions about the individual&#xD;
      indication for decompressive surgery. In consideration of a variable clinical course (some&#xD;
      patients develop fatal brain edema early, whereas other patients do not show severe brain&#xD;
      swelling for several days), achieving a way to measure, control and predict malignant brain&#xD;
      edema formation would be of extremely important value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way, the ICP measuring could represent an objective value to determine in every&#xD;
      patient the time point to indicate decompressive craniectomy surgery, and also could allow us&#xD;
      to find a correlation between the size of the infarction and periinfarction edema. Therefore&#xD;
      the optimal timing of surgical intervention can be defined and all the medical treatment&#xD;
      adjusted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, ICP can be measured and registered only using invasive techniques. The two ICP&#xD;
      measurement methods available - intraventricular and intraparenchymal - require both a&#xD;
      neurosurgical procedure, in order to implant the catheter and probes within the brain. Thus,&#xD;
      these measures include themselves a risk for the subject, and both infections and&#xD;
      intracranial bleedings are regular albeit not frequent complications. In addition, invasive&#xD;
      recording of ICP requires neurosurgical expertise and intensive care unit (ICU) facilities.&#xD;
      Therefore ICP measurement so far, is not a standard of care in stroke units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reliable, accurate and precise non-invasive method to measure ICP would be of considerable&#xD;
      clinical value, enabling ICP measurement without neurosurgical expertise and ICU facilities.&#xD;
      Moreover, it would save the patients from the complication risks associated with invasive&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICP should be measured in patients with MCA stroke in order that their ICP can be observed&#xD;
      prospectively.It is expected that any increase in ICP will be detected before neurological&#xD;
      deterioration occurs. Beside the benefits for the patient, there is the advantage for the&#xD;
      attending physician to have more evidence in his decision and the correct moment to make it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive ICP measurement will be done with non-invasive ICP absolute value meter&#xD;
      (Vittamed 205). This device has CE marking since July 2014.The non-invasive technique for&#xD;
      measurement of ICP is based on simultaneously measuring of an ophthalmic artery (OA) blood&#xD;
      flow parameters in the intracranial (IOA) and extracranial (EOA) segments of the OA with&#xD;
      two-depth transorbital Doppler (TCD) measurements including mechanical head frame for&#xD;
      fixation of ultrasonic transducer on the closed eye lid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned number of 48 subjects and their non-invasive ICP measurements is expected to be&#xD;
      collected during a 36 months period starting from the first quarter of 2018. The main&#xD;
      analysis of these data will be done during the three-year project. Measurements will be&#xD;
      performed in patients admitted to the Kantonsspital Aarau.&#xD;
