  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV clinical trial observing and evaluating the safety of proton therapy in&#xD;
      children. Protocol therapy is not being done as part of this clinical trial. The radiation&#xD;
      targeting, planning, prescribed dose, fractionation, schedule, and use of other forms of&#xD;
      therapy will be done per other therapeutic protocols at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital&#xD;
      (SJCRH) at the discretion of the treating physicians associated with those trials.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the clinical trial being described in this registration, participants will be observed to&#xD;
      collect data for baseline assessment of disease and patient characteristics. This will be&#xD;
      done before proton therapy on other trials followed by serial standard-of-care clinical&#xD;
      assessments to evaluate acute and late complications, disease control, treatment-related&#xD;
      mortality, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the incidence of radiation associated grade 3 and grade 4 non-hematologic&#xD;
           toxicities at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years in a radiated region specific manner after the&#xD;
           initiation of proton therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the incidence of necrosis, vasculopathy, and symptomatic and permanent&#xD;
           neurologic deficits at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years after the initiation of proton therapy in&#xD;
           children treated for central nervous system (CNS) tumors in an irradiated region&#xD;
           directed manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the incidence of treatment-related mortality at 5 and 10 years after the&#xD;
           initiation of proton therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the incidence of subsequent malignancies at 5 and 10 years after the&#xD;
           initiation of proton therapy in an irradiated region directed manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the incidence of fracture and osteonecrosis at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years after&#xD;
           the initiation of proton therapy in children treated for musculoskeletal tumors in an&#xD;
           irradiated region directed manner.&#xD;

        All participants will be patients at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. They must meet&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is planned for treatment or has been treated with proton therapy at St.&#xD;
             Jude Children's Research Hospital on or after November 18, 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently pregnant will not be enrolled in the study as radiation has&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. In the rare case that a patient was previously&#xD;
             pregnant as a young adult, the patient will be considered eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
