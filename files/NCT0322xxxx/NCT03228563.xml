    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health issue that has a substantial impact on&#xD;
      affected individuals. Chronic inflammation, which is widely seen in CKD including long-term&#xD;
      dialysis patients, is associated with malnutrition, atherosclerosis and an increased&#xD;
      mortality risk. Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-α, are&#xD;
      elevated in dialysis patients and can predict cardiovascular event and all-cause mortality.&#xD;
      Endotoxin is bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and makes up the outer membrane of Gram-negative&#xD;
      bacteria. Endotoxin is also an important source and also a marker of inflammation in CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The natural intestinal microbiota is altered in CKD patients as an increase in aerobic&#xD;
      bacteria such as E. coli and a decrease in anaerobic bacteria such as Bifidobacterium.&#xD;
      Dysbiosis might contribute to the chronic inflammatory state in dialysis patients through&#xD;
      endotoxemia, induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, and production of uremic toxins&#xD;
      through fermentation of protein in the large intestine. Probiotics containing Bifidobacterium&#xD;
      species and Lactobacilli species could benefit the host by inhibiting the growth or&#xD;
      epithelial invasion of pathogenic bacteria, enhancing the intestinal barrier function, and&#xD;
      regulating the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics could suppress proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6 . In addition,&#xD;
      probiotics could improve renal function parameters in uremic rats and significantly lower&#xD;
      levels of blood urea nitrogen in stage 3 and 4 CKD patients. The aim of the present study is&#xD;
      to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whether probiotics could retard the decline of renal function?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether probiotics could change microbiota?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Whether probiotics could reduce the serum levels of endotoxin and cytokines (TNF-α,&#xD;
           IL-6, and IL-18)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Whether probiotics could improve the gastrointestinal symptoms in CKD patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated glomerular filtration rate, stool microbiota, serum cytokines and endotoxin, and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms of stage 3-5 patients are measured before and after intervention.&#xD;
      The Wilcoxon signed-rank and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare intra- and&#xD;
      intergroup differences for continuous variables, as appropriate. A p value less than 0.05 was&#xD;
      considered significant.&#xD;

    <description>Gastrointestinal symptoms are evaluated by a study nurse using questionnaire at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after intervention. The questionnaire included the stool form [1 = very hard (small hard lumps), 2 = hard stool (hard sausage shape), 3 = normal stool (sausage to banana shape), 4 = soft stool, 5 = muddy stool, 6 = watery stool], ease of defecation (1 = difficult, 2 = easy, 3 = very easy) and abdominal symptoms [frequency of upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, borborygmus, and flatulence (1 = frequent, 2 = occasional, 3 = almost never)]. The average scores before and after the intervention were analyzed.</description>
