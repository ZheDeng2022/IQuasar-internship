    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the effect of paracetamol alone against NSAIDs alone against the association of&#xD;
      paracetamol + NSAIDs in the treatment of traumatic pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paracetamol, NSAIDs, or a combination of the two molecules are usually prescribed. Patients&#xD;
      even use these medications without a prescription. It is not known, however, whether or not&#xD;
      NSAIDs have an additional value relative to paracetamol for the treatment of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomization of subjects was performed&#xD;
      centrally according to a computer-generated random code provided by one of investigators who&#xD;
      was not involved in any other part of the trial. The patients included were divided into 3&#xD;
      groups: Paracetamol group who received paracetamol 1000 mg orally every 8th hour for 7 days;&#xD;
      NSAID group who received piroxicam 20 mg orally twice a day for 7 days, and Paracetamol-NSAID&#xD;
      combination who received both treatments at the same doses for 7 days. All protocol&#xD;
      treatments were administered in opaque packets with code number according to the&#xD;
      randomization list by an independent nurse who was not involved in monitoring or follow-up of&#xD;
      the individuals. Data were collected for each patient, including demographics, medical&#xD;
      history, and findings of the clinical examination. Injury Severity Score (ISS) whose values&#xD;
      range from 0 to 75 was also assessed. Each patient was re-evaluated on the 3rd and 7th day&#xD;
      post-trauma (D7) using a telephone contact by a clinical research associates who was blinded&#xD;
      to the details of the study to note the following clinical data: pain VNS, ED readmissions&#xD;
      for residual pain, need for other analgesics other than those of the protocol, other&#xD;
      treatment modalities the patient might have used (adherence to the treatment prescribed), and&#xD;
      side effects. In addition patients were asked about their satisfaction with pain control&#xD;
      following ED using five point Likert scale: very dissatisfied, not satisfied, neutral,&#xD;
      satisfied and very satisfied and about the degree to which they adhered to medication&#xD;
      schedule. The principal investigator who was aware of the allocation was not involved in&#xD;
      monitoring or recording of the outcomes until the data collection was completed.&#xD;
