  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The significance of this study is that it will be the first prospective trial to compare MBI,&#xD;
      a relatively low-cost functional breast imaging technique, to DBT, the new standard anatomic&#xD;
      breast cancer screening technique in women with dense breasts. This study is also the first&#xD;
      to evaluate two consecutive annual MBI scans to assess change in advanced cancer presentation&#xD;
      after introduction of a functional imaging technique. These data will inform individualized&#xD;
      decisions on supplemental screening and determine if a functional technique that is&#xD;
      relatively low in cost and complexity of interpretation can eliminate the reservoir of&#xD;
      clinically important breast cancers that remain occult on anatomic techniques. This study&#xD;
      will also provide exploratory data about the optimal frequency of repeat MBI.&#xD;

Subjects will receive Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) at Year 0 screening within a 24-hour period. All patients who did not receive a diagnosis of breast cancer during the Year 0 screening will undergo DBT and MBI at approximately one year (Year 1 screening), again within a 24-hour period.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is a consenting female age 40-75 years scheduled for routine screening DBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is asymptomatic for breast disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient had heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts on most recent prior&#xD;
             mammographic examination (BI-RADS c or d).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient is able to participate fully in all aspects of the study (completing study&#xD;
             visits and study data collection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient understands and signs the study informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient anticipates being able to return one year after study enrollment to complete&#xD;
             the second round of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior MBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior whole breast ultrasound (WBUS), with either a hand-held ultrasound probe or&#xD;
             automated system. A prior diagnostic breast ultrasound is not an exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior contrast-enhanced breast MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior contrast-enhanced mammogram (CESM or CEDM).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Concurrent participation in any other breast imaging research studies that involve&#xD;
             undergoing additional imaging tests beyond routine screening with mammography,&#xD;
             including but not limited to contrast-enhanced mammography, WBUS, MBI, or&#xD;
             contrast-enhanced breast MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient had a breast biopsy within 3 months prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient had breast surgery within 12 months prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient is using endocrine therapy for breast cancer treatment or prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient has a known history of any condition or factor judged by the investigator to&#xD;
             preclude participation in the study or which might hinder study adherence.&#xD;
