  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate analgesic onset, efficacy, and safety of 1000 mg acetaminophen administered as&#xD;
      two Test Acetaminophen 500 mg tablets (Test ACM) compared with 1000 mg acetaminophen&#xD;
      administered as two commercial acetaminophen 500 mg caplets (ACM) and 400 mg ibuprofen&#xD;
      administered as two commercial ibuprofen 200 mg liquid-filled capsules (IBU) in the dental&#xD;
      pain model following third-molar extractions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active- controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group study to evaluate the analgesic onset, efficacy, and safety profile of Test&#xD;
      ACM 1000 mg compared with two commercial products over a four-hour period after third-molar&#xD;
      extractions. Subjects will undergo dental extraction of three or four third molars.&#xD;

The participant is instructed to stop the stopwatch when they first begin to feel any pain relief. The perceptible pain relief is confirmed if the participant also stopped the second stopwatch indicating meaningful pain relief. Test acetaminophen 1000 mg and placebo were compared on the percentage of subjects with confirmed perceptible relief starting at 30 minutes and testing successively earlier minutes (29, 28, etc) until the difference was no longer statistically significant.

The participant is instructed to stop the stopwatch when they first begin to feel any pain relief. The perceptible pain relief is confirmed if the participant also stopped the second stopwatch indicating meaningful pain relief. Test acetaminophen 1000 mg and placebo were compared on the percentage of subjects with confirmed perceptible relief starting at 30 minutes and testing successively earlier minutes (29, 28, etc) until the difference was no longer statistically significant.

      <desc>AEs were systematically collected during the study and at the follow-up telephone interview within 7 days after surgery along with spontaneously reported AEs. Any clinically important abnormalities or causally-related AEs persisting were followed until resolution or until reaching a clinically stable endpoint. SAEs required immediate notification to the Sponsor. Any SAE occurring after the reporting period was to be promptly reported if a causal relationship to study product was suspected.</desc>
