      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and is the third&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer that related death in the worldwide. Although, current most of&#xD;
      doctors and laboratorians of HCC diagnoses bases are medical imaging such ultrasound, MRI,&#xD;
      CT-scan and laboratory analyses tests for serum tumor markers such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)&#xD;
      which characterized by very low of sensitivity in the detection of HCC. Last two decades,&#xD;
      scientists was focused researches of small molecules called MicroRNAs which are produced by&#xD;
      human cells and can be released in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MicroRNAs are class of (20 - 25 nucleotide in length) non-coding RNAs, and its emerging&#xD;
      non-invasive diagnostic biomarker for cancer diagnosing, screening, monitoring treatment and&#xD;
      to predict prognosis. A number of studies exposed an abnormal expression of human serum&#xD;
      MicroRNAs in many tumors such as liver, pancreatic and colorectal carcinoma. Recently,&#xD;
      MicroRNAs have a role in the development of HCC, but still it is unknown if these small&#xD;
      molecules will be used as biomarker for diagnosis and survival of HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to establish MicroRNAs as biomarkers for diagnostic tool of HCC&#xD;
      patients and to compare to circulating levels of MicroRNAs in chronic liver diseases patients&#xD;
      and health volunteers and those HCC patients and To determine the clinical utility of&#xD;
      MicroRNAs as a diagnostic maker of hepatocellular carcinoma comparing with alpha fetoprotein&#xD;
      the current marker of (HCC).&#xD;

      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and is the third&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer that related death in the worldwide. According the burden of cancer&#xD;
      in economically developing countries is increasing in a result of population aging and growth&#xD;
      in addition to increasing the adaptation of cancer-related lifestyle choices such as physical&#xD;
      inactivates, smoking and western diets. Liver cancer in women are seventh most common&#xD;
      diagnosed cancer and sixth most cause of cancer death while in men are fifth diagnosed cancer&#xD;
      and second cause of cancer death. In 2008 liver cancer new cases were estimated 748,300 and&#xD;
      death cases were 695,900 occurred in worldwide. Viral hepatitis infections, alcohol, fungal&#xD;
      toxins (aflatoxins), food additives, toxins produced industrial chemicals and water and air&#xD;
      pollutants are the major factors of primary liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, current most of doctors and laboratorians of HCC diagnoses bases are medical&#xD;
      imaging such ultrasound, MRI, CT-scan and laboratory analyses tests for serum tumor markers&#xD;
      such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) which characterized by very low of sensitivity in the&#xD;
      detection of HCC. Last two decades, scientists was focused researches of small molecules&#xD;
      called MicroRNAs which are produced by human cells and can be released in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MicroRNAs are class of (20 - 25 nucleotide in length) non-coding RNAs, and its emerging&#xD;
      non-invasive diagnostic biomarker for cancer diagnosing, screening, monitoring treatment and&#xD;
      to predict prognosis. A number of studies exposed an abnormal expression of human serum&#xD;
      MicroRNAs in many tumors such as liver, pancreatic and colorectal carcinoma. Recently,&#xD;
      MicroRNAs have a role in the development of HCC, but still it is unknown if these small&#xD;
      molecules will be used as biomarker for diagnosis and survival of HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To recognize serum microRNAs as a diagnosis or prediction biomarker for Hepatocellular&#xD;
           carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To correlate with the expression level of microRNAs between HCC patients , chronic liver&#xD;
           disease and health volunteer subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the clinical utility of MicroRNAs as a diagnostic maker of Hepatocellular&#xD;
           carcinoma comparing with alpha fetoprotein the current marker of (HCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design: This is observational study (Case Control Study). A total of 126&#xD;
      subjects aged over 18 years old; that divided into three groups will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      study in Dufle Specialist Hospital; these groups are HCC group, Chronic liver disease group&#xD;
      and health volunteer group. The diagnosed criteria of HCC group are ultrasound which its&#xD;
      nodules more than 5cm, liver function tests, viral markers and AFP. The other groups (chronic&#xD;
      liver disease and health) the diagnoses will be based on laboratory such as (liver function&#xD;
      tests, viral markers, AFP, complete blood count (CBC), Kidney functions and others) the&#xD;
      clinical and laboratory analysis data will be collected perceptively The blood samples will&#xD;
      be collected at one time, after that the blood samples will be separated using&#xD;
      Serum-separating tubes and then centrifuges to get the serum and will be stored in -20Â°C&#xD;
      before transferred from Somalia to Russia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viral marker Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) will be&#xD;
      checked using commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kits for every subject&#xD;
      of these three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expression of MicroRNAs will be detected by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with human TaqMan MicroRNA Assay Kits (Applied Biosystems) of these&#xD;
      groups either HCC group , Chronic liver disease and healthy volunteers. The investigators&#xD;
      will define the groups of HCC, Chronic liver disease and healthy volunteers with high or low&#xD;
      expression based on the median expression value of each microRNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses will be carried out with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences&#xD;
      (SPSS) version 20. MicroRNAs expressions among different group (HCC, Chronic liver diseases,&#xD;
      and healthy volunteers) will be analyzed by SPSS.&#xD;
