      Study CC-90010-ST-001 is an open-label, Phase 1a, dose escalation and expansion,&#xD;
      First-in-human (FIH) clinical study of CC-90010 in subjects with advanced or unresectable&#xD;
      solid tumors and relapsed and/or refractory advanced Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The dose&#xD;
      escalation part (Part A) of the study will explore escalating oral doses of CC-90010 to&#xD;
      estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CC-90010. The expansion part (Part B) will&#xD;
      further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-90010 administered at or below the MTD in the&#xD;
      following cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL approximately 20-25 evaluable subjects at 45 mg&#xD;
      CC-90010 4-days-on/24-days-off in each 28-day cycle Cohort 2: advanced BCC -enrollment&#xD;
      stopped due to recruitment challenges Cohort 3: relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL&#xD;
      -approximately 15 evaluable subjects at 30mg CC-90010 3-dayson/11-days-offin each 28-day&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollment of subjects with R/R DLBCL in Cohort 1 and Cohort 3 was closed due to&#xD;
      Company's strategic decision and not due to any safety concern or lack of preliminary&#xD;
      antitumor efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The food effect assessment (Part C, Spain only) will evaluate the impact of food on CC-90010&#xD;
      when administered at the RP2D of 45 mg 4-days-on/24-days-off (180 mg per 28-day cycle), by&#xD;
      comparison of the PK parameters following fasted and fed (high-fat, high-calorie meal)&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;

      Parts A, B and C will consist of 3 periods: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Screening Period starts 28 days (± 3 days) prior to first dose of CC-90010. The informed&#xD;
      document (ICD) must be signed and dated by the subject and the administering staff prior to&#xD;
      the start of any other study procedures. All screening tests and procedures must be completed&#xD;
      within the 28 days (±3 days) prior to the first dose of CC-90010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Treatment Period, CC-90010 was initially administered orally once daily for 3&#xD;
      consecutive days followed by 4 consecutive days off drug every week (3/7-days schedule) in&#xD;
      each 28-day cycle in Part A. Alternative dosing schedules (eg, 2-days-on/5-days- off each&#xD;
      week, 3-days-on/4-days-off every other week, 4-days on/24 days off) may be evaluated one&#xD;
      dosing schedule at a time or ≥ 2 dosing schedules given in parallel, based on the review of&#xD;
      available safety, PK, pharmacodynamic (PD), and efficacy data by the SRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of dose escalation in Part A, selected expansion cohorts will receive&#xD;
      CC-90010 in Part B. The SRC determined the RP2D for Part B to be 45 mg CC-90010 given once&#xD;
      daily for 4 consecutive days on followed by 24 consecutive days off (4-days-on/24-days-off)&#xD;
      in each 28-day cycle. There are 3 cohorts in Part B expansion. A cohort of up to&#xD;
      approximately 20-25 subjects with relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL (Cohort 1) enrolled at the&#xD;
      RP2D..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment in advanced BCC (Cohort 2) will be stopped due to recruitment challenges. An&#xD;
      additional cohort of approximately 15 evaluable subjects with R/R DLBCL (Cohort 3) will be&#xD;
      enrolled under an alternative dosing regimen of 30 mg CC-90010 3days-on/11-days off in each&#xD;
      28-day cycle. The enrollment of subjects with R/R DLBCL in Cohort 1 and Cohort 3 was closed&#xD;
      due to Company's strategic decision and not due to any safety concern or lack of preliminary&#xD;
      antitumor efficacy. The food effect assessment (Part C, Spain only) will evaluate the impact&#xD;
      of food on CC-90010 when administered at the RP2D of 45 mg 4-days-on/24-days-off, by&#xD;
      comparison of PK parameters following fasted and fed (high-fat, high-calorie meal) conditions&#xD;
      in approximately 24 subjects with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Follow-up Period, subjects will be followed for 28 days (± 3 days) after the last dose&#xD;
      of CC-90010 for safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Safety Follow-up visit, all subjects will be followed every subsequent 3 months (±&#xD;
      2 weeks) for survival follow-up for up until 2 years or until death, lost to follow-up, or&#xD;
      the End of Trial, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
