      Investigating the effects of non-invasive transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)&#xD;
      as a treatment for auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator's primary objective is to provide further evidence for the effectiveness of&#xD;
      transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to treat auditory hallucinations and to&#xD;
      collect preliminary data on whether maintenance stimulation sessions can prolong the duration&#xD;
      of stimulation-induced clinical benefits. The investigators will be looking into effects of&#xD;
      tACS to re-normalize pathological alpha oscillations in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (dl-PFC) of patients with schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder by comparing Auditory&#xD;
      Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS) scores immediately before the first stimulation session,&#xD;
      immediately after the last stimulation session, and at the end of the 8 weeks of maintenance&#xD;
      sessions. As a secondary objective, the investigators will assess the differential clinical&#xD;
      effects of active sham and 10Hz tACS on electroencephalogram (EEG) measures of alpha&#xD;
      oscillations. The investigators will also be using source localization techniques in EEG&#xD;
      analysis, based on individual locations of the scalp electrodes and anatomical structures&#xD;
      with the use of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI).&#xD;
