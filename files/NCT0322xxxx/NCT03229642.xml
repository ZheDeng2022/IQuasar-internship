  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid use disorder (OUD) is prevalent and causes substantial health and social burdens.&#xD;
      Although evidence have showed the effectiveness of opioid agonist maintenance therapy in OUD,&#xD;
      high drop-out rate and the requirement of continuing use of opioid agonists are the major&#xD;
      problems. Therefore, to develop novel treatment for OUD is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive method of brain&#xD;
      stimulation used to treat a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. Recent studies showed that&#xD;
      there may be potential therapeutic effects in rTMS for addictive disorder, including reducing&#xD;
      craving and substance use severity. The underlying mechanisms of rTMS in treating addictions&#xD;
      may involve increased dopamine function in corticomesolimbic brain circuits and modulation of&#xD;
      neural activity in brain circuits that relevant to addiction. However, the treatment results&#xD;
      of rTMS in OUD were lacked, and the analysis in functional brain imaging study,&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests and other potential biomarkers under rTMS treatment were limited,&#xD;
      too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators will conduct the add-on double-blinded, sham-controlled study rTMS&#xD;
      treatment in 40-60 patients with OUD under methadone maintenance therapy. Patients will be&#xD;
      allocated to active and sham rTMS in a 1 : 1 ratio, and participants will receive rTMS on the&#xD;
      left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (15 Hz frequency, 4 seconds per train,&#xD;
      inter-train interval of 26 seconds, 40 trains per session, total 11 sessions in 4 weeks). The&#xD;
      treatment response, urine drug tests, craving scales and side effects to evaluate the&#xD;
      therapeutic effects of rTMS will be examined. Neuropsychological assessments, functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and tests for potential biomarkers of immune parameters&#xD;
      will also be measured during 12-weeks follow up. The study results will provide the important&#xD;
      data in whether rTMS add-on methadone maintenance therapy is able to 1) reduce heroin use; 2)&#xD;
      reduce craving for heroin; 3) be an effective treatment for OUD, and 4) be associated with&#xD;
      improvement in fMRI, biological markers and psychological tests.&#xD;
