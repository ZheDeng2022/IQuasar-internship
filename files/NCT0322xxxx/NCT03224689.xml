      PRIMARY ENDPOINT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary endpoint is to evaluate the procedural success ie successful implantation of&#xD;
           the device in the opinion of the surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KSS Knee scores and KSS Function scores at 6 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months post-treatment&#xD;
           compared to pre-treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject reported outcomes (SF-36, Oxford Knee Score and WOMAC) at 6 weeks, 6, 12 and 24&#xD;
           months post-treatment compared to pre-treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stability of the device through radiographic analysis to assess alignment and component&#xD;
           position at immediate post-treatment, 6 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months post-treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety in terms of adverse events and device deficiencies throughout the clinical&#xD;
           investigation including any additional knee treatments and/or surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survivorship analysis of the device at 12 and 24 months and annually thereafter&#xD;

    <measure>Knee Society Score (KSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Pre-op versus 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months,12 months and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pre-and post-operative function and patient and mechanical assessment. The KSS contains questions in 2 sections: knee joint (pain, range of motion, stability) and function (walking distance, ability to climb stairs). The greater score correlates to better outcome.</description>

    <description>Assessment domains to explain variations in patient outcomes. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Pre-op versus 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months,12 months and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of OA of the knee or hip. Possible score range of 0- 20 for Pain, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function</description>

    <measure>Radiographic assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Pre-op versus 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months,12 months and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective review and assessment of serial radiographs. Items include presence or absence of radiographic evidence of component loosening, malposition, migration and periprosthetic osteolysis, bone loss or interface composite (bone-cement-component) breakdown.</description>
