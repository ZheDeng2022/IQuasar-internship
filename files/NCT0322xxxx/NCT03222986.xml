      detected and correlated to specific organ failure in sepsis. The inflammatory process also&#xD;

      Background: Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host&#xD;
      response to infection, continues to be a source of considerable morbidity and mortality. 19&#xD;
      million cases are seen worldwide each year. Many animal sepsis models had found that sepsis&#xD;
      induced multiple organ failure. Ubiquitination, autophagy, apoptosis may involve the process&#xD;
      of sepsis related multiple organ failure. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies in&#xD;
      clinical populations and in rodent and mammalian animal models had started with discovered&#xD;
      many novel biomarkers of sepsis. Esoxomes had been found in blood or urine presented the&#xD;
      signal of autophagy and apoptosis. Recently, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) was used as&#xD;
      a new method for direct and real-time analysis of exosomes. These make it possible to study&#xD;
      the exosome biomarkers to analyze septic patients with multiple organ failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study: This research will be the first study not only to set up macrophage&#xD;
      co-cultured with human organ cell models for exosomes secretions but also collect purified&#xD;
      exosomes in blood and urine from septic patients. Proteomics studies in exosomes from cell&#xD;
      culture and clinical specimens. Analyze ubiquitination, autophage, and apoptosis related&#xD;
      biomarkers of exosomes by bioinformatics. Use NTA to set up newly diagnostic methods, to&#xD;
      judge the specific organ damage of septic patient by exosomes autophagy-apoptosis biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: In 1st year, LPS (lipopolysaccharide) stimulated macrophage&#xD;
      co-cultured with human organ cells will be set up. Exosomes will be isolated and purified&#xD;
      from different groups. ScFv (single chain fragments of antibody) will be selected for&#xD;
      blocking infection related exosome's transmission. The 2nd year, a total of 60 patients with&#xD;
      infection and positive culture results will be included, of whom 30 septic patients had at&#xD;
      least one organ failure, others will have only infection. All patients included and&#xD;
      classified according to the sepsis-3 criteria. Clinical specimens will be collected from&#xD;
      August 2017 to July 2019. Exosome will be isolated and purified. Magnetic beads purification,&#xD;
      2D gel electrophoresis, MALDI-TOF, and bioinformatics will be used to analyze proteomics of&#xD;
      exosomes and association of organ-specific markers, autophagy, and apoptosis markers. Western&#xD;
      blotting will be done to prove the proteins found by proteomics. Cytokines array in blood&#xD;
      also confirm and correlate to autophagy. Finally, we will use nanoparticle tracking analysis&#xD;
      with double markers identification to understand the exosome subpopulations of specific organ&#xD;
      and autophagy-apoptosis biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible effect: Systematic establishment of exosome proteomics in co-culture medium and&#xD;
      clinical sepsis specimens will be done. In vitro study, ScFv exploring will help to block&#xD;
      exsomes uptake as a possible therapeutic method. Ubiquitination-autophagy-apoptosis&#xD;
      biomarkers in exosomes will be detected and correlated to specific organ failure in sepsis.&#xD;
      The inflammatory process also will be validated by cytokines analysis. NTA double markers&#xD;
      identification will be a smart method to understand the exosome subpopulations.&#xD;
