    <textblock>
      Protocol PEN-866-001 is an open-label, multi-center, first-in-human Phase 1/2a study&#xD;
      evaluating PEN-866 in patients with advanced solid malignancies whose disease has progressed&#xD;
      after treatment with previous anticancer therapies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1a will employ an adaptive model guided with overdose control principle to make dose&#xD;
      recommendations and estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PEN-866 (single agent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b will employ a standard 3 + 3 design to make dose recommendations and estimate the&#xD;
      MTD of PEN-866 in combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2a (single agent) will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics profile of PEN-866 (single agent) at the recommended Phase 2 dose determined&#xD;
      at the conclusion of Phase 1a in patients with advanced solid malignancies.&#xD;
