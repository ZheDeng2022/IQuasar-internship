      Multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, the safety and&#xD;

      Subjects who fulfill all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, after giving&#xD;
      informed consent, will be eligible for participation in this study. At the Visit 2 (Day1)&#xD;
      subjects will receive the study medication and instructions for its administration.&#xD;
      Thereafter, subjects will return to the investigational site at week 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48,&#xD;
      for efficacy and safety assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the virologic failure criteria will return to the investigational site&#xD;
      approximately one week later to repeat viral RNA testing (Virologic Failure Confirmation&#xD;
      visit). If virologic failure is confirmed and the viral load meets the criteria for&#xD;
      resistance testing, viral resistance testing will then be performed.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of DTG in combination with two NRTIs [ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC] in the treatment of HIV-2 treatment-naïve subjects, as measured by the proportion of subjects achieving a plasma viral load of &lt;40 copies/mL and/or by the change from baseline in CD4 cell count and in CD4/CD8 ratio at Week 48. Global success&quot; is a composite variable defined as a plasma HIV-2 RNA viral load &lt;40 copies/mL and a delta of CD4 depending on the initial CD4 count (CD4 delta &gt;+100 cells/mm3 for initial CD4s ≤ 500 cells/mm3; or CD4delta &gt; +50 cells/mm3 for initial CD4s &gt; 500 cells/mm3).</description>

                  conditions / co-morbidities in which treatment is considered, according to&#xD;
                  European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) and national guidelines;&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Naïve to ART including investigational antiretroviral agents .&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Considered clinically stable with no signs or symptoms of active infection, at&#xD;
                  the time of entry into the study (i.e., clinical status and all chronic&#xD;
                  medications should be unchanged for at least 2 weeks prior to the start of&#xD;
                  treatment in this study), in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. If woman or man with reproductive potential, agrees to adopt one of the following&#xD;
                  effective contraceptive methods throughout the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. True abstinence, if this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
                       of the subject [Period abstinence (e.g., abstinence only on certain calendar&#xD;
                       days, abstinence only during ovulation period, use of symptothermal method,&#xD;
                       use of post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                       contraception].&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Use of an acceptable method of birth control throughout the study (either by&#xD;
                       subject or subject's partner). Acceptable methods of birth control are: oral&#xD;
                       contraceptive, intrauterine device (IUD), diaphragm with spermicide,&#xD;
                       contraceptive sponge, condom, vasectomy. All forms of hormonal contraception&#xD;
                       are acceptable. However, the investigator should consult local prescribing&#xD;
                       information for guidance on the use of hormonal contraceptives with&#xD;
                       background ART as some antiretrovirals have clinically significant drug&#xD;
                       interactions with these products.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: A subject who is not of reproductive potential , is not sexually active, whose&#xD;
        current partner(s) is/are not of reproductive potential, or whose sexual activity is&#xD;
        exclusively homosexual is eligible without requiring the use of contraception. However, use&#xD;
        of barrier methods of contraception is strongly encouraged to reduce the risk of HIV-2&#xD;
        transmission during sexual contact.&#xD;
