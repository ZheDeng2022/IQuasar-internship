  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first 2 years of this project consisted of user-centered design and development of an&#xD;
      online resource designed by and for parents of very young children with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      (under 6 years old). That phase of the work has been completed and recruitment has begun for&#xD;
      the second phase, which is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of use of&#xD;
      this resource on a variety of pertinent child and parent outcomes. INTERESTED, ELIGIBLE&#xD;
      PARENTS OR GUARDIANS CAN LEARN MORE BY NAVIGATING TO: www.bit.ly/youngT1D&#xD;

      In response to PA-DK-14-022, the researchers propose to design and test an intervention to&#xD;
      improve management of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in very young children (&lt;6 years). Parents of&#xD;
      very young children with T1D (YC-T1D) often experience distress and anxiety that can impede&#xD;
      T1D care, threatening the child's current and future adaptation to T1D.Typical health care&#xD;
      often does not equip parents to contend with these issues, but YC-T1D parents can offer&#xD;
      support/guidance to each other to promote parental coping and thus child outcomes. The many&#xD;
      obstacles to direct interaction among parents suggest that social media may be an efficacious&#xD;
      way to facilitate timely, meaningful and needed social support such as parenting guidance,&#xD;
      affective support, provision of information, and sharing of creative solutions to common T1D&#xD;
      management problems in YC-T1D. Many good social media resources exist, but there is not a&#xD;
      focused portal that facilitates parents' access to these resources, nor have potential&#xD;
      benefits been validated empirically. The researchers applied crowdsourcing methods to achieve&#xD;
      the iterative development and initial evaluation of an online resource designed by and for&#xD;
      YC-T1D parents with continuous input from health professionals and technical expertise in&#xD;
      crowdsourcing and application development provided by our web development agency partners&#xD;
      (e-city interactive, Philadelphia) and Nemours web development team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crowdsourcing is a flexible online activity that has been applied to diverse problems in many&#xD;
      fields, including public health, with four elements: 1.) An organization that has a task it&#xD;
      needs to be performed, (development of an online resource that meets the needs of parents of&#xD;
      YC-T1D); 2.) A community, &quot;the crowd&quot;, that agrees to perform the necessary tasks voluntarily&#xD;
      (here parents of YC-T1D, T1D clinicians, and professional application developers); 3.) An&#xD;
      online environment that allows the work to take place by enabling collaboration between the&#xD;
      crowd and the organization, (the infrastructure proposed in this grant); and 4.) Mutual&#xD;
      benefit for the organization and members of the crowd (better glycemic control, improved&#xD;
      quality of life and decreased burden of care for YC-T1D and their families).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the researchers' knowledge, crowdsourcing has not been applied to the design and&#xD;
      development of online health behavior resources such as that proposed in this application.&#xD;
      They will design the portal with stakeholders based on principles of User-Centered Design and&#xD;
      then collect preliminary data needed to justify and then conduct a rigorous controlled trial&#xD;
      of the effectiveness of an online resource that will provide parents of YC-T1D (&lt;6 years old)&#xD;
      with timely, responsible, safe and effective support and guidance regarding parental&#xD;
      management of common behavioral, affective and cognitive barriers to effective T1D care in&#xD;
      this age group. The proposed work will address these specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 (Completed): The team used crowdsourcing methods to 1.) Identify the most important&#xD;
      concerns about management of YC-T1D from key stakeholders (parents, pediatric&#xD;
      endocrinologists, diabetes nurses, dietitians, psychologists and social workers) to specify&#xD;
      content areas that the online resource should address; 2.) Collaborate with parents (with&#xD;
      available input from T1D professionals) to design the optimal content, structure, functions&#xD;
      and governance of a social media resource for parents of YC-T1D to improve daily T1D care and&#xD;
      problem solving, to enhance parental coping with sources of distress and care burden that&#xD;
      uniquely affect this clinical population and to facilitate parents' access to and use of&#xD;
      other beneficial resources of the diabetes online community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 (Completed): The researchers iteratively incorporated the knowledge, experience and&#xD;
      perspectives gained in Aim 1 to systematically build and refine an online resource enabling&#xD;
      parents of very young children with T1D to obtain real-time emotional support, information&#xD;
      and parenting guidance, enabling them to cope more effectively with the daily demands of&#xD;
      diabetes management in this population. The team relied on the web development agency&#xD;
      partners, Nemours web development team, and ongoing stakeholder input.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 (Completed): The researchers will conduct a randomized controlled trial of a final&#xD;
      version of the online resource with parents of at least 150 children &lt;6 years old who receive&#xD;
      T1D care at any Nemours operating entity in the Delaware Valley and Florida or who enroll in&#xD;
      response to online announcements. The team will explore treatment effects on metabolic,&#xD;
      behavioral and affective outcomes of T1D care, patterns of portal utilization by parents and&#xD;
      users' feedback on website use during and after the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having designed, built, tested, validated and refined the proposed online resource, the team&#xD;
      will be well-positioned to plan and complete a rigorous randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      evaluate effects of portal use/access on metabolic, behavioral, affective and social outcomes&#xD;
      of T1D care for YC-T1D. While completing Aim 3, the researchers will solidify partnerships&#xD;
      with several key organizations (PEDSnet, T1D Exchange, JDRF, American Diabetes Association)&#xD;
      to enable economical completion of a major multisite trial. The design of the proposed&#xD;
      preliminary RCT will position the team to propose a completely electronic multisite RCT that&#xD;
      does not require face to face contact between parents and the research team and can be&#xD;
      completed totally in cyberspace.&#xD;
