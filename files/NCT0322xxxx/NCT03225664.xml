  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of trametinib when given&#xD;
      together with pembrolizumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer that has come back and spread to other places in the body, cannot be removed&#xD;
      by surgery, or spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes. Trametinib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving&#xD;
      trametinib and pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the toxicity profile of trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, an anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody, as treatment for refractory to chemotherapy&#xD;
      KRAS mutation positive (mut+) and KRAS wild-type patients with advanced non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC) and establish a recommended dose for the combination for the phase II portion&#xD;
      of the study. (Part 1) II. To determine the 6-month overall response rate (ORR) for the&#xD;
      combination of trametinib + pembrolizumab in subjects with NSCLC who received prior cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy and anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. (Part 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate overall response rates (ORRs) using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1 and immune related [ir]RECIST) and duration of response (DOR),&#xD;
      median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in KRAS mut+, KRAS&#xD;
      wild-type, PD-L1+ and PD-L1 negative cohorts of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate ORRs by immune-related RECIST (irRECIST). III. To assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with trametinib at the recommended dose to be&#xD;
      used in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of trametinib and pembrolizumab when administered in&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To identify prognostic and predictive markers for the two treatment regimens by analyzing&#xD;
      pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate exploratory genomic and gene expression biomarkers and their relationships in&#xD;
      tumors in response to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Analyze circulating soluble factors including cytokines, chemokines, and antibodies&#xD;
      against tumor and self antigens in response to clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the activation state, quantity, and phenotype of T cells, B cells, and natural&#xD;
      killer cells and the presence of immune regulatory cells (myeloid-derived suppressor cells)&#xD;
      (MDSC) in response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Examine changes in the localization and numbers of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)&#xD;
      expressing key markers (PD-1, CD8, CD4, CD45RO, granzyme, CD68, Foxp3) by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry in response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Perform immune monitoring studies in tissue and blood and correlate with genomic profiling&#xD;
      and outcomes including toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Evaluate KRAS-mutation specific T cell response in patients before and after monotherapy&#xD;
      with PEMBROLIZUMAB and the combination of PEMBROLIZUMAB and trametinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Evaluate immunophenotypes within the context of subsets of KRAS co-mutations (KRAS/p53,&#xD;
      KRAS/LKB1, KRAS/CDKN2A/B inactivation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Collect and store archival diagnostic tumor samples, matched pre- and post-treatment&#xD;
      tumor biopsy samples and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (from tumor and blood) for future&#xD;
      exploratory research into genes/genetic variation and factors that may influence resistance&#xD;
      and/or sensitivity, and/or response to trametinib and/or PEMBROLIZUMAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. Explore the relationship between pharmacokinetic (PK) plasma trametinib levels,&#xD;
      trametinib exposure, safety and clinical outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. Isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from whole blood to enable flow&#xD;
      cytometric analysis of additional markers and perform functional testing for antigen&#xD;
      specificity and responsiveness, and T cell receptor (TCR) diversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XI. Perform flow cytometric analyses in tumor tissue. XII. Analysis of the host microbiome&#xD;
      from stool. XIII. Analysis of micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) platelets and analysis in&#xD;
      response to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of trametinib followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) 14 days prior to cycle 1 and days&#xD;
      1-10 of each course (10 days on, 11 days off). Beginning in cycle 2, participants also&#xD;
      receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 3&#xD;
      weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 3 months&#xD;
      for up to 3 years.&#xD;
