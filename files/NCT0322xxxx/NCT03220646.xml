    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cohort A specific inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed IDHwt, RB intact, grade II or III glioma that has recurred&#xD;
             after first line therapy (consisting of at least maximum feasible surgical resection&#xD;
             and radiation therapy). There is no limit on the number of prior therapies or types of&#xD;
             therapies patients can have received.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease on imaging (1cm) or measurable non-enhancing tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 12 weeks elapsed since prior radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cohort B specific inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with histologically confirmed glioma of any grade (II-IV) who are planned for&#xD;
             a standard of care surgical debulking/resection and for whom participation in this&#xD;
             study would not cause a medically unacceptable delay in surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have relapsed/progressed following therapy (consisting of at least&#xD;
             maximum feasible surgical resection and radiation therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cohort C specific Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed IDH mutant glioma, meningioma, schwanomma, PCNSL, ependymoma,&#xD;
             or other Primary Brain Tumors that have recurred despite previous standard of care&#xD;
             therapy. Because this cohort is, in part, meant to allow patients access to therapy&#xD;
             who might not otherwise be eligible for other clinical trials - deviations from&#xD;
             standard of care treatment or histological confirmation can be presented to and&#xD;
             approved by the Principal Investigator for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed PCNSL that has recurred after prior methotrexate-based&#xD;
             chemotherapy or for whom methotrexate-based chemotherapy is deemed medically not in&#xD;
             the patient's best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Glioma patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Standard of care next generation sequencing via a CLIA certified platform must be&#xD;
             available, or planned and at a minimum include IDH, and RB status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must provide written informed consent prior to any screening procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older.&#xD;

          -  Required baseline laboratory status:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dL (SI Units: 80 g/L). Patients may receive erythrocyte&#xD;
                  transfusions to achieve this hemoglobin level at the discretion of the&#xD;
                  investigator. Initial treatment must not begin earlier than the day after the&#xD;
                  erythrocyte transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L without growth factor support&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST/SGOT and/or ALT/SGPT ≤ 3 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable dose of corticosteroids for &gt; 5 days prior to baseline MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Before starting study treatment, patients must have recovered from toxic effects of&#xD;
             prior therapies (except for residual alopecia or Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy) and at&#xD;
             least 3 weeks must have elapsed since any prior signaling pathway modulators, (e.g.,&#xD;
             EGFR, FGFR, or other tyrosine kinase inhibitors), at least 3 weeks must have elapsed&#xD;
             since temozolomide, 4 weeks must have elapsed since carboplatin or cisplatin, and at&#xD;
             least 6 weeks from nitrosoureas (e.g., BCNU, CCNU). In general, at least 4 weeks must&#xD;
             have elapsed from any other anticancer drug therapy (e.g. bevacizumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to undergo contrast enhanced MRI scans (or contrast enhanced CT&#xD;
             scans for patients unable to tolerate MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by MRI (or CT for&#xD;
             patients who cannot tolerate MRI) in comparison to a prior scan. The same type of&#xD;
             scan, i.e., MRI (or CT for patients who cannot undergo MRI) must be used throughout&#xD;
             the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a female of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 7 days of the first dose of abemaciclib and agree to use a medically approved&#xD;
             contraceptive method during the treatment period and for 3 months following the last&#xD;
             dose of abemaciclib. If a male, agree to use a reliable method of birth control and to&#xD;
             not donate sperm during the treatment period and for at least 3 months following the&#xD;
             last dose of abemaciclib. Contraceptive methods may include an intrauterine device&#xD;
             [IUD] or barrier method. If condoms are used as a barrier method, a spermicidal agent&#xD;
             should be added as a double barrier protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal exposures to abemaciclib should be&#xD;
        reported. If a patient or spouse/partner is determined to be pregnant following abemaciclib&#xD;
        initiation, she must discontinue treatment immediately. Data on fetal outcome and&#xD;
        breast-feeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must agree not to breast feed while on abemaciclib treatment and for at least&#xD;
             three months following the last dose of study therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence of significant intracranial hemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No other investigational or standard anti-tumor therapy allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a known history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds&#xD;
             of similar chemical or biologic composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a serious preexisting medical condition(s) or uncontrolled&#xD;
             intercurrent illness that would preclude participation in this study (for example,&#xD;
             interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, history&#xD;
             of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or preexisting&#xD;
             Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in&#xD;
             baseline Grade 2 or higher diarrhea) or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of&#xD;
             cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological original (including,&#xD;

             cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. This applies only to patients who have&#xD;
             a documented history of HIV; HIV testing is not otherwise required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an active systemic fungal and/or known viral infection (for example, human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C&#xD;
             antibodies)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be on EIAEDs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have other active concurrent malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent treatment on another clinical trial. Supportive care trials or&#xD;
             non-therapeutic trials (i.e. Quality of life) are allowed.&#xD;
