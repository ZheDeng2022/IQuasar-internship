      The goal of the proposed study is to determine whether a liberal transfusion strategy&#xD;
      (transfusion trigger at Hb &lt; 10 gm/dl) in Veterans at high cardiac risk who undergo major&#xD;
      open vascular and general surgery operations is associated with decreased risk of adverse&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes compared to a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfusion trigger at&#xD;
      Hb &lt; 7 gm/dl).&#xD;

      Background: Despite the need for clinically appropriate use of blood products in the&#xD;
      postoperative setting, blood transfusion practices are empiric and variable. In the absence&#xD;
      of a physiologic test that can effectively guide transfusion-related decisions after an&#xD;
      operative intervention, hemoglobin-based transfusion triggers have been suggested as clinical&#xD;
      tools. Traditionally, clinicians have transfused patients to maintain hemoglobin (Hb) above a&#xD;
      minimum (typically 10 gm/dl) level, in order to prevent adverse cardiac events and death.&#xD;
      Recent randomized trials, however, have shown that restrictive transfusion policies&#xD;
      (transfusion when Hb falls below 8 gm/dl or even lower) are well tolerated by specific&#xD;
      patient populations. Furthermore, these trials have demonstrated that in some patient subsets&#xD;
      reduced transfusion is associated with reduction in postoperative complications and death.&#xD;
      Thus, guidelines have been developed emphasizing the need for a restrictive transfusion&#xD;
      strategy in most stable hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the emerging enthusiasm with respect to the safety of restrictive transfusion&#xD;
      strategies, high quality evidence on the value of such an approach in patients at high risk&#xD;
      for postoperative adverse cardiac events remains scarce. This is a serious limitation of the&#xD;
      current literature, as ischemic heart disease (IHD) is highly prevalent and represents the&#xD;
      leading cause of mortality in this country, accounting for the death of one American every&#xD;
      minute. Furthermore, there is evidence from small trials and secondary analyses that in this&#xD;
      subset of patients withholding transfusion when Hb falls below 10 gm/dl increases the risk of&#xD;
      death or myocardial infarction, suggesting that widespread use of restrictive transfusion&#xD;
      policies may actually result in patient harm. This uncertainty on transfusion thresholds in&#xD;
      high cardiac risk patients has created a knowledge gap that requires urgent attention. IHD is&#xD;
      highly prevalent in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and myocardial&#xD;
      infarction represents the leading cause of postoperative mortality in patients undergoing&#xD;
      PAD-related surgical interventions. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of patients&#xD;
      undergoing Vascular and General Surgery operations have history of prior IHD, making this&#xD;
      patient population an ideal high cardiac risk group in which to analyze the effect of&#xD;
      transfusion strategies. In order to address the knowledge gap of postoperative transfusion&#xD;
      thresholds in patients at high risk for postoperative adverse cardiac events, the&#xD;
      investigators propose the current study under the hypothesis that transfusion strategy will&#xD;
      affect important postoperative outcomes after major surgical interventions in high cardiac&#xD;
      risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The goal of the proposed study is to determine whether a liberal postoperative&#xD;
      transfusion strategy (transfusion trigger at Hb&lt;10gm/dl) in patients at high risk for&#xD;
      postoperative adverse cardiac events will reduce the risk of adverse postoperative outcomes&#xD;
      after major vascular and general surgery operative interventions. The primary end point is&#xD;
      the composite rate of all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction (MI), coronary&#xD;
      revascularization, stroke, or acute renal failure within 90 days from the time of&#xD;
      randomization. The secondary end points are rates of postoperative infectious complications&#xD;
      (wound infections, pneumonia, and sepsis), and postoperative cardiac complications (new&#xD;
      cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure exacerbation, and cardiac arrest) at 90 days&#xD;
      post-randomization; the composite rate of all-cause mortality, MI, coronary&#xD;
      revascularization, stroke, or acute renal failure, within 30 days from the time of&#xD;
      randomization; the length of hospital stay; and all-cause mortality up to one year after&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: CSP #599 - TOP study is a randomized, intent-to-treat, two-arm, parallel design,&#xD;
      single blind, multicenter trial. Vascular and General Surgery programs at Veterans Affairs&#xD;
      Medical Centers with expertise in performing the operations of interest will be invited to&#xD;
      participate and participants will be screened for enrollment using established&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Enrolled participants will be randomized to one of the two&#xD;
      arms; liberal (transfusion trigger at Hb &lt; 10gm/dl) or restrictive (transfusion trigger at Hb&#xD;
      &lt; 7gm/dl). Consent for the study will be obtained prior to the index surgical intervention.&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed postoperatively after the patient has a confirmed Hb &lt;&#xD;
      10gm/dl. Assessments will be collected pre/post-operatively and at discharge, or at 30 days&#xD;
      after randomization if the patient is still hospitalized. Follow up forms will be filled out&#xD;
      during a clinic visit after the 30th and 90th post-randomization day. Patients who cannot&#xD;
      present to the clinic will have a phone call for follow up. One year post-randomization&#xD;
      mortality will be ascertained using electronic medical records, phone follow-up, and search&#xD;
      of the national death index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Study Duration: This study will randomize 1520 participants undergoing major&#xD;
      vascular and general operations at 15 VA medical centers with expertise in Vascular and&#xD;
      General surgical procedures. Assuming a recruitment rate of 3 participants per site per&#xD;
      month, total recruitment will take approximately four years to complete. The duration of the&#xD;
      study will be five years with four year recruitment, three months active follow up, and nine&#xD;
      months passive follow up which will be performed by the Chairman's office in order to collect&#xD;
      1-year post-randomization data on all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The study will include a) patients who undergo open (non-endovascular) PAD&#xD;
      - related operations, and b) patients who undergo selected major Vascular and General Surgery&#xD;
      operations and have prior history of PAD or IHD. Vascular Surgery operations examined will&#xD;
      include, but not be limited to, PAD-related: aortobifemoral or aortobiiliac bypass, open&#xD;
      abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with simultaneous repair of aortoiliac occlusive disease,&#xD;
      visceral bypass, iliofemoral bypass, femoral bypass or endarterectomy, infrainguinal bypass,&#xD;
      supra-aortic trunk bypass or endarterectomy, carotid endarterectomy, and major lower&#xD;
      extremity amputations (transfemoral, through the knee, or transtibial); Other vascular&#xD;
      surgeries: open aneurysm repair (including but not limited to carotid, subclavian, abdominal&#xD;
      aortic, iliac, femoral, or popliteal aneurysms); and complex endovascular aneurysm repair&#xD;
      (defined as fenestrated endograft, or endograft with need for iliac conduit, or endovascular&#xD;
      aneurysm repair with simultaneous femoral artery reconstruction or bypass). General Surgery&#xD;
      operations examined will include open cholecystectomy or other complex biliary reconstruction&#xD;
      (such as open common bile duct exploration for stones, reconstruction as part of oncologic&#xD;
      operations such as palliative pancreatic cancer procedures) , small bowel resection,&#xD;
      pancreatectomy, colon resection, rectal resection, splenectomy, transhiatal esophagectomy,&#xD;
      liver resection, and open ventral hernia repair. Patients will be included in the study if&#xD;
      their postoperative Hb falls below 10gm/dl within 15 days after surgery. Intervention:&#xD;
      Liberal transfusion strategy is the conventional transfusion method for the surgical&#xD;
      procedures the investigators will include in the study, and is defined as transfusion when&#xD;
      the postoperative Hb drops below 10gm/dl, with a goal to maintain Hb above 10 gm/dl.&#xD;
      Restrictive transfusion strategy will be defined as transfusion when the postoperative Hb&#xD;
      drops below 7gm/dl with goal to maintain Hb above 7 gm/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The proposed CSP# 599 study is uniquely positioned to address the knowledge gap&#xD;
      of postoperative transfusion thresholds in high cardiac risk patients undergoing major&#xD;
      surgical interventions, who are currently transfused based on data from patient populations&#xD;
      with different risk profile. The study will include patients with high IHD burden, a&#xD;
      population that should be the most likely to benefit from a liberal transfusion strategy and&#xD;
      CSP#599 will examine this hypothesis directly. Conversely, if the proposed trial demonstrates&#xD;
      that this high cardiac risk patient population can tolerate restrictive transfusion well,&#xD;
      then the results will be easy to generalize to other patient populations and the question of&#xD;
      transfusion thresholds will be definitively addressed. Thus, the investigators believe that&#xD;
      regardless of outcome this trial will have significant clinical and policy implications, and&#xD;
      will substantially impact the VA and national transfusion-related guidelines.&#xD;
