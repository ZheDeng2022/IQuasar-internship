  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to examine the effect of GH on adipose tissue inflammation, this study will examine&#xD;
      adipose tissue and serum inflammation in patients with GH deficiency before and after GH&#xD;
      therapy. The investigators will also obtain serum samples before and after treatment for&#xD;
      adipokines, inflammatory markers and examine macrophages in circulation with regard to their&#xD;
      inflammatory state. The investigators will also obtain adipose tissue biopsies from healthy&#xD;
      subjects matched to the growth hormone deficiency (GHD) subjects. Adipose tissue specimens&#xD;
      will be analyzed for adipose tissue morphology, adipocyte size, adipokine gene expression,&#xD;
      and adipose tissue macrophage number.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The growth hormone (GH) axis has important influences on adipose tissue. GH may have a novel&#xD;
      effect to reduce macrophage yet increase adipocyte inflammation in adipose tissue along with&#xD;
      reducing adipose tissue mass. Disordered adipose tissue metabolism may dysregulate adipokine&#xD;
      secretion, which could contribute to metabolic abnormalities in GH deficiency. Adipokines,&#xD;
      peptides expressed and secreted by adipose tissue, exert important local adipose tissue and&#xD;
      systemic metabolic effects. This study will combine direct assessment of adipose tissue with&#xD;
      assessment of body composition. Adult GHD can be associated with central adiposity, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, dyslipidemia and increased cardiovascular (CV) risk.&#xD;
