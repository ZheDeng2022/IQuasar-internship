  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of childhood cancer often suffer treatment-related toxicities, including chronic&#xD;
      health conditions, high symptom burden and emotional distress, and decremented functional&#xD;
      status and quality of life. Although some patient-reported outcome (PRO) tools are available&#xD;
      for survivors of childhood cancer younger than 18 years old, very few studies have been&#xD;
      designed to evaluate longitudinal measurement properties of these PRO tools. In this study&#xD;
      the investigators propose to recruit participants from a cohort of diverse childhood cancer&#xD;
      survivors who were treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (St. Jude) to improve&#xD;
      assessment tools for PROs and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to measure the link between Patient Reported Outcome Measurement&#xD;
      Information System (PROMIS) and clinical assessments of childhood cancer survivors over time.&#xD;
      PROMIS is a questionnaire that measures patient-reported outcomes in adults and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plans to enroll 300 children. Surveys will be completed by the children and their&#xD;
      parents/legal guardians (a total of 600 surveys).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the longitudinal construct validity of the PROMIS Pediatric measures for&#xD;
           childhood cancer survivors by testing the association of change in PROMIS PRO scores and&#xD;
           the change in health status measured by objective clinical assessment. Age at baseline&#xD;
           and sex will be included in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish clinically meaningful classifications of the PROMIS Pediatric measures for&#xD;
           childhood cancer survivors by referring PROMIS PRO scores to health status measured by&#xD;
           clinical assessment. Age at baseline and sex will be included in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To estimate the minimally important differences (MIDs) of the PROMIS Pediatric measures&#xD;
           by referring to the change of health status evaluated by anchor-based anchors and&#xD;
           patient-based anchors for childhood cancer survivors. Age at baseline and sex will be&#xD;
           included in the analysis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A longitudinal framework was designed to collect data from childhood cancer survivors (8-18.9&#xD;
      years of age) and parents of participating cancer survivors (i.e., dyads) when they visit the&#xD;
      After Completion of Therapy (ACT) clinic at St. Jude in three consecutive years&#xD;
      (approximately 1 year apart; T1, T2, and T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete pediatric patient-reported outcomes (PRO) survey/questionnaires, a&#xD;
      neurocognitive assessment and physical performance evaluation will be completed, and parental&#xD;
      surveys will be conducted. In addition, any data collected as part of the SJLIFE protocol may&#xD;
      also be used as part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Pediatric PRO survey/questionnaires collection information on PROs. They include&#xD;
           questions about general health, pain interference, fatigue, psychological stress&#xD;
           experiences, stigma, sleep disturbance, sleep-related impairment, positive affect,&#xD;
           meaning and purpose, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and physical function-mobility. Each&#xD;
           cancer survivor will complete these during annual follow-up visits at three time points:&#xD;
           years 1, 2 and 3. This process takes approximately 30-40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Neurocognitive evaluation is done by tests given by a licensed or certified&#xD;
           psychological examiner to evaluate how the participant processes information. The tests&#xD;
           evaluate how problems are solved, how well information is remembered, how well the&#xD;
           participant pays attention, how quickly they understand information, and their&#xD;
           assessment of quality of life. The tests are commonly used standardized tests that take&#xD;
           about 2 hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Physical performance evaluation will measure heart and lung fitness, flexibility,&#xD;
           mobility, muscle strength, endurance, balance and physical mobility. Testing takes about&#xD;
           2 hours to complete and includes six-minute walk test, walking speed test, muscle&#xD;
           strength and flexibility, and balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The parental survey is a parent-report form (PRF) to be completed by parents/legal&#xD;
           guardians of participants. Information collected on the PRF includes demographic&#xD;
           information, parental quality of life, social support, family dynamics, parenting&#xD;
           behaviors, and the child's health care utilization data. The child and parent data will&#xD;
           be compared. Parental questionnaires will be completed at one time point, year 1, 2, or&#xD;
           3, and will take approximately 40 minutes to complete.&#xD;
