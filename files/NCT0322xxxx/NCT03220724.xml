      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      EnvSeq-1 and CH505 M5 gp120 Envs adjuvanted with GLA-SE in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of EnvSeq-1 and CH505&#xD;
      M5 gp120 Envs adjuvanted with GLA-SE in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. The three individual&#xD;
      EnvSeq-1 HIV vaccine Envs used in this study are called CH505TF gp120, CH505w53 gp120, and&#xD;
      CH505w78 gp120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in two parts: Part A and Part B. Participants in Part A will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of four groups. Participants in each group will receive CH505TF&#xD;
      (admixed with GLA-SE) or placebo by intramuscular (IM) injection at Months 0, 2, 4, 8, and&#xD;
      12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study researchers will evaluate participant data from Part A of the study prior to enrolling&#xD;
      participants into Part B of the study. Researchers will also evaluate data from Part A to&#xD;
      determine the dosing for Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Part B will be randomly assigned to one of four groups. Participants in each&#xD;
      group will receive IM injections at Months 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16. GLA-SE will be admixed&#xD;
      with all the CH505 gp120 vaccines. Part B, Group 5 will follow a sequential approach to&#xD;
      EnvSeq-1 vaccine administration with administration of the CH505TF vaccine at Month 0, then&#xD;
      CH505w53 at Month 2, and CH505w78 at Months 4, 8, 12, and 16. Part B, Group 6 participants&#xD;
      will follow an additive approach to EnvSeq-1 administration with administration of the&#xD;
      CH505TF vaccine at Month 0; then the CH505TF and CH505w53 vaccines at Month 2; then the&#xD;
      CH505TF, CH505w53 and CH505w78 vaccines at Month 4; then the CH505w53 and CH505w78 vaccines&#xD;
      at Month 8; then the CH505w78 vaccine at Months 12 and 16. Part B, Group 7 participants will&#xD;
      receive CH505 M5 at Months 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16. Part B, Group 8 participants will receive&#xD;
      placebo injections at each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional study visits will occur through Month 18 for participants in Part A and through&#xD;
      Month 22 for participants in Part B. Visits may include physical examinations and clinical&#xD;
      assessments; blood, urine, and stool collection; HIV testing; risk reduction counseling; and&#xD;
      interviews/questionnaires. Study staff will contact participants for follow-up health&#xD;
      monitoring at Month 24 for participants in Part A and at Month 28 for participants in Part B.&#xD;
