  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accelerated Recovery Performance (ARP) Wave therapy is an electromyostimulation therapy&#xD;
      designed to enhance neuromuscular control in order to rehabilitate patients with&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pathology. The outcomes of this technology have not been assessed under the&#xD;
      rigors of clinical science. This prospective randomized crossover study will assess ARP Wave&#xD;
      to both shorten duration of therapy and determine other advantages in the treatment of&#xD;
      adolescent anterior knee pain. Two cohorts of teenagers will be followed weekly through&#xD;
      either physical therapy (PT) or ARP Wave therapy, physiological therapy versus neurological&#xD;
      therapy, respectively. Results should highlight the clinical utility of this modality and&#xD;
      provide pilot data for future study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will utilize a prospective randomized cohort of adolescent patients that present&#xD;
      to the orthopedic sports center (age restriction greater than 12 years old) with adolescent&#xD;
      anterior knee pain. This knee pain includes: Osgood-Schlatter disease,&#xD;
      Sindig-Larsen-Johanssen syndrome, patellofemoral syndrome, symptomatic medial plicae, and&#xD;
      Hoffa fat pad syndrome/impingement. Although these diagnoses affect slightly different sites&#xD;
      at the anterior knee, the underlying pathology is essentially the same: muscle inflexibility&#xD;
      and core strength weakness. These are clinical diagnoses, and plain radiographs are expected&#xD;
      to be normal with no significant osseous abnormalities other than possible apophyseal&#xD;
      fragmentation. Skeletal maturity will not be an exclusion criteria; but, previous surgery,&#xD;
      history of hemarthrosis, previous physical therapy due to lack of control within the cohorts,&#xD;
      and/or diagnosis of ligament, meniscal, cartilage, or tendon injury will be criteria for&#xD;
      exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization by computer generated order of consent packets will be utilized once the family&#xD;
      and patient agrees to undergo treatment via the proposed trial. Two cohorts of patients will&#xD;
      be created: Cohort #1 and #2. Cohort #1 will consist of patients that begin with the PT&#xD;
      portion of the study (2 sessions per week for 6 weeks per standard of care) and cross-over in&#xD;
      the ARP Wave protocol (20 sessions over 4 weeks). Cohort #2 will consist of patients that&#xD;
      begin with the ARP Wave protocol and then cross-over in the standard PT protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both cohorts will undergo physical therapy utilizing a standard of care uniform PT protocol&#xD;
      for a traumatic knee pain that focuses on flexibility and development of hip core strength&#xD;
      over a 6 week period, visiting the therapist twice per week and encouraged to maintain a home&#xD;
      exercise program (HEP). They will all receive a handout with basic exercises to use at home&#xD;
      to ensure that progress with their HEP is maximized (Appendix I). Basic stretches for the&#xD;
      hamstring and quadriceps muscles will also be provided with line drawings. During this&#xD;
      treatment period the patients will complete a daily diary of time spent on the HEP with&#xD;
      attestation from their parents or guardians, in order to improve compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both cohorts will undergo the same ARP Wave protocol, as well. There are 20 sessions that are&#xD;
      used to take a single individual through to completion of treatment over a period of 30 days.&#xD;
      During that time frame the athletes are not allowed to undergo PT, HEP or their normal&#xD;
      athletic endeavors since it may interfere with the neuromuscular training particular to this&#xD;
      therapeutic modality. Treatments will be performed at an outside vendor that has agreed to&#xD;
      perform the treatments at reduced cost for the sake of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both cohorts of patients will be evaluated every two weeks, for 10 weeks, by an independent&#xD;
      team of observers who will be blinded to the actual cohort that the patient is randomized.&#xD;
      These individuals will perform a Return to Sports (RTS) assessment and measurement of thigh&#xD;
      circumference of the patients at these biweekly assessments. Although the RTS will not&#xD;
      provide an objective measure of absolute core muscle strength, it does provide an objective&#xD;
      measure of dynamic muscle function - which is the ultimate objective of these treatment&#xD;
      modalities, not absolute strength of any given muscle such as the quadriceps. Moreover, the&#xD;
      RTS makes an objective assessment of both strength and endurance of the core lower extremity&#xD;
      muscle groups. These independent observers will also administer patient-derived outcome&#xD;
      scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis for each patient will be performed once they complete their first arm of&#xD;
      the study. Both the research staff and the orthopedic surgeon principal investigator (PI)&#xD;
      will examine the outcome variables at this time in insure safety in treatment. If the&#xD;
      patients are scoring in the 95% percentile on all outcome measures, they will be considered&#xD;
      as reaching the study endpoint and will not cross-over into the next phase of treatment. For&#xD;
      patients who do not reach this 95% percentile of healing at the end of the first arm,&#xD;
      crossover into the next arm of the study will occur immediately. At the end of 10 weeks and&#xD;
      successful completion of both arms of the study, the patient will be seen by the orthopedic&#xD;
      surgeon to make a final assessment regarding treatment progress, knee pain, and whether or&#xD;
      not further treatment will be required (in the standard of care for these patients,&#xD;
      regardless of study cohort).&#xD;

    <description>ARP Wave therapy utilizes direct current compounded with a high frequency double exponential background waveform that creates an electromyostimulation with characteristics that contrast with more conventional therapeutic neuromuscular electrical stimulation, including: interferential, microcurrent, galvanic, Russian stimulation, and iontophoresis. ARPWave therapy is a class II FDA medical device that has been approved for muscle re-education, relaxation of muscle spasms, increased neovascularization, prevention of disuse atrophy, and maintaining/increasing joint range of motion. The ARPWave Rx100 uses a main electrostimulation pulse of 40 to 500 cycles per second that is coupled with a background high-frequency carrier signal at 10,000 cycles per second. The polarity direction of electron flow is reversible within the unit and this is utilized as part of the therapy.</description>
