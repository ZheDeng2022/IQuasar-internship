      Background: In children and adults living with HIV, cardiomyopathy is a major source of&#xD;
      comorbidity. Traditional echocardiographic measures are insensitive and consequently&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy often goes undiagnosed until late stages of disease. Myocardial deformation&#xD;
      imaging represents a promising means to identify early dysfunction, but to date there have&#xD;
      been no large studies using strain or strain rate to assess cardiac function in children with&#xD;
      HIV and to establish predictors of worse cardiac function such as viral burden and ART&#xD;
      regimen. These studies are critically important as earlier diagnosis and intervention&#xD;
      represent the best means to alter the course of HIV-associated cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To determine the association of biomarker levels, myocardial deformation, and&#xD;
      viral load level history in HIV infected children attending Moi Teaching and Referral&#xD;
      Hospital (MTRH) clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A cross-sectional study on clients attending HIV clinic, MTRH. Setting: Module 4 HIV&#xD;
      clinic at MTRH in western Kenya, Africa. Population: HIV-infected children attending clinic&#xD;
      in 2017 - 2018 Main Measures: Echocardiographic function assessment, Age, Immune status,&#xD;
      other illnesses, ART status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions: The study will explore the NIH/HIV High Priority Target area of HIV-associated&#xD;
      cardiac co-morbidities and will enhance understanding of the relationship between cardiac&#xD;
      function and viremia. The investigators expect to be able to reliably define a subset of&#xD;
      children with worse cardiac function by risk factors: specific ART regimens, less time&#xD;
      virally suppressed, and increased BNP biomarker.&#xD;

      Research Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Protocol Title: Evaluating Indicators of Cardiac Function in Children Living with Human&#xD;
           Immunodeficiency Virus in Western Kenya&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Purpose of Study: To determine the association of biomarker levels and relevant HIV&#xD;
           history with cardiac function in HIV infected children attending Moi Teaching and&#xD;
           Referral Hospital (MTRH) clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Background &amp; Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
           HIV-associated cardiomyopathy is a disease that exposes children with the infection to&#xD;
           tremendous morbidity and mortality. Detection of cardiomyopathy is limited by&#xD;
           traditional echocardiographic measures (i.e. left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF),&#xD;
           which do not detect cardiomyopathy until late stages of disease. Therefore, a critical&#xD;
           need exists to determine HIV-associated cardiomyopathy risk through early detection.&#xD;
           Prior to changes in traditional echocardiographic measures, newer cardiac imaging&#xD;
           techniques such as myocardial deformation imaging (ie strain measurements) can detect&#xD;
           decreased myocardial performance when LVEF is still normal. The lack of methods to&#xD;
           detect early myocardial dysfunction and biomarkers that determine risk are major barrier&#xD;
           for outcomes and treatment research.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Myocardial deformation imaging represents a promising means to identify early&#xD;
           dysfunction, but to date there have been no large studies using strain to assess cardiac&#xD;
           function in children with HIV. Further, none have established predictors of worse&#xD;
           cardiac function such as viral burden, immune status, zidovudine-containing ART&#xD;
           regimens, and inflammatory state. This large-scale investigation utilizing the latest&#xD;
           imaging techniques in evaluating cardiac function will provide first-in-kind data&#xD;
           enabling estimation of prevalence of early HIV-associated cardiomyopathy as well as risk&#xD;
           stratification. The study will explore the NIH/HIV High Priority Target area of&#xD;
           HIV-associated cardiac co-morbidities and will enhance understanding of the relationship&#xD;
           between cardiac function and viremia. Although these data will substantively enhance our&#xD;
           understanding of early disease progression in children with subclinical HIV-associated&#xD;
           cardiomyopathy, my long-term objective is to use these data in support of future work&#xD;
           focused on early initiation of potentially, life altering therapies (such as&#xD;
           angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and digoxin medications) to children at highest&#xD;
           risk for HIV-associated cardiac dysfunction in Africa and other resource poor regions of&#xD;
           the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The proposal objective is to determine the association of biomarker levels, myocardial&#xD;
           deformation, and viral load level history in children with perinatally acquired HIV. Our&#xD;
           central hypothesis is that risk of abnormal myocardial strain can be defined in terms of&#xD;
           HIV clinical parameters - including viral load, antiretroviral therapy (ART), CD4 count,&#xD;
           and serum biomarkers (such as b-natriuretic peptide, BNP). The investigators will&#xD;
           accomplish our objectives with the following Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
           AIM 1: Describe the prevalence of cardiomyopathy using myocardial deformation imaging&#xD;
           compared with traditional echocardiographic measures in a large cohort of children&#xD;
           living with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1: Strain and rate measurements will demonstrate presence of early&#xD;
           cardiomyopathy not detected by traditional echocardiographic measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           AIM 2: Evaluate the association between HIV viral load and global longitudinal strain&#xD;
           and strain rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 2: Children with detectable replicating virus will have worse global&#xD;
           longitudinal strain and strain rate measurements than those who are virally suppressed,&#xD;
           and increasing viral load will be associated with worsening longitudinal strain and&#xD;
           strain rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           AIM 3: Evaluate the association between b-natriuretic peptide level and myocardial&#xD;
           strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 3: There will be an inverse relationship between b-natriuretic peptide level&#xD;
           and myocardial strain. The correlation between b-natriuretic peptide level and&#xD;
           myocardial strain will potentially lead to screening thresholds in children living with&#xD;
           HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Design &amp; Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a cross sectional design and conducted on consecutive HIV infected children&#xD;
      seen in the AMPATH Pediatric HIV clinic whose mothers or caregivers give consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will undergo a 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram after enrollment&#xD;
      during her/his regularly scheduled clinic follow up as defined in the inclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      echocardiogram will be completed with a portable cardiovascular ultrasound machine (GE Vivid&#xD;
      q or similar) equipped with 4-8 MHz tissue-harmonic imaging probes. Images will be acquired&#xD;
      with raw data and DICOM data at frame rates 60-100 frames/min. Additionally,&#xD;
      electrocardiographic leads will be attached during image acquisition. The echocardiogram is&#xD;
      anticipated to take less than 20 minutes of procedure time for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional echocardiographic measurements will include LVEF, fractional shortening, and&#xD;
      estimations of diastolic function such as mitral inflow E/A ratio. Additionally, assessment&#xD;
      of the right ventricle will include indicators of pulmonary hypertension such as tricuspid&#xD;
      regurgitant jet velocity, tricuspid valve annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), and&#xD;
      pulmonary insufficiency end-diastolic gradient. Measurements will be performed according to&#xD;
      American Society of Echocardiography standards. The definition of cardiomyopathy will be&#xD;
      restricted to reduced left ventricular systolic function. Reduced left ventricular systolic&#xD;
      function will be defined as ejection fraction less than 50% by traditional measures.&#xD;
      Fractional shortening and myocardial deformation imaging (longitudinal strain) will be&#xD;
      defined as reduced left ventricular systolic function if the value is less than 2 standard&#xD;
      deviations below the published means for age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left ventricular global longitudinal strain and strain rate measurements will be made using&#xD;
      the &quot;length of line&quot; technique from the apical 4-chamber, 2-chamber, and 3-chamber views.&#xD;
      Right ventricular longitudinal strain and strain rate measurements will be made from the&#xD;
      apical 4-chamber view using the same technique. All strain and strain rate measurements will&#xD;
      be performed utilizing GE console analysis package (Netherlands) and TomTec ImageComTM&#xD;
      software (Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be extracted from the electronic and paper medical record for key demographic and&#xD;
      historical data including but not limited to markers of HIV infection (e.g., white blood cell&#xD;
      counts, nadir and most recent CD4 counts, and HIV viral loads), duration since initiation of&#xD;
      ART, type of regimen, regimen changes, lifetime ART exposure, anthropomorphic data (age,&#xD;
      weight, height, sex, and gender), blood pressure measurements, and comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be obtained as additional vials with the same clinically indicated&#xD;
      venipuncture for all subjects. The primary study population will be children undergoing a&#xD;
      routine clinically-indicated laboratory blood draw. However, children attending clinic for a&#xD;
      routine follow up visit but not due for a laboratory blood draw will still be offered the&#xD;
      opportunity to participate in the study as well. No more than 5 ml of blood will be drawn for&#xD;
      the study. Children less than 3.5 kg will be excluded. The blood samples transported daily to&#xD;
      the AMPATH Reference Laboratory at MTRH, which is accredited by the NIAID Division of AIDS.&#xD;
      Samples will be labeled with study identification number only. The reference laboratory will&#xD;
      be governed under the Duke - Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital data agreement. The&#xD;
      investigators will analyze b-natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels for all subjects. Additionally,&#xD;
      the remaining serum will be stored at the AMPATH Reference Laboratory for testing of&#xD;
      inflammatory markers at Duke University. In order to understand mechanisms of cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      in the HIV-infected, the investigators plan to secure additional funding to test markers of&#xD;
      inflammation thought to be causative in cardiac dysfunction including: tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      alpha (TNF- α), interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, and IL-8. TNF- α, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-8, and ST2.&#xD;
      The investigators will store the blood specimens for up to 2 years after the last patient has&#xD;
      been enrolled. Specimens will be destroyed or further IREC approval will be requested to&#xD;
      maintain the stores beyond May 2020.&#xD;
