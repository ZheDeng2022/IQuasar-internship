  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) refers to the clinically cervical visible lesion with&#xD;
      a diameter of &gt; 4 cm, which has been considered as a high risk of early cervical cancer for a&#xD;
      long time. Because of local bulk lesion of LACC, the risk of radical hysterectomy is pretty&#xD;
      high and the radical effect commonly does not meet the satisfactory. Therefore, 1-3 course of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) were carried out before operation. However, nearly 20% of&#xD;
      patients are not sensitive to NACT. Therefore NACT did not bring any benefits to radical&#xD;
      surgery even to some extent delayed the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional radiotherapy is also commonly used in the treatment of LACC, however ovarian&#xD;
      function would be permanently destroyed especially for young patients, additionally&#xD;
      radioactive complications to adjacent organs of cervical such as vagina, bladder and rectal&#xD;
      also commonly happened, moreover sexual dysfunction after radiotherapy significantly affect&#xD;
      the life quality of young patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particle radiotherapy developed recently, has the advantages of short course of treatment and&#xD;
      mild side effects, due to its special working mechanism, Bragg effect. So the amount of&#xD;
      radiation in the tumor tissue is very extremely high, and in the adjacent tissue is quiet&#xD;
      low, therefore the organs at risk were protected by avoiding unnecessary damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these, we proposed the application of particle radiotherapy in LACC pre-operation,&#xD;
      and comprehensively evaluated recent curative effect, complications and long-term follow-up&#xD;
      between particle radiotherapy and NACT. Furthermore, the clinical significance and long-term&#xD;
      application prospects about particle therapy were objectively assessed.&#xD;
