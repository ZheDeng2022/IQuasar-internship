  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer will experience one or more&#xD;
      episodes of fever or infection during their course of therapy. The most common&#xD;
      microbiologically documented infection is bloodstream infection (BSI), which can be&#xD;
      associated with severe sepsis or death. Current methods of diagnosis require a significant&#xD;
      load of live bacteria in the blood making early detection difficult. Delayed diagnosis and&#xD;
      delayed optimal therapy of BSIs are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to identify whether next generation sequencing (NGS) of pathogens can&#xD;
      identify patients with impending bloodstream infection. This would enable preemptive targeted&#xD;
      therapy to replace antibacterial prophylaxis which often leads ot high-density broad-spectrum&#xD;
      antibiotic exposure and contributes to subsequent development of antibiotic resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of next generation pathogen sequencing for&#xD;
           prediction of bloodstream infection in children with cancer at high risk of infection.&#xD;

      Plasma samples collected but not required for clinical care (discarded samples) will be&#xD;
      collected and stored. Results of NGS will be compared between patients who develop BSI&#xD;
      immediately (within 72 hours) after sample collection, those who develop other infectious&#xD;
      syndromes, and those who remain well. Clinical data describing baseline information about the&#xD;
      patient and malignancy, antibiotic and chemotherapy exposure, microbiology testing,&#xD;
      hematology results, and infection-related events will be collected prospectively from the&#xD;
      electronic medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial exploratory phase will examine approximately 50 participants to determine whether&#xD;
      the effectiveness of predicting infections. The study may then enroll up to 200 participants&#xD;
      to collection additional data for analysis.&#xD;
