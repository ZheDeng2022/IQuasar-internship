  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study of pembrolizumab plus mifepristone in advanced breast cancer&#xD;
      patients. The study will include a safety lead in of ten patients. Patients who are deemed&#xD;
      eligible and have signed informed consent will be treated with pembrolizumab at a fixed dose&#xD;
      of 200 mg intravenously on day 1 of each 21 day cycle for each dose level. Mifepristone 300mg&#xD;
      PO be administered daily starting the week prior to pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the safety of the combination is confirmed (study will be paused at least 6 weeks after&#xD;
      first 10 patients are enrolled for safety evaluation), dose expansion cohorts will be&#xD;
      performed in parallel for two cohorts: cohort 1 in triple-negative breast cancer and cohort 2&#xD;
      in hormone receptor positive breast cancer.&#xD;

      Eligible patients will be treated with pembrolizumab on day 1 of every 21 day cycle, given at&#xD;
      a dose of 200 mg. Mifepristone 300mg PO will be administered daily starting the week prior to&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. Enrollment will be paused after the first 10 patients are enrolled in the&#xD;
      study for a safety evaluation. Once safety is confirmed, dose expansion cohorts will be&#xD;
      performed in parallel for each indication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hormone receptor positive, hormone refractory advanced breast cancer (n = 25-34)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Triple-negative advanced breast cancer (n = 27-40) Mandatory pre- and on-treatment tumor&#xD;
           biopsies will be obtained in order to evaluate immunological changes in these tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle length is 21 days. Patients will be evaluated every 3 cycles until progression of&#xD;
      disease unless the patient is otherwise withdrawn from the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of pembrolizumab in combination with mifepristone in patients &lt; 18 years of age,&#xD;
             children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric&#xD;
             trials.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must practice abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual contact&#xD;
             with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in&#xD;
             the study, during dose interruptions and for 6 months following protocol&#xD;
             discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any number of prior therapies is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must consent to pre and on treatment research biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Cohort 1 (TNBC):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have diagnosis of triple negative breast cancer (defined as ER &lt; 1% by IHC, PR &lt; 1% by&#xD;
             IHC, Her 2 negative by ASCO CAP guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with TNBC may be enrolled in dose expansion cohort A with any number of prior&#xD;
             lines of therapy (patients will be allowed to enroll in frontline setting).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cohort 2 (HR+):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a diagnosis of ER+ and/or PR+ breast cancer (defined as ER/PR &gt; 1% by IHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ breast cancer must have progressed on at least 2 lines of&#xD;
             endocrine therapy, unless ER/PR expression is low (&lt; 10% positive) or weakly&#xD;
             expressed, and the treating physician does not feel endocrine therapy is appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to entering the study must&#xD;
             have recovered from adverse events to Grade 1. Radiation within 3 months of study&#xD;
             treatment initiation is prohibited, as serious rashes have been observed in patients&#xD;
             who have recently received radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study&#xD;
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational&#xD;
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 agent, or&#xD;
             mifepristone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.&#xD;
             Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are&#xD;
             stable (without evidence of progression by imaging at least 4 weeks prior to first&#xD;
             dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have&#xD;
             no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at&#xD;
             least 7 days prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to pembrolizumab or mifepristone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent medical or psychiatric illness that would limit compliance&#xD;
             with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Mifepristone is an abortifacient&#xD;
             agent with the potential for teratogenic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with Mifepristone, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother wishes to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with pembrolizumab and/or mifepristone.&#xD;
             In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated&#xD;
             with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active infection requiring intravenous systemic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to first&#xD;
             dose of therapy. Administration of killed vaccines is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), known active Hepatitis B (e.g. HBsAg&#xD;
             reactive), or Hepatitis C (e.g. HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected) infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Long term or concurrent use of corticosteroid therapy other than for premedication or&#xD;
             supportive care use as detailed in the protocol. Physiologic doses of steroids (e.g.&#xD;
             equivalent to or less than oral prednisone 10mg daily) are allowed and do not require&#xD;
             approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mifepristone can both inhibit CYP3A4 and induce CYP3A4. Addition of mifepristone to a&#xD;
             pre-existing drug regimen may cause a mild and temporary increase in plasma drug&#xD;
             concentration of drugs with significant CYP3A4 metabolism. Medications that are strong&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A4 such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin,&#xD;
             primidone, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine, St. John's Wort may decrease plasma&#xD;
             mifepristone levels. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitor medications are expected to cause the&#xD;
             largest increases in plasma mifepristone concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mifepristone may increase the plasma drug concentration of concomitant medications&#xD;
             with metabolism mediated by CYP2C9/CYP2C8. Drugs with the largest increases will be&#xD;
             those whose metabolism is largely or solely mediated by CYP2C9/2C8 and include:&#xD;
             Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that&#xD;
             required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
