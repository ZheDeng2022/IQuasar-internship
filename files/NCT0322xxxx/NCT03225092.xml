    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the potential effects of platelet rich plasma for the treatment&#xD;
      of persistent medial knee pain after total knee arthroplasty. All study participants will&#xD;
      receive PRP injections and will be followed up to see if any benefit in regards to pain&#xD;
      and/or function is achieved.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections for the&#xD;
      treatment of persistent medial knee pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that PRP injections will provide meaningful pain relief and&#xD;
      improved functionality for patients suffering from post-TKA residual pain. The incidence of&#xD;
      residual pain after TKA ranges between 10-34%. Many of these patients can be effectively&#xD;
      managed by physical therapy, orthotics, and pes anserine bursa corticosteroid injections.&#xD;
      However, there remain a number of refractory cases that are frustrating for both the patient&#xD;
      and physician. With the advent of interventional pain management, advanced interventions for&#xD;
      this clinical problem have focused on selective nerve blocks and ablations targeting the&#xD;
      infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve. More recently, attention has been paid to the&#xD;
      role of patient biology and inflammatory mediators in the development of post-arthroplasty&#xD;
      pain (including IL-6 and CRP). If individual patient biology is the foundation of post-TKA&#xD;
      pain, then biologic interventions aimed at restoring the balance of these mediators (such as&#xD;
      PRP), rather than ablative procedures, seems preferable. Furthermore, while intra-operative&#xD;
      PRP has been studied for its effects on wound healing, blood loss, and post-operative pain&#xD;
      control, no study has investigated its utility in treating residual medial knee pain after&#xD;
      TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All injections will be performed by the same board-certified sports medicine and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal ultrasound physician. There will be no activity restrictions following the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to report mean changes in outcome scores. Data will be&#xD;
      analyzed with a 2-sample t-test.&#xD;
