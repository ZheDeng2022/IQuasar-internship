    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about the problems in brain function in focal hand dystonia (FHD) or complex&#xD;
      regional pain syndrome (CRPS) dystonia. It is unclear why some CRPS patients develop dystonia&#xD;
      but others do not. Researchers want to learn which area of the brain is involved in CRPS&#xD;
      dystonia compared with FHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand why people with CRPS develop dystonia, and if these reasons are different in&#xD;
      people with FHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 - 70 with CRPS dystonia OR with CRPS without dystonia OR with FHD and Healthy&#xD;
      volunteers of similar age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with physical exam, neurological exam, and medical history.&#xD;
      They may give a urine sample and will answer questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can have 4 - 5 outpatient visits or stay at the clinical center for&#xD;
      approximately 5-6 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have MRI scans. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of a&#xD;
      scanner that takes pictures of their brain. They will do small tasks or be asked to imagine&#xD;
      things during the scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) sessions for a few hours, with&#xD;
      breaks. A brief electrical current passing through a well insulated wire coil on the scalp&#xD;
      creates a magnetic pulse. This affects brain activity. Participants may do small tasks during&#xD;
      TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have the electrical activity of their muscles measured during TMS sessions.&#xD;
      Small sticky pads will be attached to their hands and arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants ability to feel 2 separate stimuli as different will be tested by using a weak&#xD;
      electrical shock to their fingers. They will also be asked to feel small plastic domes with&#xD;
      ridges, that may cause discomfort.&#xD;

      Objective: detailed evaluation of pathophysiology of Focal Hand Dystonia (FHD) with focus on&#xD;
      the involvement of the parietal area, and to investigate differences in cortical mapping in&#xD;
      the sensory and motor cortices between FHD and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study will enroll patients with FHD and Healthy Volunteers (HVs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective study using MRI and Physiology experiments using EMG and TMS based&#xD;
      protocols to evaluate the differences between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The evaluation using fMRI will be performed under 3 conditions; 1. Rest 2.&#xD;
      Voluntary activity 3. Motor imagery task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures (fMRI based):&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will explore the differences in BOLD signal in the parietal lobe, in FHD compared to HVs,&#xD;
      in the different conditions. We will look for changes in the BOLD signal in the parietal&#xD;
      sensorimotor integration area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use vascular occupancy imaging (VASO) to explore differences of detailed cortical&#xD;
      mapping of neural structures between FHD and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Physiology experiments aim to explore abnormalities and differences in the baseline motor&#xD;
      cortical excitability between the groups and evaluate the influence of continuous Theta Burst&#xD;
      Stimulation (cTBS) on these measures. We will study the influence of cTBS on the phenomenon&#xD;
      Cortical Silent Period (cSP) in FHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also be studying the baseline Spatial and Temporal Discrimination (SDTs and TDTs),&#xD;
      which are measures of sensory surround inhibition and have been noted to be endophenotypic of&#xD;
      dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiology outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline differential influences of PMv and IPL on motor cortical excitability and changes&#xD;
      after cTBS of dIPL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline cortical Silent Period (cSP) in the involved and uninvolved limb in FHD and the&#xD;
      influence of cTBS on cSP in the involved limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TDTs/ SDTs in both the involved and uninvolved limbs in FHD compared to HVs.&#xD;
