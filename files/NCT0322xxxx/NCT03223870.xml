    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the Fingertip Respiratory Rate algorithm&#xD;
      performance of the Nonin Medical X-100SP pulse oximetry systems with the 8300AA sensors and&#xD;
      Onyx 3 fingertip oximeter. There is no treatment or interventions being performed.&#xD;

      1. Start data collection system(s) and allow them to run 15 minutes prior to study start of&#xD;
           each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Confirm that the subject meets inclusion/exclusion criteria and has signed the current&#xD;
           IRB- approved Informed Consent Form&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Collect Demographic and Anthropometric Data from the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Place Pulse Oximetry Sensors&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Place nasal cannula for capnography recordings&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A summary of Respiratory rate protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Stage 1: Subject will rest quietly and breathe at a normal comfortable rate for 40&#xD;
                minutes. The start and stop times will be marked on the data collection system.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Stage 2: Immediately after Stage 1 is complete, the subject will start the 25&#xD;
                minute paced breathing protocol which will ramp from 5-45 BPM. A computer program&#xD;
                will be used to guide the subject through the stage 2 paced breathing. The start&#xD;
                and stop times will be marked on the data collection system.&#xD;

        A minimum of 30 subjects will be included in this study. The subject selection will be an&#xD;
        approximately equal mix of males and females with varying skin tones. At a rate of 3-4&#xD;
        subjects per day, enrollment will take approximately 7-10 days to complete.&#xD;
