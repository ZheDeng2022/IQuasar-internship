      The researchers hypothesize that there is a correlation between Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)&#xD;
      performance and innate athletic skill level. A similar study was conducted in female, young&#xD;
      adult gymnasts where a correlation was shown between VOR performance and gymnastic skill&#xD;
      level. However, the results from this study did not suggest that VOR differences develop as a&#xD;
      result of practice; rather that the differences in VOR may simply allow some individuals to&#xD;
      become better performers. In this study the researchers would like to extend the population&#xD;
      to adults both with and without a background in gymnastics to determine the natural&#xD;
      relationship between VOR and innate athletic potential.&#xD;

      Sports like gymnastics, diving, and ice skating often involve rotational elements with high&#xD;
      angular velocities. Many of these are airborne skills and have a significant element of risk.&#xD;
      The athletes who perform these skills have to rely on sensory information from the visual and&#xD;
      vestibular systems. It has been suggested that the vestibular system adapts to these types of&#xD;
      inputs and the athlete no longer experiences dizziness associated with multiple rotations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent Neuroscience abstract described a small study of the directional selectivity of&#xD;
      vestibular habituation adult professional figure skaters. The results showed that figure&#xD;
      skaters demonstrated a profound reduction in the magnitude of post-rotary nystagmus and&#xD;
      caloric test response in their preferred direction of rotation. It was suggested that this&#xD;
      sensitivity was a result of &quot;habituation.&quot; The authors implied that the skaters learned to&#xD;
      suppress vestibular receptors on the side that they turned toward. This deduction is based on&#xD;
      patients that develop pathology on one side and learn to suppress the sensation on that side.&#xD;
      However, we do not currently know if the developing vestibular system works the same way or&#xD;
      if this is an inherited trait. Most of these athletes started as children, when their&#xD;
      vestibular system was still developing, and may have a more fine-tuned vestibular system and&#xD;
      be able to suppress certain reflexes. On the other hand, it could be that some people are&#xD;
      born with the ability to suppress this sensation, thus allowing them to become elite&#xD;
      athletes. Currently there isn't a defined relationship between a person's athleticism or&#xD;
      athletic upbringing and their vestibular system performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major component of vestibular performance is the Vestibular Ocular Reflex (VOR). The VOR is&#xD;
      responsible for stabilizing the visual field on the retina during head movement. To&#xD;
      accomplish this, the eyes are reflexively moved in a direction opposite the head. For&#xD;
      example, in a twisting gymnast, this actually reduces the ability of gymnasts to see the&#xD;
      landing during airborne skills. Hence, it becomes necessary for gymnasts to cancel or&#xD;
      suppress their VOR in order to view the landing. A previous study conducted by the&#xD;
      researchers determined that young, actively practicing gymnasts (mean age 15Â±2.2) had a&#xD;
      higher ability to suppress their VOR than non-gymnasts of the same age. This previous study&#xD;
      determined that there is a correlation between VOR performance and gymnastic skill level.&#xD;
      However, these results do not suggest that the VOR differences develop as a result of&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to establish a relationship between VOR performance and athleticism. By&#xD;
      comparing ex-gymnast adults (ages 18-30), and their age-matched, non-gymnast counterparts to&#xD;
      the previous study results involving actively practicing, child gymnasts, a relationship&#xD;
      between VOR performance and athletic skill can be determined. Furthermore, examining the VOR&#xD;
      data collected from this study to data collected from tests aimed at determining athleticism,&#xD;
      or a person's athletic potential, it may be possible to relate VOR performance to athletic&#xD;
      skill; In other words, determining whether athletes are successful because their vestibular&#xD;
      performance is superior to those whom are non-athletes, or it is a learned skill with&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

        Approximately 12 adults (6 ex-gymnastics, and 6 age matched, non-gymnast counterparts),&#xD;
        ages 18-30 will be obtained via a sample of convenience from the University community.&#xD;
        Subjects will be asked to wear a measurement system (Eyelink II, SR Research) that tracks&#xD;
        head and eye movements as they perform as set of eye and head movements to measure saccadic&#xD;
        eye movements, VOR and VOR suppression. Periodic calibrations will be performed throughout&#xD;
        the experiment to test the continued reliability of the data.&#xD;
