      This study evaluates the performance of new technology &quot;CRYOTHERAPY MAINS ET DECOLLETE&quot;&#xD;
      against a classic cryotherapy &quot;Nitrogen Liquid &quot; to treat solar lentigines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hands and the neckline will be randomised, either left or right side and treated by two&#xD;
      cryotherapy devices:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CRYOTHERAPY MAINS ET DECOLLETE is the device under evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Liquid nitrogen is a comparator device.&#xD;
