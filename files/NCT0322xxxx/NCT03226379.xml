      The DREAMM project is investigating whether the DREAMM interventions (1) Health system&#xD;
      strengthening, 2) Co-designed education programs tailored to frontline healthcare workers, 3)&#xD;
      Implementation of a diagnostic and treatment algorithm and, 4) Communities of practice in&#xD;
      infectious diseases and laboratory capacity building) when combined reduce two week all-cause&#xD;
      mortality of HIV-associated meningo-encephalitis in African LMICs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-associated central nervous system (CNS) infection causes significant mortality and places&#xD;
      a high burden on limited health care resources in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Cohort and&#xD;
      autopsy studies estimate that CNS infections cause up to a third of HIV-related deaths in&#xD;
      African LMICs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryptococcal meningitis alone is estimated to account for up to 20% of HIV-related mortality&#xD;
      and its' incidence in Africa, unlike in resource-rich settings, has remained high despite&#xD;
      antiretroviral roll out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In African low and middle-income countries (LMICs) mortality associated with cryptococcal&#xD;
      meningitis has been estimated at 70% at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuberculous meningitis mortality also remains unacceptably high and is reported at over 70%&#xD;
      in a study from Cameroon. Delays in diagnosis are key causes of poor patient outcomes for&#xD;
      tuberculous and bacterial meningitis, and cryptococcal meningitis where patients present late&#xD;
      and with advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the DREAMM study is to drive down this unacceptably high mortality associated with&#xD;
      HIV-associated meningo-encephalitis in LMICs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further aim is to provide capacity building in implementation research at each of the sites&#xD;
      driven by the local African Principal Investigators (PIs) (Dr Cecilia Kanyama, Lilongwe,&#xD;
      Malawi; Dr Charles Kouanfack, Yaoundé, Cameroon; Dr Sayoki Mfinanga, NIMR, Dar es Salaam&#xD;
      Tanzania, Dr Saulos Nyirenda, Zomba, Malawi).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is in three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Observation: Local clinical and laboratory procedures and practices and availability of&#xD;
           essential drugs and diagnostic tests for routine care of HIV-associated&#xD;
           meningo-encephalitis patients in three study countries will be observed and documented.&#xD;
           75 patients in total will be recruited into the observation phase of DREAMM, 25 patients&#xD;
           from each study country.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Training: A co-designed laboratory and clinical training program on HIV-associated&#xD;
           meningitis in LMICs tailored to frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) will be delivered.&#xD;
           Key clinical and laboratory routine HCWs will be trained including on the latest point&#xD;
           of care (POC) diagnostic tests and safe administration of essential medicines for&#xD;
           HIV-associated meningo-encephalitis such as amphotericin B deoxycholate using a Train&#xD;
           the Trainer approach. The knowledge and skills will be disseminated widely following&#xD;
           this training by frontline HCWs. Locally adapted optimal clinical and laboratory&#xD;
           pathways for the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-related meningoencephalitis in resource&#xD;
           limited settings will be devised during the training phase using a health system&#xD;
           engineering approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Implementation: Implementation of an algorithmic approach to diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
           HIV-associated meningitis including aggressive microbiological detection and treatment&#xD;
           of cryptococcosis and tuberculosis in the five study sites. The aim is to reduce the&#xD;
           time from participant presentation to diagnostic testing and administration of&#xD;
           effective, microbiologically-driven treatment. As part of the implementation of the&#xD;
           algorithm, the optimised clinical and laboratory pathways endorsed by local leadership&#xD;
           are implemented. Communities of practice are formed with weekly multidisciplinary&#xD;
           meetings to discuss clinical cases and continue laboratory capacity building.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from the observation and implementation phases of the study will be fed back to&#xD;
      local ministries of health (MOH), and access to essential antifungal drugs and diagnostic&#xD;
      tests for HIV-associated meningitis improved and finally, cohesive HIV-related meningitis&#xD;
      guidelines for African LMICs developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Important sub-studies include a health economics evaluation study to determine the cost of&#xD;
      the intervention and routine care costs. A new semi-quantitative cryptococcal antigen lateral&#xD;
      flow assay (CrAg LFA) (CryptoPS, Biosynex, Strasburg, France) will be evaluated uniquely for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of patients with meningo-encephalitis. New, POC polyvalent tests (CrAg/HIV) and&#xD;
      (CrAg/Streptococcus pneumoniae) will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These POC tests nested within algorithms, and the new tests being evaluated, together with&#xD;
      administration of recommended, microbiologically driven treatments have the potential to&#xD;
      significantly reduce CNS infection-related mortality by reducing delays in proven diagnosis&#xD;
      and initiation of effective treatments.&#xD;
