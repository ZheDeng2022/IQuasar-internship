  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to obtain clinical performance (outcomes) data and&#xD;
      survivorship for commercially available Vivacit-E (HXPE) liners. This will be done by&#xD;
      analysis of polyethylene wear, validated outcome measurement tools, radiographs, and reported&#xD;
      adverse events data.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Safety will be evaluated by monitoring the frequency and incidence of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance will be determined by assessment of the overall pain and functional performances,&#xD;
      survivorship, health status and radiographic parameters of all enrolled study subjects who&#xD;
      receive the Vivacit-E HXPE Liner with the Continuum acetabular shell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the implanted Vivacit-E HXPE Liners will be evaluated for bedding in, and linear&#xD;
      and volumetric wear by the Martell 2-D method at 6 weeks and 1, 2, 4, &amp; 5 years&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain and functional performance will be measured using the Harris Hip and High Activity&#xD;
      Arthroplasty Scores. Survivorship will be based on removal or intended removal of the device&#xD;
      and through analysis of radiographs, and health status will be determined by evaluation of&#xD;
      the EQ-5D.&#xD;
