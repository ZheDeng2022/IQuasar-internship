  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human intestinal tract harbours a diverse and complex microbial community which plays a&#xD;
      central role in human health. It has been estimated that our gut contains in the range of&#xD;
      1000 bacterial species and 100-fold more genes than are found in the human genome . This&#xD;
      community is commonly referred to as our hidden metabolic 'organ' due to their immense impact&#xD;
      on human wellbeing, including host metabolism, physiology, nutrition and immune function. It&#xD;
      is now apparent that our gut microbiome coevolves with us and that changes to this population&#xD;
      can have major consequences, both beneficial and harmful, for human health. Indeed, it has&#xD;
      been suggested that disruption of the gut microbiota (or dysbiosis) can be significant with&#xD;
      respect to pathological intestinal conditions such as obesity and malnutritio, systematic&#xD;
      diseases such as diabetes and chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease (IBD), encompassing ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of the gut microbiome in human health and disease is becoming clearer thanks to high&#xD;
      throughput sequencing technologies (HTS) as well as parallel recent developments in non&#xD;
      genomic techniques.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) there is a quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      alteration of intestinal microflora (dysbiosis); so the composition and metabolic activities&#xD;
      of microflora are changed in CKD. These alterations include changes in intestinal transit,&#xD;
      decreased protein absorption, decrease in dietary fibre intake, treatment with oral iron and&#xD;
      frequent use of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of this contributes to systemic inflammation and the accumulation of uraemic toxins that&#xD;
      are absorbed by intestine and eliminated by the kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This uraemic toxins have been associated with deleterious biological effects in different&#xD;
      tissues and cell lines and with an increased risk of the progression of CKD, morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression of CKD: both indoxyl sulfate(IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS) are associated&#xD;
           to the development of fibrosis, deterioration of renal function and disease progression&#xD;
           . In vitro studies have shown a deleterious effect of these molecules on renal tubular&#xD;
           cells. - Cardiovascular complications: in CKD patients, IS is associated with&#xD;
           endothelial damage, arterial stiffness and aortic calcification .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anaemia: IS has been associated with anaemia of the renal patient; it interfere with the&#xD;
           adequate production of erythropoietin and increased eryptosis (programmed cell death of&#xD;
           red blood cells) .Polyamines are associated to anaemia in renal patients, through an&#xD;
           intra-erythrocytic effect ,reduces erythropoiesis, and inhibit the activity of&#xD;
           erythropoietin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alterations of bone-mineral metabolism: IS reduces bone formation by promoting oxidative&#xD;
           stress in osteoblasts and inducing resistance to PTH, which favours the development a&#xD;
           dynamic bone .There is a positive correlation between FGF-23 and IS serum levels,&#xD;
           suggesting an association between this molecule and metabolic bone disease in uraemic&#xD;
           patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin resistance: In CKD patients the catabolism of insulin is reduced and often, they&#xD;
           also have insulin resistance, which is associated with an increased risk of mortality;&#xD;
           it seems that insulin resistance is related to some of the uremic toxins .&#xD;
