  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      World's population over 60 years old is increasing rapidly. It is expected that in 2050&#xD;
      elderly population will be 22% of the total population, representing around 2 billion people.&#xD;
      This situation means a rising in the incidence of elderly-related diseases, and thereby the&#xD;
      need for long-term care. Reduction in body fat and weight are a common problem among the&#xD;
      institutionalized elderly. Some factors that contribute to the anorexia of aging are&#xD;
      decreased perception of hunger and increased satiation. This represents an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing cachexia even during minor illnesses. The potentially severe consequences of&#xD;
      anorexia of aging a greater understanding of the underlying mechanism of these changes is&#xD;
      highly important. Intraesophageal and intragastric infusion of 20mg/kg lidocaine results in&#xD;
      an increase in food intake in Wistar rats. All infusions were done 30 minutes before the&#xD;
      start of the meal intake (meal consisted of mealworms). It may be possible to decrease&#xD;
      satiation, increase hunger, and hence food intake in elderly individuals through gastric&#xD;
      infusion of the anesthetics lidocaine or benzocaine. In the future this study could&#xD;
      potentially contribute to improve food intake in elderly vulnerable of losing body weight.&#xD;
      Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the effect of intragastric administration of&#xD;
      lidocaine on food intake, satiety/satiation and gastrointestinal complaints.&#xD;

      Aim: To determine the effect of intragastric infusion of lidocaine on satiation,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal complaints and food intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that intragastric administration of lidocaine will result in a&#xD;
      delay of postprandial satiation and hereby will result in an increase in food intake.&#xD;
      Furthermore, lidocaine infusion will not result in an increase in any gastrointestinal&#xD;
      complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To investigate the effect of intragastric infusion of lidocaine on ad&#xD;
      libitum food intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the effect of intragastric infusion of lidocaine on satiety/satiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the effect of intragastric infusion of lidocaine on gastrointestinal&#xD;
           complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Double blind randomized placebo-controlled cross-over trial in healthy male&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 35 healthy human male volunteers, 18 - 50 years old. Main study&#xD;
      parameters/endpoints: Difference in ad libitum meal intake (as measured during ad libitum&#xD;
      chili con carne meal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) scores for satiety feelings (e.g., satiety,&#xD;
      fullness, hunger, prospective feeding, desire to eat, desire to snack) and gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms (burning, bloating, belching, cramps, colics, warm sensation, sensation of abdominal&#xD;
      fullness, nausea and pain) will be measured using VAS (0 to 100 mm) anchored at the low end&#xD;
      with the most negative or lowest intensity feelings (e.g., extremely unpleasant, not at all),&#xD;
      and with opposing terms at the high end (e.g., extremely pleasant, very high, extreme).&#xD;
      Volunteers will be asked to indicate on a line which place on the scale best reflects their&#xD;
      feeling at that moment. The scoring forms will be collected immediately so that they cannot&#xD;
      be used as a reference for later scorings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter placement: the subjects will perceive mild discomfort during the placement of the&#xD;
      catheter. Subjects can, at any time, come in contact with the investigator if any problems&#xD;
      occur. All participants are healthy volunteers and we don't expect any health benefits or&#xD;
      disadvantages.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Based on medical history and previous examination, no gastrointestinal complaints can&#xD;
             be defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age between 18 and 50 years. Several studies (see introduction) showed a difference in&#xD;
             response to a meal between young and elderly people. Inclusion of elderly could&#xD;
             interfere with the outcome of this study. Goal of this study is to investigate whether&#xD;
             a difference in food intake can be found after intragastric infusion of a local&#xD;
             anaesthetic. For this proof of concept study we therefore choose to include healthy&#xD;
             male volunteers with a maximum age of 50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI between 20 and 25 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight stable over at least the last 6 months (≤5% weight change)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females, because of their hormonal cycle and the possible influence of these hormones&#xD;
             on eating behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe cardiovascular, respiratory, urogenital, gastrointestinal/hepatic,&#xD;
             haematological/immunologic, HEENT (head, ears, eyes, nose, throat),&#xD;
             dermatological/connective tissue, musculoskeletal, metabolic/nutritional, endocrine,&#xD;
             neurological/psychiatric diseases, allergy, major surgery and/or laboratory&#xD;
             assessments which might limit participation in or completion of the study protocol.&#xD;
             The severity of the disease (major interference with the execution of the experiment&#xD;
             or potential influence on the study outcomes) will be decided by the principal&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of amiodaron, because of the cardiotoxicity (in combination with lidocaine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of beta blockers, cimetidine and norepinephrine (synergetic effect on the action&#xD;
             of Lidocaine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other use of medication, which could interfere with the outcome of the study. This&#xD;
             will be decided by the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of investigational drugs or participation in any scientific&#xD;
             intervention study which may interfere with this study (to be decided by the principle&#xD;
             investigator), in the 90 days prior to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major abdominal surgery interfering with gastrointestinal function (uncomplicated&#xD;
             appendectomy, cholecystectomy and hysterectomy allowed, and other surgery upon&#xD;
             judgement of the principle investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dieting (medically prescribed, vegetarian, diabetic, macrobiological, biological&#xD;
             dynamic)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Excessive alcohol consumption (&gt;20 alcoholic consumptions per week)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-admitted HIV-positive state&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any food allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not able to eat a chili con carne meal.&#xD;
