  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have balance problems and are at&#xD;
      risk of falling. New guidelines recommend balance assessment be included in pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation (PR) however no specific tests are recommended. Our goal is to determine the&#xD;
      best balance test for identifying COPD patients who are at risk of falling. In this study,&#xD;
      COPD patients who report balance problems or falling in the last year will participate in a&#xD;
      testing session. Balance, balance confidence, lower body strength, exercise tolerance and&#xD;
      perceived physical limitations will be assessed. The number of falls over the following year&#xD;
      will be recorded using monthly calendars.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a leading cause of death, disability and hospitalization in Canada. In addition to&#xD;
      the primary lung impairment, secondary effects of the disease are well established including&#xD;
      impairments in muscle function, mobility and exercise capacity. Individuals with COPD also&#xD;
      have marked deficits in balance and an increased risk of falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The updated American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society Statement on PR&#xD;
      recommended expanding the scope of outcome assessment in COPD to include balance however no&#xD;
      specific tests are suggested. An examination of brief balance measures feasible for fall risk&#xD;
      screening has not been conducted. Such information will inform clinicians as to those most&#xD;
      likely to benefit from targeted intervention. This study aims to determine the optimal&#xD;
      balance measure for identifying patients with COPD who are high risk for falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of the study are to: 1) Investigate the construct validity&#xD;
      (convergent and known-groups) and reliability (inter-rater and test-retest) of three short&#xD;
      balance screening measures in people with COPD; 2) Investigate the predictive validity of the&#xD;
      balance screening tests for falls; and 3) Identify cut-off scores for identifying fallers&#xD;
      with COPD on the balance screening tool with the strongest psychometric properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and twenty individuals with COPD will be recruited from two sites. Upon&#xD;
      enrolment, participants will undergo a physical assessment session measuring balance,&#xD;
      functional lower body strength and exercise tolerance. Participants will also complete&#xD;
      questionnaires of balance confidence, perceived physical function limitations, fall risk,&#xD;
      dyspnea, global cognitive impairment and executive function. Participants will then be&#xD;
      followed for 12 months to measure incidence of falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess inter-rater reliability of the primary measures, two raters will simultaneously&#xD;
      administer the balance tests with a subset of the first 32 subjects to agree to participate&#xD;
      in this study. This subset will also be asked to return for repeat testing two-three days&#xD;
      after the baseline assessment to assess test-retest reliability.&#xD;
