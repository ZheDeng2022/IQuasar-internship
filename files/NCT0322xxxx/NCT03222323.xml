  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to investigate if dexmedetomidine prolongs the duration of an ulnar&#xD;
      nerve block. By using healthy volunteers the investigators can perform bilateral ulnar nerve&#xD;
      blocks and thereby control for a systemic effect to clarify if the effect is actually&#xD;
      peripheral or systemic. The investigators hypothesis is that dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to&#xD;
      a local anaesthetic prolongs the duration of a peripheral nerve block by a peripheral&#xD;
      mechanism.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficient pain management promoting mobilization and convalescence is essential in an ideal&#xD;
      perioperative course. Regional nerve blocks are a central element in postoperative regimes&#xD;
      for many patients and it is therefore important that these nerve blocks are both long lasting&#xD;
      and efficient. This trial will investigate whether it is possible to optimize the&#xD;
      postoperative pain management when adding dexmedetomidine to the local anaesthetic&#xD;
      ropivacaine in peripheral nerve blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prolonging effect of using dexmedetomidine as adjunct in peripheral nerve blocks have&#xD;
      been investigated in several studies. However, it remains uncertain whether the effect is&#xD;
      mediated by a systemic-, a peripheral- or a combined systemic/peripheral mechanism. In this&#xD;
      trial the adjuvating effect of dexmedetomidine will be investigated using an ulnar nerve&#xD;
      block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will attend two trial days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On one trial day the volunteers will receive bilateral ulnar nerve blocks. In one arm they&#xD;
      will receive the local anaesthetic ropivacaine 4ml 5mg/ml and placebo (saline) and in the&#xD;
      other arm ropivacaine 4ml 5mg/ml and dexmedetomidine 100Î¼g. The dexmedetomidine administered&#xD;
      perineurally is absorbed and redistributed and will influence the two nerve blocks equally&#xD;
      systemically. On the other trial day the participants will receive ropivacaine 4ml 5mg/ml and&#xD;
      placebo (saline) and in the other arm ropivacaine 4ml 7.5mg/ml and placebo (saline). The&#xD;
      allocation is blinded to volunteer and investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this setup we therefore have a perineural- and a systemic dexmedetomidine group and also a&#xD;
      placebo group , and a group testing if higher doses of local anesthetics will prolong the&#xD;
      duration of a nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the nerve block will be measured by 3 different tests: pinprick, temperature&#xD;
      test (alcohol) and Pain during tonic heat stimulation. All tests are validated within pain&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
