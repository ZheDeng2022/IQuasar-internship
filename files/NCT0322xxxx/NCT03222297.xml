    <textblock>
      To evaluate the feasibility of CT perfusion technique to monitor the changes of blood&#xD;
      perfusion in the brain tissue before and after skull repair using titanium mesh. To determine&#xD;
      the best timing for skull repair using the three-dimensional titanium mesh; to compare the&#xD;
      effects of early (1-3 months after decompression) and late-stage (6-12 months after&#xD;
      decompression) skull repair on neurologic rehabilitation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A skull defect is inevitable in patients with traumatic brain injury undergoing decompression&#xD;
      treatment, which results in a loss of physiological and functional integrity of the brain&#xD;
      that makes atmospheric pressure directly act on the brain tissue to induce environmental&#xD;
      disorders in the brain. Moreover, with the changes in the body position, the contents of the&#xD;
      brain often move in an unstable position, and with the extension of time, there may be&#xD;
      compensatory ventricular enlargement and brain atrophy, eventually causing neurological&#xD;
      dysfunction and cognitive disorders. Therefore, it is imperative to repair the skull defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many repair materials for skull defects, including autogenous bone, allogeneic&#xD;
      bone, nonmetallic materials (plexiglass, bone cement, silicone rubber, etc.) and titanium&#xD;
      mesh. The performance of different materials have their own advantages and disadvantages, and&#xD;
      titanium alloy is an ideal repair material and has been widely used in clinical practice&#xD;
      because of good biocompatibility and strength, no aging, low density, non-iron atoms, ability&#xD;
      to be not magnetized in magnetic fields, and no influence on CT, MRI, EEG and X-ray&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timing for repair of skull defect after traumatic brain injury is still controversial.&#xD;
      Some scholars believe that if there is no hydrocephalus and intracranial infection after&#xD;
      decompression with removal of bone flap, skull repair should be proceeded as soon as possible&#xD;
      to isolate the scalp from the dura mater and recover the normal intracranial pressure by&#xD;
      easing the negative effects of the scalp, such as cerebrovascular traction, compression and&#xD;
      distortions. Most importantly, early skull repair is able to reduce a variety of secondary&#xD;
      neurological deficits due to skull defects, increase brain surface blood flow, and thus&#xD;
      reduce epileptic attack. Of course, some scholars recommend late-stage skull repair, and they&#xD;
      believe hematoma absorption after decompressive surgery is a long process, and in some&#xD;
      patients, hematoma will be completely absorbed in about 3 months or even longer, which may&#xD;
      result in secondary brain edema. Moreover, surgical trauma exerts negative effect on the&#xD;
      brain tissue recovery, which is not conducive to neurologic rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there is no unified conclusion on the timing for the repair of skull defects,&#xD;
      investigators conducted a multi-sample, double-blind, randomized, clinical trial, to collect&#xD;
      craniocerebral injury patients undergoing decompression with removal of bone graft who were&#xD;
      randomized into two groups to receive early skull repair in test group and late-stage skull&#xD;
      repair in control group. CT perfusion technology was used to monitor the blood perfusion in&#xD;
      the brain before and after skull repair and to compare the changes of blood perfusion in the&#xD;
      brain tissue and neurological recovery in patients undergoing early or late-stage skull&#xD;
      repair.&#xD;

    <description>To monitor the changes of blood perfusion in the brain tissue based on CT perfusion technology after skull repair with titanium mesh. 50 mL of iopromide was injected at a rate of 5 mL/s into the median cubital vein of the patients, and 3 seconds later, 256-slice spiral CT (Philips) was used for continuous scan for 50 seconds, followed by image processing using a Philips-specific workstation.</description>
