    <textblock>
      Understanding the impact of dietary patterns, exercise, and behavior change in the prevention&#xD;
      of disease is paramount to improving the health and well-being of future generations and&#xD;
      economies. A gap in the research is the lack of data on factors that predict successful&#xD;
      behavior change for sustained dietary practices chosen for health or other personal reasons.&#xD;
      To date, no survey exists that was designed to target persons following a wide range of&#xD;
      popular dietary patterns (e.g., Paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, vegan, Mediterranean,&#xD;
      gluten-free, etc.). These dietary patterns, which offer great variation in macronutrient&#xD;
      composition, are unique and unexplored in other similar surveys to date, making their&#xD;
      examination innovative. Adhering to Dietary Approaches for Personal Taste (ADAPT) will be the&#xD;
      first large cohort of its type that is focused on adherence to popular dietary patterns,&#xD;
      providing the opportunity to better understand how individuals can be supported to&#xD;
      successfully maintain a specific dietary practice, and, in the long-term, how these practices&#xD;
      may influence parameters of healthy aging.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Public interest in nutrition is at the forefront of wellness and food culture, and the number&#xD;
      of followers of various popular diets has grown in the last decade. These popular diets span&#xD;
      the spectrum from vegan/vegetarian to low-carb/Paleo. Compared to typical American dietary&#xD;
      patterns, which are high in added sugar and fat, these emerging diet patterns may offer&#xD;
      improved dietary quality due to a reduction in added sugars and refined carbohydrates.&#xD;
      Observational cohort studies have associated improved diet quality and health benefits with&#xD;
      various types of plant-based diets, and randomized controlled trials have shown these diets&#xD;
      to be beneficial for reducing body weight and cardiometabolic risk. Randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials have also demonstrated improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors among individuals&#xD;
      following low-carb and Paleo diets. In spite of these documented health benefits, there is&#xD;
      limited intervention and longitudinal data on followers of popular diets. Evidence on&#xD;
      successful adherence to such diets is further limited and may be of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Adhering to Dietary Approaches for Personal Taste (ADAPT) Recruitment Feasibility Survey&#xD;
      (FS), conducted in the summer of 2015, demonstrated interest on the part of popular diet&#xD;
      followers in participating in nutrition research. This planning survey identified over 7,000&#xD;
      individuals expressing interest in being contacted for a future study on dietary patterns,&#xD;
      and the ADAPT study exam 1 aims to recruit from this pool of participants. To date, research&#xD;
      has identified psychobiological, cultural, social, and environmental factors that enable&#xD;
      individuals to adhere to weight loss and other diets over the long-term (2+ years). These&#xD;
      adherence factors include habit formation, social support, a supportive environment,&#xD;
      self-efficacy including knowledge of nutrition, and motivation. However, no observational&#xD;
      study has recruited individuals following a variety of self-identified diets to examine (1)&#xD;
      the actual nutrient composition of popular dietary patterns compared to targeted intakes, (2)&#xD;
      the association of predictors of adherence identified in weight-loss research to these&#xD;
      specific dietary patterns chosen for personal preference, and (3) which of these factors are&#xD;
      most prevalent among self-identified long-term followers and how this may differ across diet&#xD;
      groups. The question of how individuals can successfully adhere to a variety of healthier&#xD;
      dietary patterns is of highest public health importance because of the growing burden of&#xD;
      disease risk in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are as follows: 1) Compare the mean nutrient composition,&#xD;
      diet quality, and degree of adherence among US-based, long-term followers (&gt;2 years) of&#xD;
      popular diets to determine how closely individuals met the prescribed targeted nutrient&#xD;
      profiles; 2) Compare the self-reported body weight and BMI across diet patterns; 3) Assess&#xD;
      the prevalence of predictors of dietary adherence (psychobiological, cultural, social,&#xD;
      economic, and environmental) across diet patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exam 1 (baseline) recruitment will target a variety of populations who choose to eat less&#xD;
      common or lesser-studied diets, with a trend towards avoiding processed foods and added&#xD;
      sugars, such as: raw vegan, vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, whole food, Dietary Approaches to&#xD;
      Stop Hypertension (DASH), gluten-free, dairy-free, Mediterranean, Paleo, Weston Price, or&#xD;
      diets specifically for weight loss. Participants will be recruited from a pool of subjects&#xD;
      who expressed interest in future study involvement as a part of the ADAPT FS. In addition,&#xD;
      the investigators will continue to recruit additional participants electronically, through a&#xD;
      variety of online resources that may include affinity-based email lists, social media&#xD;
      (Facebook, Twitter), referrals from family and/or friends in the FS, and personal&#xD;
      communications from study investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exam 1 participants who provide permission to be contacted for future research in the Exam 1&#xD;
      consent will be contacted within 1-5 years after exam 1 participation, with an invite to&#xD;
      participate in the first follow-up study (Exam 2). Eligible Exam 2 participants (defined as&#xD;
      those following one of 5 dietary patterns of interest) will be additionally contacted to&#xD;
      participate in a sub-study assessing different methods of collecting dietary intake data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey Questionnaires Exam 1: The investigators will administer a demographics and lifestyle&#xD;
      questionnaire, supplement use questionnaire, and a variety of previously validated&#xD;
      questionnaires hosted online in Qualtrics. Questionnaires on demographics, supplement use,&#xD;
      diet choice, diet history, socioeconomic status, food access/availability, cost, and&#xD;
      convenience have been created in Qualtrics. The following previously validated questionnaires&#xD;
      were also created in Qualtrics: the Nutrition Self-Efficacy Scale, Three-Factor Eating&#xD;
      Questionnaire, Power of Food Scale, Yale Food Addiction Scale, Social Support and Eating&#xD;
      Habits Survey, Self-Report Habit Index,International Physical Activity Questionnaire Long&#xD;
      Form, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Index. The investigators will assess dietary intakes using the&#xD;
      following: (1) the Diet History Questionnaire II (DHQ II), a web-based food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and (2) the web-based Automated&#xD;
      Self-Administered 24-Hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24), also from NCI. The ASA24 will be&#xD;
      administered, unannounced, to a subset of participants to try to minimize instances of&#xD;
      participants altering their diet, either intentionally or unintentionally, as a result of&#xD;
      knowing about an upcoming 24-hour recall questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will take approximately 3-4 hours in total to complete but will be&#xD;
      staggered over the course of 6-12 weeks to reduce respondent burden. A total of 17&#xD;
      questionnaires will be administered, staggered in batches of 1-3 questionnaires at a time,&#xD;
      resulting in participants being contacted a minimum of 10 times over the course of&#xD;
      approximately 6-12 weeks. Participants who miss or do not complete questionnaires may be&#xD;
      contacted more frequently with reminder emails.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exam 2: The investigators will administer the following surveys-- Follow-up demographics &amp;&#xD;
      lifestyle (25 min), Brief medical history (15 min), SF36 health questionnaire (15 min), WHO&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaire (15 min). Participants will receive a weekly email for 4 weeks&#xD;
      with each week's questionnaire, and they will be contacted for an additional 4 weeks, if&#xD;
      needed, with a request to make-up incomplete questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Intake Study: Eligible exam 2 participants will be invited to complete the following&#xD;
      questionnaires as part of a sub-study-- NCI Diet History Questionnaire (30-40 minutes to&#xD;
      complete), 3-day food record (3 days, approximately 1hr/day), NCI ASA 24-hr dietary recall&#xD;
      (30-45 min). Participants will receive one questionnaire per week for 3 weeks and will then&#xD;
      be contacted to make-up missing questionnaires (if applicable) for an additional 6 weeks. The&#xD;
      sub-study aims to enroll 250 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide electronic consent prior to beginning each survey (Exam 1, Exam 2,&#xD;
      and the Dietary Intake Sub-study) by reading a disclosure and answering questions aimed at&#xD;
      capturing all elements required by the Tufts University Health Sciences Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board (IRB) for consent.&#xD;
