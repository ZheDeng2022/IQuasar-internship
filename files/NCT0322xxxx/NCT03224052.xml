  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend empirical antibacterial therapy as&#xD;
      the standard of care in all African children with severe falciparum malaria, there are fewer&#xD;
      data to guide the management of adults with the disease in low transmission settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently WHO guidelines do not recommend empirical antibacterial therapy in adults with&#xD;
      malaria in low transmission settings, instead antibacterial therapy is only clearly&#xD;
      recommended in those patients in whom a serious bacterial co-infection is clinically&#xD;
      suspected. However, in a pilot study in Myanmar (High Frequency of Clinically Significant&#xD;
      Bacteremia in Adults Hospitalized With Falciparum Malaria PMID: 26989752) we found that 13%&#xD;
      of adults hospitalized with falciparum malaria were bacteremic, with bacterial co-infection&#xD;
      suspected by clinicians in the minority. Patients with serious bacterial infection are&#xD;
      commonly not bacteraemic and so this probably underestimates the frequency of significant&#xD;
      bacterial co-infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In that pilot study, over 75% of patients received empirical antibacterial therapy on&#xD;
      admission to hospital, which would not accord with published WHO guidelines as clinicians&#xD;
      suspected bacterial co-infection in only 17%. However, the study's 100% survival rate - when&#xD;
      over half of the patients were at high risk of death - suggests that the administration of&#xD;
      antibacterial therapy may be appropriate until bacterial co-infection is excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also academic debate about the role of co-morbidities in the presentation of&#xD;
      patients severely ill with vivax malaria. Bacterial co-infection has been reported in some -&#xD;
      but by no means all - studies of severe vivax infection. It would be useful to determine the&#xD;
      relative contribution of bacterial co-infection to the clinical presentation of patients with&#xD;
      vivax malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By systematically seeking evidence of bacterial co-infection in all patients hospitalized at&#xD;
      the study sites, this study aims to determine if the bacterial infection is really as&#xD;
      prevalent as was the case in the pilot study. Accordingly it aims to determine the utility of&#xD;
      a strategy that includes empirical antibacterial therapy in adults hospitalized with malaria&#xD;
      in low transmission settings, until significant bactrila infection has been excluded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study's participants will be adults hospitalized with malaria at four tertiary referral&#xD;
      hospitals in Myanmar. The study will be a collaboration between clinicians at Insein General&#xD;
      Hospital North Okkalapa General Hospital and Thingangyun General Hospital in Yangon and&#xD;
      Naypyidaw General Hospital in Naypyidaw, Myanmar and the Department of Global Health at&#xD;
      Menzies School of Health Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's participants will be cared for by local doctors and nurses according to current&#xD;
      WHO guidelines for the management of severe malaria. Management will include a systematic&#xD;
      screen for bacterial infection with a detailed history, examination, radiological and&#xD;
      laboratory studies, including the collection of blood cultures in all patients (this is&#xD;
      recommended in WHO guidelines, but rarely performed in the resource poor setting). The only&#xD;
      difference to the current WHO guidelines for the management of severe malaria will be the&#xD;
      administration of empirical antibacterial therapy to all participants with falciparum malaria&#xD;
      on admission. Participants with vivax malaria - who have a much lower incidence of&#xD;
      complicated disease - would be managed according to the existing WHO guidelines, which&#xD;
      suggest that antibacterial therapy should only be commenced in the presence of convincing&#xD;
      evidence of severe bacterial co-infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent is obtained, artesunate is administered and a detailed work up for&#xD;
      bacterial co-infection is performed, all participants with falciparum malaria will receive&#xD;
      empiric levofloxacin. This will continue until 48 hours when, if the patient is improving and&#xD;
      the work up for infection is negative, antibiotics will be ceased. Conversely if cultures are&#xD;
      positive, targeted antibacterial therapy will be commenced as soon as sensitivity data are&#xD;
      available. In the setting of convincing clinical evidence of bacterial infection when&#xD;
      cultures are negative (a patient with a chest x-ray consistent with pneumonia but in whom&#xD;
      cultures are negative for example), appropriate antibacterial will be continued. Participants&#xD;
      who deteriorate in the first 48 hours will have their antibacterial therapy escalated to&#xD;
      vancomycin and meropenem (based on microbiological findings in our pilot study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants hospitalized with vivax malaria will also receive parenteral antimalarial&#xD;
      therapy and have a detailed work up for infection, but empirical antibacterial therapy will&#xD;
      not be commenced. Study clinicians may start antibacterial therapy in the setting of positive&#xD;
      cultures or unequivocal evidence of bacterial infection if cultures are negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subsequent clinical course of the participants and the frequency of confirmed bacterial&#xD;
      co-infection would be compared to historical controls at the study sites to determine the&#xD;
      utility of empirical antibacterial therapy in adults hospitalized with malaria in Myanmar.&#xD;
      These data would be generalizable to other low transmission settings potentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan is to continue the study for 3 years; we expect that this will allow sufficient time&#xD;
      to enrol enough patients to answer the study questions. The data will be analysed annually by&#xD;
      independent safety monitors (from the University of Medicine 2, Myanmar and The Kirby&#xD;
      Institute, Australia) and the study terminated if clear benefit or harm is identified.&#xD;
      Independent safety monitors will also follow the study locally, review all deaths and be&#xD;
      available to address any concerns of the participants and their families.&#xD;
