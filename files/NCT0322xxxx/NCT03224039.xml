  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-center, randomized, controlled trial conducted in the Brooklyn&#xD;
      Hospital Center's Emergency Department (ED) expected to last 2 years. The sample size will be&#xD;
      40 patients with 20 patients in each treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data points to be collected in the study are as follows: baseline characteristics&#xD;
      (baseline pain score, date of birth, age, gender, weight and ethnicity), NRS pain scores at&#xD;
      5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes, dose of study treatment administered, incidence of adverse&#xD;
      effects, time to patient discharge following administration of study treatment, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction of pain control based on a 10-point Likert Scale, number of patients who&#xD;
      required rescue analgesia, and amount of rescue analgesia required. 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once informed consent is obtained, patients will be randomized to receive Treatment A&#xD;
      (sufentanil 0.7 mcg/kg intranasally (IN) and normal saline 1ml IV push) OR Treatment B&#xD;
      (Normal saline 0.6 mL IN and morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV push). It should be noted that during the&#xD;
      study period, use of additional morphine or adjuvant analgesics outside of the designated&#xD;
      time intervals is allowed. The decision to use adjuvant analgesics is the decision of the&#xD;
      attending physician assigned to the patient in the Emergency Department (ED).&#xD;

      This study will be a single-center, randomized, controlled trial conducted in the Brooklyn&#xD;
      Hospital Center's Emergency Department (ED)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be randomized to receive one of the two study treatments below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment A:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Sufentanil 0.7 mcg/kg IN x 1dose (max of 1 mL administered per nostril)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Normal saline 1ml IV push x 1dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment B:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Normal saline 0.3 mL IN x 1 dose&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV push x 1dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rescue protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of assignment to Treatment A or Treatment B, if severity of pain is â‰¥ 5 on the&#xD;
      NRS, IV morphine dosed at 0.1 mg/kg IV push (max dose: 10 mg) may be administered at the&#xD;
      discretion of the attending physician or medical resident assigned to the patient at&#xD;
      designated intervals (5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes after administration of study treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of patients with chief complaints or visit reasons of &quot;acute pain&quot;,&#xD;
           &quot;musculoskeletal pain&quot;, &quot;back pain&quot;, &quot;abdominal pain&quot;, &quot;fracture&quot;, &quot;headache&quot;,&#xD;
           &quot;lacerations&quot;, and &quot;sprains&quot; via the Emergency Department's Status board by Research&#xD;
           Associate (RA) or study investigators&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Screening of potentially eligible patients with inclusion/exclusion criteria checklist&#xD;
           via chart review by RA or study investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If patient is eligible, the RA or study investigators will approach the medical resident&#xD;
           or attending physician to confirm if the patient's visit reason is acute pain. If a&#xD;
           medical decision is made by the attending or resident to treat the patient for acute&#xD;
           pain, the RA (along with the medical resident, with approval from the attending&#xD;
           physician) or study investigators will approach the patient to obtain informed consent&#xD;
           and explain potential risks and benefits associated with receiving study interventions.&#xD;
           Only study investigators will sign informed consent forms as per IRB protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Once informed consent is obtained, patients will be randomized to receive Treatment A&#xD;
           (sufentanil 0.7 mcg/kg intranasally (IN) and normal saline 1ml IV push) OR Treatment B&#xD;
           (Normal saline 0.6 mL IN and morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV push). It should be noted that during&#xD;
           the study period, use of additional morphine or adjuvant analgesics outside of the&#xD;
           designated time intervals is allowed. The decision to use adjuvant analgesics is the&#xD;
           decision of the attending physician assigned to the patient in the Emergency Department&#xD;
           (ED).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Order will be placed in the electronic medical record (EMR) by the medical resident,&#xD;
           attending physician, or pharmacist under the permission of the attending physician for a&#xD;
           study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Upon receiving the medication order in the EMR, the order will be verified by the&#xD;
           pharmacy. The pharmacy will then prepare either a sufentanil IN syringe and placebo&#xD;
           injection or morphine injection and placebo IN syringe based on the study number&#xD;
           assigned to the patient. The study investigators or RA assigned to the study will obtain&#xD;
           the medication preparations from the pharmacy. Medication preparations will only be&#xD;
           labeled with patient number and study number. No other identifying markers will be&#xD;
           placed on the labels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The nurse assigned to the patient or physician from the research team will administer&#xD;
           the intervention medications. During administration of the intervention, the patient&#xD;
           will be connected to a cardiac monitor for monitoring of possible cardiovascular adverse&#xD;
           events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. An RA or study investigator will approach the patient to assess and record primary&#xD;
           outcomes and secondary outcomes at designated time intervals. The data will be recorded&#xD;
           on paper data collection sheets (see attached forms). The primary study investigator&#xD;
           will not take part in data collection or analyses. If additional analgesic medications&#xD;
           are requested by the patient, the orders will be placed by the medical resident or&#xD;
           attending physician assigned to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. All data collected on the paper data collection sheets will be transcribed into an&#xD;
           encrypted and password protected electronic database by the RA. All patient identifiers&#xD;
           will be de-identified in the database and all participants will be assigned a study&#xD;
           participant number. This database will be stored on ED computers only and only RA's and&#xD;
           study investigators will have access to it. The paper data collection sheets will be&#xD;
           stored in a stationary, locked cabinet in the ED for safe keeping. At the end of the&#xD;
           study, these records will be maintained according to the hospital's record-retention&#xD;
           policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. At the conclusion of study enrollment, an independent biostatistician will analyze the&#xD;
           data. Only data from patients with diagnoses relating to acute pain and completed the&#xD;
           study protocol without use of rescue analgesia during the designated time will be&#xD;
           included in the study. Once the initial data analysis is complete, the log which details&#xD;
           whether study participants received sufentanil IN or morphine IV will be revealed to the&#xD;
           biostatistician for final data analysis and compilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. At the conclusion of the study, final results and conclusions will be presented to the&#xD;
           IRB. All data recorded on the paper data collection sheets will be destroyed and all&#xD;
           data on the electronic databases will be deleted.&#xD;
