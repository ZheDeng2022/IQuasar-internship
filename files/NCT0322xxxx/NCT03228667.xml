  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIb, multicohort, open-label multicenter study of combination immunotherapies&#xD;
      in patients who have previously received treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors. All patients in Cohorts 1-4 will receive the combination treatment of PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor plus N-803 for up to 17 cycles. Each cycle is six weeks in duration.&#xD;
      Some patients who experience disease progression while on study in Cohorts 1-4 may roll over&#xD;
      into Cohort 5 and receive combination therapy with a PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor, N-803,&#xD;
      and PD-L1 t-haNK cellular therapy for up to an additional 17 cycles. Each cycle is six weeks&#xD;
      in duration. All patients will receive N-803 once every 3 weeks. Patients will also receive&#xD;
      the same checkpoint inhibitor that they received during their previous therapy. Radiologic&#xD;
      evaluation will occur at the end of each treatment cycle. Treatment will continue for up to 2&#xD;
      years, or until the patient experiences confirmed progressive disease or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, withdraws consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the patient's&#xD;
      best interest to continue treatment. Patients will be followed for disease progression,&#xD;
      post-therapies, and survival through 24 months past administration of the first dose of study&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
