    <textblock>
      Cesarean section is one of the oldest surgical interventions in the history of medicine.Many&#xD;
      variations in cesarean section technique have been studied.The investigatory team are aiming&#xD;
      to decrease blood loss during cesarean section by vertical splitting versus transverse&#xD;
      cutting of muscle layer in lower segment cesarean sections to avoid uterine vessels injury.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cesarean section is one of the oldest surgical interventions in the history of medicine.Since&#xD;
      the first documented cesarean delivery in 1020 AD, various modifications have been made in&#xD;
      the technique. It was a surgery performed as a last resort, mostly peri- or post-portem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many variations in cesarean section technique have been studied.our study aim is to decrease&#xD;
      blood loss during cesarean section through decreasing incidence of uterine vessels injury.&#xD;
      The investigator supposed that applying Vertical pull on a small C-shaped incision in the&#xD;
      lower uterine segment during cesarean section allows the tissues to split along their natural&#xD;
      arrangement, decreasing the probability of extension of the wound into the uterine vessels,&#xD;
      thus; decreasing blood loss; operative time and maternal recovery.&#xD;

    <description>vertical splitting of lower uterine segment during lower cesarean section making the direction of traction up and downward instead of being laterally and we suppose that this will allow the tissues to split along their natural arrangement, decreasing the probability of extension of the wound into the uterine vessels, thus; decreasing blood loss; operative time and maternal recovery.</description>
