    <textblock>
      Since the development of custom-made fenestrated and branched endografts a novel therapeutic&#xD;
      option for the management of thoracoabdominal and para-renal aortic aneurysms was made&#xD;
      accessible. Because of the design of these branched endografts, an arterial vascular access&#xD;
      from the upper limb is required to allow selective catheterization of the branch component&#xD;
      and the respective target vessel (celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, renal artery).2&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary end-point is to evaluate the requirement of upper extremity arterial access (UEA)&#xD;
      retrospectively in the cohort of patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms treated by&#xD;
      means fenestrated and/or branched endografts in Vascular surgery San Raffaele Hospital&#xD;
      between 2013 and 2017, and prospectively in the next 50 patients that will be treated between&#xD;
      2017 and 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-point is an anatomical evaluation of the different sites available for&#xD;
      UEA(upper extremity arterial access ) based on pre-operative imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators review a prospectively compiled Microsoft Office Excel database with the&#xD;
      procedural details of the 34 patients treated at Vascular surgery of San Raffaele Hospital&#xD;
      between October 2013 and March 2017 by means of total endovascular thoracoabdominal aortic&#xD;
      aneurysm repair and of those of the next 50 patients who will be treated until December 2020.&#xD;
      All patients in which an UAE (upper extremity arterial access ) is employed will be&#xD;
      identified together with the side (left/right) and site (proximal/distal axillary artery,&#xD;
      brachial artery) of vascular access. Furthermore, the pre-operative contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      computed tomography scans (CTA) of all patients, stored in the hospital PACS, will be&#xD;
      analyzed on the dedicated workstation with OsiriX software (Pixmeo sarl, Bernex, Switzerland)&#xD;
      currently employed at Vascular surgery of San Raffaele Hospital for imaging assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Requirement of an UEA(upper extremity arterial access ) during the procedure is extrapolated&#xD;
      from the corresponding field of the available database and reported together with side and&#xD;
      site of access and reason for the employment of UEA (upper extremity arterial access ) and&#xD;
      for its location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-planar, curved and 3D reconstructions of each patient CTA will be analyzed and the&#xD;
      following measurements recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patency of both potential upper extremity access vessels (right/left subclavian artery);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. diameter of the proximal axillary artery on both sides;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. diameter of the distal axillary artery on both sides;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. presence of calcifications on the proximal axillary artery on both sides;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. presence of calcifications on the distal axillary artery on both sides;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. arterial tortuosity index on both sides: measured as the ratio between the axillary&#xD;
           artery length measured on curved reconstruction and its length measured on 3D&#xD;
           reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the assessed variables will be prospectively recorded in a Microsoft Office Excel&#xD;
      database together with patients' weight, height, age and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients involved in the retrospective part of the study have already signed informed&#xD;
      consent for data collection and analysis at hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 50 patients that will be enrolled until December 2020 will also sign an &quot;ad hoc&quot;&#xD;
      consents, specific for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitive patient information will not be available during data analysis. The clinical study&#xD;
      will be carried out according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and&#xD;
      following the active regulations on observational studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients characteristics and anatomical data on UEAs(upper extremity arterial access) will be&#xD;
      analyzed on Wizard Statistics software to investigate the presence of statistically&#xD;
      significant Pearson correlations among the identified variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extracted data and their relevant clinical and procedural implications will be submitted&#xD;
      for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals focused on the field of vascular and&#xD;
      endovascular surgery.&#xD;
