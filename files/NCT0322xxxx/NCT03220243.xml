      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of using an autologous mesenchymal&#xD;
      stromal cell (MSC) coated fistula plug in people with rectovaginal fistulizing Crohn's&#xD;
      disease. This is an autologous product derived from the patient and used only for the same&#xD;
      patient. Participants will be in this study for two years. There is potential to continue to&#xD;
      monitor participants' progress with regular visits as part of standard of care. All study&#xD;
      visits take place at Mayo Clinic and Rochester, MN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study visit schedule is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (Week -6) - Screening visit: exam under anesthesia and surgery to assess eligibility&#xD;
      of fistula tract, take fat biopsy, if eligible, and fecal diversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (Week 0; Day 0), exam under anesthesia for stem cell coated fistula plug placement&#xD;
      Visit 3 (Week 0; Day 1) Visit 4 (Week 2; Month 1) Visit 5 (Week 4; Month 1) Visit 6 (Week 8;&#xD;
      Month 2) Visit 7 (Week 12; Month 3) Visit 8 (Week 24; Month 6) Visit 9 (Week 52; Month 12).&#xD;
      Visit 10 (Week 104, Month 24)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Investigators propose to study the safety of autologous mesenchymal stromal cell transfer&#xD;
      using a biomatrix (the Gore Bio-A174; Fistula Plug) in a Phase I study using a single dose of&#xD;
      20 million cells. Fifteen adult patients with refractory, rectovaginal fistulizing Crohn's&#xD;
      disease will be enrolled. Participants will undergo standard adjuvant therapy including&#xD;
      drainage of infection and placement of a draining seton with continuation of pre-existing&#xD;
      anti-Crohn's therapy. If the participant is not currently diverted, then participants will&#xD;
      undergo a laparoscopic diversion with a loop ileostomy. Six weeks post placement of the&#xD;
      draining seton, the seton will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore Bio-A fistula plug as per&#xD;
      current clinical practice. The participants will be subsequently followed for fistula&#xD;
      response and closure for 24 months. This is an autologous product derived from the patient&#xD;
      and used only for the same patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened at outpatient clinic visits and interested qualified&#xD;
      participants will be offered participation in the trial and consented. At the first study&#xD;
      visit (Visit 1; Screening visit), the patient will be evaluated and assessed. Six weeks post&#xD;
      placement of the draining seton, the seton will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore Bio-A&#xD;
      fistula plug. Participants will return on: Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 24,&#xD;
      Week 52, and Week 104.&#xD;

Participants will have a health assessment and blood work measured at each study visit to monitor for adverse events, such as worsening of the perinal fistulizing disease, abnormal laboratory values, or significant abnormalities in physical examination.
