  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For decades, men who have sex with men (MSM) have carried the heaviest burden associated with&#xD;
      the HIV epidemic in the United States. Although MSM represent a minority (i.e., approximately&#xD;
      4%) of the male population in the United States, in 2010 MSM accounted for 78% of new HIV&#xD;
      infections among males. Furthermore, the estimated number of new HIV infections attributed to&#xD;
      male-to-male sexual contact is currently rising. In order to improve interventions to&#xD;
      decrease transmission of HIV among MSM, it is important to have a better understanding of&#xD;
      predictors of risky sexual behavior. Alcohol use is among the most reliable predictors of&#xD;
      risky sexual behavior. Unfortunately, studies of alcohol use and risky sex among MSM have&#xD;
      mainly relied on survey-based methods that cannot advance our understanding of the causal&#xD;
      mechanisms linking acute alcohol use to HIV risk behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will utilize an &quot;alcohol/placebo/nonalcohol&quot; design to examine the mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying the association between the acute effects of alcohol (i.e., pharmacological and&#xD;
      expectancy) and risky sexual decision making in MSM. Focal mechanisms include sex-specific&#xD;
      delay discounting (SSDD), and the core constructs of the Cognitive Mediation Model. The&#xD;
      alcohol/placebo/nonalcohol design involves three conditions. In the alcohol condition (target&#xD;
      BrAC = 0.080g%), the participant will be told he is receiving alcohol and will receive&#xD;
      beverages of 1:4 parts vodka and tonic water with dashes of lime juice and mint, all mixed in&#xD;
      his presence. In the placebo condition (target BrAC = 0.000g%), the participant will be told&#xD;
      he is receiving alcohol but will receive beverages of 1:4 parts flat tonic water (served from&#xD;
      a vodka bottle) and tonic water, with a minimal amount of vodka &quot;floated&quot; on the surface&#xD;
      (using a lime juice bottle) to provide the smell and taste of vodka, with lime juice and&#xD;
      mint, all mixed in his presence and served in glasses with vodka-soaked rims. In the true&#xD;
      control (or nonalcohol) condition, the participant will be told he is receiving no alcohol&#xD;
      and will be given water (poured in his presence) in a volume comparable to the other&#xD;
      conditions. This 3-group design will enable us to test the pharmacological effects of alcohol&#xD;
      while accounting for potential expectancy effects. Participants (Target N = 150-180) will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one condition; all will undergo the same protocol, which will be&#xD;
      completed within one experimental session. The study protocol consists of baseline&#xD;
      assessment, followed by beverage administration, followed by post-drinking assessment of SSDD&#xD;
      and sexual decision making, followed by debriefing.&#xD;

      Significance and Specific Aims of Project&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by the HIV&#xD;
      epidemic in the United States. However, the experimental research designed to advance our&#xD;
      knowledge of the causal link between alcohol use and risky sex has disproportionately focused&#xD;
      on heterosexual men and women. Experimental studies are needed to test established theories&#xD;
      and explore new mechanisms linking alcohol to HIV risk among MSM. This proposed project will&#xD;
      experimentally test if sex-specific delay discounting (SSDD) is a mechanism of action&#xD;
      underlying the association between alcohol and risky sexual behavior among MSM. More&#xD;
      specifically stated, the aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the pharmacological effect of alcohol on sex-specific delay discounting in MSM,&#xD;
           with the prediction that individuals who consume alcohol will display greater sexual&#xD;
           impulsivity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the expectancy effect of alcohol on sex-specific delay discounting in MSM, with&#xD;
           the prediction that those who receive placebo will evince greater sexual impulsivity&#xD;
           than true controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test whether sex-specific delay discounting mediates the effects of alcohol on risky&#xD;
           sexual decision making in MSM, using the CMM as a theoretical base for hypothesis&#xD;
           testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant population will consist of males age 21 to 35 years who are able to read and&#xD;
      communicate in English. Eligible participants are: 1) single (i.e., not in a mutually&#xD;
      monogamous relationship for at least 3 months); 2) sexually active as defined by any anal sex&#xD;
      (i.e., receptive or insertive) with another man in the past 12 months; and 3) have had&#xD;
      condomless anal sex with a male partner in their lifetime; 4) have had at least one sexual&#xD;
      encounter with a male partner met online in their lifetime; 5) characterized as a current&#xD;
      heavy drinker, as defined by self-report of one or more episodes of heavy drinking (i.e., ≥5&#xD;
      standard drinks in a single occasion) during the past 30 days; and 5) HIV negative, based on&#xD;
      self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-drinkers, light to moderate drinkers, and individuals with current alcohol problems (as&#xD;
      indexed by an AUDIT score ≥16) or drug problems (as indexed by a DAST score ≥6) will be&#xD;
      excluded. Given that this is a study of MSM, females will be excluded. Furthermore,&#xD;
      individuals who do not meet the relationship status and sexual activity criteria above will&#xD;
      be excluded. Lastly, individuals who participated in Phase 1 of this research program will be&#xD;
      excluded from Phase 2 Based on recruitment rates from studies at Brown, the investigators&#xD;
      estimate that one quarter of participants completing the screening consent will be eligible&#xD;
      for the study. As such, the investigators plan to obtain screening consent from approximately&#xD;
      600 to 800 individuals with the hope of yielding 150 to 180 participants eligible for the&#xD;
      experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited using established and approved methods that have been applied&#xD;
      in our community, including online advertisement through the Brown CAAS and Brown Alcohol&#xD;
      Research Center on HIV (ARCH) websites, flyers posted at CAAS- and ARCH-affiliated clinical&#xD;
      and community centers, and flyers posted at public venues and organizations in the local&#xD;
      community. In addition to these direct recruitment strategies, this study will employ chain&#xD;
      referral sampling (i.e., &quot;snowball sampling&quot;), in which project staff will ask men who&#xD;
      respond to our advertisements if they would be willing to inform others about our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project staff will also contact individuals who have completed the online survey for our&#xD;
      research participant pool. The participant pool survey provides an efficient means to&#xD;
      identify individuals who are interested in participating in research studies on sexual&#xD;
      minority men's health. The HRPP confirmed that the procedures necessary for creating and&#xD;
      managing this participant pool do not constitute human subjects research, and therefore do&#xD;
      not require IRB review. The participant pool survey includes items that are sufficient to&#xD;
      determine whether an individual meets preliminary screening criteria for the current study.&#xD;
      As with our other recruitment strategies, all individuals recruited through the participant&#xD;
      pool will be asked to complete the dedicated screening consent and survey to determine full&#xD;
      eligibility for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology and Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening. Upon contact, potential participants will be given a brief description of the&#xD;
      study and will receive a link to our online screening consent form and screening survey. Upon&#xD;
      completion of the screening survey, those who do not meet the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      notified of their ineligibility online. Eligible participants will be contacted by a research&#xD;
      assistant to describe the experimental session further and confirm their interest in&#xD;
      participating. Eligible participants will be informed that the experimental session will last&#xD;
      2.5 hours, plus the time it takes for BrAC to fall to .02%. Participants will be told not to&#xD;
      drive to the session; public transportation or cab vouchers will be provided if necessary.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to bring photo identification to their session, to avoid using&#xD;
      alcohol or drugs that are not prescribed (including over-the-counter drugs) for 24 hours&#xD;
      prior to their appointments, and to fast for 3 hours before their appointments. Participants&#xD;
      agreeing to these terms will be scheduled for the experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent Procedure. All experimental sessions will be conducted at CAAS in&#xD;
      Providence, RI. Our labs are designed to facilitate studies involving alcohol administration.&#xD;
      When participants arrive to the lab, the research assistant will review photo identification&#xD;
      to verify the participant's age, then they will collect a BrAC to ensure that they are .000%.&#xD;
      Those with a BrAC above .000% will be rescheduled. Next, the research assistant will review&#xD;
      all sections of the informed consent document with the participant. The research assistant&#xD;
      will ask the participant if he understands the key component involved in participation, and&#xD;
      will answer any remaining questions before obtaining the participant's signature on the&#xD;
      appropriate documentation. After obtaining consent, the research assistant will review a&#xD;
      standard medical condition agreement, which asks participants to indicate whether they have&#xD;
      any medical conditions or are taking any medications for which alcohol use is&#xD;
      contraindicated. RAs will emphasize that questions are being asked of participants to ensure&#xD;
      their safety, and inquire about whether there are any safety reasons why they should not&#xD;
      participate. Lists of affected conditions and medications will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Session Protocol. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three&#xD;
      potential conditions described above. The research assistant will collect measures of the&#xD;
      participant's weight and height for determining the volume of beverage to be administered.&#xD;
      This includes determining the appropriate dose of alcohol for those assigned to the alcohol&#xD;
      condition. Dose amounts will be calculated using a well-validated algorithm. Next&#xD;
      participants will be asked to complete a baseline assessment battery via computer-delivered&#xD;
      self-report questionnaire. Finally, the research assistant will encourage the participant to&#xD;
      use the restroom prior to initiating experimental procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the baseline measures, participants will undergo the beverage administration&#xD;
      protocol, which will be identical for all participants so as to avoid bias due to potential&#xD;
      timing effects. Duration and timing of beverage administration and post-drinking assessment&#xD;
      is based on pharmacokinetic assumptions that peak blood alcohol is approximately 60 minutes&#xD;
      after consumption. Participants in the alcohol condition will consume a volume of alcohol to&#xD;
      reach a peak BrAC of .080g%. The total volume will be divided into three drinks to be&#xD;
      consumed over the course of 15 minutes. Following consumption, BrAC will be measured every&#xD;
      5-minutes, and post-drinking assessment will be initiated when the participant's BrAC is&#xD;
      .035g%, as this corresponds with the initiation of stimulant effects of alcohol. The&#xD;
      estimated absorption period to reach this level is 10 to 20 minutes. Initiation of post-drink&#xD;
      assessment for placebo and true control participants will be determined using a yoked control&#xD;
      design, such that each control participant is assigned to undergo the same waiting period and&#xD;
      the same number of breath tests as a corresponding alcohol participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon reaching a BrAC of .035g% (or comparable time for placebo and control), participants&#xD;
      begin the post-drinking assessment protocol, comprising an arousal prime, two measures of&#xD;
      sex-specific delay discounting, followed by the MSM stimulus story. The instructions for each&#xD;
      of these tasks will be computer-delivered, and participant responses will be collected via&#xD;
      computer-based self-report questionnaires. Within the MSM scenario, participants are asked in&#xD;
      open-ended format to respond to other character in the story or to describe what happens&#xD;
      next. These responses will be audio recorded using a digital recording device set to&#xD;
      automatically record when the participant begins speaking. Throughout this protocol, which&#xD;
      will last approximately 35-45 minutes, BrAC will be measured every 10-15 minutes for all&#xD;
      participants independent of condition. To evaluate the success of the experimental&#xD;
      manipulation, subjective intoxication (e.g., &quot;how intoxicated do you feel?&quot;) will be measured&#xD;
      every 10-15 minutes as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the assessment phase, participants in the placebo and control conditions will be&#xD;
      debriefed and provided with a taxi home. Participants in the alcohol condition will begin the&#xD;
      recovery period, in which they will be able to eat a snack, use the restroom, and wait&#xD;
      comfortably. BrAC will be assessed every 15-20 minutes until it is verified at .02g% or&#xD;
      below, at which point they will be debriefed and provided with a taxi or public&#xD;
      transportation home.&#xD;
