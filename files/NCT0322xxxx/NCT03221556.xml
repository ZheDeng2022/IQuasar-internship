  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial to improve outcomes among pregnant and&#xD;
      post-partum women with symptoms of depression. Both interventions under study will be based&#xD;
      in the patient-centered medical home setting at Boston Medical Center - specifically, in&#xD;
      prenatal clinic or in the general pediatrics clinic. The study is a type 1 hybrid&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation trial of 230 mothers with clinically significant depressive&#xD;
      symptomatology. Of the 230 subjects, half will receive the Engagement-Focused Care&#xD;
      Coordination intervention; the other half will receive the Problem Solving Education&#xD;
      intervention. Outcomes for mothers will be assessed every 2 months throughout a 12 month&#xD;
      follow-up period. This trial is funded by a contract with PCORI, the Patient-Centered&#xD;
      Outcomes Research Institute.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of 230 mothers with clinically&#xD;
      significant depressive symptomatology being conducted at Boston Medical Center (BMC). The&#xD;
      effectiveness component of the study (which is the trial registered on ClinicalTrials.gov) is&#xD;
      a pragmatic, parallel group randomized trial that measures patient-reported outcomes over 12&#xD;
      months of follow-up. The implementation portion comprises a series of qualitative interviews&#xD;
      to discern barriers and facilitators to intervention implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 230 mothers with clinically significant depressive&#xD;
      symptomatology according to the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), a widely used&#xD;
      screening instrument valid during pregnancy and in the postpartum period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Engagement-Focused Care Coordination will be compared to Problem Solving Education (PSE).&#xD;
      Whereas Engagement-Focused Care Coordination emphasizes referral to formal depression&#xD;
      services following a brief engagement session, PSE offers initial depression treatment&#xD;
      onsite, followed by referral to further care if depressive symptoms persist or worsen.&#xD;
      Patients in both arms will have access to the same array of community-based mental health&#xD;
      services upon referral. Both intervention arms are designed to be peer-delivered; thus, the&#xD;
      investigators will enlist their existing team of PCMH family advocates - a group of women&#xD;
      (approximately age-matched with our study participants) - to serve as intervention providers.&#xD;
      To minimize contamination across comparators, this team will be divided into those trained in&#xD;
      Engagement Interviewing and those trained in PSE.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS SR-16). This scale is a 16-item self-report measure of depressive symptoms over the past 7 days. Each item is scored 0-3 (0 = no presence of the symptom; 3 = high burden of the symptom), yielding a total score range of 0 to 27. Because of its wide scoring range, the QIDS can be used to detect depressive illness in populations with low symptoms. Lower scores reflect less depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>Assessed by the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS). This 25-item self-reported measure is used to track changes weekly in the behaviors hypothesized to underlie depression and specifically targeted for change by behavioral activation. The BADS subscales include activation, avoidance/rumination, work/school impairment, and social impairment. Each item is scored 0-6 (0=not at all; 6=completely), yielding a total score range of 0 to 150. High scores indicate greater levels of activation. For all the subscores, high scores are consistent with the subscale name.</description>

    <description>The brief intervention in Engagement-Focused Care Coordination is the Engagement Interview. In this model, providers meet one to two times with mothers who screen positive for depression, and use techniques of shared decision-making to help mothers process the results of the screen; explore treatment options; and connect with formal mental health services. Engagement-Focused Care Coordination emphasizes referral to formal mental health services.</description>

    <description>Engagement interviewing is embedded within a traditional PCMH structure using motivational interviewing and shared decision making; it explores treatment options in the context of a patient's life circumstances, and helps her work through ambivalence to receiving care. In one to two sessions, providers disclose the probable diagnosis of depression, provide psycho-education, present treatment options, and engage clients in shared decision making to determine the most appropriate referral.</description>
