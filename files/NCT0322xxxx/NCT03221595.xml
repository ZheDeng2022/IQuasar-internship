      This study evaluates the efficacy of surgical stabilization of rib fractures, as compared to&#xD;
      best medical management, for patients with multiple, displaced rib fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of patients will be randomized to surgery (in addition to best medical management),&#xD;
      whereas the other half will be randomized to medical therapy only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the subjects overall quality of life measured at two months&#xD;
      following injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rib fracture are the most common serious injury following blunt trauma, and occur in&#xD;
      approximately 10% of trauma patients [1]. Despite improvements in the care of rib fracture&#xD;
      patients, outcomes remain poor and have not changed substantially over the last 15 years [2].&#xD;
      Poor outcomes resulting from serious rib fractures include both acute complications (e.g.,&#xD;
      pneumonia, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and death) and chronic disability (e.g., pain,&#xD;
      dyspnea, and loss of productivity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last 10 years, surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) has emerged as a&#xD;
      promising technology for the management of patients with severe chest wall injuries [3].&#xD;
      Conceptually, SSRF applies the fundamental orthopedic principles of reduction and fixation to&#xD;
      rib fractures, restoring chest wall stability and minimizing pain with respiration,&#xD;
      splinting, and secretion accumulation. The advent of muscle-sparring [4] and even&#xD;
      minimally-invasive surgical techniques [5], as well as a relatively low complication rate&#xD;
      [6], has improved the appeal of this operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, three randomized clinical trials (RCTs) [7-9] and three meta-analyses of these and&#xD;
      other trials [10-12] have limited their scope to patients with flail chest, a specific&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis characterized by paradoxical motion of a portion of the chest wall due to&#xD;
      fractures of two or more ribs in at least two places. Flail chest represents the most severe&#xD;
      form of chest wall injury, with an associated, very high morbidity and mortality. Each of the&#xD;
      aforementioned RCTs, as well as multiple prospective, non-randomized investigations [13, 14],&#xD;
      have found a benefit to SSRF as compared to best medical management in this patient&#xD;
      population. Accordingly, expert consensus statements have recommended this operation in this&#xD;
      subset of patients [3, 15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon the favorable reported efficacy of SSRF in patients with flail chest, many&#xD;
      surgeons have broadened indications to patients with severe, non-flail rib fracture patterns,&#xD;
      most commonly ≥ 3 severely displaced fractures. Although these injuries differ anatomically&#xD;
      from flail chest, many of the same pathophysiologic principles are at work: namely, painful&#xD;
      motion at the fracture sites cause respiratory compromise, bony bridging [16], and risk of&#xD;
      subsequent non-union, chronic pain, and restrictive lung disease. However, it is not clear if&#xD;
      stabilization of these fractures confers the same benefits as in the case of flail chest.&#xD;
      This lack of efficacy data has been recognized in recent guidelines, which were unable to&#xD;
      recommend SSRF for non-flail fracture patterns pending further data. Furthermore, long term&#xD;
      quality of life data for both flail and non-flail fracture patterns managed with SSRF are not&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of SSRF is increasing exponentially. Somewhat alarmingly, nearly one half of the&#xD;
      procedures were performed in patients without flail chest [17]. A combination of the&#xD;
      favorable results observed for SSRD in flail chest, the increasing prevalence of SSRF for non&#xD;
      flail-chest, and the lack of quality evidence to support this operation in this patient&#xD;
      population, lead to the design of the current RCT. The objective of this trial is to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy of SSRF, as compared to non-operative management, for hospitalized&#xD;
      patients with specific, non-flail, severe rib fractures, and within expert, high volume&#xD;
      centers that participate in the Chest Wall Injury Society. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      SSRF, as compared to standardized medical management, improves pain control, pulmonary&#xD;
      function, risk of complications, and quality of life among patients with severe, non-flail&#xD;
      chest fracture patterns.&#xD;
