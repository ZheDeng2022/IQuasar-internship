      To develop predictive models for short-term readmission (60 days) and medium term (one year)&#xD;
      for patients with an exacerbation of COPD (eCOPD) which are admitted to any of the&#xD;
      participant hospitals. To identify factors contributing to readmission from the time of&#xD;
      discharge from the index admission to the studied readmission time. Methodology. Design:&#xD;
      Prospective cohort study with a nested case control study, with follow up to one year.&#xD;
      Patients: 1500 patients admitted over a year and a half in any of the 9 participant hospitals&#xD;
      by an eCOPD. Methods: During admission, background information on patient situation prior to&#xD;
      admission, data of the ED during admission, and discharge planning, will be collected from&#xD;
      medical history. The investigators will also survey patients (generic and specific&#xD;
      health-related quality life -HRQoL- dependence, social support, presence of fragility). All&#xD;
      patients will be followed to determining whether any readmission until 60 and up to one year&#xD;
      of discharge from the index admission occurs. Patients readmitted at the first 60 days after&#xD;
      discharge will be surveyed on a number of possible causes of readmission (continuity of care,&#xD;
      medication, complications, individual and social factors). A one to one control group will be&#xD;
      established to compare different factors studied in the case group (readmission). Statistical&#xD;
      analysis: predictive models will be developed from the derivation sample, and validated in a&#xD;
      validation sample. Also, the factors evaluated in the case-control study will be compared&#xD;
      using appropriate test for paired samples.&#xD;

      DESIGN: A prospective observational cohort study with a nested case control study, with one&#xD;
      year follow-up from index hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING: Multicenter and multidisciplinary study taking part the following hospitals: Costa&#xD;
      del Sol Hospital (Andalusia), Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria University Hospital (Canary&#xD;
      Islands), Gregorio Marañón General University Hospital (Madrid), and Basque Country hospitals&#xD;
      (Araba, Donostia, Basurto, Cruces University Hospitals and Santa Marina and Galdakao-Usansolo&#xD;
      Hospitals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS: In this study episodes will be considered from the index episode of the admission&#xD;
      of the COPD exacerbated recruited patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: episodes of patients with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD). Those patients can be admitted with 2 presentations: A) known case of COPD:&#xD;
      episodes of patients with a previous diagnosis of COPD (FEV1/FVC&lt;70%) who have an&#xD;
      exacerbation of COPD. The exacerbation of COPD is defined as an acute worsening of symptoms&#xD;
      in relation to the baseline situation and beyond the patient's daily variability. In&#xD;
      addition, the exacerbation makes necessary to make changes in the patient's usual medication.&#xD;
      The most frequently reported symptoms are dyspnea, cough, increased the sputum's production,&#xD;
      and changes in the sputum's color. B) New case of COPD: episodes in which COPD is suspected&#xD;
      because of the medical history and anamnesis (smokers or ex-smorkers of more than 15&#xD;
      pack/year, with basal dyspnea, cough, and expectoration for more than three months per year)&#xD;
      and it is compatible with an exacerbation. The diagnosis will be confirmed at respiratory&#xD;
      outpatient clinic within two months after discharge, by performing a spirometry when the&#xD;
      patient is stable. If COPD is not confirmed in this consultation, the patient would be&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who sign informed consent. Exclusion criteria: patients admitted with obstructive or&#xD;
      restrictive ventilatory failure due to another disease (asthma, consequences of tuberculosis,&#xD;
      pachypleuritis, restrictive diseases). All COPD patients finally admitted for any other&#xD;
      cause, other than exacerbation or complicated COPD. Patients with severe physical or&#xD;
      psychopathological disease, cognitive deterioration, any neurologic disease, that prevented&#xD;
      them from properly completing the questionnaires. Patients who do not understand the Spanish&#xD;
      language to complete properly the questionnaires. Patients that do not want to participate or&#xD;
      do not sign the inform consent. For re-admissions: those who are programmed admissions or&#xD;
      those for another cause not in relation with CMS algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE: Calculation of sample size: predictive modeling studies establish that it is&#xD;
      necessary to have at least 10 events of the dependent variable of interest (readmissions) for&#xD;
      each independent variable included in the multivariate model. In the multivariate logistic&#xD;
      regression models, for the assessment of not less than 5 but not more than 10 variables, the&#xD;
      investigators estimate that it will be necessary at least 100 events of the dependent&#xD;
      variable (Readmissions) in the sample from which the investigators will derive the prediction&#xD;
      rule to ensure that the model converges properly. With a 20% of readmissions, and requiring&#xD;
      two samples (derivation and validation) the investigators need at least 1000 valid&#xD;
      admissions. On the other hand, in the nested case-control study, to detect differences in the&#xD;
      continuity of care at follow-up, from 70 to 55%, or in conciliation with medication from 30&#xD;
      to 15%, separately for case (readmissions) and control groups, less than 200 valid patients&#xD;
      would be needed for the analysis in each group (for and α=0.05 and a power (1-β) of 0.80),&#xD;
      which suppose 1000 index admissions. To do this, each center will have to collect&#xD;
      approximately 100-250 patients during the recruitment period. This is assured, while assuming&#xD;
      a 20% of exclusions, including those cases that are programmed admissions, and 15% of losses&#xD;
      on the remaining sample. Sampling: consecutive, all patients who re-enter and renter during&#xD;
      the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Variables to be included in the study: Variables to be collected from the Emergency&#xD;
      Department: 1) level of awareness measured by Glasgow scale, baseline and admission dyspnea&#xD;
      (MRC dyspnea and Borg fatigue scales), respiratory and cardiac frequency, blood pressure,&#xD;
      fever, thoracic pain, gasometric parameters (arterial oxygen (PO2) or oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (spoO2), pH, arterial carbon dioxide level (PCO2)); Variables to be collected during&#xD;
      admission: 2) Background and sociodemographic (age, sex); health habits (smoking, exercise&#xD;
      level), hearing or visual deficits, or falls; social support; 3) baseline COPD severity&#xD;
      (measured by FEV1, 5), emergency visits in the last month and year, and previous admissions&#xD;
      during the last 12 months; 4) Associated diseases that affect the exacerbation of COPD&#xD;
      (cardiac, diabetes), and all those that the Charlson Comorbidity index; 5)Weight, height&#xD;
      (BMI); 6)electrocardiography data, radiological findings, biochemical data and hematocrit,&#xD;
      gasometry, FIO2 on arrival and discharge; 7) Other: basal treatment in the Emergency&#xD;
      Department, and in the admission (short and/or long-term beta inhalers, anticholinergics,&#xD;
      inhaled and/or oral orticoid, oxygen therapy), antibiotics, and other medications necessary&#xD;
      for comorbidities; ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation; 8) presence of&#xD;
      complications, or death; Variables to be collected at admission and until discharge: ECG,&#xD;
      radiography at discharge, physiological data (temperature, respiratory and cardiac frequency,&#xD;
      blood preassure), biochemical data and hematocrit, gasometry and/or pulsimetry. Length of&#xD;
      hospital stay. Non-invasive ventilation or oxygen therapy at home. Health care habits&#xD;
      (tobacco, diet, exercise), specialist or family physician assessment, and, if available, a&#xD;
      review of inhalers using technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-administered questionnaires to be completed by the patient during admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of the quality of life. EuroQol-5d generic questionnaire; specific&#xD;
           questionnaire: COPD Assessment test (CAT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms´ assessment: MRC Dyspnea Scales; Physical Activity Questionnaire made ad hoc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anxiety/depression assessment: HAD questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social dependency: -Duke-UNC Social Support Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fragility assessment: Tilburg Frailty Indicator Part B (Components of frailty)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activities of daily living: Barthel's test. Variables to be collected from 2 months and&#xD;
           until one year of follow-up: through the participants hospitals' computer systems&#xD;
           (electronic medical history) and/or medical record on paper, and of the national death&#xD;
           index it will be collected basic information of the new readmissions (cause, date,&#xD;
           duration and complications) or patient's death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTED. A) Patients recruitment: trained personnel, with help/supervision of the&#xD;
      hospitals' respiratory specialist, will consecutively and prospectively recruit patients at&#xD;
      each center that meet the inclusion criteria. For each patient, the data collector will be&#xD;
      introduced to each patient to inform about the study aims', and if the patient agree to&#xD;
      participate, and sign the inform consent, HRQoL questionnaires will be given. The&#xD;
      questionnaires should be completed by the patient itself or with the help of a family member&#xD;
      or caregiver. The data collector will establish when to get back the questionnaires. If the&#xD;
      patients have been discharged, the questionnaires will be mailed. B) Clinical data&#xD;
      collection: Information will be collected from the Emergency Department and later, from the&#xD;
      medical record during admission and up to discharge. C) Identification of readmissions in the&#xD;
      first two months: The same data collector described above will examine the readmission from&#xD;
      the discharge to 60 days from it, to detect patients who are re-admitted. This will be&#xD;
      identified as readmission, and simultaneously, a patient that will be act as control and who&#xD;
      has been admitted at the same week as the patient with the current readmission will be&#xD;
      searched, trying to match both patients by age (by categories of five years) and baseline&#xD;
      FEV1 (greater or less than 50). All patients who have been readmitted within two months, and&#xD;
      their established controls, will be immediately mailed the follow-up questionnaire (the&#xD;
      corresponding questionnaire according if is case-readmission- or control situation). They&#xD;
      will be phoned in advance to advise them of the mailing of the questionnaires. The&#xD;
      questionnaires will be hand-delivered in the case of the patient hospital admitted at that&#xD;
      time. If within 7/10 days the questionnaire has not been received, a reminder letter will be&#xD;
      sent, and if in another 7/10 days the questionnaire has not been yet received, a letter with&#xD;
      the questionnaire will it be sent again. D) One year follow-up: Of all the patients recruited&#xD;
      in the index admission, whether they were readmissions, controls or not, clinical data will&#xD;
      be completed up to the year. E) Blood sample: In three of the hospital participant a sample&#xD;
      of blood has been collected in each index admission and stored in each Biobank. In these&#xD;
      cases, the patient must sign a specific additional informed consent established by the&#xD;
      Biobank. With each Biobank the method will be established for the recruitment and delivery of&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
