  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent mental illness (~9% life-time) that results&#xD;
      from exposure to trauma. As it is associated with vastly heterogeneous origins, accurate&#xD;
      diagnosis and optimal treatment strategies are sometimes very difficult to achieve. No known&#xD;
      biomarker exists, which makes it difficult to assess treatment response and functional&#xD;
      outcomes. The recent brain imaging studies have suggested that PTSD patients show abnormal&#xD;
      brain connectivity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The&#xD;
      investigators propose that cognitive processing therapy may ameliorate this functional&#xD;
      connectivity abnormality which may be related with their symptomatic improvement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops when a constellation of symptoms persist&#xD;
      following exposure to traumatic events such as actual or threatened death, serious injury,&#xD;
      and sexual violation, leading to significant interference with occupational and social&#xD;
      functioning. Epidemiological data indicate that the rate of lifetime PTSD in Canada is&#xD;
      approximately 9.2%, with a rate of current PTSD (symptoms for 1 month) estimated to be 2.4%.&#xD;
      Although significant advances have been made in the treatment of PTSD, e.g.,&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioural therapy; pharmacological interventions, a sizable proportion of&#xD;
      individuals do not respond to treatment. The lack of biomarkers and poor understanding of the&#xD;
      pathophysiology has hindered the efforts for advancing treatment of this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The meta-analysis on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies demonstrated that&#xD;
      patients with PTSD show reliable hyper-activity in the limbic brain regions including the&#xD;
      amygdala and hippocampus, while prefrontal brain regions associated with top-down executive&#xD;
      control, show decreased activity. These findings were in line with traditional neurocircuitry&#xD;
      models proposing that PTSD-related deficits in attention or awareness, including the&#xD;
      inability to suppress attention to trauma-related stimuli, are mediated by decreased&#xD;
      recruitment of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) whereas vivid and intrusive trauma&#xD;
      recollections are mediated by exaggerated amygdala activity. While the traditional&#xD;
      neurocircuity model proposed more of a unidirectional relationship (i.e., loss of top-down&#xD;
      prefrontal control results in exaggerated amygdala activity), later research suggested that&#xD;
      dysfunction in the PFC and limbic brain areas may stem from bidirectional alterations in&#xD;
      functional connectivity. An increasingly emerging body of studies has revealed PTSD symptoms&#xD;
      may arise from a breakdown in the interaction between larger-scale, neurocognitive networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in fMRI methodology have allowed for a more comprehensive assessment of&#xD;
      network interactions in PTSD. Newly developed network analysis techniques have shifted the&#xD;
      focus toward a perspective that views the brain as a network system, and have suggested that&#xD;
      disconnection or hyper-connection between brain regions is more relevant to clinical symptom&#xD;
      expression than regional dysfunction itself. Relatively lower frontal connectivity and&#xD;
      hyper-connectivity of limbic-amygdala circuitry have been found in PTSD. However, due to the&#xD;
      unstable nature of the conventional brain imaging analysis techniques, replication studies&#xD;
      are generally lacking and test-retest variability is too high to be qualified as a&#xD;
      &quot;biomarker&quot; to be used in clinical settings. In the current study, the investigators have&#xD;
      proposed using a novel method that can identify reliable brain network topography and&#xD;
      quantify the degree of abnormality which has great potential to be used as a biomarker for&#xD;
      PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a preliminary study, the investigators analyzed the resting state fMRI data of 11 PTSD and&#xD;
      11 trauma-exposed control (TEC) subjects using a novel approach that combines graph theory&#xD;
      and scaled subprofile modeling (SSM), which identifies eigenvector centrality and its&#xD;
      group-discriminating topographical pattern, respectively. The eigenvector centrality&#xD;
      represents how a node is neighboring other important nodes with respect to information flow.&#xD;
      The resulting pattern was characterized by increased eigenvector centrality in the&#xD;
      orbitofrontal regions, left amygdala, left anterior cingulate, right middle frontal and right&#xD;
      angular cortices (Ko &amp; Patel, in preparation). Moreover, the degree of pattern expression was&#xD;
      significantly higher in PTSD patients compared to TEC (t(20)=2.165, p=0.043) and this pattern&#xD;
      expression was correlated with memory performance for negative versus positive information&#xD;
      only in the PTSD group (r=0.641, p=0.034). As SSM typically focuses on the principal&#xD;
      components with &gt;10% variance-accounted-for, it has historically demonstrated high&#xD;
      replicability which lends the proposed method to be a potentially more useful biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed project, the investigators will recruit 40 patients with PTSD, 20 patients&#xD;
      with trauma exposure but without PTSD (TEC; 1st control group) and 20 healthy normal subjects&#xD;
      (HC; 2nd control group). All participants will undergo a comprehensive assessment (including&#xD;
      a psychodiagnostic and neuropsychological assessment) followed by resting state fMRI. The&#xD;
      PTSD and TEC groups will then be re-scanned with resting-state fMRI after undergoing 12&#xD;
      sessions of cognitive-processing therapy (CPT; 1 session/week). The HC group will be&#xD;
      rescanned 12 weeks later but no intervention will be introduced. The investigators expect&#xD;
      that the investigators will be able to replicate the preliminary finding described above&#xD;
      (i.e., identifying a PTSD-related network configuration that is not present in the control&#xD;
      groups) and demonstrate that changes within the PTSD-related network pattern expression will&#xD;
      be correlated with clinical improvement after CPT. The anticipated neuroimaging results are&#xD;
      expected to reveal a reliable neurobiological biomarker associated with the treatment (i.e.,&#xD;
      symptom reduction) of PTSD. The use of objective neuroimaging-based biomarkers will benefit&#xD;
      clinicians, patients and caregivers by significantly advancing the ability to establish a&#xD;
      connection between brain-related changes and an improvement in clinical symptoms.&#xD;
