    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study that provides the investigators with an opportunity to assess the&#xD;
      application of PSM technology for patient monitoring in the NICU. This is a prospective,&#xD;
      observational, cohort study.The investigators expect the duration of infant participation in&#xD;
      this study to be 6 hours per single recording session with no follow-up required.&#xD;

      Study Procedures/Evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The trial will be conducted at the CHEO NICU. The non-invasive patient monitoring&#xD;
           equipment that has no direct contact with infant's skin, includes a pressure sensitive&#xD;
           mat (PSM) from the LX100 series (XSensor Technology Corp. Calgary, Canada, XSensor.com)&#xD;
           and a video camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be lying in an incubator, on an overhead warmer neonatal bed, or an&#xD;
           open crib (whatever bed type they are currently being nursed in/on). The patient's nurse&#xD;
           will place the PSM on the mattress and under the patient's bedsheet where it will have&#xD;
           no contact whatsoever with the patient. The PSM placement under the infant will happen&#xD;
           at a time when the infant would normally be handled/moved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data from the following four sources will be recorded simultaneously in each session:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Contact pressure data from PSM&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Physiologic monitor data including blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR),&#xD;
                pulse rate (PR), respiratory rate (RR), and the alarms associated with each of&#xD;
                these physiologic data streams. This data is collected from monitors that the&#xD;
                patient has attached as part of their usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Video of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Event annotations collected by a bedside research assistant on a PC, laptop or&#xD;
                tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All data will be de-identified using unique study identifiers. The NICU research team&#xD;
           will assign these study identifiers and keep this information on a Master Study List&#xD;
           separate from all recorded data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The PSM connects to an X3 Pro Sensor Pack that feeds into an X3 Pro Electronic Platform&#xD;
           that is connected via USB to a laptop running the X3 Pro software. The X3 Pro software&#xD;
           is used to record PSM data and video simultaneously. The PSM is powered from an approved&#xD;
           AC power supply and is connected to the data acquisition computer via USB. The XSensor&#xD;
           PSM system is already being used with adult patients, however, the electrical safety of&#xD;
           our final configuration will also be established through independent inspection (see&#xD;
           below). The pressure mat will be covered by one or more bedsheets at all times. The baby&#xD;
           will not be permitted to come in contact with the mat to reduce the risk of electrical&#xD;
           shock and airway obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bench tests will be conducted by CHEO Clinical Engineering to confirm that leakage&#xD;
           current measurements from the mat and the entire system will meet the limits published&#xD;
           in Requirement EN60601. If any deficiencies are identified alternations to the system&#xD;
           will then be completed prior to a special inspection by Canadian Standards Association&#xD;
           (CSA). A special electro medical inspection will be arranged with CSA for the final&#xD;
           configuration of PSM, laptop, and power supplies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The video camera will be mounted on a tripod to capture patient movements, routine care,&#xD;
           and clinical interventions if any. We will capture the entire body, the head being very&#xD;
           important as this is where most interventions occur such as nasal gavage feeding,&#xD;
           ventilator support and airway suctioning. Video analysis has shown to be particularly&#xD;
           useful for estimating RR in neonates [39].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A bedside research assistant (RA) will manage all data recordings on a computer kept by&#xD;
           the patient's bedside for up to 6 hours per recording session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physiologic data including the patient's heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), oxygen&#xD;
           saturation levels (SpO2) and pulse rate (PR) as well as corresponding alarms for each&#xD;
           data stream shall be logged from the bedside Dr√§ger patient monitor onto a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The RA will simultaneously annotate all patient events including movements, routine&#xD;
           care, and clinical interventions on an electronic device such as a PC, laptop, or&#xD;
           tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The RN who will respond to the alarms will be asked for their clinical opinion as to the&#xD;
           veracity (artifact or clinically important) of the alarms and this opinion will be&#xD;
           annotated by the RA.&#xD;
