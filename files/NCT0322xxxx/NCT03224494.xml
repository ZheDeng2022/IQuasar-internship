      BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Bowel hypersensitivity (lower threshold for discomfort in response to&#xD;
      distention of a balloon in the rectum compared to healthy controls) is a key documented&#xD;
      feature in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) mechanistic studies. The use of the barostat&#xD;
      catheter to assess bowel hypersensitivity has been well documented in research settings, but&#xD;
      it's use is time consuming which makes it unpractical for routine clinical practice (test&#xD;
      time up to 60 minutes). The Rapid Barostat Bag is a novel device used to obtain a rapid and&#xD;
      simple assessment of the rectal function, which has received approval for use by Health&#xD;
      Canada. Although its safety and use has been validated in healthy controls, RBB use has never&#xD;
      been reported in a cohort of IBS patients. The aim of this study is to 1) evaluate bowel&#xD;
      sensitivity in IBS patients, compared with healthy controls and 2) determine whether the&#xD;
      sensory threshold predicts response to standard of care interventions such as diet or&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: This is a prospective controlled study. All participants will undergo RBB testing&#xD;
      and will answer a questionnaire related to bowel symptoms (IBS-SSS - IBS Severity Scoring&#xD;
      System) and a questionnaire related to anxiety/depression (HADS - Hospital and Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: The investigators hypothesize that IBS patients will display lower bowel&#xD;
      sensitivity thresholds than healthy controls, using the RBB device. Furthermore, we predict&#xD;
      that those with a low sensory threshold (i.e. visceral hypersensitivity) are most likely to&#xD;
      respond to interventions that decrease bowel distention (e.g. low FODMAP diet) or the&#xD;
      medication linaclotide that is reported to decrease pain signaling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IBS is a clinical entity characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel movements. About&#xD;
      20% of the western population is affected by IBS. Abnormal perception of visceral stimuli&#xD;
      plays a paramount role in the pathogenesis of IBS related abdominal pain. Moreover,&#xD;
      sensitization (modulation of intracellular mechanisms leading to exaggerated action potential&#xD;
      discharge in response to a given stimulus) of nociceptive dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons&#xD;
      by tissue mediators is a fundamental mechanism underlying abnormal pain signaling. Clinical&#xD;
      management of IBS has consisted primarily of symptomatic management of the altered bowel&#xD;
      movement pattern. Although these can also afford improvement in abdominal pain,&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy directly targeting bowel hypersensitivity are limited. Tri-cyclic&#xD;
      antidepressants have been used in small doses in selected IBS patients who have not responded&#xD;
      to first line therapy, but anti-cholinergic side effects have limited their use. The low&#xD;
      FODMAP diet is well described therapeutic intervention which also targets bowel&#xD;
      hypersensitivity, and about 70% of patients respond to this intervention. However, predictors&#xD;
      of response to the various IBS therapies are lacking, and treatment decisions are often made&#xD;
      on a &quot;trial and error&quot; fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of bowel sensitivity has been reported using a barostat (an elastic balloon&#xD;
      inflated manually by a syringe until rectal sensations are reported). Unfortunately, barostat&#xD;
      device use has not been practical because considerable time is required to carry out the&#xD;
      studies (up to 60 min). As such, barostat studies have been used mainly in research settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rapid barostat bag (RBB) is a novel handheld barostat device. It is quick and simple to&#xD;
      use, and its polyethylene bag provides superior volume measurements than the elastic balloons&#xD;
      currently in use. This test could ultimately provide a bedside measure in the clinic of&#xD;
      patients and identify those who are hypersensitive and thus more likely to respond to&#xD;
      therapies targeting this sensory disorder. Data on validation of the RBB method against the&#xD;
      standard barostat system has been published, using healthy volunteers. However, no studies&#xD;
      evaluating the use of the RBB to assess bowel visceral sensitivity have been published to&#xD;
      date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, there are 2 aims to this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To evaluate bowel sensitivity in IBS patients, compared with healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To determine whether sensory thresholds measured in clinic at the time of the initial&#xD;
      physical examination correlate with standard of care interventions, such as a low FODMAP diet&#xD;
      or medication such as linaclotide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new knowledge will afford the opportunity to gain new insights into the bowel&#xD;
      hypersensitivity which characterizes IBS. The overall goal of this study will be to assess if&#xD;
      IBS-mediated bowel hypersensitivity as assessed by the RBB can serve as predictor of response&#xD;
      to IBS pharmacotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both healthy controls (n= 100) and IBS patients (n=100) will undergo anorectal studies using&#xD;
      a Rapid barostat bag catheter. To test for stability of the response over time, IBS patients&#xD;
      will be given the option of returning in one month time so these studies can be repeated.&#xD;
      These studies will measure rectal perception to balloon inflation. The investigators will&#xD;
      correlate the changes to IBS symptoms using the IBS severity scoring system questionnaire&#xD;
      (IBS-SSS). The questionnaire will be administered twice for IBS patients who have consented&#xD;
      to return for a second study visit, at each of the two RBB studies. The patients will also&#xD;
      complete a validated anxiety and depression questionnaire (HAD scale). The symptom&#xD;
      questionnaires will also be administered to the healthy controls, to prove that they indeed&#xD;
      do not have symptoms of IBS. The Rapid Barostat Bag (Mui Scientific, Mississauga) will be&#xD;
      used for these studies. It has been approved for clinical use by Health Canada. It is a&#xD;
      computer driven volume displacement device. The device measures pressures and volumes&#xD;
      (sampling rate 1-2mL/second) and is connected to a device that monitors sensations as 0= no&#xD;
      pain,1=sensation, 2=urge, 3=discomfort.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients diagnosed with IBS by their treating gastroenterologist, according to the&#xD;
             Rome IV criteria. According to Rome IV criteria, IBS is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             recurrent abdominal pain, on average, at least one day per week in the last three&#xD;
             months, associated with 2 or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. pain is related to defecation&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. associated with a change in stool frequency&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. associated with a change in stool form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Irritable Bowel syndrome patients will be recruited from the GI motility clinic and&#xD;
             general GI clinic at Hotel Dieu Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Healthy controls will be recruited from the GI clinics. These are patients coming for&#xD;
             evaluation for non-colonic symptoms such as colon screening, gastroesophageal reflux&#xD;
             disease, or liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. patients under the age of 18;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. a recent change in IBS treatment regimen or patients taking analgesics, which may&#xD;
             affect bowel sensitivity (this includes the FODMAP diet)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. pregnant patients, as there may be a small risk of inducing labor with the barostat&#xD;
             probe&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. patients who have had previous colorectal surgery as it may bowel sensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. healthy controls who are experiencing bowel symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
