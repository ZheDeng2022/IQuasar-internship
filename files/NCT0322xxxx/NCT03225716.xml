  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying Ulocuplumab combined with ibrutinib as a possible treatment&#xD;
      for symptomatic Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an&#xD;
      investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational&#xD;
      drug to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ulocuplumab as a treatment&#xD;
      for any disease. Ulocuplumab is a type of protein called an antibody that attacks CXCR4, a&#xD;
      protein that is found on B-cells like WM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has Ibrutinib as a treatment option for this&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ibrutinib has been under investigation in research studies in participants with recurrent&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), mantle&#xD;
      cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and prolymphocytic leukemia, and&#xD;
      WM. In a study of ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory WM patients, response rates were high and&#xD;
      the treatment was well tolerated. In that study participants who had a CXCR4 mutation had a&#xD;
      lower response rate to ibrutinib than those without a mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating the safety of ulocuplumab in&#xD;
      combination with ibrutinib participants with symptomatic WM who have a CXCR4 mutation. The&#xD;
      investigators are also evaluating how well the ulocuplumab works in combination with&#xD;
      ibrutinib&#xD;
