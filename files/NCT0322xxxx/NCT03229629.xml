  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-school undernutrition is a global problem with life long adverse consequences. One form&#xD;
      of undernutrition, chronic undernutrition or stunting, affects 171 million children under the&#xD;
      age of 5 worldwide. 35% of these children live in Africa. In Ethiopia, the focus of this&#xD;
      study, in 2014, 44.5% of children under 5 were stunted. Stunting is the consequence of&#xD;
      several factors including low birth weights, sub-optimal infant and complementary feeding&#xD;
      practices and repeated illness. In Ethiopia, complementary feeding is sub-optimal; only 4% of&#xD;
      children aged 6-24 months met the minimum dietary diversity recommended by WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize four main reasons why many children and mothers in Ethiopia&#xD;
      fall short of best practice in terms of meeting nutritional needs and providing appropriate&#xD;
      childcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Lack of information on healthy eating and appropriate child-feeding practices; (ii)&#xD;
      Limited affordability; (iii) Limited accessibility to markets and diverse food items; and&#xD;
      (iv) Limited peer effects in spreading information and adopting new practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the efficacy of the interventions that address these four barriers to&#xD;
      optimal complementary feeding practices in Ethiopia. Using a cluster randomized control&#xD;
      design, mother-father-child pairs in two localities, Holeta and Ejere will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Treatment will be randomized at the garee (village) level. There will be five treatment arms&#xD;
      and a control group: T1, weekly maternal nutrition BCC sessions for four months; T2, weekly&#xD;
      maternal nutrition BCC sessions for four months and weekly paternal nutrition BCC sessions&#xD;
      for three months; T3, receipt of a food voucher for six months; T4, weekly maternal nutrition&#xD;
      BCC sessions for four months and receipt of a food voucher for six months; T5 weekly maternal&#xD;
      nutrition BCC sessions for four months and weekly paternal nutrition BCC sessions for three&#xD;
      months and receipt of a food voucher for six months; and C, a control group. Within&#xD;
      household, recipient of voucher (mother or father) will be randomly selected.&#xD;

      1. Specific Aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 1: How does maternal behavior change communication (BCC) on healthy eating affect&#xD;
           knowledge on child feeding, child feeding behavior, and nutritional status of the child?&#xD;
           o Does BCC lead to changes in knowledge about healthy child-feeding and child-feeding&#xD;
           behaviors?&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Does the changes in child-feeding behaviors due to BCC lead to improvements in&#xD;
           nutritional status among young children measured by height-for-age and&#xD;
           weight-for-height?&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 2: How do food vouchers affect food consumption and nutritional status?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Do vouchers lead to increased food consumption and dietary diversity?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Do vouchers crowd out private spending on food?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Does the increased food intake due to food vouchers lead to improvements in&#xD;
                nutritional status among young children measured by height-for-age and&#xD;
                weight-for-height?&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 3: How does increased accessibility affect food consumption, child-feeding behavior&#xD;
           and nutritional status?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  By sending petty traders of various food items to randomly selected markets with&#xD;
                limited access to diverse food groups, the investigators hypothesize that increased&#xD;
                accessibility to diverse food items will lead to increased food consumption and&#xD;
                dietary diversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Is there complementarity between accessibility and BCC or vouchers?&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 4: Is there complementarity between BCC and food voucher? • The investigators will&#xD;
           test whether there is a complementarity between BCC and food vouchers, as those&#xD;
           receiving the BCC would make more informed decisions on food consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 5: Are there peer effects in nutrition education and corresponding behavior change?&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Within treatment groups: As low food diversity is in part due to eating norms in the&#xD;
           community, the investigators will test to what extent peer effects within the treatment&#xD;
           group will play a role in reinforcing nutritional knowledge and in changing household's&#xD;
           food consumption decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Outside the treatment groups (spillovers): The investigators hypothesize that mothers&#xD;
           receiving BCC will affect eating behaviors of other household members and/or friends.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 6: How do variations in the prices of healthy food impact demand?&#xD;
&#xD;
           o The investigators hypothesize that offering lower price options of healthy but&#xD;
           expensive food such as meat would increase the demand for that food.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o What are the price elasticity of demand for important food items? What is the maximum&#xD;
           price households are willing to pay-i.e., the stoppage rule-for healthy food items?&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 7: Is there additional impact of paternal and maternal nutrition BCC sessions on&#xD;
           complementary feeding practice compared to maternal nutrition BCC sessions alone?&#xD;
&#xD;
           o There will be greater improvement in complementary feeding practices when fathers are&#xD;
           engaged in nutrition BCC sessions. Increased fathers' support on purchasing expensive&#xD;
           but nutritious food items and household labor will facilitate the changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 8: Is there differential impact of voucher transfer on complementary feeding&#xD;
           practices depending on recipient's gender?&#xD;
&#xD;
           o The investigators will compare the effect of giving vouchers to fathers with giving&#xD;
           vouchers to mothers on complementary feeding practices, food consumption of household,&#xD;
           and health-related outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Detailed intervention component&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Maternal behavior change communication&#xD;
&#xD;
           BCC will be delivered in groups of six through weekly sessions for a duration of 4&#xD;
           months. Key gaps in knowledge and barriers identified through formative studies are also&#xD;
           addressed in the BCC modules.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Paternal behavior change communication&#xD;
&#xD;
           Materials will be delivered in groups of 6 through weekly sessions for the duration of 3&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3 Food vouchers&#xD;
&#xD;
           Food vouchers are transferred monthly at the Project Office in Holeta. Eligible&#xD;
           participants will receive 200 ETB, estimated around US$10. The length of the voucher&#xD;
           scheme will be 6 months. Voucher recipient's gender will be randomly selected within&#xD;
           group 3, 4 and 5 to assess whether there is any differential impact on complementary&#xD;
           feeding practices depending on the gender of voucher recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.4 Access to healthy food&#xD;
&#xD;
           For a random half of the treated and control groups, petty traders with diverse food&#xD;
           items to their localities will be sent to increase accessibility. This is taking into&#xD;
           consideration that some mothers, especially rural residents, have access a limited set&#xD;
           of food items in the markets that they usually visit, lacking dairy products, meat,&#xD;
           green leafy vegetables, and diverse fruits. To bridge this accessibility gap, petty&#xD;
           traders will be sent to some selected markets with dairy products, meat, and various&#xD;
           fruits and vegetables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.5 Price variation of healthy foods&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will introduce variation in the prices of healthy foods that are sold&#xD;
           through petty traders to estimate the impact of price on demand. Price variations will&#xD;
           take the form of 10%, 20%, or 30% discounts. While price will be varied by each petty&#xD;
           trader every time, average food prices over the 6-month intervention period will be the&#xD;
           same among all petty traders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quality assurance plan&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Baseline and follow up data will be collected through mobile-survey to minimize&#xD;
           errors. Commcare software will be used to build mobile survey. Data collected through&#xD;
           mobile survey will be checked for errors and missing data on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For some variables, predefined rule will be applied within Commcare software using&#xD;
                data validation tools as the data are collected to prevent avoidable errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Principle investigator and co-investigators will take turn and monitor the field&#xD;
                site during data collection stage (both baseline and follow up) and during early&#xD;
                intervention stage to ensure data quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Baseline survey data will be compared to demographic and health survey data to&#xD;
                assess the accuracy, completeness and representativeness of the data. However, for&#xD;
                most variables, there are no external data sources to compare.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data dictionary not relevant&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For variable with missing data above 5%, the variable won't be used as control&#xD;
                variables. For main outcome of interest, data will be checked for errors and&#xD;
                missing data on a daily basis. The investigators will revisit the study participant&#xD;
                to minimize missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Standard Operating Procedures to address registry operations and analysis activities&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1 Patient recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
           The selection of the households that will be eligible to receive interventions will take&#xD;
           place using the census data of Holeta and Ejere that was collected in 2016. To minimize&#xD;
           potential contamination, control and treatment groups will be randomized at garee&#xD;
           (village) level. Upon consent to participate in the study, mothers living in same garee&#xD;
           will form a group to receive BCC education for mothers, and eligible spouse/partner of&#xD;
           the participating mother will be recruited to form a group separately from mother to&#xD;
           receive BCC for fathers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 Consent process&#xD;
&#xD;
           Women will be recruited from home visits by AFF's enumerators assigned to this study.&#xD;
           Women will be approached by an AFF's enumerator from the study to see if they are&#xD;
           interested in participating. All women in their reproductive age (18-40) will be&#xD;
           informed about the details of the survey and asked to participate in the survey with the&#xD;
           consent form. Enumerators will read all out the consent form before asking for&#xD;
           signature. If they accept, enumerators will conduct the baseline survey, which consists&#xD;
           of demographic and socioeconomic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 Survey data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
           When eligible participants are identified, AFF enumerators will meet the participants at&#xD;
           the health posts.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4 Sample size assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Minimum detectable difference for the cluster-randomized controlled trial was&#xD;
           calculated. Intra-cluster coefficient was calculated using 2011 DHS data for HAZ, WHZ&#xD;
           and child dietary diversity score (DDS). Minimum detectable difference was estimated&#xD;
           with statistical significance of 0.05 and power of 0.8. Six mother-child pair per&#xD;
           cluster was decided on the study area's estimates of birth rates, 50 numbers of clusters&#xD;
           available for each arm. 10% attrition was assumed. Details of power calculation for main&#xD;
           outcomes of interest are shown below.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Detectable difference&#xD;
&#xD;
           • DDS: 0.30 (Mean 1.5, SD 1.05, ICC 0.10)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HAZ: 0.51 (Mean -1.56, SD 1.75, ICC 0.12)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  WHZ: 0.42 (Mean -0.80, SD 1.44, ICC 0.11)&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5 Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Estimation of treatment effects&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this section, the investigators outline the basic estimation approach to measuring&#xD;
           the effect of the treatments on various outcomes. Our basic treatment effects&#xD;
           specification estimates the following equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           y= β₀ + β₁BCC + β₂Voucher+ β₃BCC&amp;Voucher+ β₄X+ ε where y is the outcome of interest.&#xD;
           BCC, Voucher, and BCC&amp;Voucher are dummy variables equal to 1 if the participant was&#xD;
           randomly assigned to the BCC, voucher group, or the BCC and voucher villages,&#xD;
           respectively, and 0 otherwise. β₁, β₂ and β₃ represent the effect of being assigned to&#xD;
           the specific treatment arm. X is a vector of individual's characteristics including&#xD;
           demographic variables (e.g., age, marital status, birth order, and household size) and&#xD;
           socioeconomic status (e.g., level of education, employment status/history, and household&#xD;
           income and asset). ε is an error term. The outcome variable, y, include mother's&#xD;
           nutritional knowledge score, household food and non-food expenditures, child's dietary&#xD;
           diversity score and FCS, and child's height-for-age (HAZ) and weight-for-height Z scores&#xD;
           (WHZ).&#xD;
&#xD;
           To assess the gender-related impacts of engaging fathers in the BCC program, the&#xD;
           investigators estimate the following equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           y= β₀ + β₁MotherBCC+ β₂BothBCC+ β₃MotherBCC&amp;Voucher+ β₄BothBCC&amp;Voucher+ β₅X+ ε where&#xD;
           MotherBCC, BothBCC, MotherBCC&amp;Voucher and BothBCC&amp;Voucher are dummy variables equal to 1&#xD;
           if the household was randomly assigned to the mother BCC, mother and father BCC, mother&#xD;
           BCC and voucher, or mother and father BCC and voucher villages, respectively, and 0&#xD;
           otherwise. β₁, β₂, β₃ and β₄ represent the treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To assess the differential impacts of randomly giving vouchers to mothers or fathers, a&#xD;
           dummy variable representing the sex of the voucher recipient will be interacted with the&#xD;
           voucher treatment assignment variable. Further, the investigators will implement the&#xD;
           same analysis with a restricted sample by excluding BCC only villages.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators also have random variation in the accessibility to certain food items&#xD;
           in the markets, as a random half of the participants are provided access to additional&#xD;
           goods in the markets. To analyse the effect of increased accessibility on household&#xD;
           expenditures and nutritional outcomes, the investigators estimate the following&#xD;
           equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           y =α₀+α₁Access+α₂X+α₃P+ ε Where Access is a dummy variable equal to 1 if petty traders&#xD;
           are randomly assigned to markets in village provide lacking food items such as meat,&#xD;
           dairy products, and fruits and vegetables. P is a vector of food prices in village.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Finally, the investigators use network data to estimate whether the treatment also&#xD;
           influenced the outcomes of peers of the participants. The extent of such peer effects or&#xD;
           information spillovers can be estimated with the following specification:&#xD;
&#xD;
           y =α₀+α₁Peer+α₂X+ ε Where y is the outcome of interest for individual i with child less&#xD;
           than four months of age or in pregnancy at the time of baseline survey. Peer is a dummy&#xD;
           variable equal to 1 if respondent has a peer in cluster who is assigned to BCC or BCC&#xD;
           and voucher treatment group.&#xD;
