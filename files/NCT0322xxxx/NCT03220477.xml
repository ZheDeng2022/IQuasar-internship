    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a combination of three drugs,&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, guadecitabine and mocetinostat. Pembrolizumab is a drug given by vein and all&#xD;
      patients will receive the same dose. Guadecitabine and mocetinostat will be given at&#xD;
      different doses to find out what effects, if any, they have on treating your cancer and side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be capable, willing, and able to provide written, informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have progressed on treatment with an anti-PD1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
             (mAb) administered either as monotherapy, or in combination with other checkpoint&#xD;
             inhibitors or other therapies. PD-1/PD-L1 treatment progression is defined by meeting&#xD;
             all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Has received at least 2 doses of an approved anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAb b. Has&#xD;
             demonstrated disease progression after PD-1/PD-L1 as defined by RECIST v1.1 (if&#xD;
             treatment received as part of a clinical trial with formal RECIST reads performed) or&#xD;
             a combination of clinical AND radiologic evidence of progression, as determined by the&#xD;
             treating investigator. The initial evidence of disease progression (PD) should ideally&#xD;
             be confirmed by a second assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date of the first&#xD;
             documented PD, unless there is rapid clinical progression such that follow up imaging&#xD;
             is infeasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Note: Second imaging for confirmation of PD can be waived in rapidly progressing&#xD;
             patients after consultation with the Sponsor/PI. Progressive disease has been&#xD;
             documented within 24 weeks from the last dose of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAb.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable by RECIST v1.1 (those undergoing pre-treatment resection must have imaging&#xD;

             radiographic progression at that site subsequent to the time of completing radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a safely biopsiable tumor lesion and be willing to undergo a pre-treatment and&#xD;
             ontreatment core biopsy&#xD;

             creatinine levels &gt;1.5 x ULN, an estimated creatinine clearance of ≥ 40 mL/min&#xD;
             calculated using the Cockcroft and Gault formula ((140-Age) • Mass (kg)/(72 •&#xD;
             creatinine mg/dL); multiply by 0.85 if female) e. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN OR, for&#xD;
             subjected with total bilirubin levels &gt;1.5 x ULN, a direct bilirubin ≤ ULN f. AST and&#xD;
