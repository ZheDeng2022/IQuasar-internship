      a comparative study was done to assess the effectiveness of Module based learning and Mobile&#xD;
      application based learning regarding Facility based newborn care among nursing students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MODULE GROUP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1: Pre assessment of Knowledge through Structured knowledge questionnaire was done and&#xD;
      practice through observation checklist by OSCE method .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2: Module based Teaching administered to nursing students who were present on the data&#xD;
      collection. Teaching and Hands on sessions were given to students by investigator.&#xD;
      Introduction regarding Module and topics: Prevention of infection (Hand washing), Kangaroo&#xD;
      Mother Care, Feeding of normal and low birth weight babies (Attachment during feeding,&#xD;
      Paladai Feeding), Common Procedures (Oxygen administration, Insertion and Orogastric Tube&#xD;
      Feeding, Weight Recording of a Newborn)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 15th = Post-test of Knowledge through Structured knowledge questionnaire was done in BSc.&#xD;
      Nursing 3rd year classroom and practice through observation checklist by OSCE method&#xD;
      Post-test of knowledge took 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MOBILE APPLICATION BASED GROUP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 16th = Pre assessment of Knowledge through Structured knowledge questionnaire was done in&#xD;
      BSc. Nursing 3rd year classroom of M.M Institute of Nursing and practice through observation&#xD;
      checklist by OSCE method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 17th = Mobile Application based Teaching administered to nursing students who were&#xD;
