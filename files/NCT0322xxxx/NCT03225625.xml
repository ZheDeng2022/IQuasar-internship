      The SciExVR study will evaluate the potential benefit of autologous bone marrow derived stem&#xD;
      cells (BMSC) in the treatment of spinal cord injury with evidence of impaired motor or&#xD;
      sensory function. The treatment consists of bilateral paraspinal injections of the BMSC at&#xD;
      the level of the injury as well as superior and inferior to that spinal segment followed by&#xD;
      an intravenous injection and intranasal placement. Patients undergoing BMSC treatment may&#xD;
      also be assigned to use of exoskeletal movement (or equivalent) or virtual reality&#xD;
      visualization (or equivalent) to augment upper motor neuron firing and/or receptivity of the&#xD;
      sensory neurons. http://mdstemcells.com/sciexvr/&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Stem Cell Spinal Cord Injury Exoskeleton and Virtual Reality (SciExVR) study is based on&#xD;
      the progress that researchers have made treating spinal cord injury (SCI) with bone marrow&#xD;
      derived stem cells (BMSC). While major improvements have remained elusive with other&#xD;
      approaches, modest benefits have been achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of subarachnoid BMSC provided via intrathecal injection has resulted in improvements&#xD;
      for certain sensory and bladder functions. Exoskeleton treatment has shown certain benefits&#xD;
      in sensory, bowel and bladder function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous (IV) BMSC have benefited stroke and other central nervous system damage. In the&#xD;
      sponsor's concomitant Neurologic Stem Cell Treatment (NEST) study for general neurologic&#xD;
      disease, benefit has been shown by combining IV with intranasal BMSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SciExVR study uses paraspinal injections- meaning the BMSC are placed adjacent to the&#xD;
      spinal nerves which enter the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramen of the&#xD;
      vertebral bodies. The BMSC will be placed at the level of the injury on both sides of the&#xD;
      spine as well as approximately two segments above and two segments below. The investigators&#xD;
      believe this will allow entry into the spinal tissue at the injury site as well as to the&#xD;
      injured upper motor neuron pathways; lower motor neurons which may be injured; sensory&#xD;
      pathways; dorsal root ganglia at and below the site and autonomic ganglia. Placement in the&#xD;
      paraspinal tissue may extend the time that BMSC have to proliferate at, above and below the&#xD;
      vicinity of the spinal cord injury and interact with damaged cells in the spinal cord, spinal&#xD;
      roots, spinal nerves and paravertebral ganglion. Potential benefits of these interactions&#xD;
      include BMSC mitochondrial transfer to target cells, secretion of mRNA increasing target cell&#xD;
      activity, secretion of nerve growth factor and other neurotrophic factors beneficial to nerve&#xD;
      regrowth. Increased proliferation and contact time may increase neuronal transdifferentiation&#xD;
      of BMSC to neurons and/or neuroglia. Following paraspinal injections the patient receives the&#xD;
      remaining BMSC intravenously (IV) and also topically intranasally. BMSC given IV may enter&#xD;
      the central nervous system through the paraventricular organs in the brain to potentially&#xD;
      reach the ascending and descending pathways, thalamus, sensory cortex, motor cortex and&#xD;
      circulate through the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Intranasal provides access through the&#xD;
      axons of the Trigeminal (V) cranial nerves and entry into the brain at the level of the pons&#xD;
      with similar opportunity to move through the tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMSC are separated from bone marrow obtained from the posterior iliac crest with a single&#xD;
      aspiration on each side. The procedure is performed under general or MAC anesthesia at the&#xD;
      fully licensed surgical center so there is no discomfort in performing the procedure. The&#xD;
      BMSC are separated from the aspirate using an FDA cleared class II device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After BMSC treatment patients who are in Arm 1 simply follow up with their own neurologists&#xD;
      at 1,3,6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those in Arm 2 require similar follow up and pursue treatment at centers that can provide&#xD;
      exoskeletal stimulation or physical therapy equivalent. Exoskeleton devices move the limbs of&#xD;
      the patient to provide stimulation to the muscles in a self directed fashion but similar to&#xD;
      physical therapy that is often performed for SCI. The investigators believe that Arm 2 may&#xD;
      provide stimulation of the upper and lower motor neurons and sensory receptors such as&#xD;
      exteroceptors and proprioceptors which may, in the presence of BMSC, assist in regeneration&#xD;
      or reactivation of the spinal cord pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Arm 3 require similar follow up and may use Virtual Reality headsets or&#xD;
      equivalent to increase visualization of movement of the lower extremities and/or sensory&#xD;
      feedback. This may also help stimulate the upper and lower motor neurons and sensory&#xD;
      receptors.&#xD;
