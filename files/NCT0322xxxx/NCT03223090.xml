  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project pursues the validation of an innovative strategy to boost language learning,&#xD;
      based on the benefits derived from sensorimotor training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The common belief of a rigid brain structure in adult life had to be reconsidered during the&#xD;
      last decade. After training, local increase in cerebral cortex volume and thickness, the part&#xD;
      of the brain containing neuronal cells and synapses, has been documented. Research has&#xD;
      established that brain structures active during training expand while learning and return to&#xD;
      baseline afterwards. The transient structural increase is thought to reflect &quot;work in&#xD;
      progress&quot; within areas involved in learning, meant to integrate new skills in existing neural&#xD;
      circuitries, via strengthening and/or selection of local neuronal connections. My main&#xD;
      hypothesis is that other functions, as long as they rely on the activity of the same brain&#xD;
      territories, can take advantage of this &quot;work in progress&quot;. To use an allegory, imagine the&#xD;
      restauration of a building (brain area). It can start after the request of improvements from&#xD;
      some of the residents (trained function) and then become the occasion for other tenants&#xD;
      (other functions) to see realized also their own wish for improvements. In the end everybody&#xD;
      will benefit from the restauration, provided that they all live in the same building and&#xD;
      everybody has posed their requests during the &quot;work in progress&quot;. Out of the allegory, living&#xD;
      in the same building means neural overlap of functions in the brain. The case of motor and&#xD;
      linguistic systems represents, from this perspective, a unique opportunity. State-of-the-art&#xD;
      research 1) proved the existence, and described the temporal evolution of brain plastic&#xD;
      changes during sensorimotor learning, and 2) documented neural overlap and functional&#xD;
      interactions of motor and linguistic systems. This posits solid bases for a crucial step&#xD;
      forward, gravid of important consequences and applications. This project aims to take this&#xD;
      step forward by directly testing the innovative hypothesis that brain changes induced by&#xD;
      sensorimotor learning induce benefits for linguistic functions relying on the same brain&#xD;
      territories.&#xD;

             this research&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A person under administrative or judiciary contention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A person who is not eligible to a MR-exam according to the relative screening&#xD;
             questionnaire cannot be admitted to the experiments including MR acquisitions in the&#xD;
             protocol&#xD;

          -  A person who is not eligible to a tDC Stimulation according to the relative screening&#xD;
             questionnaire cannot be admitted to the experiment including tDCS in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A person who is defined as bilingual according to the criteria described above cannot&#xD;
             be included in this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A person who studied a musical instrument for more than 3 years or plays it regularly&#xD;
             cannot take part to the studies in Objective B1, B2 and B3. This might introduce a&#xD;
             confound in the rate of motor learning and relative brain plasticity.&#xD;
