  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperkalemia (high potassium in blood) is a common condition found in kidney transplant&#xD;
      patients. Risk factors include poor kidney function and exposure to various drugs. Regardless&#xD;
      of the causes, current treatment options are limited. Previously, the only available&#xD;
      potassium binder for lowering potassium in the blood is sodium polystyrene sulfonate, which&#xD;
      has unknown drug interaction profile with transplant medications. Patiromer is a newly&#xD;
      approved potassium binder indicated for the treatment of hyperkalemia. Kidney transplant&#xD;
      patients with hyperkalemia may benefit from patiromer. However, the interaction of patiromer&#xD;
      and transplant medications has not been studied. The goal of this study is to look into the&#xD;
      drug interactions between patiromer and transplant medications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label single center pharmacokinetic study of kidney transplant recipients&#xD;
      with hyperkalemia receiving tacrolimus and MMF-based immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria during the screening visit.&#xD;
      There will be 2 study visits (visit 0 and visit 1) for each subject after successful&#xD;
      screening. Visit 0 occurs within 14 days (± 3 days) after screening. Visit 1 occurs at 7 days&#xD;
      (± 3 days) after visit 0. There will be 3 clinical visits (standard of care) after visit 1. A&#xD;
      total of 6 visits are anticipated for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard diet for lunch and dinner will be provided to subjects during visit 0 and visit 1.&#xD;
      Meals provided will be monitored in relationship to C0 and C12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During screening visit, blood tests for baseline BMP, aldosterone, magnesium, tacrolimus,&#xD;
      DSA, and MMF will be obtained. If applicable, concomitant fludrocortiosone will be stopped&#xD;
      prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During visit 0, tacrolimus levels will be drawn immediately before (0 hr) and at 8 intervals&#xD;
      after dosing (1,2,3,4,5,6,9,12 hrs). MMF levels will be drawn immediately before (0 hr) and&#xD;
      at 9 intervals after dosing (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,12 hrs). Basic metabolic profile and serum&#xD;
      magnesium levels will be drawn immediately before tacrolimus dosing. Oral MMF and tacrolimus&#xD;
      will be dosed at 8am ± 1hr.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment is defined as the first day when subject receives patiromer treatment. Patiromer&#xD;
      (8.4 grams) will be taken daily at 3 hours after oral tacrolimus and MMF dosing by subjects&#xD;
      commencing 3 days (± 1 day) prior to visit 1. No tacrolimus or MMF dosing changes are allowed&#xD;
      between visit 0 and 1. The addition of new concomitant drugs causing interactions with&#xD;
      tacrolimus and MMF are prohibited between visit 0 and 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During visit 1, subjects will follow the same protocol of blood draws as visit 0. Tacrolimus&#xD;
      levels will be drawn immediately before (0 hr) and at 8 intervals after tacrolimus dosing&#xD;
      (1,2,3,4,5,6,9,12 hrs). MMF levels will be drawn immediately before (0 hr) and at 9 intervals&#xD;
      after MMF dosing (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,12 hrs). Basic metabolic profile and serum magnesium levels&#xD;
      will be drawn immediately before tacrolimus dosing. Patiromer at 8.4 grams will be given 3&#xD;
      hrs after tacrolimus and MMF dosing. Oral MMF and tacrolimus will be dosed at 8am ± 1hr.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will followup for clinical visits (2-4) with the PI or their transplant&#xD;
      nephrologists after visit 1 according to schedule (see appendix for study visit events).&#xD;
      Subjects will complete study by 30 days (± 7 days) after visit 0. Adjustment of patiromer&#xD;
      dosing is at the discretion of PIs after visit 2. After completion of study visits, subjects&#xD;
      will continue to follow with transplant clinic monthly for 2 months or sooner if clinically&#xD;
      indicated per the discretion of the treating transplant nephrologist. After 2 months, clinic&#xD;
      visits will be conducted per routine clinic schedule.&#xD;
