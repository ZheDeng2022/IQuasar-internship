    <textblock>
      Surgical gastrojejunostomy is the conventional treatment for palliating patients suffering&#xD;
      from of inoperable malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). Although, the procedure is&#xD;
      associated with a high success and low re-intervention rates, there is a risk of morbidities&#xD;
      (10% - 16%) and mortalities (7%). The placement of a pyloro-duodenal self-expandable metallic&#xD;
      stent (DSEMS) is an alternative to surgery for the palliating these patients. As compared to&#xD;
      surgery, the procedure is associated with shorter hospital stay, reduced morbidities and&#xD;
      cost. However, the clinical efficacy of DSEMS is limited by several problems. In uncovered&#xD;
      DSEMS, the long-term patency is reduced by tumor ingrowth leading to subsequent re-stenosis.&#xD;
      In covered DSEMS, stent migration occurs at a frequency of 14 - 25% and it is a major&#xD;
      obstacle to stent patency. As a result, randomized trials comparing uncovered DSEMS and&#xD;
      partially or fully covered DSEMS in patients with malignant GOO have reported comparable&#xD;
      stent patency between the two types of stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the creation of a gastrojejunostomy under EUS (EUS-GJ) guidance using&#xD;
      lumen-apposing stents has been described 12-16. The procedure was associated with a technical&#xD;
      success rate of around 90% and clinical success of 85% to 100%. The procedure holds the&#xD;
      potential to create a gastrojejunostomy without surgery. Furthermore, there is a low risk of&#xD;
      tumor ingrowth and stent migration, thus improving the stent patency and reducing the need of&#xD;
      re-intervention. However, there is limited data on how EPASS compares to endoscopic stenting.&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is thus to compare prospective data on EPASS versus a historical&#xD;
      group that received DSEMS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In recent years, DSEMSs have provided an attractive alternative to surgery for palliation of&#xD;
      malignant gastric outlet obstruction. Several studies have assessed the clinical and&#xD;
      technical success rates of DSEMS for malignant gastroduodenal obstruction. Technical success&#xD;
      rates of 90% to 100% and clinical success of 80% to 95% was achieved.The procedure was&#xD;
      associated with quicker recovery and reduced morbidities as compared to surgical&#xD;
      gastrojejunostomies. However, the long-term patency of uncovered DSEMS is limited by the risk&#xD;
      of tumor ingrowth that would lead to subsequent re-stenosis of the stents requiring&#xD;
      re-intervention. Thus to palliate malignant gastric outlet obstruction, surgical&#xD;
      gastrojejunostomy is preferred in patients that are fit for surgery with prolonged life&#xD;
      expectancy whilst insertion of DSEMS is preferred in patients that are associated with&#xD;
      high-risk for surgery and short life expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, EUS-guided gastrojejunostomies have become possible. In the early description, a&#xD;
      common technical problem exists in the series. The target duodenum or jejunum needed for&#xD;
      creation of a GJ is collapsed and it is difficult to identify the target organ by EUS from&#xD;
      the stomach. Furthermore, the insertion of the stent for creation of the anastomosis may be&#xD;
      difficult with a collapsed bowel and this may result in catastrophic outcomes. To overcome&#xD;
      this difficulty, our group has published the results of using the double balloon occluder&#xD;
      that allows distension of the duodenum in conjunction with the AXIOS stent for creation of a&#xD;
      GJ in 20 patients (Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided double-balloon-occluded&#xD;
      gastrojejunostomy bypass - EPASS). The technical success rate was 90% (18/20). The median&#xD;
      intubation time from the double-balloon tube intubation to stent placement was 25.5 min&#xD;
      (range 10-39 min). Post-treatment gastric outlet obstruction scoring system (GOOSS) score&#xD;
      improved in all 18 cases in which EPASS was successfully performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, based on the above results, EUS-GJ may be associated with improved outcomes as compared&#xD;
      with conventional procedures for management of malignant GOO. The aim of the current study is&#xD;
      to compare the efficacies of EPASS in a prospective multicenter setting versus a historical&#xD;
      cohort of uncovered DSEMS for patients suffering from unresectable malignant GOO.&#xD;

    <description>The procedures would be performed under conscious sedation or monitored anesthesia by a therapeutic gastroscope. The endoscope would be used to reach the site of obstruction. The stricture would be cannulated with a 0.025&quot; or 0.035&quot; guide-wire. The double balloon occluder would then be inserted on guidewire beyond the duodenal-jejunal flexure and the two balloons of the occluder would be inflated. A segment of duodenum/jejunum would then be occluded and saline would be injected. A linear echoendoscope would then be inserted into the stomach to guide insertion of the gastrojejunostomy stent.</description>
