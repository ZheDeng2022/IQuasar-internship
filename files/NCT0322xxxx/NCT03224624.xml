  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is the most common medical problem among US Veterans. Treatment is available and&#xD;
      effective, but control rates remain under 75%. While blood pressure control has traditionally&#xD;
      been achieved through sequential visits and medication changes initiated by providers during&#xD;
      office-based care, self-monitoring and self-management of blood pressure medication is an&#xD;
      important strategy that would empower Veterans to achieve better control of blood pressure.&#xD;
      The health impacts of better systems for treatment of hypertension are significant, including&#xD;
      decreased rates of cardiovascular and kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This two-site clinical trial will randomize 400 Veterans to either usual blood pressure care&#xD;
      or a self-management strategy in which patient-driven self-management of blood pressure&#xD;
      medications will be taught and used over the course of 1 year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Project background: Recent literature from the UK (TASMIN2 and TASMIN-SR trials) have&#xD;
      suggested that patient-driven self-management of blood pressure medications can be effective&#xD;
      in achieving hypertension control, but questions remain as to how to apply these findings to&#xD;
      a US population. The VA Healthcare System is an ideal system in which to test and customize&#xD;
      this strategy for blood pressure treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is patient-initiated self-management of blood pressure medication using a pre-specified,&#xD;
      generalizable dose escalation scheme clinically effective, safe, and acceptable to patients&#xD;
      and clinicians, compared to usual care in controlling blood pressure in hypertensive&#xD;
      Veterans? Project methods: The investigators propose a 12-month randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      non-blinded, single-center study of patient-initiated self-management of blood pressure&#xD;
      medication vs. usual care with planned post study cohort follow-up via medical records.&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention arm will be provided with home blood pressure monitoring&#xD;
      tools and a self-management algorithm for changing their blood pressure medications as&#xD;
      needed. Participants in the usual care arm will receive home monitoring tools and typical&#xD;
      hypertension care from the primary care provider. The primary blood pressure outcome measure&#xD;
      for the study will be between-group change in in-clinic blood pressure. Acceptability,&#xD;
      safety, patient-centered outcomes and adherence will be key secondary outcomes&#xD;
