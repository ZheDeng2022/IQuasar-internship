  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, the introduction of quadripolar left ventricular leads (one with four pacing poles)&#xD;
      has allowed the opportunity to pace the lateral (back) of the heart from several points at&#xD;
      once using a single lead (multi-point pacing - MPP). Although it seems logical that&#xD;
      electrical beginning at several points on the left ventricular wall should improve&#xD;
      coordination of the heart, there is no consistent response in terms of improved remodeling&#xD;
      (cardiac structure and function) or composite scores of patient-related status. The&#xD;
      technology has a further disadvantage that it leads to accelerated battery drain, with on&#xD;
      average one year less longevity over the lifetime of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to explore the effect of MPP on the force-frequency relationship,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to examine the effects of MPP on exercise capacity measured by treadmill walk time and&#xD;
           whether these are related to the FFR response to MPP in individual patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. establish whether the acute contractile response is maintained to 6 months after the&#xD;
           implant procedure and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. determine whether the acute contractile response to MPP is associated with subsequent&#xD;
           beneficial remodeling over a further six months.&#xD;

      Cardiac function during exercise Cardiac output is a function of stroke volume (the volume of&#xD;
      blood ejected with each beat) and heart rate. During exercise cardiac output must rise to&#xD;
      supply exercising muscles. This occurs by an increase in both heart rate and stroke volume.&#xD;
      Limitations to heart rate rise (chronotropic incompetence (CI)) or stroke volume increases&#xD;
      (contractility) or a combination of both might contribute to lower cardiac output during&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increases in contractility during exercise are under two major influences:&#xD;
      depolarization-rate dependent (heart rate dependent), and catecholamine-dependent. Normal&#xD;
      increases in contractility during exercise require both to be functioning normally. As&#xD;
      mentioned, the catecholamine system is chronically overactive in CHF such that there is&#xD;
      down-regulation of receptors making the sympathetic system less sensitive and responsive. The&#xD;
      depolarization-rate dependent (catecholamine-independent) mechanism, whereby increases in&#xD;
      heart rate lead to increases in the force of contraction known as the Treppe phenomenon, or&#xD;
      the force frequency relationship (FFR), was described by Bowditch in the late 19th century,&#xD;
      and is thought to be impaired in CHF such that contractility in heart failure does not rise&#xD;
      normally with increases in heart rate and in fact reduces once heart rate rises above a&#xD;
      threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How to determine force-frequency relationship in humans&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have established a reliable, reproducible and non-invasive method by which&#xD;
      to assess the FFR in patients with pacemaker devices. The investigators subsequently&#xD;
      demonstrated that optimizing heart rate rise to within the range for optimal contractility is&#xD;
      associated with acute improvements in exercise capacity. The FFR assessment protocol is&#xD;
      described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first stage, 50 patients undergoing cardiac resynchronisation therapy will be&#xD;
      invited, to participate in an observational, double-blind, randomised cross-over study&#xD;
      exploring the acute effects of multi-point pacing (MPP) on the force frequency relationship&#xD;
      and exercise capacity at around 6 weeks and 6 months following the implant. The plan is not&#xD;
      to explore whether MPP improves remodeling following a CRT implant so MPP will be programmed&#xD;
      off during the first 6 months after implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the first six months, if there are promising results from the first stage,&#xD;
      participants will then randomly be allocated to MPP on or off in a double-blind parallel&#xD;
      group study. After a further 6 months (12 months after the initial implant) they will return&#xD;
      for a single visit during which they will have an echocardiogram and exercise test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six weeks following device implant (phase 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, participants will undergo a pacemaker check, a review of medications and&#xD;
      other medical history. They will sign a consent form. They will then undergo a resting&#xD;
      echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this, their pacemaker will be randomly programmed to MPP or usual pacing.&#xD;
      Programming will be performed by a secondary (unblinded) cardiac physiologist, who will also&#xD;
      be responsible for watching the electrocardiogram during each test. Patients and the primary&#xD;
      cardiac physiologist undertaking the echocardiogram will be unaware of allocation. Images&#xD;
      will be collected at rest following which atrial pacing will be initiated in the DDD-mode at&#xD;
      50 beats/min (or the next highest 'round figure' above the baseline heart rate). After four&#xD;
      minutes, images will be recorded, and the pacing rate will then be increased in a stepwise&#xD;
      20-beat interval with images recorded after every four minutes. This step-wise increase will&#xD;
      be repeated until the maximum predicted heart rate as per the calculation by Astrand&#xD;
      (220-age) is reached. At this point peak data will be collected and pacing will then return&#xD;
      to baseline settings. Throughout this assessment, at each stage a blood pressure will be&#xD;
      recorded to allow the calculation of the force frequency relationship. Five minutes after the&#xD;
      end of atrial pacing, a final set of images and a blood pressure will be recorded. Angina&#xD;
      pectoris at any point during these tests will be an indication that the test needs to be&#xD;
      stopped and the heart rate will be allowed to return to normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This assessment will be undertaken twice during this first visit, once with MPP on and once&#xD;
      with MPP off in random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following these echocardiographic assessments (which will occur at rest on the echo couch),&#xD;
      patients will undergo a peak walk test on the treadmill during which peak oxygen consumption&#xD;
      (a cardiopulmonary exercise test) will be assessed. Prior to this test, the pacemaker heart&#xD;
      rate programming will be optimised in line with previous data, and MPP will be either&#xD;
      activated or left off in random order with allocation carried out in a double-blind fashion.&#xD;
      Participants will be invited back at one week (7 weeks after the implant procedure) for a&#xD;
      second exercise test for the second arm (MPP off or on).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Images will be stored for offline analysis and governance purposes. Pacemaker devices will be&#xD;
      set to usual programming modes at the end of each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months after the device implant:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At around 6 months after the initial implant, the above protocol will be repeated with two&#xD;
      echocardiograms and one exercise test at the first visit and one exercise test one week&#xD;
      later. At one of these 6-month visits, patients will be asked to complete two quality of&#xD;
      questionnaires (Minnestoa Living with Heart Failure and the EQ5D-5L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term assessment (phase 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      At six months, patients will be invited to continue into a second stage during which MPP will&#xD;
      be randomly programmed on or left off. This will be a double-blind, randomised, parallel&#xD;
      cohort study. Participants will come back at a further 6 months (12 months after implant) for&#xD;
      a final visit which will include echocardiography and a treadmill test and also complete the&#xD;
      two quality of life questionnaires. At this point, unless there is clear evidence of benefit&#xD;
      of MPP, we will decide to turn off this programming mode in those that were randomised to&#xD;
      'MPP-on', or on in those randomised to 'MPP-off'. This will be based upon individual&#xD;
      assessment until the results of the entire study are known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis plan A measure of contractility will be collected at each heart rate interval.&#xD;
      These can be plotted against heart rate for each patient to achieve three novel variables per&#xD;
      patient (peak contractility, heart rate for peak contractility and the slope of the FFR). The&#xD;
      study aims to determine whether these three variables change over time following CRT&#xD;
      implantation, and whether they are influenced by MPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These comparison projects and the randomised placebo-controlled trial are exploratory and&#xD;
      feasibility studies respectively. The sample size for the former will be reviewed after the&#xD;
      first 10 patients are enrolled.&#xD;
