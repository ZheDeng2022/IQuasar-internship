    <textblock>
      Diabetes is arguably the most urgent healthcare challenge of the 21st century. Poor adherence&#xD;
      to insulin regimens is reported in up to two-third of patients with diabetes; thus it is&#xD;
      important to identify patients at risk and to develop strategies and tools to increase&#xD;
      adherence to prescribed insulin regimens. This study will evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      Insulclock® - small electronic device to help track date, time and dosage of the last&#xD;
      injection, type of insulin used and temperature, with an alarm system to prevent insulin&#xD;
      omissions and mistiming. The Insulclock's real time memory and alert system are likely to&#xD;
      improve treatment adherence, patient's satisfaction, and quality of life measures, which may&#xD;
      improve glycemic control in insulin treated patients with Type 2 Diabetes.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQc-change) Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The amplitude of the score on the DTSQc gives the degree of change in satisfaction while the direction (positive or negative) will provide guidance on the preference of one device over the other. DTSQc contains eight items scored on 7-point scales; scores range from +3 = much more satisfied now to -3 = much less satisfied now, with 0 (midpoint), representing no change.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diabetes Related Quality of Life (DRQoL) Scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DRQoL is a composite score, consisting of a standardized and unweighted Insulin Treatment Experience Questionnaire Score (ITEQ), and Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) questionnaire score. ITEQ includes 7 domains: leisure activities (4 items), psychological barriers (2 items), handling (5 items), diabetes control (6 items), dependence (5 items), weight control (3 items), sleep (2 items); + 1 additional item assigned to assess overall satisfaction with current insulin therapy regimen. The PAID contains 20 items that describe negative emotions related to diabetes commonly experienced by patients with diabetes. Each question has five possible answers with a value from 0 to 4, with 0 representing &quot;no problem&quot; and 4 &quot;a serious problem&quot;. The scores are added up and multiplied by 1.25, generating a total score between 0 - 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mean HbA1c.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the three-month average plasma glucose concentration. The test is limited to a three-month average because the lifespan of a red blood cell is four months (120 days). Change in mean HbA1cas will be measure and recorded to monitor glycemic control.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Episodes of Severe Hypoglycemia.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 through week 24.</time_frame>
    <description>Number of episodes of severe hypoglycemia will be recorded.Severe hypoglycemia is defined as episodes necessitating assistance and associated with measured plasma glucose &lt; 40 mg/dl (2.2 mmol/L), or with prompt recovery after administration of carbohydrates, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>The study consented 121 participants. The study team realized that changes needed to be done for the protocol to be efficient. The first 28 candidates were consented for &quot;pilot&quot; data, ten of them were screen failures, 18 were randomized. Data on Insulclock device malfunctions were collected, it was planned to improve all issues by the time the main phase of the study started. 93 subjects were consented for the main study, 13 were screen failures, and 80 subjects were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The amplitude of the score on the DTSQc gives the degree of change in satisfaction while the direction (positive or negative) will provide guidance on the preference of one device over the other. DTSQc contains eight items scored on 7-point scales; scores range from +3 = much more satisfied now to -3 = much less satisfied now, with 0 (midpoint), representing no change.</description>

          <title>Change in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQc-change) Score.</title>
          <description>The amplitude of the score on the DTSQc gives the degree of change in satisfaction while the direction (positive or negative) will provide guidance on the preference of one device over the other. DTSQc contains eight items scored on 7-point scales; scores range from +3 = much more satisfied now to -3 = much less satisfied now, with 0 (midpoint), representing no change.</description>

        <title>Change in Diabetes Related Quality of Life (DRQoL) Scores.</title>
        <description>DRQoL is a composite score, consisting of a standardized and unweighted Insulin Treatment Experience Questionnaire Score (ITEQ), and Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) questionnaire score. ITEQ includes 7 domains: leisure activities (4 items), psychological barriers (2 items), handling (5 items), diabetes control (6 items), dependence (5 items), weight control (3 items), sleep (2 items); + 1 additional item assigned to assess overall satisfaction with current insulin therapy regimen. The PAID contains 20 items that describe negative emotions related to diabetes commonly experienced by patients with diabetes. Each question has five possible answers with a value from 0 to 4, with 0 representing &quot;no problem&quot; and 4 &quot;a serious problem&quot;. The scores are added up and multiplied by 1.25, generating a total score between 0 - 100.</description>

        <population>The questionnaire was considered originally for use in the study, but no replies were received in a timely manner from the companies in charge of providing licensing for it. Therefore, data was not collected.</population>
