      To compare the efficacies of MTA, calcium hydroxide preparation, Biodentine and TheraCal LC&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the importance of deciduous teeth and the hazards of caries in deciduous&#xD;
      teeth have gradually attracted the attention of professionals and parents of children. The&#xD;
      dental pulp disease and periapical disease of deciduous teeth are the main and important&#xD;
      factors that cause deciduous teeth defects, deciduous dentition and mixed dentition deletion,&#xD;
      which have a serious impact on the physical and mental health of children from the local or&#xD;
      systemic aspects. From the point of view of children's stomatology, according to the&#xD;
      principle of treatment of dental caries of deciduous teeth, vital pulp preservation should be&#xD;
      selected in patients with deep caries and reversible pulpitis; This concept has been carried&#xD;
      forward especially after the advent of new materials with good biocompatibility and good edge&#xD;
      sealing. After judging the existing state of the affected teeth (such as deep caries or&#xD;
      reversible pulpitis) and removal of caries, indirect pulp capping, direct pulp capping, and&#xD;
      vital pulpotomy can be correspondingly selected. Complete healthy pulp can be preserved in&#xD;
      indirect pulp capping and direct pulp capping. During vital pulpotomy, coronal pulp due to&#xD;
      infection induced by various causes is removed, and healthy root pulp is retained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The success of the preservation of vital pulp in carious deciduous teeth depends not only on&#xD;
      determining the health status of the pulp, but also on selecting the most suitable pulp&#xD;
      capping agent. No matter the use of calcium hydroxide and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) or&#xD;
      new biomaterials, controlling pulp inflammation and preserving healthy pulp are the keys to&#xD;
      successful treatment. The clinical reality is that it is not easy to determine the state of&#xD;
      the pulp accurately because of the child's feelings of pain and the unreliability of the&#xD;
      description. Thus, the secondary treatment can be easily produced after treatment. For&#xD;
      example, pulp re-infection requires dental pulp extraction; or severe infection results in&#xD;
      removal of the affected teeth and space maintenance. In the face of this reality, many&#xD;
      clinicians will advise parents to select dental pulp extraction for deciduous teeth at the&#xD;
      first visit. If there is a reliable clinical pathway for the preservation of the vital pulp&#xD;
      of the carious deciduous teeth, the doctor will put aside his worries. Therefore, this study&#xD;
      is designed to find a suitable clinical pathway and to increase the success rate of the&#xD;
      preservation of the vital pulp of carious deciduous teeth. The key to solving this problem&#xD;
      lies in the selection of suitable pulp capping agent, as well as the repair method of the&#xD;
      crown selection to obtain a better edge sealing. Numerous studies have confirmed that crown&#xD;
      repair of deciduous teeth can obtain better edge sealing on the basis of obtaining the&#xD;
      largest degree of morphological restoration. The difficulty and key point are to select the&#xD;
      best biomaterials as the pulp capping agents for the preservation of vital pulp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will select classical and new biomaterials for the preservation of vital&#xD;
      pulp and compare them so as to select a pulp capping agent with high success rate. With the&#xD;
      further research of biomedical ceramic materials, such as restorative material for pulposis&#xD;
      Bioaggregate and restorative material to dentin Biodentine, the biocompatibility of such&#xD;
      materials allows the destructed dental pulp tissue to be reconstructed. Shayegan et al.&#xD;
      performed vital pulpotomy for pigs using Biodentine, white MTA and formaldehyde cresol as&#xD;
      pulp capping agents, and using Biodentine, white MTA and calcium hydroxide as direct pulp&#xD;
      capping, and observed the response to dental pulp tissue. They concluded that Biodentine and&#xD;
      white MTA have the same biocompatibility, and they are suitable for the pulp capping material&#xD;
      of porcine deciduous teeth. In recent years, TheraCal LC has emerged as a new type of pulp&#xD;
      capping agent. Some scholars believed that both MTA and TheraCal are good indirect pulp&#xD;
      capping materials. TheraCal has better operability and similar chemical property as MTA. In&#xD;
      the indirect pulp capping treatment of deciduous teeth, TheraCal can be a successful&#xD;
      alternative to MTA. Nevertheless, TheraCal is rarely used in direct pulp capping, and vital&#xD;
      pulpotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, this study will select Biodentine and TheraCal, verify their efficacies, and&#xD;
      explore their superiorities. Calcium hydroxide and MTA will be selected as controls, which&#xD;
      will be separately used in indirect pulp capping, direct pulp capping, and vital pulpotomy to&#xD;
      provide reliable choices for clinicians.&#xD;
