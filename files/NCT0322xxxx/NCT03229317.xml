  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early lung function deficits represent a significant risk factor for the evolution toward&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease later in life. Prematurity and in utero tobacco smoke&#xD;
      exposure are already known to predispose children to develop a non-reversible obstructive&#xD;
      ventilatory defect in adulthood. The role of vitamin D status during pregnancy is less&#xD;
      certain. In humans, low vitamin D concentrations during pregnancy are associated to an&#xD;
      increased risk of asthma in children. In murine models, low vitamin D concentrations during&#xD;
      pregnancy are associated to structural abnormalities of the airways in mouse pups.&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesized that vitamin D play a role in early airways development, from the&#xD;
      first trimester of pregnancy. To bring arguments to this hypothesis, the investigators will&#xD;
      study the association of airway resistance in children aged 5 to 6 years old with the&#xD;
      concentration of vitamin D during the first trimester of pregnancy in their mothers.&#xD;

      Children aged 5 to 6 years old will be included from the FEPED cohort. The FEPED cohort is a&#xD;
      cohort of French pregnant women designed to study the association between vitamin D status&#xD;
      during pregnancy and the risk of pre-eclampsia. Vitamin D concentration at first and third&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy as well as in cord blood is available for 1400 women. Investigators&#xD;
      will include 200 children born from these women. Children will undergo lung function tests&#xD;
      and prick-tests and parents will answer the ISAAC questionnaire that is a standardised&#xD;
      questionnaire designed to evaluate asthma and rhinitis symptoms. The main outcome of this&#xD;
      study will be specific airway resistance. The investigators will look for an association&#xD;
      between specific airway resistance and vitamin D concentration measured during the first&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy in their mothers.&#xD;
