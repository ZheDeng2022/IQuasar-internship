    <textblock>
      Microvascular complications are a major complication of diabetes.Diabetic microvascular&#xD;
      complications can not only lead to chronic kidney disease and retinopathy, but also affect&#xD;
      the quality of life of patients with diabetic nephropathy, which can lead to the death of&#xD;
      diabetic patients.Due to diabetes patient survival for decades, in spite of more than 90% of&#xD;
      time is a life outside the hospital, so the analysis of the effect of outside risk factors&#xD;
      for complications of hospital and progress, and to find effective intervention measures is of&#xD;
      great significance for the prevention and control of diabetic microvascular&#xD;
      complications.Therefore, we use of advanced Internet technology, and analysis of large data&#xD;
      algorithms, and try to keep track of routine indicators such as the patient's urine in real&#xD;
      time in patients' families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This topic mainly observe movement (step 6000 steps per day or 6000 / week) in patients with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetic kidney disease microvascular end point events, provide the basis for&#xD;
      prevention and control of diabetes kidney complications, clinical significance and treatment&#xD;
      prospects.&#xD;

      Research target:To explore exercise intervention in patients with diabetic nephropathy&#xD;
      (intervention time for 3 years), the events in the primary end point was observed (double&#xD;
      serum creatinine, ESRD dialysis) and secondary events (reduced urinary protein and&#xD;
      retinopathy progression, cardiovascular events, and cerebrovascular events for all-cause&#xD;
      mortality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major technical programmes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research object:Clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetic nephropathy patients. The inclusion&#xD;
      criteria: Clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetic nephropathy patients.Many years history of&#xD;
      diabetes, urinary albumin excretion rate of more than 30-300 mg/L, eye exams have diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy, routine urine without red blood cells, double renal morphologic examination&#xD;
      being normal, and excludes the other secondary kidney disease. Age 18-75. Willing to&#xD;
      participate in this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Type 1 diabetes, with other systemic diseases such as cancer, liver&#xD;
      function damage, severe edema, cardiac insufficiency (grade 3, 4, cardiac function disorder),&#xD;
      serious lung disease caused by respiratory insufficiency, pregnancy and lactation women, and&#xD;
      could not walk and did not sign the informed consent of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimate the sample size: In this study, the incidence of the combined endpoint was 40% in&#xD;
      the untreated group, 30% in the treatment group, 10% in the treatment group and 80% in the&#xD;
      control group, and 0.05 in bilateral statistical level. The above formulations are calculated&#xD;
      by each group of 112 cases; Therefore, the sample size of this study is 120 cases per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corhort study: Exercise group (walking 6000 steps or more than 40,000 steps on foot),&#xD;
      non-exercise group (walking 6000 steps or less than 40,000 steps on foot).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up examization: Check the routine of morning urine daily, and check the blood sugar,&#xD;
      HbA1c, fasting insulin level, kidney function, liver function, electrolyte, blood routine,&#xD;
      blood c-reactive protein and blood type B natriuretic peptide per quarter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney endpoint event: The blood creatinine was doubled on baseline, or the eGFR was assessed&#xD;
      for end-stage renal disease and required dialysis or transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular endpoint event: During the observation, cardiac failure and acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction were defined as cardiac endpoints Cerebrovascular endpoint event: Hospitalization&#xD;
      of cerebral stroke or cerebral hemorrhage is defined as the end of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinal progression: The severity of retinopathy was analyzed based on the fundus&#xD;
      photographs, according to Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)(1. Benefits of&#xD;
      Renin-Angiotensin Blockade on Retinopathy in Type 1 Diabetes Vary With Glycemic Control.&#xD;
      Diabetes Care 2011; 34:1838-1842ã€‚2. Renal and Retinal Effects of Enalapril and Losartan in&#xD;
      Type 1 Diabetes. N Eng J Med 2009; 361:40-51).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse reactions: The adverse reactions of the movement include collapse, body weakness and&#xD;
      muscle soreness are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internet web system: The urine is monitored outside the general hospital, and The patient&#xD;
      urine routine test results were tracked in real time by the external follow-up system of&#xD;
      subekang internet web system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitor steps:Add patients' buddy feature to WeChat to add the WeChat movement public number&#xD;
      to see the number of steps on the WeChat public number.&#xD;
