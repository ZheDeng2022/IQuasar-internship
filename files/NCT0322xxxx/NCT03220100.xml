  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a new way to provide palliative care to patients who have&#xD;
      recently been diagnosed with lung cancer. . Palliative care is a medical specialty focused on&#xD;
      lessening (or &quot;palliating&quot;) patients' symptoms and helping patients and their families cope&#xD;
      with a serious illness.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with serious cancers, like advanced lung cancer, often experience physical symptoms,&#xD;
      such as pain or shortness of breath. Both patients and their families often feel worried&#xD;
      and/or sad about this diagnosis. Research has shown that early involvement of a team of&#xD;
      clinicians that specialize in lessening (or palliating) many of these distressing physical&#xD;
      and emotional symptoms, and in helping patients and their families' cope with serious&#xD;
      illnesses, improves patients' quality of life and mood, and can help their loved ones' feel&#xD;
      less depressed or sad. This team is called &quot;palliative care,&quot; and consists of physicians and&#xD;
      advanced practice nurses who work closely and collaboratively with the oncology team to care&#xD;
      for the patient and their loved ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the investigators know having palliative care clinicians care for patients along with&#xD;
      their oncology team is helpful for the participant and their loved ones, the investigators do&#xD;
      not know the optimal timing of the visits with palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if the investigators can closely monitor participants'&#xD;
      health condition and quality of life and use these metrics as indications of when the&#xD;
      participant should see the palliative care team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will monitor participants' health condition and schedule the participant to see&#xD;
      the palliative care team if the participants' cancer grows or after the participant have been&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital. The investigators will also monitor participants' quality of life&#xD;
      every six weeks and schedule the participant to see the palliative care monthly if the&#xD;
      participant quality of life decreases during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also monitor participants' mood, coping, and understanding of the participant&#xD;
      illness and prognosis. The investigators will ask the participant to fill out questionnaires&#xD;
      asking about these topics every 12 weeks. The participant will be able to complete these&#xD;
      questionnaires in clinic, via email, using a mailed paper copy, or over the phone with a&#xD;
      member of the research team.&#xD;
