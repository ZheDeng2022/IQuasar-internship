      Title of the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory study to inventory opportunities to optimize continuity of pharmacotherapy at&#xD;
      hospital discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study area:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care region Leuven (individual interviews), care region Bruges (individual interviews) and&#xD;
      care region Mortsel (One focus group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From an explorative angle, the study aims to identify hurdles, barriers, facilitators and&#xD;
      needs that general practitioners and community pharmacists experience with patients who have&#xD;
      recently been discharged from a hospital. From a feasibility standpoint, the study aims to&#xD;
      investigate what supportive actions are feasible and useful to optimize the care process upon&#xD;
      hospital discharge. For this purpose, a discharge document for the community pharmacist will&#xD;
      be shown to the healthcare professionals. The HCP will be given the opportunity to give&#xD;
      feedback on this document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-interventional, qualitative study is set up using face-to-face, semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews and a focus group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community pharmacists and general practitioners that are employed in the study region and&#xD;
      that are considered opinion leaders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of health care professionals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual interviews will be organised until there is saturation of information and no new&#xD;
      elements are provided in the interviews. At least five community pharmacists and five general&#xD;
      practitioners will be interviewed per care region. In addition, a focus group will take place&#xD;
      in care region Mortsel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon an informed consent of the healthcare professional, a semi-structured face-to-face&#xD;
      interview will take place. The interview will focus on concrete patient cases, provided by&#xD;
      the healthcare professional, as well as a fictional case of the researcher. In the focus&#xD;
      group, data of the individual interviews will be presented and the relevance and completeness&#xD;
      of the information will be assessed. Finally, the aim of the focus group is to reach a&#xD;
      consensus on the research questions.&#xD;
