      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoma is a cancer of white blood cells found in the lymph nodes. It affects the&#xD;
      system that fights infections and disease. Researchers want to learn how certain drugs work&#xD;
      together to treat B-cell lymphomas. The drugs are venetoclax, ibrutinib, prednisone,&#xD;
      obinutuzumab, and lenalidomide (ViPOR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the safety of ViPOR for people with B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with B-cell lymphoma whose cancer has returned or not improved after&#xD;
      treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue sample from previous procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registration for counseling on the risks of lenalidomide. They must get counseling at&#xD;
           least every 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a bone marrow aspiration before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have tumor samples taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get ViPOR in 21-day cycles. For up to 6 cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will get one drug by IV on days 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take the other four drugs by mouth on most days. After their first&#xD;
           dose of venetoclax, they will stay in the clinic for at least 8 hours and return the&#xD;
           next day for monitoring. They may be admitted for more drugs or monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a drug diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a physical exam and blood and urine tests at least once per cycle.&#xD;
      They will have scans 4 times over 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a visit about 1 month after their last dose of study drug. They will&#xD;
      then have visits every few months for 3 years, and once a year for years 4 and 5. Visits&#xD;
      include a physical exam, blood tests, and scans.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination chemotherapy with Rituximab has been the mainstay of treatment for CD20-positive&#xD;
      B-cell lymphomas&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant advances have been made in curing aggressive B-cell lymphomas with&#xD;
      chemoimmunotherapy but indolent lymphomas and relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphomas remain&#xD;
      mostly incurable with chemotherapy alone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted therapies aimed at disrupting key survival pathways in lymphoid malignancies are&#xD;
      emerging and showing significant activity in NHL in both the relapsed and first-line settings&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanistically-based combinations of targeted agents are likely to benefit patients who&#xD;
      cannot tolerate or who relapse after or are refractory to standard chemoimmunotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      ViPOR targets major survival pathways in B-cell lymphomas including BCL-2 (apoptosis); BTK&#xD;
      (B-cell receptor signaling and NFKB); Cereblon (NFKB) and CD20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the safety and toxicity profile&#xD;
      of the combination of Venetoclax, Ibrutinib, Prednisone, Obinutuzumab and Revlimid (ViPOR) in&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: To determine the overall response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) rate of&#xD;
      ViPOR in relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women and men greater than or equal 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 2 [JS([1]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed and/or refractory B-cell lymphoma,&#xD;
      excluding CLL/SLL. NOTE: untreated and relapsed and/or refraactory MCL are included in the&#xD;
      phase 2 MCL expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate organ function unless dysfunction secondary to lymphoma effect&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label, single-center, non-randomized phase 1b/2 study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b: Standard 3 + 3 design will be used to determine the MTD of dose-escalated&#xD;
      venetoclax with fixed dose ibrutinib, prednisone, obinutuzumab and Revlimid (ViPOR) in&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Expansion cohorts of aggressive and indolent non-MCL patients and MCL patients will&#xD;
      be treated at the MTD to determine the ORR and CR rate in these subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum 6 cycles of combination targeted therapy every 21 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore all dose levels in both non-MCL and MCL patient cohorts in the phase 1b study, and&#xD;
      to assess the ORR and CR rate in aggressive and indolent non-MCL and MCL patient cohorts in a&#xD;
      phase 2 dose expansion at the MTD, the accrual ceiling will be set at 130 patients.&#xD;

                  with creatinine levels above 2 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cr Cl will be calculated with the use of the 24-hour creatinine clearance or modified&#xD;
        Cockcroft-Gault equation (eCCR; with the use of ideal body mass [IBM] instead of mass):&#xD;
&#xD;
        (140 Age) x IBM (kg) x [0.85 if female]/ 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        *RBC transfusions and use of G-CSF will be allowed in order to meet eligibility parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immune-modulating drugs (IMiDs) including Revlimid are known to be teratogenic and&#xD;
             potential embryo-fetal harm can be seen with use of venetoclax and ibrutinib. The&#xD;
             effects of obinutuzumab on the developing human fetus is unknown. For these reasons,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception as&#xD;
             described below. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she&#xD;
             or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
             physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women of childbearing potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a&#xD;
                  contraceptive method with a failure rate of 1% per year as outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or&#xD;
                  urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10 14 days&#xD;
                  and again within 24 hours prior to prescribing Revlimid for Cycle 1&#xD;
                  (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days as required by Revlimid REMSTM) and&#xD;
                  must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin&#xD;
                  TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one&#xD;
                  additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts&#xD;
                  taking Revlimid. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal,&#xD;
                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (greater than or equal to 12 continuous&#xD;
                  months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not&#xD;
                  undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of less than 1% per year&#xD;
                  include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives&#xD;
                  that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper&#xD;
                  intrauterine devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For men:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;
                  contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined&#xD;
                  below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or use&#xD;
                  a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a&#xD;
                  failure rate of less than 1% per year as noted below. Men must refrain from&#xD;
                  donating sperm during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  With pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom as noted&#xD;
                  below to avoid exposing the embryo.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients requiring the use of warfarin are excluded because of potential&#xD;
                  drug-drug interactions that may potentially increase the exposure of warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;

        medication used, whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to the following that may&#xD;
             limit interpretation of results or that could increase risk to the patient at the&#xD;
             discretion of the investigator:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
                  arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled and/or symptomatic thyroid disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic, or other&#xD;
                  infection (excluding fungal infections of nail beds) at study enrollment, or any&#xD;
                  major episode of infection requiring treatment with IV antibiotics or&#xD;
                  hospitalization (relating to the completion of the course of antibiotics) within&#xD;
                  2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known infection with human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other&#xD;
                  hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis; as well as active infection with&#xD;
                  HBV or HCV:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients who are positive for HCV antibody must be negative for HCV by&#xD;
                       polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to be eligible for study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients with occult or prior HBV infection (defined as positive total&#xD;
                       hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb] and negative HBsAg) may be included if HBV&#xD;
                       DNA is undetectable. These patients must be willing to undergo monthly DNA&#xD;
                       testing during treatment and for at least 12 months after completion of&#xD;
                       study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Malabsorption syndrome or other condition that precludes enteral route of&#xD;
                  administration&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women, or women who intent to become pregnant during the study, are excluded&#xD;
             from this study because Revlimid has known teratogenic effects and venetoclax,&#xD;
             ibrutinib and obinutuzumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
             interactions with venetoclax, ibrutinib and Revlimid and combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in&#xD;
             patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active tumor lysis syndrome based on laboratory assessment&#xD;
&#xD;

             interpretation of results&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with a history of curatively treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma or&#xD;
                  stage 1 melanoma of the skin as well as any in situ carcinoma are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with a malignancy that has been treated with curative intent will also&#xD;
                  be eligible. Individuals in documented remission without treatment for greater&#xD;
                  than or equal to 2 years prior to enrollment may be included at the discretion of&#xD;
                  the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to both xanthine oxidase inhibitors and rasburicase; or, known&#xD;
             hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs&#xD;
