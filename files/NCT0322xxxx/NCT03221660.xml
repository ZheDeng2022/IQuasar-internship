    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of F-Composite 2 system&#xD;
      in Class I and Class II cavities in permanent teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The materials of the system can be polymerized in short time with a curing light which is&#xD;
      part of the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out as a prospective study, with evaluation of the restorations&#xD;
      after 7-10 days (baseline), at 6 months, at 12 months, at 24 months and 60 months according&#xD;
      to defined criteria.&#xD;

    <description>The postoperative sensitivity is assessed by tests with thermal stimuli and occlusal forces (during biting) determined by VAS (Visual Analog Scale, from 0 &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 &quot;maximum pain&quot;) following the FDI criteria on a scale from 1 &quot;very good&quot; to 5 &quot;unacceptable&quot;.&#xD;
A maximum of 10% postoperative hypersensitivities are defined as acceptable after one month.</description>

    <measure>Number of Restored Teeth With Loss of Vitality</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The loss of vitality of restored teeth is assessed by a cold stimuli test (cotton pellet and refrigerating spray) following the FDI criteria on a scale from 1 &quot;very good&quot; to 5 &quot;unacceptable&quot;.&#xD;
A maximum of 1 tooth with loss of vitality within 12 months is determined to be acceptable.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Restored Teeth With Postoperative Sensitivity</title>
          <description>The postoperative sensitivity is assessed by tests with thermal stimuli and occlusal forces (during biting) determined by VAS (Visual Analog Scale, from 0 &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 &quot;maximum pain&quot;) following the FDI criteria on a scale from 1 &quot;very good&quot; to 5 &quot;unacceptable&quot;.&#xD;
A maximum of 10% postoperative hypersensitivities are defined as acceptable after one month.</description>
