  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The need for non-invasive, non-pharmacological and cost-effective therapeutic options has&#xD;
      revived the use of transcranial current stimulation, either direct (tDCS) or alternating&#xD;
      (tACS), in a wide range of pathologies and cognitive disturbances. Results, although often&#xD;
      promising, are not unequivocal, possibly due to different stimulation parameters and sites,&#xD;
      or non-homogenous patient selection. tDCS has been widely applied but few studies have&#xD;
      focused on tACS which has the advantage of potentially entraining brain oscillations at the&#xD;
      same frequency of stimulation. This overcomes the basic mechanism of tDCS which deploys&#xD;
      anodal or cathodal currents to broadly excite or inhibit supposedly dysfunctional underlying&#xD;
      cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether a stimulation paradigm based on sound neurophysiological markers could provide a&#xD;
      better and longer-lasting clinical outcome has not yet been ascertained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to establish, with a trans-disease approach, categories characterized&#xD;
      by defective EEG oscillatory activity and related dysfunctional networks. This&#xD;
      classification, expected as the result of the first stage of this project, will guide the&#xD;
      stimulation paradigm: categories with a pathologically low-band EEG prevalence will be&#xD;
      treated with high-frequency tACS, and vice-versa, while the stimulation site will correspond&#xD;
      to the defective sites of pathological EEG band maps. Parkinson's disease (PD), the EEG&#xD;
      marker of which is a shift towards fast frequencies, and neuropathic pain (NP), with an EEG&#xD;
      prevalence of slow bands, will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to categorize pathologies on the basis of their EEG frequencies, EEG power spectrums&#xD;
      will be derived from resting EEG, and cortical oscillatory reactivity will be assessed by&#xD;
      EEG-TMS (electroencephalographic-Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) co-registration. This&#xD;
      method appears to elicit state-dependent brain oscillatory response and is expected to&#xD;
      support power spectrum data. The identified prevailing EEG band will be used subsequently to&#xD;
      reconstruct scalp EEG band distribution. tACS paradigms will be tailored according to these&#xD;
      findings: the anode will be placed over the scalp area corresponding to the dysfunctional&#xD;
      rhythm and frequency will be set in order to correct the prevailing EEG band (slow&#xD;
      stimulation if fast frequencies prevail, and vice-versa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translational element of this research proposal will consist of its clinical application&#xD;
      in day-to-day practice for the benefit of people with the target conditions. The&#xD;
      patient-groups, after undergoing the neurophysiology studies, will be tested with&#xD;
      disease-specific scales and a neuropsychological battery. A 2-weeks tACS, either real or&#xD;
      active sham, protocol will then be performed (30 minutes/day, 5 days/week), associated with&#xD;
      an ad hoc rehabilitation protocol (60 minutes/day 5 days/week). During the last day of&#xD;
      stimulation, patients will be tested again with the disease specific scales,&#xD;
      neuropsychological battery and standard EEG to detect EEG frequencies modifications. At&#xD;
      4-weeks follow up, the same tests and EEG recording will be carried out, to assess the&#xD;
      persistence of after-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected result is a valid, non-invasive and cost-effective stimulation paradigm based on&#xD;
      sound neurophysiologic markers which transcend traditional disease classifications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      tDCS has been applied to a spectrum of diseases, including depression, Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD), dementia and others, on the basis of the concept of dysfunctional brain areas:&#xD;
      modulating the hypo-or hyper-function of the indicated brain regions via anodal or cathodal&#xD;
      tDCS has shown evidence of clinical symptom improvement, although generally short lasting and&#xD;
      often with discordant results among studies. Conversely, tACS has only rarely been applied to&#xD;
      people with disease, with discordant results. Its application to healthy individuals to boost&#xD;
      sleep and sleep-related memory formation and working memory has, however, been shown to be&#xD;
      effective. If consensus on stimulation patterns (continuous vs. alternating) is, however,&#xD;
      lacking, the same holds true for frequencies, although evidence from computational and animal&#xD;
      studies demonstrates that tACS is very effective at entraining the network at the frequency&#xD;
      of the applied stimulation, with theta noticeably efficacious at improving cognitive&#xD;
      performances in memory tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether a different paradigm, tailored to specific neurophysiological signatures, and not to&#xD;
      the phenotype of the underlying dysfunction (i.e. applying inhibitory tDCS on the&#xD;
      hyperfunctioning cortical area of a given disease or vice-versa), could lead to better and&#xD;
      long-lasting clinical results is not yet defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this proposed study has two fundamental questions: 1) is a re-categorization of&#xD;
      pathologies based on their oscillatory activities and related scalp distribution. Indeed, the&#xD;
      answer the investigators are seeking is whether the investigators could identify clear&#xD;
      neurophysiological markers that could lead to a new diagnostic classification. From a&#xD;
      translational perspective the question is: 2) could these markers eventually guide&#xD;
      therapeutic options? If these points are proved, the investigators expect to expand the&#xD;
      results to other oscillopathies (i.e. schizophrenia or insomnia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project is thus two-staged: a first stage will define neurophysiologic&#xD;
      markers of diverse diseases, overcoming the traditional symptom-based classification of&#xD;
      pathologies. In the second stage, these features will be translated into a tailored&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) protocol. Indeed, focusing on oscillatory rhythms&#xD;
      dysfunctions, tACS, that entrains specific EEG frequencies, instead of tDCS, that&#xD;
      hypo-hyperpolarizes indiscriminately vast brain regions, will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage, selected pathologies among the broader spectrum of&#xD;
      thalamo-cortical-dysrhythmias (TCDs) will be categorized on the basis of their prevalent EEG&#xD;
      rhythm; in addition, oscillatory brain response to external perturbation (frequency bands&#xD;
      synchronization or desynchronization in response to TMS stimulation as defined by EEG-TMS&#xD;
      co-registration) will be obtained. The identified EEG frequency will subsequently be&#xD;
      extracted from EEG to visualize scalp defective areas. The investigators will identify:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the prevailing EEG rhythm in a resting, standard EEG by means of power spectral&#xD;
           analysis, based on Fourier transform;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a more detailed insight into brain reactivity and its oscillatory response as a reaction&#xD;
           to random, non-entraining TMS stimulation with EEG co-registration, a method that&#xD;
           appears to elicit state-dependent brain oscillatory response; Pathologies presenting&#xD;
           with analogous neurophysiological signatures will be grouped together in order to define&#xD;
           an appropriate, common stimulation paradigm, independently of symptom phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage the investigators will attempt to tailor tACS on the basis of the&#xD;
      previously defined categories. The scalp area of the dysfunctional rhythm will aid in the&#xD;
      selection of the stimulation site, whereas the stimulation paradigm will be established on&#xD;
      the basis of the prevailing EEG bands at rest and after perturbation - i.e. transcranial&#xD;
      stimulation will be low frequency (4 Hz) alternating (tACS) for diseases characterized by a&#xD;
      pathological increase of fast rhythms, and vice-versa (30 Hz), in order to entrain the&#xD;
      defective EEG band. A clear-cut, long-lasting improvement of clinical symptoms is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our expected result is to be able to set up appropriate and effective tACS stimulation&#xD;
      paradigms based on disease neurophysiological markers rather than on clinical symptoms. Given&#xD;
      the large number of pathologies encompassed in the TCD spectrum, this therapeutic option&#xD;
      could become a promising non-invasive, cost-effective therapeutic option with a wide field of&#xD;
      applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathologies to be included are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PD: altered thalamo-cortical loop that reflects, through the thalamus, the beta&#xD;
           prevalence in the deep nuclei loop and reverberates to the cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropathic pain (NP): evidence of increased high theta band power (7-8Hz), especially&#xD;
           over frontal and somatosensory cortex. The generation of low-frequency activity by the&#xD;
           thalamocortical circuit results in a long-term pathological equilibrium in the cortical&#xD;
           pain matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      2.3. Signal analysis T0, T1 and T2 resting EEG analysis. EEG will be acquired using an TMS&#xD;
      compatible EEG amplifier (BrainAmp 32MRplus, BrainProducts GmbH, Munich, Germany) and a cap&#xD;
      providing 30 Ag/AgCl electrodes positioned according to a 10/20 system. Data will be&#xD;
      processed in Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) using scripts based on EEGLAB&#xD;
      (http://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab), as well as a dedicated home-made code created for this&#xD;
      study. Visible artifacts in the EEG will be removed using an independent component analysis&#xD;
      procedure and EEG will be band-pass filtered from 1 to 30 Hz. EEG data will be divided into&#xD;
      epochs of 2 s and a fast Fourier transform (FFT) will be applied to non-overlapping epochs,&#xD;
      and averaged across epochs. Based on power spectra density, relative powers (%) in delta (1-4&#xD;
      Hz), theta (4-7Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency ranges will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one sample z-test will be applied to compare the map of the patient to the grand average of&#xD;
      the controls (a group of 20 healthy subjects). Thus, the statistical map defines the sensors&#xD;
      in which relative power from an individual patient differs statistically from that of a&#xD;
      reference population (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-stimulation (T0) EEG-TMS co-registration TMS will be performed using a Dymeg in biphasic&#xD;
      pulse configuration (DuoMag, EMS, Italy) which generates a maximum magnetic field of 1.5 T.&#xD;
      TMS will be delivered through a figure-of-eight focal coil over the dominant primary motor&#xD;
      area (M1). Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) will be recorded from the left/right thenar&#xD;
      eminence muscle with Ag/AgCl surface electrodes fixed to the skin with a belly-tendon&#xD;
      montage. Stimulus intensity will be set at 110% of motor threshold intensity. 100 TMS&#xD;
      single-pulse stimuli will be delivered at random, with inter-trial interval between 8-15 s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG will be acquired using the same magnetic resonance compatible EEG system previously&#xD;
      described. EEG data will be analysed using a time-frequency procedure to characterize&#xD;
      TMS-induced oscillations. Time-frequency analysis will be performed with continuous Morlet&#xD;
      wavelet transform, which provides a time course after magnetic stimulation of the relative&#xD;
      power in the main frequency bands, as described above. Profiles for each subject will be&#xD;
      averaged from the post-stimulus trials and normalized to the baseline value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4. TADCS stimulation paradigm Stimulation will be applied by a battery driven external&#xD;
      stimulator (BrainStim, EMS, Bologna, Italy) via two sponge electrodes (5x7cm). The anodal&#xD;
      electrode will be placed over the scalp area corresponding to the defective network node as&#xD;
      derived by EEG source analysis. The cathodal electrode will be placed over the ipsilateral&#xD;
      mastoid. A sinusoidal current, ranging from 1 to 2mA will be delivered; stimulation frequency&#xD;
      will be derived from the defective EEG band - i.e. if low frequency oscillations prevail,&#xD;
      stimulation will be at 30 Hz; if high frequency oscillations prevail, stimulation will be at&#xD;
      4 Hz. Sham stimulation, according to consensus statement, will be delivered as random noise&#xD;
      stimulation (RNS) with electrodes located at the same sites as active stimulation and Sham&#xD;
      Sessions will last 30 minutes, and repeated for two weeks on 5 consecutive days per week&#xD;
      separated by a 2 days interval. A random Noise Stimulation (RNS) with an amplitude 1 to 2 mA&#xD;
      will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5. Ethical Committee Approval The study involves stimulation of human subjects and as such&#xD;
      will require Ethical approval. The investigators obtained Ethical Approval from the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of the University Hospital, Padova (3507/15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6. Statistical analysis and study power Data will be summarized using descriptive&#xD;
      statistics. Appropriated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome will be produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6.1. First phase The proportion of people with PD displaying EEG beta peak (FFT) and the&#xD;
      95% binomial CI will be computed. The same analysis will be performed for people with NP&#xD;
      displaying EEG theta peak (FFT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6.2. Second phase 2.6.2.1. Primary analyses A repeated measures test (ANCOVA) will be used&#xD;
      to evaluate differences in UPDRS score and NPQ score between T0 and T1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6.2.2. Secondary analyses Cross sectional evaluation at pre- and post-treatment between PD&#xD;
      with beta Peak and PD with other EEG peaks will be run using the independent sample t test.&#xD;
      Same analysis will be performed to evaluate differences at T0 and T1 between NP subjects with&#xD;
      theta Peak vs NP with other EEG peaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further analyses could be performed using analysis of variance (ANOCOVA) to account for these&#xD;
      predictors: age, sex, disease severity at T0, interaction with other frequency bands, pre-&#xD;
      and post-stimulation therapy after real and active sham tACS modification, drugs. Repeated&#xD;
      measures models could be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6.3. Signal analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures will be applied to the relative power with&#xD;
      the factor ''time'' (T0, T1 and T2); the sphericity assumption will be assessed using&#xD;
      Mauchly's test. Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon adjustments for non-sphericity will be applied&#xD;
      where appropriate. A post hoc paired sample two tailed t-test adjusted for multiple&#xD;
      comparisons with the Bonferroni method will be used. Statistical significance will be set at&#xD;
      p &lt; 0.05, corrected. Two-dimensional grand mean t-maps of the relative power will be computed&#xD;
      from the t-values to check the topographical distribution of the significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6.4. Study power To compute the total sample size of the project the investigators will&#xD;
      first compute the sample size for phase II. Given sample size for phase II, sample size for&#xD;
      phase I will be computed accounting for potential drop-outs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II sample size Two different populations will be investigated (PD, NP) hence no&#xD;
      correction for multiplicity will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with PD and NP A sample size of 15 achieves 92% power to detect a mean of paired&#xD;
      differences (UPDRS pre- and post-stimulation score difference) of 4.0 with an estimated&#xD;
      standard deviation of differences of 4.3 and with significance level (alpha) of 0.05 using a&#xD;
      two-sided paired t-test in people with PD displaying EEG beta (FFT). The same assumption will&#xD;
      be assumed for NPQ decrease, hence a total of 30 subjects will be required, 15 for each&#xD;
      category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I sample size The investigators expect all people with PD to have a beta frequency&#xD;
      peak, while those with NP will be in the theta band. A sample size of 15 people with NP&#xD;
      produces a one sided 97.5 binomial CI of 79.61%-100% given that the expected proportion of&#xD;
      theta is 100%. A sample size of 15 people with PD produces a one sided 97.5 binomial CI of&#xD;
      79.61%-100% given that the expected proportion of beta is 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total sample size In order to account for potential drop outs the investigators will recruit&#xD;
      20 people with NP and 20 people with PD, giving a total sample size of 40 patients.&#xD;
