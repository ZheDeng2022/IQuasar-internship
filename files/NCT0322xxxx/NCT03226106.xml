  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although total knee arthroplasty is an effective intervention for decreasing knee pain and&#xD;
      improving physical function, physical activity levels remain low up to a year after surgery.&#xD;
      This study will use mobile-health technology to deliver an intervention designed to improve&#xD;
      physical activity behavior for Veterans recovering from total knee arthroplasty. The study&#xD;
      will assess the effectiveness of using behavior-change intervention as a supplement to&#xD;
      conventional rehabilitation to improve physical activity. The intervention will be delivered&#xD;
      using home-based tablet computers for Veterans to have remote interaction with the researcher&#xD;
      and real-time physical activity feedback from a wrist-worn activity sensor.&#xD;

      This randomized clinical trial will assess the efficacy of using physical activity behavior&#xD;
      change intervention for Veterans recovering from total knee arthroplasty. Testing will occur&#xD;
      at baseline (before surgery), at intervention midpoint (8 weeks after surgery), end of&#xD;
      intervention (14 weeks after surgery), and 24 weeks after intervention. The primary outcome&#xD;
      is accelerometer-assessed daily step count. Secondary outcomes include the percent time&#xD;
      engaged in standing and walking activity and physical function (Six-Minute Walk, 30-Second&#xD;
      Chair-Stand Test, Timed Up-and-Go, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis&#xD;
      Index, and the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey.&#xD;
