  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent and/or metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN) are a common&#xD;
      clinical situation and although this group of patients has very heterogeneous disease&#xD;
      characteristics, they share a dismal prognosis with a median survival time around 6-11 months&#xD;
      and a relatively poor quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy approaches have recently demonstrated clinical efficacy in more than twenty&#xD;
      cancer types, including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
      and SCCHN. Nivolumab demonstrated significant overall survival benefit as treatment for&#xD;
      recurrent SCCHN in a randomized phase III Study CA209141 conducted on a cohort of 361&#xD;
      patients (240 in the nivolumab arm and 121 in the standard therapy arm), presenting this&#xD;
      condition and whose disease had progressed within 6 months after platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
      In this study, treatment with nivolumab resulted in significantly longer survival than&#xD;
      treatment with standard therapy with a median overall survival of 7.5 months vs 5.1 months&#xD;
      (p=0.01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to provide additional insight into the frequency of&#xD;
      high-grade AEs related to nivolumab and their outcome, and thus supplement the growing safety&#xD;
      database of nivolumab-treated recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head&#xD;
      and neck patients.&#xD;

    <description>Time to resolution of grade 3-4 will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier method among patients who had experienced this type of AEI from the grade 3-4 AEI onset date to date of AEI grade 1.

Progression is defined according to RECIST 1.1. Patients last known to be alive without progression having occurred before will be censored at date of last contact.
