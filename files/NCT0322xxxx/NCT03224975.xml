  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is complex phenomenon misunderstood in spite of medical progress and neurosciences.&#xD;
      That's why the relief of chronic pain is only partial for a lot of infection as arthrosis,&#xD;
      chronic back pain, headaches or neuropathic pain. Certain situations bring to relive pain&#xD;
      sensation. Investigators were interested to former burned. They wonder about somatic memory&#xD;
      and unconscious of acute.&#xD;

      It is a comparative and monocentric study. There are two groups. On the one hand, there is&#xD;
      the former burned and, on the other hand, healthy volunteers. While they thought to painful&#xD;
      memory or not, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) will be performed. Then,&#xD;
      investigators compare two functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective of this study is link up between brain activity by functional Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and acute pain memory.&#xD;
