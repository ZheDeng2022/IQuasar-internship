  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain is composed of several anatomical compartments separated by physiological barriers&#xD;
      allowing the maintenance of homeostasis. Furthermore, brain-barriers restrain the diffusion&#xD;
      of some drugs in cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) and in extracellular fluid (ECF) of brain tissue,&#xD;
      making the development and optimization of dosing regimen of new drugs difficult. Most dosing&#xD;
      regimen are determined from the plasma concentration because target site concentrations are&#xD;
      difficult to obtain in the brain, hence making the prediction of the therapeutic effect, the&#xD;
      adverse effect and the toxicity of a brain- diffused drug difficult. Although quantitative&#xD;
      and qualitative differences exist in the processes governing pharmacokinetic (PK) in CSF and&#xD;
      brain tissue, CSF is considered as the best surrogate of drugs penetration in the human&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study previously published has evaluated in rats the cerebral distribution of paracetamol,&#xD;
      used as a marker of passive diffusion in the ECF by microdialysis in the striatum and in the&#xD;
      CSF by microdialysis in the ventricular lateralis and the cistern magna. Authors chose&#xD;
      paracetamol, as it has the property to diffuse passively and rapidly in the central nervous&#xD;
      system allowing the exclusive description of the relationship between the different&#xD;
      compartments of the brain. This study has first revealed an unexpected important difference&#xD;
      between the distribution profiles obtained in ECF and CSF. Based on these results, authors&#xD;
      developed a physiologically based PK model (PBPK) to describe their results and thereby&#xD;
      offering the possibility to perform interspecies simulations to predict central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS) distribution of paracetamol in human. In this study, authors used this model to&#xD;
      perform pharmaceutical extrapolations between species converting data from animal to human by&#xD;
      replacing obtained data from clinical past studies describing paracetamol distribution in the&#xD;
      CSF and in plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microdialysis allows determination of free extracellular concentrations of drug in different&#xD;
      tissues and also in brain. Our research team, INSERM U1070, has several past experiences with&#xD;
      studies involving micro-dialysis to study the distribution of antibiotic in tissue in both&#xD;
      animal and human including cerebral tissue in rat and human. Recommendation from the scholar&#xD;
      society suggests that brain injured patients should benefit from a multimodal monitoring to&#xD;
      optimize their care and brain perfusion. This invasive multimodal monitoring consists of&#xD;
      measuring the intracranial pressure, the oxygen tissue-pressure, the estimation of the&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow-rate by cranial Doppler as well as the monitoring of cerebral ischemic&#xD;
      parameters by microdialysis. We also prevent systemic cerebral aggression among which,&#xD;
      hyperthermia, explaining the prescription of paracetamol among a large number of brain&#xD;
      injured patients. Furthermore setting up of an external ventricular draining (EVD) to treat&#xD;
      an intra cranial hypertension is usually necessary to allow the continuous flow of the excess&#xD;
      of CSF in the brain ventricle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies carried on human has aimed at comparing the distribution of drugs in both the CSF&#xD;
      and the brain extracellular fluid though it is established that the brain barriers differ in&#xD;
      their permeability as well as the drug's concentrations are different between brain&#xD;
      compartments. Thus by mean of monitoring through microdialysis and/or through therapeutic&#xD;
      EVD, required by brain-injured patients, we aim in our study to explore the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      of paracetamol in the brain ECF, the CSF and the plasma and to validate in man the PBPK&#xD;
      developed in rat.&#xD;
