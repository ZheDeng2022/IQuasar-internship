      Vascular stiffness increases as a person ages, due to the repetitive stress that is put on&#xD;
      the vascular system which causes changes in the elasticity of the vessel walls. The increased&#xD;
      stiffness of the arteries puts added stress on the circulatory system. This rise in stiffness&#xD;
      has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, in both&#xD;
      presumably healthy patients, as well as elderly patients The current method for assessing&#xD;
      perioperative cardiac risk is the Goldman's Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI). This method,&#xD;
      however, does not include a direct measurement of arterial stiffness. Applanation tonometry&#xD;
      is a non-invasive technique that has been shown to reliably provide indices of arterial&#xD;
      stiffness While the use of applanation tonometry has been widely studied in general medicine,&#xD;
      it is has not been studied for pre-operative risk assessment in surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this investigation is to examine whether aortic stiffness is an independent&#xD;
      risk factor for developing cardiovascular related adverse events in patients who are having&#xD;
      major surgery under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applanation tonometry will be performed on the right carotid and femoral arteries to assess&#xD;
      carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, a surrogate for aortic stiffness. (SphygmoCor system,&#xD;
      AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia). The measurement will be obtained before induction of&#xD;
      general anesthesia in the presurgical area. Patients' medical history, intraoperative&#xD;
      hemodynamics, and any postoperative complications will be recorded to determine significant&#xD;
      correlations and relationships. This information will potentially help identify future&#xD;
      patients that might be at greater risk of developing an adverse cardiovascular event&#xD;
      following their surgical procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: In 1894 William Osler, MD, said: &quot;You are as old as your arteries.&quot; A number of&#xD;
      recent studies have confirmed this prescient proclamation. Vascular rather than chronological&#xD;
      age is the best predictor of adverse cardiovascular events and mortality from coronary&#xD;
      insufficiency, ischemia, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cerebrovascular insufficiency&#xD;
      or stroke, and renal insufficiency or failure. We believe it is likely this also applies to&#xD;
      perioperative risk of cardiovascular complications from the numerous stress factors&#xD;
      associated with major surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular aging leads to central aortic dilation, arterial wall thickening of the media and&#xD;
      adventitia with sclerotic changes and increased vascular stiffness. These changes lead to&#xD;
      central blood pressure (BP) augmentation, elevated systolic and pulse pressure, along with&#xD;
      lowered diastolic BP. (1) Central more elastic vessels cushion and dampen pressure&#xD;
      oscillations with left ventricular (LV) ejection and transfer this stored energy into&#xD;
      continuing antegrade pulse waves along the arterial tree during diastole. (2) the pulse wave&#xD;
      is also reflected back centrally when it meets higher flow resistance at major artery branch&#xD;
      points and muscular arteries resulting in central aortic combination wave. In a younger&#xD;
      compliant central aorta the reflected waves arrive after aortic valve closure, augmenting&#xD;
      early diastolic perfusion pressure an coronary blood flow. Elderly stiff aorta and major&#xD;
      arteries vessels transfer both antegrade and retrograde pulse waves faster. If heart rate is&#xD;
      slow enough an asystole long enough, this combination wave will arrive at the central aorta&#xD;
      during late systole. This elevates LV workload, resulting in compensatory left ventricular&#xD;
      hypertrophy (LVH). In addition, disappearance of the diastolic combination wave lowers&#xD;
      coronary perfusion pressure, increasing the risk of coronary insufficiency for the&#xD;
      hypertrophied LV wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, high blood flow coronary, and renal arteries are not so muscular that they can&#xD;
      reduce the impact of high combination systolic pressure waveforms. This induces chronic&#xD;
      kinetic injury to these high blood flow vessels and organs. Increased pulsatility leads to&#xD;
      arterial remodeling and microcirculation damage in brain and kidney, small lacunare infarcts,&#xD;
      white matter lesions associated with cognitive dysfunction and dementia, while endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction compromises cerebral blood flow, the blood-brain barrier and renal perfusion.&#xD;
      Again, LVH from elevated combination waveform pressure leads to diastolic dysfunction and&#xD;
      heart failure. Thus, elevated pulse wave velocity (PWV)and central aortic pulse augmentation&#xD;
      indices are independent predictors of CAD, stroke, renal dysfunction, and all-cause&#xD;
      mortality. (1) It is responsible for the rising risk of myocardial insufficiency, ischemia,&#xD;
      LVH, and heart failure, cerebrovascular insufficiency or injury as well as renal injury and&#xD;
      impairment with vascular aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of vascular aging is multifactorial, including genetic susceptibilities as well as&#xD;
      acceleration from vascular disease such as hypertension, atherosclerosis and diabetes. Recent&#xD;
      trials have shown ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II blocks (ARBs) and Ca++ channel blockers have&#xD;
      favorable effects on central aortic compliance, reducing LVH and reducing the risk of heart&#xD;
      failure, stroke and renal impairment. In contrast, Beta blockers enhance central aortic BP&#xD;
      augmentation by lengthening LV ejection time. Thus the reflected pulse waves arrive during&#xD;
      late systole, augmenting the combined central aortic wave amplitude and LV workload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulse wave velocity (PWV)has become a very good measure of aortic stiffness. PWV rises from&#xD;
      6m/sec in a young person to 10m/sec in a 65 y/o. It increases 2-fold from 20-80 y/o, due to a&#xD;
      4-fold reduction in aortic distensibility. (3) The CAFE study showed significant reduction in&#xD;
      central artic BP and adverse cardiovascular events as well as renal impairment with Ca++&#xD;
      channel blockers, but not with atenolol plus thiazide Rx. (4) The REASON study showed ARBs&#xD;
      reduced vascular stiffness, wave reflections, central aortic pulse pressure, vascular&#xD;
      resistance, remodeling and thickness of resistance vessels. (5) Method/Design: The study will&#xD;
      be human subject non-randomized observational study. This study will enroll approximately 500&#xD;
      patients. This was determined by a preliminary analysis of 140 patients, of which 19 had&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular events, within a week after surgery. The results of this preliminary&#xD;
      study found average PWV was significantly higher in patients who developed postoperative&#xD;
      cardiovascular events compared with patients who had uneventful postoperative course.&#xD;
      (p-value 0.024). Therefore it was determined that 500 patients should be sufficient to see a&#xD;
      statistically significant difference if there is one. This study will be conducted at day of&#xD;
      surgery administration area and main operation room at University of Iowa Hospitals and&#xD;
      clinics. Arterial stiffness will be measured at day of surgery administration area prior to&#xD;
      the surgery. Carotid-Femoral Pulse Wave Velocity (Aortic Stiffness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) will be determined by applanation tonometry using&#xD;
      the Sphygmocor system by sequentially recording ECG-gated carotid and femoral artery&#xD;
      waveforms. Pulse wave signals will be recorded by tonometers positioned at the base of the&#xD;
      right common carotid artery and over the right femoral artery. The time (t) between the feet&#xD;
      of simultaneously recorded waves will be determined as the mean of 10 consecutive cardiac&#xD;
      cycles. PWV is calculated by the system software from the distance between measurement points&#xD;
      (D) and the measured time delay (t) as follows: cfPWV = D/Δt (m/ s) where D is distance in&#xD;
      meters and t is the time interval in seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent, the subject will be taken to a private exam room where a noninvasive study of&#xD;
      PWV and central aortic BP will be performed in supine position using the SphygmoCor sensor&#xD;
      positioned over the carotid and femoral or radial artery pulse waveform, along with 3-lead&#xD;
      EKG for QRS timing of the onset of systole. The SphygmoCor pulse wave sensor will be&#xD;
      calibrated with an upper arm sphygmomanometer cuff BP. The vascular aging measurements will&#xD;
      not be used to guide or alter medical decision making in the study. The study will take&#xD;
      approximately 30 min. They will also not be repeated for this protocol either during or after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre and intraoperative data collection will include: ASA status, history of peripheral&#xD;
      vascular disease, history of ischemic vascular disease, history of congestive heart failure,&#xD;
      and history of cerebrovascular disease, intraop: all of the routine vital signs, anesthetic&#xD;
      drug details, fluids, blood loss, and urine output data relevant to the surgical procedure.&#xD;
      Any significant clinical AEs such as brady- or tachycardia (HR &lt;50 or &gt;100 for &gt;10 min),&#xD;
      hyper- or hypotension (BP &gt;30% above or &gt; 30% below awake), EKG rhythm or ST segment&#xD;
      abnormality, abnormal BIS (anesthetic depth) or other EEG issue during anesthesia or surgery,&#xD;
      and wake up difficulty will be documented in the clinical anesthesia electronic record. All&#xD;
      other relevant monitoring data such as hypoxemia (pulse oximeter), hypo-or hyperventilation&#xD;
      (capnography or arterial blood gas values) will be recorded in a clinical data file for each&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative data collection will include vital signs and any clinical cardiac, neurological&#xD;
      or renal adverse events or other complications especially for the first 30 days, and any&#xD;
      later events including all-cause mortality up to one year after surgery. Postoperative&#xD;
      outcome information will be primarily collected via the medical record review. We do not plan&#xD;
      to visit study subjects at bedside while recovering from surgery as inpatients, and will not&#xD;
      schedule additional outpatient research follow up visits. However we also plan to call&#xD;
      enrolled subjects at 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery to ask them whether they have&#xD;
      experienced postoperative complications such as a a stroke, myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      dysrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure, respiratory failure, kidney function&#xD;
      problem, renal failure or death.&#xD;
