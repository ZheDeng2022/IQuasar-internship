  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Audio-Visual (AV) Distraction is a recent modality introduced to the entertaining market&#xD;
      technology for adults and children. Some practitioners started using this modality of&#xD;
      distraction in the dental practice to aid in psychological management of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to compare between conventional dental visits (No Distraction) and&#xD;
      dental visits aided with audio-visual distraction. Providing a safe, comfortable and&#xD;
      entertaining dental environment will give pediatric children a better perception regarding&#xD;
      the dental environment and motivate them for repetitive dental visits for better dental&#xD;
      health care.&#xD;

      [I] Recruitment: Children aged 5~8 years old with teeth decay requiring restorative dental&#xD;
      treatment will be randomly selected according to the Intrusion and Extrusion Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [II] Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The operator will select the teeth; child must have decayed tooth requiring restorative&#xD;
           dental treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The visit will be started by using the tell-show-do technique to explain the procedure.&#xD;
           After that the Facial Image Scale is validated to assess dental anxiety and will be&#xD;
           explained to the child. The dentist will ask the child to choose one of the six faces&#xD;
           that best represented his/her current emotional state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pulse oximeter sensor will then be placed and initial pulse rate will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient will choose from a bowl a piece of paper to decide if AV-distraction will be&#xD;
           used or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Above steps will be done in both visits, with and without the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If the toss had AV-distraction, The operator will introduce the Audio-visual device&#xD;
           (Virtual Reality Eye Glasses) to the patient and how it works and will allow the patient&#xD;
           to choose his favorite show to watch during the dental visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The operator will instruct the patient with the rules that will be applied during the&#xD;
           dental visit to assure complete cooperation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The operator will apply topical and dental anaesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Pulse rate will be measured every 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. The operator will allow extra time if the dental visit ended before the child finishes&#xD;
           the tv-show.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Then operator will ask the patient to choose from the face scale diagrams about his&#xD;
           anxiety state at the end of the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention modifications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case the child interrupted the dental visit for questions or any reason, the last record&#xD;
      of pulse oximeter will be repeated.&#xD;
