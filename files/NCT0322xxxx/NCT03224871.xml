  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The advent of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has revolutionized the management of&#xD;
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the promising evidence for deep and&#xD;
      durable responses with these agents the majority of patients fail to respond. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that a novel strategy combining radiotherapy and intralesional&#xD;
      interleukin-2 (IL-2), a signaling molecule and member of the cytokine family involved in the&#xD;
      activation of leukocytes and lymphocytes, may overcome resistance to checkpoint blockade&#xD;
      therapy and offer significant clinical benefit to patients who fail to respond to checkpoint&#xD;
      blockade alone. The investigators propose a microtrial testing the feasibility of a bold&#xD;
      combinatorial immunotherapy strategy consisting of radiotherapy (RT), intralesional IL-2, and&#xD;
      check-point blockade for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients who have progressed&#xD;
      after checkpoint inhibition. IL-2 can upregulate PD-1 expression and activate T-cells.&#xD;

      The advent of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has revolutionized the management of&#xD;
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the promising evidence for deep and&#xD;
      durable responses with these agents the majority of patients fail to respond. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that a novel strategy combining radiotherapy and intralesional&#xD;
      interleukin-2 (IL-2), a signaling molecule and member of the cytokine family involved in the&#xD;
      activation of leukocytes and lymphocytes, may overcome resistance to checkpoint blockade&#xD;
      therapy and offer significant clinical benefit to patients who fail to respond to checkpoint&#xD;
      blockade alone. The investigators propose a microtrial testing the feasibility of a bold&#xD;
      combinatorial immunotherapy strategy consisting of radiotherapy (RT), intralesional IL-2, and&#xD;
      check-point blockade for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients who have progressed&#xD;
      after checkpoint inhibition. IL-2 can upregulate PD-1 expression and activate T-cells. There&#xD;
      is data supporting combination therapies with IL-2 and checkpoint blockade, IL-2 and&#xD;
      radiotherapy, and checkpoint blockade and radiotherapy but clinical data is limited and the&#xD;
      triple combination has never been tested. IL-2 + checkpoint blockade was recently tested in a&#xD;
      small clinical trial and showed promising results but RT was not included in this trial. As&#xD;
      outlined above RT has been demonstrated to increase the efficacy of both IL-2 and checkpoint&#xD;
      blockade. The investigators believe that the triple combination of radiotherapy + IL-2 +&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibition will be highly effective as RT + IL-2 can serve highly activate the&#xD;
      immune system and checkpoint blockade can reverse the immune suppressive pathways induced by&#xD;
      tumor and therapy. The investigators hypothesize that the combination of intralesional IL-2&#xD;
      with radiotherapy will act as an &quot;in-situ&quot; vaccine inducing an anti-tumor immune response.&#xD;
      The investigators further hypothesize that this vaccine effect will convert patients with&#xD;
      primary or secondary resistance to checkpoint blockade into responders since one mechanism of&#xD;
      resistance to checkpoint blockade appears to be lack of a pre-existing anti-tumor immune&#xD;
      response. The primary endpoint is tolerability, safety and toxicity. Exploratory endpoints&#xD;
      include abscopal response rate, objective response rate, disease control rate, progression&#xD;
      free survival, and correlative studies. This trial will incorporate robust correlative assays&#xD;
      to provide insights into mechanisms of resistance to checkpoint blockade and how this therapy&#xD;
      may overcome that resistance. This trial, although small, has the potential to drastically&#xD;
      advance both our understanding and treatment of metastatic lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot phase I study that will evaluate the safety and toxicity of this&#xD;
      combinatorial approach. Eligible patients with NSCLC who fail to respond to PD1/PDL1&#xD;
      checkpoint blockade will be enrolled. Patients will continue on checkpoint blockade and&#xD;
      receive intralesional IL-2 in combination with hypofractionated radiotherapy. Radiotherapy&#xD;
      will be delivered to the treatment lesion during the first week of therapy using an 8 Gy x 3&#xD;
      fractions palliative regimen. Fractions may be delivered on consecutive or every other day&#xD;
      but must be completed during week 1 and will not be repeated in future cycles. Immune&#xD;
      checkpoint blockade will be started on week 1 day 1, concurrent with radiotherapy and&#xD;
      continue with cycles every 2 (nivolumab) or 3 (pembrolizumab) weeks. A total of four&#xD;
      Interleukin-2 treatments will be delivered into the treatment lesion by intralesional&#xD;
      injections twice weekly starting 24-72 hours after the completion of radiotherapy and to be&#xD;
      completed no later than study Day 21. Intralesional injections will be performed by palpation&#xD;
      of the lesion or under ultrasound or CT guidance as indicated. Intralesional IL-2 injections&#xD;
      will follow guidelines, which we have previously published. Briefly, each patient will&#xD;
      receive an initial test dose of 3 x 106 IU of IL-2, which will be escalated to 7 x 106 for&#xD;
      the second treatment and then 15 x 106 IU for the final two treatments as tolerated. If a&#xD;
      dose level is not tolerated the treatment will be de-escalated to previous dose levels for&#xD;
      subsequent treatments. If 3 million IU IL-2 is not tolerated the dose can be de-escalated to&#xD;
      1 million IU IL-2. If 1 million IU IL-2 is not tolerated the treatment will be deemed&#xD;
      intolerable and patient removed from study.&#xD;

    <description>A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as a treatment related grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity and will require dose de-escalation. If a DLT does not resolve within 5 days, is not responsive to management, or occurs at the lowest dose level (1 million IU IL-2) after de-escalation then that patient will be removed from trial and the therapy will be deemed intolerable. Therapy will be deemed safe and tolerable if no greater than 33% of patients find the treatment intolerable.</description>

    <description>High dose IL-2 (HD-IL-2) is a cytokine produced endogenously by activated T cells and is effective in the treatment of a variety of malignancies because it has both immune-modulating and antitumor properties. In an attempt to take advantage of the robust immune activating effects of IL-2 but avoid the toxicity of high dose systemic IL-2 we and others have investigated the use of intralesional IL-2 injections.</description>
