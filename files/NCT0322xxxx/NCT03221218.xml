  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine whether enhancing screening-informed follow-up letters will improve&#xD;
      (i) family physician compliance with best practice guidelines for managing persistent&#xD;
      symptoms following concussion, and (ii) clinical outcomes from concussion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family physicians are well positioned to proactively manage symptoms in the weeks following&#xD;
      MTBI, which could prevent chronicity and reduce the need for specialist treatment. Clinical&#xD;
      practice guidelines are now available for MTBI management in primary care, such as those&#xD;
      developed by the Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation (ONF). However, awareness and use of these&#xD;
      guidelines may be low. Distilling the guidelines into a small number of actionable messages&#xD;
      that are tailored to an individual patient may facilitate family physician implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ONF guidelines for MTBI propose that early intervention should prioritize the most&#xD;
      readily treatable symptoms - mood (depression and anxiety), insomnia, and headaches. The&#xD;
      present cluster randomized trial will evaluate whether screening for these conditions and&#xD;
      sending family physicians treatment algorithms for positive screening test results will&#xD;
      result in earlier evidence-based treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from two concussion clinics that provide group education sessions.&#xD;
      Following the education session, eligible participants will complete self-reported screening&#xD;
      measures for depression, anxiety, insomnia, and headaches. Family physicians will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive these screening test results with associated treatment algorithms from&#xD;
      the ONF guidelines or a letter providing generic MTBI management recommendations from the ONF&#xD;
      guidelines (currently done as usual care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed by telephone one month and three months after the intervention. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be patient-reported treatment utilization that is congruent with the ONF&#xD;
      guidelines for depression, anxiety, insomnia, and headaches after MTBI.&#xD;
