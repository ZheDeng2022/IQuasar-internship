  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adipose tissue is strongly correlated to obesity and diabetes which are two major problems in&#xD;
      the worldwide. Adipose tissue is involved in modulating glucose and energy metabolism locally&#xD;
      and systemically by secreting factors, called adipocytokines. Tetranectin (TN), a novel&#xD;
      adipocytokine, is secreted by adipose tissues. TN may regulate the glucose/energy homeostasis&#xD;
      to affect lipid accumulation.The role of TN in adipocytes with or without TN on regulation of&#xD;
      adipose tissue growth and lipid metabolism is valuable to be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: Secreted proteins from human adipocyte culture medium were deciphered&#xD;
      using 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and determined by LC/MS with MALDI-TOF analysis&#xD;
      of proteins. Adipose tissues were obtained from the breast of 15 women undergoing mastectomy.&#xD;
      Serum samples from 200 normal healthy people and 54 breast cancer patients were assigned to&#xD;
      either a lean or obese group according to the body mass index. The TN protein concentration&#xD;
      was measured in the culture medium of stromal-vascular fraction (SVF)-derived adipocytes from&#xD;
      healthy humans, breast cancer patients, pigs and also from 3T3-L1 cells. Associations between&#xD;
      plasma TN and other biomarkers were assessed with Pearson's correlations and multivariable&#xD;
      linear regression.&#xD;

      Adipose tissues were obtained from the breast of breast cancer patients with 0 to 1&#xD;
      progression stage. All participants gave permission and the study was approved by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of National Taiwan University Hospital as no. 9461701203.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 2012 to 2013 in National Taiwan University Hospital, a cross-sectional sampling of 21 to&#xD;
      78 -year old people included women and men who were living in Taiwan. Blood samples were&#xD;
      collected after an overnight fasting. Serum was separated by centrifugation and stored at -80&#xD;
      ℃ until analysis. Plasma triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol, glucose and insulin were measured. Fasting serum samples were&#xD;
      obtained from 193 randomly selected persons having health check-ups. To investigate the&#xD;
      relationship among TN and breast cancer, fasting serum samples also obtained from 54 randomly&#xD;
      selected breast cancer patients who were 25 to 59 years old with elected surgery for breast&#xD;
      cancer stage 0 and 1.&#xD;
