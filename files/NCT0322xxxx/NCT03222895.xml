    <textblock>
      Background: Lymph node status is an important prognostic parameter in esophageal carcinoma&#xD;
      and an independent predictor of survival. Distribution of metastatic lymph nodes may vary&#xD;
      with tumor location, tumor histology, tumor invasion depth and neoadjuvant therapy. Surgical&#xD;
      strategy depends on the distribution pattern of nodal metastases but consensus on the extent&#xD;
      of lymphadenectomy differs worldwide. Especially for adenocarcinoma the distribution of lymph&#xD;
      node metastases has not yet been described in large series. Aim of the present study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the distribution of lymph node metastases in esophageal carcinoma specimens&#xD;
      following transthoracic esophagectomy with at least a 2-field lymphadenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The TIGER-study is a multinational observational cohort study. All patients with a&#xD;
      resectable esophageal or gastro-esophageal junction carcinoma in whom a transthoracic&#xD;
      esophagectomy with a 2- or 3-field lymphadenectomy is performed in participating centers will&#xD;
      be included. All lymph node stations will be excised and separately sent for pathological&#xD;
      examination. Cluster analysis will be performed to identify patterns of metastases in&#xD;
      relation to tumor location, tumor histology, tumor invasion depth and neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: TIGER will provide a roadmap of the location of lymph node metastases in relation&#xD;
      to tumor histology, tumor location, invasion depth, number of lymph nodes and lymph node&#xD;
      metastases, pre-operative diagnostics, neo-adjuvant therapy and survival. Patient-tailored&#xD;
      treatment can be developed on the basis of these results, such as the the optimal radiation&#xD;
      field and extent of lymphadenectomy based on the primary tumor characteristics.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the TIGER study is to evaluate the distribution of lymph node metastases in esophageal&#xD;
      carcinoma specimens following transthoracic esophagectomy with at least 2-field&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accuracy of preoperative diagnostics (especially EUS and PET-CT) and added value of EBUS&#xD;
           (endobronchial ultrasonography) to existing staging with EUS (endoscopic&#xD;
           ultrasonography)/PET-CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prognostic value of different lymph node stations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three- and 5-year overall and disease free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distribution pattern of recurrence or metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of harvested lymph nodes in patients who are treated with and without&#xD;
           neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of skip nodal metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ratio of nodal metastases inside and outside the radiation field o Lymph node metastases&#xD;
           will be defined as inside or outside the radiation field nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIGER is a multinational observational cohort study. The duration of the study will&#xD;
      approximately be 7 years (2 years inclusion, 5 years follow-up). The participating centers&#xD;
      are distributed over 18 countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2012, the incidence of esophageal cancer was 456,000 new cases worldwide. Only a small&#xD;
      percentage of patients with esophageal cancer present with curable disease at time of&#xD;
      diagnosis. We aim to include all patients with resectable disease in participating centers in&#xD;
      a 2 year time period. We aim to include 5000 patients. This number suffices for (i)&#xD;
      descriptive purposes and (ii) clustering of metastases diffusion profiles into meaningful&#xD;
      subgroups within predefined strata (patients with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma,&#xD;
      with and without neoadjuvant therapy, different tumor heights and invasion depths, and&#xD;
      following a 2- or 3-field lymphadenectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not undergo any additional procedures for the study. This is an observational&#xD;
      study only. Patients will be treated according to national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for 5 years after the operation according to national&#xD;
      guidelines. Follow-up will be scheduled every three months the first year, every six months&#xD;
      the second until the fourth year and once yearly until the fifth year. Investigations are&#xD;
      performed according to national guidelines. In the Netherlands, these are performed on&#xD;
      indication of patients' complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study parameter(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numbers and percentages of resected lymph nodes and lymph node metastases will be given per&#xD;
      lymph node station. Tumor location and invasion depth will be categorized. Patients with&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma and patients with and without neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
      will be analyzed separately. Also patients following a 2- or 3-field lymphadenectomy will be&#xD;
      analyzed separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study parameter(s) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of EUS and PET-CT&#xD;
      will be reported. Perioperative morbidity and mortality will be summarized descriptively. For&#xD;
      each patient group mentioned in 5.4, explorative cluster analyses will be done to identify&#xD;
      subgroups of patients with different patterns of lymph nodes metastases, tumor locations and&#xD;
      invasion depths. Potentially relevant other characteristics at the time of surgery like age,&#xD;
      gender, tumor differentiation, vaso-invasive growth will be included in the analysis. No&#xD;
      restrictions will be applied to the number of clusters in each analysis, but the ratio of the&#xD;
      largest cluster size to the smallest cluster size should preferably not exceed the value of 3&#xD;
      and/or the smallest cluster size should be minimally 30 patients. Characteristics introducing&#xD;
      patient outliers will be excluded and one should further be able to attribute meaning to the&#xD;
      resulting cluster profiles. Clusters that show the phenomenon of skip metastases will be&#xD;
      noted. The resulting clusters will be evaluated for the diffusion pattern of future&#xD;
      metastases during follow-up (descriptive analysis), the number of future metastases during&#xD;
      follow-up (Poisson regression or generalized estimation equation, whichever appropriate), for&#xD;
      3- and 5-year overall and disease free survival (Kaplan-Meier survival analysis).&#xD;
      Multivariate analysis will be performed using the Cox hazard regression method. The&#xD;
      univariate analysis, including all baseline parameters, will serve as the basis for the&#xD;
      multivariate Cox hazard regression model. Variables showing association (p &lt; 0.10) with&#xD;
      survival in univariate analysis will be included in the multivariate analysis. Age and sex&#xD;
      will be included in all multivariate analyses. Results are presented as hazard ratio with&#xD;
      exact 95% confidence interval (95% CI). After 5-years of follow-up the efficacy index will be&#xD;
      determined (incidence of metastases to an area (%) x 5-year overall survival rate (%)). A&#xD;
      log-rank test, Mann-Whitney U test, or χ2-test will be used as indicated to compare groups. A&#xD;
      value of p &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed with SPSS 21.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). No formal power analysis or&#xD;
      sample size calculation will be performed, but the 5,000 inclusions will suffice for an&#xD;
      exploratory study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other study parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics will be presented in a baseline table. Clinical and pathology data&#xD;
      will be presented in separate tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central data management is organized via the secured TIGER database that can be found on&#xD;
      TIGERstudy.net. Patient inclusion and data registration of these patients will be done by the&#xD;
      participating local PI, surgeon or fellow for the center they are representing on the TIGER&#xD;
      website. The local PI is responsible for the inclusion and data registration of all eligible&#xD;
      patients in his or her center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with resectable esophageal carcinoma undergoing transthoracic esophageal&#xD;
      resection are eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated according to national guidelines and may be neo-adjuvantly treated&#xD;
      with chemotherapy or chemoradiation. An esophagectomy with a 2- or 3-stage lymphadenectomy&#xD;
      will be performed followed by a gastric tube or colonic interposition for reconstruction. All&#xD;
      lymph node stations will be excised and separately sent for pathological examination. Initial&#xD;
      microscopic evaluation will be performed by standard H&amp;E staining. In case of suspicion of&#xD;
      micro-metastasis or isolated tumor cells in the lymph node, or in case of suspicion of&#xD;
      residual tumor cells in patients with extensive response to neoadjuvant therapy, additional&#xD;
      keratin stains will be performed. For the TIGER-study a new lymph node classification is&#xD;
      designed, and lymph nodes will be recorded according to that classification system. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed-up for 5 years after the operation.&#xD;
