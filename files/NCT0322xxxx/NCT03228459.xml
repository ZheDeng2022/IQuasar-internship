      BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death despite huge primary and secondary&#xD;
      prevention policies with a strong economic burden. The primary objectives of the ILERVAS&#xD;
      project are: (i) to identify unknown factors involved in the presence of atherosclerosis,&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes and hidden kidney disease in a low/moderate cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk population; (ii) to identify unknown factors involved in the progression of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes and hidden kidney disease in a low/moderate&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk population; (iii) to Assess of the impact of arterial ultrasound on&#xD;
      cardiovascular events and mortality in a low/moderate cardiovascular risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized intervention study. From 2015 to 2018, 16,660 participants (8,330 in the&#xD;
      intervention group (Mobile Unit Follow-up Group) and 8,330 in the no intervention group&#xD;
      (Electronic Medical History Follow-up Group )) aged between 45 and 70 years without a&#xD;
      previous history of cardiovascular disease and with at least one cardiovascular risk factor&#xD;
      will be randomly selected across the province of Lleida, Spain.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN AND POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized interventional study. From 2015 to 2018, 16,660 participants (8,330 in the&#xD;
      intervention group (Mobile Unit Follow-up Group) and 8,330 in the no intervention group&#xD;
      (Electronic Medical History Follow-up Group)) aged between 45 and 70 years without a previous&#xD;
      history of cardiovascular disease and with at least one cardiovascular risk factor will be&#xD;
      randomly selected across the province of Lleida, Spain. The Ethics Committee of the&#xD;
      University Hospital Arnau de Vilanova in Lleida (Spain) approved the protocol. All patients&#xD;
      signed informed consent. The study was conducted according to the principles of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND INSTRUMENTS FOR DATA COLLECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Mobile Unit (MU), clinical, sociodemographic and anthropometric data will be recorded.&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated with artery ultrasound (carotid, femoral, transcranial and&#xD;
      abdominal aorta), ankle-brachial index, pulse wave velocity, spirometry, determination of&#xD;
      advanced glycation-end products, atrial fibrillation screening, dried blood spot test and&#xD;
      urine analysis. Moreover, DNA, RNA, Saliva, blood and urine samples will be collected and&#xD;
      stored in the biobank to identify new biomarkers using omic studies. Additionally, climate,&#xD;
      air pollutant and airborne pollen data form the entire province of Lleida will be registered.&#xD;
      In addition, variables such as physical exercise, diet and daytime will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the no intervention group (Electronic Medical History Follow-up Group), participants will&#xD;
      be followed through their electronic medical records. Sociodemographic (age, sex, race,&#xD;
      marital status, education and labour status), clinical and anthropometric data and will be&#xD;
      electronically collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANT SELECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a total of 410,246 people with an open history in the e-CAP (in October 24, 2014), the&#xD;
      study population that meets the inclusion criteria will be identified. Of these, a total of&#xD;
      16,660 people (8,330 in the intervention group and 8,330 in the no intervention group) will&#xD;
      be selected through simple randomization without replacement, within clusters defined by&#xD;
      basic healthcare area, primary care (PC) centre or doctor's office, in accordance with the&#xD;
      total number of people who may be visited in the MU during one year period. The participants&#xD;
      of the selected intervention group will be informed of the study objectives and the&#xD;
      diagnostic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP PERIOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum 10-year follow-up period has been established to observe the onset of CV events. In&#xD;
      the Mobile Unit Follow-up group, a second visit will be performed after four year of&#xD;
      recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS AND CKD PROGRESSION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The onset of a CV event will be recorded according to the 10th version of the International&#xD;
      Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which includes: angina pectoris, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, heart failure, arrhythmia,&#xD;
      peripheral artery disease, aortic aneurysm, revascularization and angioplasty of any artery&#xD;
      region. Likewise, the patient's cause of death, whether of CV origin (myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      arrhythmia, heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, aortic aneurysm, mesenteric infarction&#xD;
      or sudden death) or of non-CV origin (infections, cancers, accident or kidney disease) will&#xD;
      be recorded. The information sources used to identify CV events will be: review of medical&#xD;
      records (through the e-CAP) and consultation of the Catalonia mortality registry. CKD&#xD;
      progression is defined as a doubling of creatinine or entry into renal replacement therapy,&#xD;
      and will also be collected through the e-CAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL DATA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be recorded: weight, height, waist circumference and neck&#xD;
      circumference, body mass index in kg/m2, hours of fasting, systolic blood pressure, diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure and pulse pressure (mmHg). Blood pressure will be measured 3 times (Omron 6®)&#xD;
      at 2-min intervals and the mean of the last 2 will be collected. Dried capillary blood&#xD;
      testing (fingertip puncture) will be used to determine creatinine, uric acid and total&#xD;
      cholesterol, using the reflotron® Plus system (Roche). In cases in which total cholesterol is&#xD;
      greater than 200 mg/dl, the complete lipid profile (HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and&#xD;
      triglycerides) will be determined using Cobas B 101® system, Roche. Non-HDL cholesterol&#xD;
      levels, glycated hemoglobin (Cobas B 101 system, Roche), the CKD-EPI glomerular filtration&#xD;
      rate will be determined as well. Albuminuria and albumin/creatinine ratio will be determined&#xD;
      in urine sample from spontaneous micturition collected in the MU using Clinitek Microalbumin&#xD;
      2 Reagent Strips and a Siemens Clinitek Status® analyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARTERY ULTRASOUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examination and reading will be performed by 2 nurses specialized in vascular imaging&#xD;
      diagnostics, following a standardized protocol with the patient in supine decubitus. The&#xD;
      VIVID I version BT12 ultrasound system (GE Healthcare) will be used. The system has a&#xD;
      12L-RS/4-13 MHz linear probe (carotid and femoral arteries), a 4C-RS/1.5-6 MHz convex probe&#xD;
      (abdominal aorta) and a 3SRS/ 1.5-2.5 MHz sector probe (transcranial). It also has a module&#xD;
      for measuring intima-media thickness and pulsed Doppler ultrasound to assess hemodynamic&#xD;
      abnormalities in the case that atheromatous plaques are present, and also to analyze the&#xD;
      intracranial circulation. The DICOM network connectivity system will be used to record the&#xD;
      results and ultrasound images online in the e-CAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotid arteries: a total of 8 vascular regions will be analyzed (common carotid, bifurcation&#xD;
      or bulb, internal carotid and external carotid), with the patient in supine decubitus and the&#xD;
      head turned 45º towards the opposite side in the examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Femoral arteries: with the patient in supine decubitus, the presence of plaque will be&#xD;
      examined in the common femoral artery (1 cm proximal to the bifurcation) and the superficial&#xD;
      femoral artery on both sides. The plaque definition follows the same previous criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal aorta: in men age 60 and older. With the patient in supine decubitus, the abdominal&#xD;
      aorta will be examined in the midline of the abdomen from the base of the sternum until the&#xD;
      bifurcation the iliac arteries. In an axial section, at the points where a greater diameter&#xD;
      is observed, 2 images of the aorta will be captured, and 2 measurements will be made&#xD;
      (anterior-posterior and lateral-lateral). An aortic aneurysm will be considered to be present&#xD;
      when the diameter is greater than 3 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial ultrasound: the arteries of the Willis circle and their branches will be&#xD;
      insonated through the transtemporal and transforaminal acoustic windows. The Doppler spectrum&#xD;
      of each intracranial artery will be determined using the colour-coded signal. Flow direction,&#xD;
      peak systolic velocity, mean flow velocity and diastolic flow velocity will be established.&#xD;
      The intracranial carotid artery, the medial cerebral artery in the M1 and M2 segments, the&#xD;
      anterior cerebral artery (segment A1) and the posterior cerebral artery in segments P1 and P2&#xD;
      will be studied through the transtemporal acoustic window. The V4 segment of the vertebral&#xD;
      arteries and the basilar artery will be studied through the transforaminal acoustic window.&#xD;
      In each patient, the number, location and severity of stenosis will be recorded.&#xD;
      Baumgartner's criteria will be used to establish the severity of the stenosis based on peak&#xD;
      systolic wave velocity (moderate to serious stenosis, if it is ≥155/ 220 cm/s for the medial&#xD;
      cerebral artery, ≤120/≥155 cm/s for the anterior cerebral artery, ≥100/≥145 cm/s for the&#xD;
      posterior cerebral artery and the basilar artery, and ≥90/≥120 cm/s for the vertebral&#xD;
      artery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANKLE-BRACHIAL INDEX:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A continuous Doppler (Hadecco ES100X MiniDop®), sphygmomanometer and blood pressure cuffs&#xD;
      (Riester minimus III®) will be used. Systolic blood pressure will be measured in the brachial&#xD;
      artery, posterior tibial artery and dorsalis pedis artery in both limbs. The ratios between&#xD;
      tibial and pedal systolic blood pressure in each leg and the higher brachial blood pressure&#xD;
      will be calculated. The final value for each limb will be the lower value of those obtained&#xD;
      between tibial and pedal blood pressure. An ankle-brachial index value &lt;0.9 will be&#xD;
      considered to be suggestive of stenosis; a value &lt;0.7 will be considered to be stenosis and a&#xD;
      value ≥1.4 will be considered to be suggestive of arterial rigidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPIROMETRY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry will be used to assess lung capacity. It will be performed by the same nurse who&#xD;
      will measure forced vital capacity (FVC); forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1); the&#xD;
      ratio between FEV1 and FVC and the lower limit of normality, as a percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DETERMINATION OF ADVANCED GLYCATION-END PRODUCTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be measured using skin autofluorescence (SAF) in the forearm with the AGE Reader&#xD;
      system® (Diagnostics, the Netherlands). SAF is measured using spectrophotometry which is&#xD;
      calculated as the relationship of the intensity of reflected light compared to refracted&#xD;
      light. The result obtained will be divided into 4 CV risk groups, taking into account age and&#xD;
      sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATRIAL FIBRILLATION SCREENING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of atrial fibrillation will be assessed with the SRA device® (EVINA Health&#xD;
      Solutions) for one hour in the MU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PULSE WAVE VELOCITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulse wave velocity (PWV) will be used as an indicator of arterial stiffness. It will be&#xD;
      measured non-invasively with the carotid to femoral PWV (cfPWV) according to standard&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOLOGICAL SAMPLE COLLECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples from a peripheral vein of the hand or forearm to obtain serum, plasma, DNA and&#xD;
      RNA will be collected. Moreover, a saliva sample will be collected.These samples will be&#xD;
      prepared in aliquots following a standardized protocol, and sent frozen (dry ice) to a&#xD;
      centralized biobank (IRBLleida Biobank, Spain) for processing and storage for subsequent&#xD;
      studies of CV, inflammatory and mineral-metabolism biomarkers and genetic polymorphisms.&#xD;
      Urine samples will be frozen and stored in a biobank for subsequent study of biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis will include absolute and relative frequencies for the qualitative&#xD;
      variables, means and standard deviations for the continuous variables that follow a normal&#xD;
      distribution, and median and interquartile range in the cases that do not follow a normal&#xD;
      distribution. Their distribution will be analyzed with the chi-squared test, in the case of&#xD;
      qualitative variables, and Student's t test or ANOVA for quantitative variables with a normal&#xD;
      distribution, or, failing this, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis tests will be&#xD;
      used for those without a normal distribution. The correlation between quantitative variables&#xD;
      will be analyzed using Pearson's or Spearman's test, depending on the distribution. The&#xD;
      existence of collinearity between 2 variables will be analyzed to enter the variable that&#xD;
      better predicts the result variable in the multivariate model. Multivariate analysis will be&#xD;
      performed using logistic regression if the dependent variable is qualitative or linear&#xD;
      regression if it is quantitative. Beta regression coefficients, odds ratios (ORs) and their&#xD;
      respective 95% confidence intervals will be estimated as measures of association. In the&#xD;
      longitudinal study, the incidence of CV morbidity and mortality and mortality due to any&#xD;
      cause will be analyzed, based on the diagnostic tests used in the MU and the biomarkers&#xD;
      studied using Cox regression. Statistical significance will be set at a p value &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
