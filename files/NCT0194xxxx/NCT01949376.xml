    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of potential changes in size, shape&#xD;
      and activity in some brain areas that can occur in women receiving different types of Breast&#xD;
      Cancer therapy, and how these changes are related to the development of mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment as the result of these treatments.&#xD;

      This study aims to identify neuroimaging biomarkers for predicting mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (MCI) in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemo and/or hormonal therapy by examining&#xD;
      hippocampal-cortical neurocircuitry. Adjuvant therapies increase long-term survival, but&#xD;
      produce changes in cognitive function in 30% (up to 70%) of women on average with breast&#xD;
      cancer. Cognitive decline negatively impacts quality of life in patients and their&#xD;
      supporters. Therefore, early identification of patients at risk for developing&#xD;
      treatment-related cognitive impairment is needed to develop potential prevention or treatment&#xD;
      options and prevent further decline. Our recent work demonstrates that patients receiving&#xD;
      adjuvant hormonal treatment exhibit decline in cognition as soon as three months post&#xD;
      treatment. Although neuroimaging studies have identified brain changes associated with&#xD;
      chemotherapy (&quot;chemo brain&quot;, no investigation has assessed the type and severity of such&#xD;
      changes following hormonal therapy, nor has any study determined which individuals are at&#xD;
      greatest risk for cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our central hypothesis is that measures of the hippocampal-cortical integrity can be used to&#xD;
      predict cognitive decline, and changes of specific domains of cognitive performance in&#xD;
      patients receiving adjuvant therapy over time will be related to changes in specific&#xD;
      components of this circuitry over time.&#xD;
