    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single arm, and multicenter study. The study will include the&#xD;
      following phases. A screening phase which lasts for 4 weeks to determine patient eligibility.&#xD;
      This phase will be followed by a 24 week Open label treatment phase. The study treatment is&#xD;
      defined as deferasirox 20mg/kg BID 9Twice a day). Serum Ferritin Levels and MRI (Magmetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging) LIC (Liver Iron Concentration) will be measured to evaluate the response&#xD;
      to BID.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study treatment is defined as deferasirox 20 mg/kg BID. The study treatment duration is 24&#xD;
      weeks. After the baseline visit, patient visits will occur weekly during the first month&#xD;
      because key safety parameters need to be performed weekly in the first month of treatment and&#xD;
      then every 4 weeks thereafter until week 24 End of Treatment (EOT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have their first dose of study treatment at Visit 3. Safety assessments are&#xD;
      routinely performed including collection of AEs (Adverse Events), SAEs (Serious ADverse&#xD;
      Events&lt;, vital signs, physical examination, ECG (Electrocardiograph), hematological and&#xD;
      biochemistry assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will continue therapy until intolerable toxicity, patient decision or after 24 weeks&#xD;
      treatment duration at which point and End of Treatment (EOT) visit will be performed and the&#xD;
      End of Treatment CRF( Case Report Form) will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 day Safety follow-up Patients who discontinue study drug before completing the study&#xD;
      should be scheduled for a visit as soon as possible, at which time all of the assessments&#xD;
      listed for the final visit will be performed. At a minimum, all patients who discontinue&#xD;
      study treatment, including those who refuse to return for a final visit, will be contacted&#xD;
      for safety evaluations during the 30 days following the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients must be followed for AEs and SAEs that may have occurred after discontinuation&#xD;
      from the study treatment. The safety follow-up visit will take place 30 days after the last&#xD;
      dose of study drug.&#xD;
