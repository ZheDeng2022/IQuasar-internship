      BHOMA Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of the BHOMA intervention on health in 3&#xD;
      rural districts of Zambia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BHOMA study includes systematic program implementation designed to contribute to&#xD;
      generalizable knowledge and evaluation of this program. The program aims to improve primary&#xD;
      health care through an integrated package of interventions, at both health facility and&#xD;
      community level, centered on improving the patient -provider interface which is considered to&#xD;
      be key to improving health outcomes. The primary objective of this research is to assess the&#xD;
      impact of the BHOMA intervention on health in three rural districts of Zambia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives include: to understand the causal pathways of the BHOMA interventions by analyzing&#xD;
      inputs, processes, outputs, and outcomes; to measure the cost of the BHOMA interventions; and&#xD;
      to measure whether the health system has been strengthened by the BHOMA interventions. The&#xD;
      endpoints of the study will be measured by a combination of facility surveys, facility health&#xD;
      worker and community health worker interviews, quality assessments, qualitative studies and&#xD;
      community surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves 7 stepped introduction of the programme in 48 facilities. A step typically&#xD;
      involves initiation of a set of selected health facilities and the communities they serve. On&#xD;
      average, 6 randomly selected sites are involved in a step. Facility workers are trained;&#xD;
      community health workers, clinic support worker and traditional birth attendants are&#xD;
      identified and trained through a month-long Ministry of Health (MOH) approved course.&#xD;
      Equipment for data collection and electronic capture are set up, filing systems established&#xD;
      and the study begins when the tools get implemented. Close supervision is provided for at&#xD;
      least a month following initiation; there after regular supervisory visits are done by six&#xD;
      quality improvement teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic Intervention, implemented by the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia&#xD;
      (CIDRZ) BHOMA program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinic intervention consists of the following 5 components: 1) the implementation of&#xD;
      clinical care forms and accompanying job aids, 2) resources, to includes equipment, supplies,&#xD;
      staffing and infrastructure, 3) clinic implementation, which involves a quality improvement&#xD;
      team working at the clinic to introduce the new patient flow system and to improve the skills&#xD;
      of clinic staff, 4) the use of electronic information for performance assessment, which&#xD;
      involves implementing an electronic data entry system within the clinics and 5) supportive&#xD;
      mentoring, which will involve the Quality Improvement (QI) team reviewing patient charts for&#xD;
      appropriate screening, diagnostics, treatment or follow-up, attending patient visits,&#xD;
      identifying equipment or infrastructure issues, and reviewing clinic performance reports and&#xD;
      updating the clinic's quality improvement strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community Intervention, implemented by the CIDRZ BHOMA program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The community intervention aims to expand the availability of community-based health services&#xD;
      and improve the quality of these services with the use of three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community Health Workers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will engage one community health worker (CHW) per Neighborhood Health&#xD;
      Committee to conduct patient follow-up and household assessments. The CHWs will use two forms&#xD;
      - patient follow-up form and a household assessment form, and will be trained to assess which&#xD;
      patients need referral to the clinic or hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional Birth Attendants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will offer training for traditional birth attendants (TBAs) working near&#xD;
      the implementation clinics. The training will review the goals of facility delivery and&#xD;
      introduce a pregnancy referral form for TBAs. The investigators will encourage the TBA to&#xD;
      help the patient arrive at the clinic, and provide incentives for the TBAs for clinic&#xD;
      referrals. The investigators will also train the TBAs to follow up all pregnancies in the&#xD;
      first month to assess the infant and teach the mother about when it is appropriate to bring&#xD;
      the infant to the clinic. TBAs will complete infant follow-up forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neighborhood Heath Committees (NHC):&#xD;
&#xD;
      These committees will complete a community health event register, during which they will&#xD;
      capture information about serious sicknesses and deaths that are not recorded at the clinics.&#xD;
      Each NHC will visit households and return their register to the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These activities will continue throughout the duration of the funded project.&#xD;

    <description>The sample size is based on a mortality rate for those aged&lt;60 years of 20/1000 person years, each of 3 cross sectional surveys recruits 150 households of whom 6 members are aged &lt;60 years, and births and deaths within the household in the last 12 months are ascertained. For a values of k between 0.2 and 0.3 there is at least 90% power to detect a 35% reduction in mortality, and for k=0.35 there is approximately 87% power.</description>
