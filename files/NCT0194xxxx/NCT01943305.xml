  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemic viral diseases have become more prevalent in recent years. Among the various&#xD;
      strategies to prevent such epidemics, vaccination is the most cost-effective. However,&#xD;
      populations that are immunized are typically already exposed to multiple previous&#xD;
      vaccinations or natural infections. Studies from this and other laboratories have revealed&#xD;
      that pre-existing dengue antibodies can either inhibit or enhance subsequent dengue infection&#xD;
      depending on the pre-existing antibody levels. While cross-reactive antibody is potentially&#xD;
      pathogenic in dengue, how it impacts immune response to vaccination is unclear. Indeed,&#xD;
      aggregated at the site of vaccination and the respective draining lymph nodes are&#xD;
      antigen-presenting and immune regulatory cells that express Fc receptors and play pivotal&#xD;
      roles in determining the magnitude and polarity of the immune response. Vaccine uptake by&#xD;
      these antigen-presenting cells may thus be either inhibited or enhanced when vaccines are&#xD;
      opsonized with cross-reactive antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the limited knowledge on how cross-reactive antibodies affect vaccination outcome,&#xD;
      investigators propose here a study that exploits the known cross reactivity between Japanese&#xD;
      encephalitis (JE) virus antibody and yellow fever (YF) vaccine. Investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that cross-reactive antibodies impacts antibody response to YF at the point vaccination in a&#xD;
      concentration-dependent manner by altering both vaccine uptake and the innate immune response&#xD;
      by antigen presenting cells. Investigators will structure an open label clinical trial on&#xD;
      sequential vaccination with JE and YF vaccines, with different time intervals between&#xD;
      vaccinations. This would test immune response to YF vaccination in subjects with different&#xD;
      titer of cross-reactive JE vaccine-derived antibodies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to examine the role of cross-reactive&#xD;
      antibodies in modulating immune responses to vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hypothesis: Antibody response to YF vaccination is influenced by the heterologous&#xD;
           antibody titer at the point of YF vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis : Heterologous antibody to YF affect magnitude of vaccine uptake through the&#xD;
           Fc receptors and alters the quality and magnitude of the innate immune response&#xD;
           following YF vaccination, which has been previously shown to predictive of immune&#xD;
           response to YF vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine neutralizing antibody response to YF vaccination in human volunteers at&#xD;
           different time intervals following a prior JE vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize the innate immune response to YF vaccination at different time intervals&#xD;
           after a prior JE vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 100 healthy adults, pre-screened to be negative for anti-dengue antibodies will be&#xD;
      enrolled upon written informed consent. 75 subjects in the test arm will received 2 doses of&#xD;
      inactivated JE vaccine(Ixiaro), while 25 subjects in the control arm has no JE vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the test arm will be sub-divided into 3 groups who receive YF17D:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group1.YF vaccination 1-month post-JE vaccination Group 2.YF vaccination 4-months post-JE&#xD;
      vaccination Group 3.YF vaccination 9-months post-JE vaccination Subjects in the control arm&#xD;
      (group 4) will receive YF vaccination at the same time as group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling in relation to YF17D vaccination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 1-day after&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 3-days after (+ 1 day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 1-week after (± 2 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 1-month after (± 5 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 1-year after (± 14 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-point: Difference in geometric mean titre of YF17D neutralizing antibody.&#xD;
