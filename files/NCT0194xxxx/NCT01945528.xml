  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Tendinopathy is a difficult problem to manage and can result in significant&#xD;
      patient morbidity. Currently, the clinical use of PRP in painful tendons is widespread but&#xD;
      its efficacy remains controversial. Current experimental research postulates different&#xD;
      efficiency among PRP formulations.Recent reviews showed that most clinical studies in&#xD;
      tendinopathies have been performed with L-PRP. The investigators aim to examine the efficacy&#xD;
      of pure-PRP in the management of epicondylitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that pure PRP associated to needling intervention can enhance&#xD;
      tendon healing in epicondylitis, improve function and reduce pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and design Randomized double blind controlled trial, a total of 80 patients will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated into one of two groups: PRP or control. Interventions: PRP group,&#xD;
      ultrasound (US)guided needling associated to delivery of multiple PRP depots each alternate&#xD;
      week for a total of two interventions. Control Group: US-guided needling with lidocaine each&#xD;
      alternate week for a total of two interventions. Main outcome measure: Changes in pain and&#xD;
      activity levels, as assessed by Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH)outcome&#xD;
      measure score, before and six months after intervention.The primary end-point is 25%&#xD;
      reduction in DASH. The investigators will compare the percentage of patients, in each group,&#xD;
      that achieve a successful treatment defined as a reduction of at least 25% in the DASH score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures:Changes in pain and function as assessed by DASH and changes in&#xD;
      pain as assessed by the visual analogue scale (VAS)at the 3, 6 and 12 month follow-up.&#xD;
      Changes in sonographic features and neovascularity at 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
