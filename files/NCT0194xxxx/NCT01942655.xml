  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progressive HIV or HIV infection seems to be related to a preferential loss of CD4+ T&#xD;
      lymphocytes, especially Th17+, within the mucosal intestinal lymphoid tissue, and with&#xD;
      intestinal mucosal damage and bacterial product translocation, which correlates with the&#xD;
      hyperactivation of the immune system, therefore with CD4+ T cell loss and prognosis. The&#xD;
      objectives of this project are to investigate the correlation between the IL12/IL-23&#xD;
      imbalance and bacterial product translocation, and to study the polarization, infection or&#xD;
      depletion of intestinal Th17 ex vivo. The investigators will test the effect of neutralizing&#xD;
      anti-IL23 antibodies directed against p40, or less classically, anti- IL-23 p19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Th17 lymphocytes fight bacterial and fungal intestinal infections. Under combined&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy, even if the plasma viral load is undetectable, hyperactivation can&#xD;
      persist, inducing localized replication from reservoirs. In humans, Th17 lymphocyte&#xD;
      differentiation and expansion depend on IL-23. The investigators were the first to uncover an&#xD;
      imbalance in the respective production of IL-12 and IL-23 in response to Lipopolysaccharide&#xD;
      (LPS) in HIV-1 infected patients. IL-23 and its receptor are implicated in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) like Crohn's disease, where the mucosa is&#xD;
      altered by Th17 cells, inducing bacterial product translocation. IBD can be efficiently&#xD;
      treated by antibodies directed against Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) or, in current&#xD;
      clinical trials, against the p40 chain which is shared by IL-12 and IL-23. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      these antibodies inhibit also IL-12. IL-12 is crucial against mycobacteria, which are&#xD;
      opportunistic in HIV-infected patients. Antibodies directed against the p19 chain of IL-23&#xD;
      would inhibit Th17 activation more specifically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect blood and recto-colic biopsies from 15 healthy donors, 15&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients with a viral load higher than 5000 copies/ml and 15 patients with&#xD;
      evolutive IBD, to establish a parallel between the two diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this project are to study if there is a correlation between the IL12/IL-23&#xD;
      imbalance and bacterial product translocation, and to investigate the polarization, infection&#xD;
      or depletion of intestinal Th17 ex vivo. Investigators will test the effect of neutralizing&#xD;
      anti-IL23 antibodies directed against p40, or less classically, anti- IL-23 p19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If these correlations are validated, the investigators will propose anti-IL-23 neutralizing&#xD;
      treatment to allow Th17 and intestinal integrity to come back into balance, and therefore to&#xD;
      break the vicious cycle of immune system hyperactivation drawn by bacterial translocation.&#xD;
