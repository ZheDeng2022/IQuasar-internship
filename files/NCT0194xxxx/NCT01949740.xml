      This pilot research trial studies patient preferences in making treatment decisions in&#xD;
      patients with stage I-IVA oropharyngeal cancer. Questionnaires that measure patient&#xD;
      priorities before and after treatment may improve the ability to plan for better quality of&#xD;
      life in patients with oropharyngeal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the stability of Head and Neck Priorities Scale (HNPS) ranking between pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Use patient-interviews to refine and modify the HNPS for use in a larger scale trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Pilot the Head and Neck Patient Outcomes Survey (HNPOS) as a potential tool to identify&#xD;
      priorities most important to quality-of-life outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Use the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head and Neck (FACT-H&amp;N) and&#xD;
      EurolQoL-5D to determine the validity of the HNPOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participate in a 45-minute interview comprising assessment of priorities and quality&#xD;
      of life at baseline, 1, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Stability of HNPS ranking between pre- and post-treatment assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of patients for whom the domain was considered stable calculated. Exact binomial tests will be used to test whether each proportion is greater than 50%.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reliability of HNPPQ scale, in terms of test-retest and internal consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Weighted kappa coefficients will serve as the measure of agreement between the two replicates. Cronbach's alpha will be used to assess internal consistency.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Validity of HNPOS</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Nine HNPOS items will be compared to corresponding items on the FACT H&amp;N scale. For each item, Kendall's tau-c will be computed for a measure of association suitable for contingency analyses of two ordinal variables.</description>
