  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, Phase IV prospective, observational study will evaluate patients, who have&#xD;
      been diagnosed with Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration and have previously received&#xD;
      either a standard intravitreal injection of ranibizumab or aflibercept, in order to get and&#xD;
      compare information regarding post-injection inflammatory (irritation in the eye)2-3 days&#xD;
      post-injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, patients will be evaluated for visual acuity and pain 2-3 days post-injection.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2-3 days after injection</time_frame>
    <description>All eyes will be evaluated 2-3 days after injection and graded in terms of (a) aqueous cells, graded subjectively on a scale of 0-4, (b) aqueous flare, graded subjectively on a scale 0-4, (c) aqueous flare graded objectively with the FM-600 Kowa flare meter and (d) vitreous haze, graded subjectively on a scale of 0-4.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate patients 2-3 days post-injection for best corrected visual acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 days post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>Best corrected visual acuity will be assessed by the number of letters read correctly on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study eye chart at a starting test distance of 4 meters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate patient's pain post-injection</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 days post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be measured on a standardized pain scale; Visual Function Questionaire -25 and a 0-10 numeric pain scale.</description>
