  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40-60 % of cutaneous melanomas select for a mutation in a protein called BRAF&#xD;
      which is part of a signaling pathway called the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK)&#xD;
      pathway. When BRAF is mutated the MAPK pathway remains active allowing for melanoma to grow.&#xD;
      Vemurafenib is an oral treatment which blocks the activity of BRAF which leads to decreasing&#xD;
      the activity of the MAPK pathway. When patients with melanoma expressing specific mutation in&#xD;
      BRAF are treated with vemurafenib approximately 50% will develop a response to treatment with&#xD;
      shrinkage of tumor. When compared to a standard chemotherapy called dacarbazine used to treat&#xD;
      melanoma, treatment with vemurafenib leads to a statistically significant overall survival or&#xD;
      living longer benefit. Because of this survival benefit vemurafenib was Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma expressing a BRAF&#xD;
      mutation called V600E BRAF. There is increasing evidence that the immune system can also be&#xD;
      important in affecting melanoma growth and survival and there are immune treatments FDA&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. There is some limited evidence that&#xD;
      blocking BRAF with vemurafenib may affect the activity of components of the immune system. It&#xD;
      is important to better characterize and understand the effects of vemurafenib treatment on&#xD;
      various components of the immune system. The purpose of this study is to systematically&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of vemurafenib treatment (at FDA approved dosing regimen) on parts of&#xD;
      the immune systems called the innate and adaptive immune systems. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      vemurafenib treatment will affect the immune system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40-60 % of cutaneous melanomas select for a mutation in the BRAF protein which&#xD;
      is part of a signaling pathway called the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway.&#xD;
      Over 90% of mutations in BRAF occur at position V600 with the most common being a V600E&#xD;
      mutation. Mutation at position V600 of BRAF activates the MAPK pathway which facilitates&#xD;
      melanoma proliferation and growth. The response rate to treatment with vemurafenib in&#xD;
      patients with stage IV melanoma expressing a V600E BRAF mutation is approximately 50%. A&#xD;
      phase III study comparing first line treatment with vemurafenib compared to standard&#xD;
      dacarbazine chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant overall survival benefit in&#xD;
      this patient population. Based on this survival benefit vemurafenib was FDA approved for&#xD;
      treatment of stage IV melanoma expressing a V600E BRAF mutation. Vemurafenib is administered&#xD;
      at a dose of 960 milligrams orally twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While targeting BRAF can lead to survival benefits in patients with melanoma expressing BRAF&#xD;
      mutation it is becoming increasingly apparent that the immune system is important in&#xD;
      modulating the growth of melanoma. As such there are immune therapies FDA approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of stage IV melanoma including ipilimumab which confers an overall survival benefit&#xD;
      by activating the immune system through inhibition of the CTLA-4 protein expressed on certain&#xD;
      T-cells. Little is known about how the exposure of different classes of immune cells to&#xD;
      vemurafenib modulates the activity of the immune system. We do know that many melanomas&#xD;
      express differentiation antigens which could potentially be recognized by the immune system.&#xD;
      This recognition could potentially be utilized in the development of novel immunotherapeutic&#xD;
      treatment approaches. The pharmacologic inhibition of the MAPK pathway does lead to increased&#xD;
      expression of various melanoma differentiation antigens along with improved recognition by&#xD;
      antigen-specific T-lymphocytes. Evaluation of a limited number of tumor biopsy specimens&#xD;
      suggest that the infiltration of melanomas by CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes markedly increases&#xD;
      following treatment with a BRAF inhibitor. Furthermore the viability and function (determined&#xD;
      using assays for cytokine release assays and cytotoxic activity) of T-lymphocytes was not&#xD;
      negatively affected by exposure to vemurafenib at concentrations known to cause anti-tumor&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MAPK pathway is a pathway utilized by many cell types including immune cells and cells in&#xD;
      the tumor microenvironment. As such vemurafenib could potentially modulate the activity of&#xD;
      the MAPK pathway in the melanoma cells, immune cells, and components of the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment. Effects of vemurafenib on tumor cells may directly lead to changes in&#xD;
      antigen presentation and effects on the innate and adaptive immune systems could potentially&#xD;
      alter recognition of tumor cells and modulate positively or negatively immune recognition and&#xD;
      antitumor activity. Therefore, a better understanding of immune modulation induced by&#xD;
      anti-BRAF therapy should provide data to model and develop in a more rational fashion&#xD;
      therapies which combine BRAF targeted and immune modulatory agents potentially using such&#xD;
      agents as ipilimumab or anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 antibodies.&#xD;
