    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators are trying to see if infusion of T cells (called CTLs) will&#xD;
      prevent or treat cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) and adenovirus (AdV)&#xD;
      reactivation or infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with blood cell cancer, other blood disease or a genetic disease may receive a stem&#xD;
      cell transplant. After receiving transplant, they are at risk of infections until a new&#xD;
      immune system to fight infections grows from the cord blood cells. In this study,&#xD;
      investigators are trying to give special cells called T cells. These cells will try to fight&#xD;
      viruses that can cause infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will test to see if blood cells from donor that have been grown in a special&#xD;
      way, can prevent patients from getting an infection. EBV, AdV and CMV are viruses that can&#xD;
      cause serious life-threatening infections in patients who have weak immune systems after&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T lymphocytes can kill viral cells but normally there are not enough of them to kill all the&#xD;
      virus infected cells after transplant. Some researcher have taken T cells from a person's&#xD;
      blood, grown more of them in the laboratory and then given them back to the person during a&#xD;
      viral infection after a bone marrow transplant. Some of these studies have shown a positive&#xD;
      therapeutic effect in patients receiving the CTLs after a viral infection in the&#xD;
      post-transplant period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will grow these cells from donor in the laboratory in a way that will train&#xD;
      them to recognize and remove viruses when the T cells are given after a transplant. Since&#xD;
      most donors have previously been infected with EBV, CMV, and adenovirus, investigators are&#xD;
      able to use their T cells that remember these viruses to grow the CTLs. However, they now&#xD;
      also have a new way of growing CTLs from donors who have not been infected with CMV.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Viral infections are normally controlled by T-cell immunity and so are an important cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality during the period of immune recovery after hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT).1 Risk for infection is impacted by the degree of tissue mismatch&#xD;
      between donor and recipient and the immune status of the donor, including the degree and&#xD;
      length of immunosuppression following transplantation. Reactivation of latent viruses such as&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are common and often cause symptomatic&#xD;
      disease. Respiratory viruses such as adenovirus also frequently cause infection. Antiviral&#xD;
      pharmacologic agents are only effective against some of these viruses; their use is costly,&#xD;
      and associated with significant toxicities and the outgrowth of drug-resistant mutants. As&#xD;
      delay in recovery of virus-specific cellular immune response is clearly associated with viral&#xD;
      reactivation and disease in these patients, cellular immunotherapy to restore viral-specific&#xD;
      immunity is an attractive option that has already been successfully used to target some of&#xD;
      these viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivirus-Specific T Cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      To broaden the specificity of single CTL lines to include the three most common viral&#xD;
      pathogens of stem cell recipients, investigators reactivated CMV and adenovirus-specific T&#xD;
      cells by using mononuclear cells transduced with a recombinant adenoviral vector encoding the&#xD;
      CMV antigen pp65 (Ad5f35CMVpp65). Subsequent stimulations with EBV-LCL transduced with the&#xD;
      same vector both reactivated EBV-specific T cells and maintained the expansion of the&#xD;
      activated adenovirus and CMV-specific T cells. This method reliably produced CTLs with&#xD;
      cytotoxic function specific for all three viruses, which investigators infused into 14 stem&#xD;
      cell recipients in a Phase I prophylaxis study. They observed recovery of immunity to CMV and&#xD;
      EBV in all patients but an increase in adenovirus-specific T cells was only seen in patients&#xD;
      who had evidence of adenovirus infection pre-infusion. A follow-up study in which the&#xD;
      frequency of adenovirus-specific T cells was increased in the infused CTLs produced similar&#xD;
      results, thus highlighting the importance of endogenous antigen to promote the expansion of&#xD;
      infused T cells in vivo. Nevertheless, all patients in both clinical trials with pre-infusion&#xD;
      CMV, adenovirus or EBV infection or reactivation were able to clear the infection, including&#xD;
      one patient with severe adenoviral pneumonia requiring ventilatory support. CTLs recognizing&#xD;
      multiple antigens can therefore produce clinically relevant effects against all three&#xD;
      viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTLs for HSCT patients with virus naïve donors&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the donor specific T cell strategies discussed so far have utilized products derived from&#xD;
      donors who are seropositive for the virus of interest. With the increasing use of cord blood&#xD;
      (CB) grafts there are appreciable numbers of patients who are recipients of virus naïve donor&#xD;
      grafts. CMV reactivation usually occurs from endogenous virus and seropositive recipients&#xD;
      with seronegative donors remain the highest risk group for developing CMV. The development of&#xD;
      multivirus specific T cells from recipients of cord blood grafts requires the priming of&#xD;
      naïve T-cells rather than the simple expansion of pre-existing memory T-cells from&#xD;
      seropositive donors. Using a protocol stimulating CB-derived T-cells with autologous&#xD;
      CB-derived dendritic cells and EBV-LCL transduced with the Ad5f35CMVpp65 vector in the&#xD;
      presence of IL-7, 12 and 15, multivirus specific T cells can be primed in vitro from the 20%&#xD;
      fraction of a cord blood unit. So far, eight patients have received CTL as prophylaxis or&#xD;
      treatment after CBT without toxicity. No infusion-related toxicities/GvHD have been observed&#xD;
      and despite receiving only 80% of the CB unit, all patients engrafted neutrophils within 30&#xD;
      days. Early evidence of efficacy has also been demonstrated with clearance of EBV, CMV and&#xD;
      adenovirus in two patients and decreasing EBV viral load in a third with the other 5 patients&#xD;
      remaining virus free. Therefore, these results suggest that transfer of naïve T cell&#xD;
      (CB)-derived virus specific T cells to patients after CBT may be safe and facilitate long&#xD;
      term reconstitution of virus-specific T-cells in vivo.&#xD;
