  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disorder that adversely affects most&#xD;
      aspects of everyday life in majority of patients. It has a prevalence of up to 3-4% of adults&#xD;
      and up to 25% among children. AD has a complex pathogenesis, characterized by: 1) immune&#xD;
      activation with increased numbers of T-cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and increased expression&#xD;
      of inflammatory molecules 2) marked epidermal hyperplasia in chronic diseased skin, and 3)&#xD;
      defective barrier function with increased trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) and decreased&#xD;
      lipids, reflecting underlying alterations in keratinocyte differentiation. AD is&#xD;
      predominantly a Th2 (IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31) disease, and recently was also found to be a&#xD;
      &quot;T22&quot; (IL-22) polarized disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ILV-094 is an anti IL-22 antibody and therefore should reverse the immune activation of AD.&#xD;
      This study is being done to assess the safety, tolerability, clinical efficacy, and mechanism&#xD;
      of action of ILV-094 in patients with AD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study of six IV infusions of ILV-094&#xD;
      administered to subjects with atopic dermatitis. Sixty subjects will be randomly assigned in&#xD;
      a 2:1 ratio to one of the two treatments arms (ILV-094 vs placebo). Forty patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the ILV-094 treatment arm and 20 in the placebo-treatment arm, accordingly. A&#xD;
      loading IV dose of 600 mg of ILV-094 or placebo will be given at baseline (Day 0), followed&#xD;
      by five additional IV doses of 300 mg of ILV-094 or placebo every two weeks (Weeks 2, 4, 6,&#xD;
      8, and 10). We will continue to follow the patients every two weeks for an additional 10&#xD;
      weeks after the last IV dose (20 weeks post baseline).&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage Change in SCORAD</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage Change in the Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) at week 12 compared to baseline in both arms of the study in subjects with atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
SCORAD (Severity scoring of Atopic Dermatitis) is composite severity index comprising a) the amount/extent of body surface area affected, b) subjective symptom visual analog assessments [itchy 0 (no itching) to 3 (severe itching) and sleep disturbance 0(no sleep disturbance) to 3 (severe sleep disturbance)], and c) 6 disease intensity assessments [dryness/scaling, erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, lichenification and oozing/weeping/crusting, each graded from 0 to (none) to 3 (severe). A SCORAD score ranges from 0 (no AD present) to 103 (severe).</description>

    <measure>The Percentage of Patients Who Achieve an Improvement of 50% or Greater From Their Baseline Objective SCORAD at Week 12 of ILV-094 Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SCORAD50 captures individuals who achieved 50% or greater improvement from baseline SCORAD score. This outcome measure is the percentage of participants who achieved SCORAD50 at week 12. This analysis will be performed using fisher exact test. Patients who drop-out will be considered treatment failures (non-responder approach). A sensitivity analysis will be carried out using data as observed.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Category 3: Cyclosporine and/or Other Immunomodulators (Methotrexate, CellCept, and&#xD;
             Immuran).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A washout period from cyclosporine and/or oral steroids of 4 weeks and from&#xD;
             phototherapy of 2 weeks prior to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A washout period of at least 1 week prior to baseline will also be required for&#xD;
             patients that responded, but did not sustain response to strong topical steroids (i.e&#xD;
             clobetasol) or topical immune modulators (i.e Protopic, and Elidel).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patients will be allowed to use topical therapy during the washout period. These&#xD;
             will include emollients, and mild steroids (class 6 or 7), except on one target area&#xD;
             that will be the site for the skin biopsies.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A washout period of at least 1 week prior to baseline will also be required for&#xD;
             patients that responded, but did not sustain response to strong topical steroids (i.e&#xD;
             clobetasol) or topical immune modulators (i.e protopic, and elidel).&#xD;

        consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives,&#xD;
        some intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUD's), sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized&#xD;
        partner. Likewise, sexually active men must also use appropriate methods of birth control&#xD;
        (e.g., abstinence, barrier methods with spermicide, or have had surgical sterilization such&#xD;
        as vasectomy).&#xD;

        to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Willingness to avoid alcohol intake 48 hours before each visit in which study drug will be&#xD;
        received, in order to avoid increases in liver function tests (LFTs) (this was an exclusion&#xD;
        in other ILV-094 studies in order to guard against increased LFTs due to alcohol intake&#xD;
        being attributed to study drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of active or latent serious infections (TB, or other granulomatous disorders such&#xD;
        as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, etc). Skin colonization by Staph. aureus is expected&#xD;
        in a high percentage of atopic patients with active disease and will not be considered as&#xD;
        an exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        *Patients with a history of a positive PPD that have received prophylaxis will be permitted&#xD;
        to enroll into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Have documented current active hepatitis B (surface antigen positive or asymptomatic&#xD;
        chronic carriers) or a history of hepatitis C infection (anti-HCV positive), by history&#xD;
        and/or screening test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have a history of substance abuse (drug or alcohol) within the past year before screening.&#xD;

        or otherwise interfere with the patient's participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women or women that are breast feeding or plan to breast feed.&#xD;
&#xD;
