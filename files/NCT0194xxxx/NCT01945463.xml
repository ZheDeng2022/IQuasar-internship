  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast augmentation surgery is currently the most common elective plastic surgery performed&#xD;
      in the US. With regards to the surgical technique, there are 4 incisional sites available for&#xD;
      breast augmentation, each with its advantages and disadvantages: Axillary, Periareolar,&#xD;
      inframammary, and umbilical. The implant is inserted in either a subglandular (beneath breast&#xD;
      tissue), submuscular (underneath the Pectoralis Major), or &quot;dual-plane&quot; (combination of both)&#xD;
      manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography is the most commonly used diagnostic test in cardiology for the evaluation&#xD;
      of cardiac structure and function. Its use has increased dramatically in the last decades. We&#xD;
      have encountered three women with congenital heart disease who have undergone breast&#xD;
      augmentation, and their echocardiographic images were significantly limited after the&#xD;
      implantation. There is only one case report in the medical literature suggesting that breast&#xD;
      implants interfere with echocardiographic views .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying physical property of the silicone breast implants that causes interference&#xD;
      with the ultrasound beam during echocardiographic examination is not known and has not been&#xD;
      studied. Similar to air in the lung but to a lesser degree, silicone breast implants appear&#xD;
      to prevent penetration of ultrasound beams. The poor penetration appears to be persistent and&#xD;
      unrevealing despite increase in gain or change in the ultrasound wave's frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many women elect breast augmentation for cosmetic reasons. Women with congenital heart&#xD;
      disease who have undergone cardiac surgery may have breast asymmetry or distortion and desire&#xD;
      augmentation accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge of the extent of impairment of breast implants to the echocardiographic examination&#xD;
      is important for few reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Women with heart disease who need echocardiographic follow up and wish to undergo breast&#xD;
           augmentation should be consulted as to the limitation of the echocardiographic&#xD;
           examination following the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Women without heart disease considering breast augmentation should be informed of&#xD;
           potential echocardiographic interference, if echocardiography be needed in the future,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Different surgical techniques may cause different masking effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Different implants size and shape may cause different masking effect.&#xD;
