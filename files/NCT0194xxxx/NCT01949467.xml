    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of iron overload is a common problem. It is important to optimize the diagnosis&#xD;
      to ensure support for patients and their relatives especially regarding genetic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron overload revealed by a high level of serum ferritin and confirmed by the presence of an&#xD;
      excessive amount of iron in the liver is a frequent situation. In a lot of case there is no&#xD;
      increase in serum iron and transferrin saturation. This situation may arise in particular in&#xD;
      patients with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a genetic iron overload related to mutation in the ferroportine gene, leading to a&#xD;
           ferroportin disease. The diagnosis is based on the sequencing of the gene,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis, the most frequent situation , where iron overload is&#xD;
           associated with abnormalities in the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats, whereas no&#xD;
           genetic cause is identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, patients often have similar biological signs and despite the implementation of&#xD;
      strict algorithm regarding the diagnostic procedure, it appears that a large number of&#xD;
      patients are tested for the mutation in the ferroportin gene, and that mutation is not found&#xD;
      in most cases. It is therefore essential to optimize the diagnosis process by introducing&#xD;
      additional criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' hypothesis, based on the known elements, is that the response to a single&#xD;
      dose of iron will modulate differently the iron parameters measured in serum, including&#xD;
      hepcidin level which controls iron metabolism and metals associated with iron. This could be&#xD;
      helpful for diagnosis procedure in patients with ferroportin disease or dysmetabolic&#xD;
      hepatosiderosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The quantification of serum hepcidin level is a potential method of investigation in iron&#xD;
      metabolism disorders. However, apart from some extreme situations, the assay achieved solely&#xD;
      is not helpful. This is due to the varying levels encountered from one subject to another for&#xD;
      the same disease. This is related to the facts that values considered to be normal cover a&#xD;
      wide range and that a value obtained for a given patient at a given time, can be influenced&#xD;
      by many factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that a a single oral iron dose induced an increase of serum hepcidin&#xD;
      level in healthy subjects which is abolished in subjects with genetic hemochromatosis linked&#xD;
      to insufficient hepcidin expression related to mutations in the HFE or TFR2 genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with a dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis, it was suggested that the expected&#xD;
      hepcidinemia increase found after an iron intake was altered, likely due to a slight&#xD;
      inflammatory signal responsible for hepcidin induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a dynamic response of iron parameters, including&#xD;
      modulation of hepcidin level, to an iron intake will allow to discriminate patients with&#xD;
      ferroportin disease or dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis, situations whose clinicobiological&#xD;
      presentation is often confusing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the three objectives in this study will be :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To define pharmacokinetic characteristics of serum hepcidin in response to iron oral&#xD;
           intake and to determine the ability of this pharmacokinetic to discriminate dysmetabolic&#xD;
           hepatosiderosis and ferroportin disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To correlate amplitude of this response to the iron parameters modulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To correlate amplitude of this response to the concentration of divalent cations whose&#xD;
           metabolism uses common genes to those involved in iron metabolism.&#xD;
