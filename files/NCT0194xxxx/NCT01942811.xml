    <textblock>
      The goal of the US-Mexico Binational Quit Using Drugs Intervention Trial (QUIT) is a&#xD;
      multi-site study conducted in the US (East Los Angeles) and Mexico (Tijuana) which aims to&#xD;
      reduce drug demand on both sides of the border. The study also aims to build a collaborative&#xD;
      partnership between the US and Mexico research teams. The Bi-National QUIT Study will conduct&#xD;
      a randomized control trial for risky drug use in several Los Angeles area community health&#xD;
      centers. The intent of the trial is to interrupt the progression to addiction for the casual&#xD;
      and occasional users of illicit drugs and non-medical users of pharmaceuticals. The&#xD;
      Bi-National QUIT protocol will include (1) a computerized assessment of the patient's&#xD;
      drug-use history (2) very brief (&lt;5 minutes) clinician advice during a patients pre-arranged&#xD;
      medical visit which will be preceded by a computerized assessment of the patient's drug-use&#xD;
      history (3) a post visit assessment and video doctor (repeating the very brief clinician&#xD;
      advice) in the waiting room (4) two post-visit telephone drug-use counseling sessions to be&#xD;
      conducted by drug-health educators at approximately 2 and 6 weeks after the start of the&#xD;
      intervention. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 3 months post-randomization.&#xD;
      Parallel activities will take place in the U.S./Los Angeles sites and Mexico/Tijuana sites.&#xD;
      Data will be shared between both teams. Data analysis will be collaboratively conducted by&#xD;
      both teams.&#xD;

    <description>The goal of the Quit Using Drugs Intervention Trial (QUIT) is to conduct a small RCT of a primary care clinic-based very brief intervention protocol for reducing the use of illegal drugs and the occurrences of drug-related harm in low-income, racially-diverse patient populations at two 'safety-net' clinics in Los Angeles. The design will emphasize screening, very brief clinician advice, and telephone drug-use health education to reduce 'at risk' drug use and thus interrupt progression from casual or episodic abuse to dependence.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        US Sites: Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy. Women who report being pregnant at the time of randomization will be&#xD;
             excluded from participation. This latter exclusion criterion is based on the following&#xD;
             reasons: (a) The interaction of drug use (in any amount) and fetal-maternal health is&#xD;
             physiologically complex and beyond the scope of this proposed intervention. (b) Drug&#xD;
             users who are pregnant are considered high-risk pregnancies and will likely be lost to&#xD;
             follow-up during the study as they will be promptly referred by their primary care&#xD;
             clinician to an obstetrician per usual clinic protocol. However, enrolled patients who&#xD;
             become pregnant after the intervention will not be withdrawn. Their eventual exits&#xD;
             from the study will be counted as drop-outs and will be included as &quot;no change&quot; in our&#xD;
             &quot;intent to treat&quot; analysis. Finally, (c) a tailored brief intervention protocol for&#xD;
             pregnant women may require more than simple clinician advice and a 2-session phone&#xD;
             health education program. Such an intervention would be more effective if designed&#xD;
             around the activities of prenatal care. Previous RCTs of problem alcohol use targeting&#xD;
             healthy adults have excluded patients who are pregnant.8,9&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Homeless status. The clinics we have chosen have large numbers of homeless patients.&#xD;
             Since this is a study on the general poverty population, we are asking homeless status&#xD;
             in order to avoid over-sampling homeless patients. We will set a quota on number of&#xD;
             homeless patients we can enroll without over-sampling these patients. If we reach this&#xD;
             quota, we will apply homeless status as an exclusion criteria for subsequent subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Repeaters. Patients who have been screened or enrolled before will be asked a set of&#xD;
             repeater questions. This includes a question on whether they have ever been involved&#xD;
             in our UCLA study at the clinic before. We will also ask them a set of questions that&#xD;
             combines aspects about the potential subject (mother's first name, father's first&#xD;
             name, month and day of birth) that will screen them out if they screen again in the&#xD;
             future.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ASSIST Score: Drug Dependence. The RA will receive a message that the subject scored&#xD;
             27+ on all illicit drugs on the WHO ASSIST (i.e. indication of possible substance&#xD;
             dependence/addiction). The RA will inform the patient that they are at risk for&#xD;
             certain health behaviors and ask the patient if they want to disclose this information&#xD;
             to their doctor. If they agree to disclose information to their doctor then we will&#xD;
             fill out a letter informing the doctor of patient's dependence on specific drugs. We&#xD;
             will also provide the patient with a list of local substance abuse treatment&#xD;
             referrals. Please see Appendix A for copies of these referrals (Appendix A. Los&#xD;
             Angeles County Substance Abuse Treatment Facilities).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  From Date of Screening Subject Enrolled in a Drug Treatment Facility. Subjects&#xD;
             enrolled in a treatment program are excluded from the study. These subjects show&#xD;
             commitment to the treatment program. Moreover, these program would serve as a&#xD;
             competing intervention to ours, biasing the potential effect of our intervention.&#xD;
