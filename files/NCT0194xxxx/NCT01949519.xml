  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel is the standard, first-line chemotherapeutic agent for castrate resistant prostate&#xD;
      cancer. While it has clinically useful activity, there is a strong need for substantial&#xD;
      improvement in its efficacy. Possible ways for improving docetaxel monotherapy would be to&#xD;
      combine it with an agent that either minimized toxicity (thus allowing higher doses) or&#xD;
      improves efficacy (by targeting synergistic pathways). Lycopene is an attractive agent for&#xD;
      combination with docetaxel because of its known accumulation in prostate tissue, its low&#xD;
      toxicity, and its ability to inhibit signaling through the IGF-1 axis, and to reduce IL6&#xD;
      levels. Lycopene is highly synergistic with docetaxel at inhibiting the growth of prostate&#xD;
      cancer in mice. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      lycopene given in combination with docetaxel. This dose can then be used for subsequent phase&#xD;
      II or phase III studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New findings from the ECOG E3805 study presented at ASCO 2014, showed that concurrent&#xD;
      chemotherapy with first-line ADT for newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer markedly&#xD;
      improved overall survival compared with delayed or no chemotherapy. These subjects could also&#xD;
      benefit from intervention to increase docetaxel effectiveness.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate and 2&#xD;
             increasing pre-study PSA values, the last of which must be ≥1 ng/ml, at least 1 week&#xD;
             apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have current or prior evidence of metastatic prostate cancer. Patients&#xD;
             with radiographic evidence of disease progression but without PSA progression may also&#xD;
             be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may have received prior chemotherapy except for a combination of docetaxel&#xD;
             and lycopene. Prior chemotherapy must have been completed at least 1 year prior to&#xD;
             start of treatment under this protocol. Prior biologic therapy, or any investigational&#xD;
             drug must have been completed at least 28 days prior to start of therapy, and the&#xD;
             patient must have recovered from toxicities of prior therapy to grade 1 or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may or may not be surgically or medically castrated. If surgically or&#xD;
             medically castrated, it would be documented by a testosterone level less than 50ng/mL.&#xD;
             If the patient is being treated with medical castration, he must be willing to&#xD;
             continue this treatment for the duration of the study. ADT should not be initiated,&#xD;
             terminated, or dose-adjusted during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior external beam radiation therapy (to less than 30% of the bone marrow only) is&#xD;
             allowed. At least 28 days must have elapsed since the completion of radiation therapy&#xD;
             and the patient must have recovered from side effects. Prior treatment with&#xD;
             samarium-153, radium-223, or strontium-86 is allowed if at least eight weeks have&#xD;
             elapsed since dosing, and all toxicities have resolved to grade 1. Soft tissue disease&#xD;
             which has been radiated in the prior 2 months is not assessable as measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received prior surgery. However, at least 21 days must have elapsed&#xD;
             since completion of surgery and the patient must have recovered from all side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have adequate hepatic function as defined by 1) a serum bilirubin ≤the&#xD;
             institutional upper limit of normal (IULN), and 2) SGOT or SGPT ≤2.5 x the&#xD;
             institutional upper limit of normal obtained within 14 days prior to start of therapy.&#xD;
             Liver function tests should be evaluated prior to each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate renal function as defined by a serum creatinine ≤1.5 x the&#xD;
             institutional upper limit of normal obtained within 14 days prior to start of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men of child bearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective&#xD;
             contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient must have an ECOG performance status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must meet the following hematological criteria (minimal values):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin of &gt; 8.0gm/dL,&#xD;
