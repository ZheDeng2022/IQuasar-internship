      dose study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles&#xD;

      This is a single-center, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single oral&#xD;
      dose study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of SEP-363856 and its&#xD;
      metabolite SEP-363854 in male and female subjects with schizophrenia. This study will&#xD;
      determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) for a single oral dose of SEP-363856, and&#xD;
      characterize the plasma PK profiles of SEP-363856 and its metabolite SEP-363854 in male and&#xD;
      female subjects with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each of the dose-escalation cohorts, 12 subjects (9 active subjects and 3 placebo&#xD;
      subjects) will receive a single oral dose. An attempt will be made to have at least one-third&#xD;
      of subjects in each cohort be female.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cohort will be comprised of 12 subjects (9 active, 3 placebo). Within each cohort,&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to receive either SEP-363856 (active) or matched placebo in a 3:1&#xD;
      ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned dose levels that will be evaluated are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: A single oral 25 mg dose of SEP-363856 or matched placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: A single oral 50 mg dose of SEP-363856 or matched placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: A single oral 100 mg dose of SEP-363856 or matched placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: A single oral 150 mg dose of SEP-363856 or matched placebo.&#xD;
