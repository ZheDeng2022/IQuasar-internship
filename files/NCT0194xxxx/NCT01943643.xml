      This is prospective, observational study, that will be conducted in two high-volume&#xD;
      university interventional cardiology centers. Study population consists of patients with&#xD;
      &quot;true&quot; coronary bifurcations (Medina 1.0.1; 0.1.1; 1.1.1) with &gt;50% stenosis in both main&#xD;
      (MB) and side branch (SB). Patients are scheduled to undergo percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) based on clinical findings. Before PCI, patients will undergo multislice&#xD;
      CT angiography (MSCTA). MSCTA before PCI for &quot;true&quot; non left main bifurcation lesions can&#xD;
      determine atherosclerotic plaque characteristics in MB and SB and predict significant&#xD;
      narrowing of SB after provisional stenting. Primary goal is to determine which plaque&#xD;
      characteristics of &quot;true&quot; non left main bifurcation lesions in MB and SB, as assessed by&#xD;
      MSCTA, can affect the occurrence of SB ostial compromise after provisional stenting. Patients&#xD;
      will be seen in the office visit at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure. Clinical&#xD;
      evaluation and 12-channel ECG are mandatory at each visit. Comprehensive echocardiogram with&#xD;
      2D-strain analysis will be done at 3-month visit. Repeated coronary angiography will be done&#xD;
      at 6-month visit, and will include quantitative analysis of previously treated bifurcation&#xD;
      lesion.&#xD;

      This is prospective, observational study, that will be conducted in two high-volume&#xD;
      university PCI centers. The centers are: Clinical Hospital Center Zemun-Belgrade, Cardiology&#xD;
      Department, and Clinical Center of Serbia, Cardiology Clinic. Study population consists of&#xD;
      patients with &quot;true&quot; coronary bifurcations (Medina 1.0.1; 0.1.1; 1.1.1) with &gt;50% stenosis in&#xD;
      both MB and SB9. Patients are scheduled to undergo PCI based on clinical findings. Before&#xD;
      PCI, patients will undergo MSCTA. Study hypothesis is that MSCTA before PCI for &quot;true&quot; non&#xD;
      left main bifurcation lesions can determine atherosclerotic plaque characteristics in MB and&#xD;
      SB and predict significant narrowing of SB after provisional stenting. Primary goal is to&#xD;
      determine which plaque characteristics of &quot;true&quot; non left main bifurcation lesions in MB and&#xD;
      SB, as assessed by MSCTA, can affect the occurrence of SB ostial compromise after provisional&#xD;
      stenting. Plaque characteristics that will be investigated include: angle between the&#xD;
      arteries, the degree of stenosis, length of stenosis, density of the plaque, plaque volume,&#xD;
      positive remodeling of the artery, and presence of spotty calcifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims are to determine whether MSCTA correctly identifies the degree of stenosis and&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque composition in MB and SB of bifurcation lesions compared to invasive&#xD;
      quantitative coronary angiography and IVUS. Also to determine correlation between endothelial&#xD;
      wall shear stress, computed using mathematical model of fluid dynamic reconstruction of MSCTA&#xD;
      findings, and the degree of stenosis and atherosclerotic plaque composition in MB and SB of&#xD;
      bifurcation lesion. Another goal is to determine correlation between SB stenosis and coronary&#xD;
      blood flow after provisional stenting and regional myocardial function assessed by myocardial&#xD;
      deformation imaging echocardiography in the area of the left ventricle supplied by SB,&#xD;
      immediately after intervention, and after three months. Study patients will be selected based&#xD;
      on previous diagnostic coronary angiogram. They will undergo MSCTA on Toshiba Aquilion CXL&#xD;
      128 slice CT scanner using predefined protocol. The procedure will include calcium scoring&#xD;
      (Agatston) then CT angiography using Ultravist 370 contrast agent ((iopromide concentration&#xD;
      370 mg/ml, Bayer Health Care, Germany). MSCTA angiograms will be analyzed using dedicated&#xD;
      software Vital Vitrea Advanced 6.2, Vital Images, Minnetonka, Minnesota, US. The bifurcation&#xD;
      lesion analyses will include: the measurement of the angle between MB and SB, measurement of&#xD;
      the lesion length, reference diameter of the vessel, degree of stenosis, atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaque analysis 10 mm proximal and distal in the MB, and 5 mm from the ostium of the SB, and&#xD;
      at the level of maximum stenosis (minimal lumen diameter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plaque analyses will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Type of tissue based on density: lipid, fibro-lipid or calcified,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Plaque volume at the level of bifurcation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Positive remodeling of the artery at the level of bifurcation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Presence of spotty calcification. Before PCI procedure, IVUS evaluation using iLabÂ®&#xD;
           Ultrasound Imaging System (Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts, US), of the MB and,&#xD;
           if possible, the SB will be performed. Automated pullback at 0.5 mm/s will be used to&#xD;
           evaluate both branches before the PCI procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial strategy for PCI will be provisional stenting. The choice of vascular access, guiding&#xD;
      catheters and coronary wires are left to the operators' discretion. Heparin in doses of&#xD;
      80-100 IU/kg will be used as periprocedural anticoagulation. After placing the guidewires in&#xD;
      the MB and SB lesion, the MB will be predilated. After predilation and nitroglycerin&#xD;
      administration intracoronary, coronary angiogram will be performed. Based on this angiogram,&#xD;
      a second generation drug eluting stent (DES) will be placed in the MB across the SB, so that&#xD;
      its diameter will be chosen according to Murray's law. The stent will have to be long enough&#xD;
      so that proximal margin of the stent is at least 10 mm proximal to the carina of the&#xD;
      bifurcation. After stenting, proximal optimization (POT) of the stent in the MB will be&#xD;
      performed using short noncompliant balloon catheter 0,5 mm larger than the diameter of the&#xD;
      stent. The distal marker of the balloon catheter will be positioned at the level of carina.&#xD;
      Inflation of the balloon catheter must be at least up to the nominal diameter. After POT and&#xD;
      intracoronary nitroglycerin administration, coronary angiograms in two orthogonal projections&#xD;
      will be done. If the SB does not have more than 75% diameter stenosis (DS) on quantitative&#xD;
      coronary angiography analysis (QCA) and/or coronary blood flow less than TIMI III, the&#xD;
      procedure is finished. If the SB has more than 75% DS stenosis or TIMI flow &lt;III, procedure&#xD;
      will be continued with guidewire exchange, preferably with a third guide wire inserted&#xD;
      through the distal strut in the SB. After predilatation of the SB ostium, kissing inflation&#xD;
      will be done using adequately sized noncompliant balloon catheters in the MB and SB, up to&#xD;
      6-8 atm. After control coronary angiogram, if the SB has more than 75% DS, TIMI flow &lt; III or&#xD;
      ostial dissection, another DES will be implanted in the SB using the technique chosen by the&#xD;
      operator. The preferred technique is T and protrusion (TAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure, the patients who had an uneventful PCI will stay in the hospital for 24&#xD;
      h. Blood samples for Troponin I, CK and CK-MB will be collected at 12 and 24 h after the&#xD;
      procedure, and for C reactive protein (CRP) after 24h. Complications of the interventions&#xD;
      will be documented in the patients study file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen in the office visit at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure.&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation and 12-channel ECG are mandatory at each visit. Comprehensive&#xD;
      echocardiogram with 2D-strain analysis will be done at 3-month visit. Repeated coronary&#xD;
      angiography will be done at 6-month visit, and will include QCA analysis of previously&#xD;
      treated bifurcation lesion.&#xD;
