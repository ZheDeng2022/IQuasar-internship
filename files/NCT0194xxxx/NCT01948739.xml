    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To augment the MAHI Exo-II, a physical human exoskeleton, with a non-invasive brain&#xD;
           machine interface (BMI) to actively include patient in the control loop and thereby&#xD;
           making the therapy 'active'.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine appropriate robotic (kinematic data acquired through sensors on robotic&#xD;
           device ) and electrophysiological ( electroencephalography- EEG based) measures of arm&#xD;
           motor impairment and recovery after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To demonstrate that the BMI controlled MAHI Exo-II robotic arm training is feasible and&#xD;
           effective in improving arm motor functions in sub-acute and chronic stroke population.&#xD;
    </textblock>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Fugl-Meyer Arm (FMA) Motor Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after end of treatment (within a week), 2 weeks after end of treatment, 12 weeks after end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>FMA is a stroke-specific, performance based impairment index. It quantitatively measures impairment based on Twitchell and Brunnstrom's concept of sequential stages of motor return in hemiplegic stroke patients. It uses an ordinal scale for scoring of 33 items for the upper limb component of the F-M scale (0:can not perform; 1:can perform partially; 2:can perform fully). Total range is 0-66, 0 being poor and 66 normal.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neural Activity (Cortical Dynamics) Measured by Electroencephalography (EEG) Movement-related Cortical Potential (MRCP) Amplitude</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after end of treatment (within a week)</time_frame>
    <description>EEG activity in the low-frequency delta band will be assessed. Scalp EEG electrodes will be located over the motor cortex, specifically, central (Cz, C1- C4), fronto- central (FCz, FC1 - FC4) and centro-parietal electrodes (CPz, CP1 - CP4). Further, to account for left hand vs. right hand impairment, the electrode locations will be flipped for individuals with right hand impairment. Increased MRCP amplitude indicates increased activation of the ipsi-lesional hemisphere or inhibition of competing contra-lesional hemisphere, following motor relearning.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cortical Dynamics Measured by Electroencephalography (EEG) Movement-related Cortical Potential (MRCP) Latency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after end of treatment (within a week)</time_frame>
    <description>EEG activity in the low-frequency delta band will be assessed. Scalp EEG electrodes will be located over the motor cortex, specifically, central (Cz, C1- C4), fronto- central (FCz, FC1 - FC4) and centro-parietal electrodes (CPz, CP1 - CP4). Further, to account for left hand vs. right hand impairment, the electrode locations will be flipped for individuals with right hand impairment. MRCP latency is the duration of MRCP prior to movement onset, and is defined as time difference starting from 50% of peak amplitude until the time of movement onset. Increased MRCP latency indicates increased activation of the ipsi-lesional hemisphere or inhibition of competing contra-lesional hemisphere, following motor relearning.</description>

    <measure>Movement Quality as Assessed by Exoskeleton Kinematics - Average Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after end of treatment (within a week)</time_frame>
    <description>A higher value indicates better movement quality.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Movement Quality as Assessed by Exoskeleton Kinematics - Spectral Arc Length</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after end of treatment (within a week)</time_frame>
    <description>Spectral Arc Length is a frequency-domain measure that increases in value as movements become less jerky. A higher value indicates better movement quality (that is, movements are less jerky).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Movement Quality as Assessed by Exoskeleton Kinematics - Number of Peaks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after end of treatment (within a week)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of peaks is a metric related to the shape of the velocity profile. A higher number of peaks implies jerkier movement. A lower number of peaks indicates better movement quality (that is, movements are less jerky).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Movement Quality as Assessed by Exoskeleton Kinematics - Time to First Peak</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after end of treatment (within a week)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to 1st Peak is a metric related to the shape of the velocity profile, and is reported as [(time to first peak) divided by (total movement duration)]. This value is usually less than the ideal value of 0.5, or 50%, of the total movement duration when a movement has more than one peak. The closer the value is to the ideal value of 0.5, the more well-balanced are the movements.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after end of treatment (within a week), 2 weeks after end of treatment, 12 weeks after end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The ARAT is used to assess subject's ability to manipulate-lift-release objects horizontally and vertically, which differs in size, weight and shape. The test consists of 19 items divided into 4 sub-tests (grasp, grip, pinch, gross arm movement) and each item is rated on a 4-point scale. The possible total score ranges between 0-57. Higher scores indicate better performance.</description>

    <measure>Score on Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after end of treatment (within a week), 2 weeks after end of treatment, 12 weeks after end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The JTHFT is a motor performance test and assesses the time needed to perform 7 everyday activities (for example, flipping cards and feeding). Score is reported as items completed per second.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

          <description>MAHI EXO-II exoskeleton augmented with BMI system will be used to actively include the patient in the control loop, thereby making the therapy 'active' and engaging patients with various impairment severity in rehabilitation tasks. Patients will receive longitudinal training with the BMI-robotic interface for 3-4 sessions per week, over a period of 3 months.&#xD;
MAHI EXO-II exoskeleton augmented with BMI system: In this longitudinal study, adult subjects with hemiparesis due to acute or chronic stroke will receive robotic-assisted training through an EEG-based BMI control of robotic exoskeleton to study the changes in upper extremity motor function, cortical plasticity (using the EEG and fMRI). The training will be provided 3x/week for 12 sessions over one-month period.</description>

It quantitatively measures impairment based on Twitchell and Brunnstrom's concept of sequential stages of motor return in hemiplegic stroke patients. It uses an ordinal scale for scoring of 33 items for the upper limb component of the F-M scale (0:can not perform; 1:can perform partially; 2:can perform fully). Total range is 0-66, 0 being poor and 66 normal.</description>

        <description>EEG activity in the low-frequency delta band will be assessed. Scalp EEG electrodes will be located over the motor cortex, specifically, central (Cz, C1- C4), fronto- central (FCz, FC1 - FC4) and centro-parietal electrodes (CPz, CP1 - CP4). Further, to account for left hand vs. right hand impairment, the electrode locations will be flipped for individuals with right hand impairment. Increased MRCP amplitude indicates increased activation of the ipsi-lesional hemisphere or inhibition of competing contra-lesional hemisphere, following motor relearning.</description>

        <title>Movement Quality as Assessed by Exoskeleton Kinematics - Time to First Peak</title>
        <description>Time to 1st Peak is a metric related to the shape of the velocity profile, and is reported as [(time to first peak) divided by (total movement duration)]. This value is usually less than the ideal value of 0.5, or 50%, of the total movement duration when a movement has more than one peak. The closer the value is to the ideal value of 0.5, the more well-balanced are the movements.</description>

            <description>MAHI EXO-II exoskeleton augmented with BMI system will be used to actively include the patient in the control loop, thereby making the therapy 'active' and engaging patients with various impairment severity in rehabilitation tasks. Patients will receive longitudinal training with the BMI-robotic interface for 3-4 sessions per week, over a period of 3 months.&#xD;
MAHI EXO-II exoskeleton augmented with BMI system: In this longitudinal study, adult subjects with hemiparesis due to acute or chronic stroke will receive robotic-assisted training through an EEG-based BMI control of robotic exoskeleton to study the changes in upper extremity motor function, cortical plasticity (using the EEG and fMRI). The training will be provided 3x/week for 12 sessions over one-month period.</description>
