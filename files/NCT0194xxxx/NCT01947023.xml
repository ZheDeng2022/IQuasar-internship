      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lapatinib when given together&#xD;
      with dabrafenib in treating patients with thyroid cancer that cannot be removed by surgery&#xD;
      and has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). Dabrafenib and lapatinib may stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of lapatinib that can be used in combination of&#xD;
      dabrafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. Evaluate potential mechanisms of primary&#xD;
      resistance of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) mutant thyroid cancer to&#xD;
      dabrafenib by performing pathway profiling of tumor biopsies before and while on therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Obtain preliminary data on the activity of the combination of lapatinib and dabrafenib&#xD;
      in BRAF mutant thyroid cancer through imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lapatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and lapatinib PO once&#xD;
      daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: Patients also receive dabrafenib PO for 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment with&#xD;
      lapatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then annually&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;

             women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier&#xD;
             method of birth control, or abstinence; hormonal contraception is not allowed due to&#xD;
             drug-drug interactions which can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective) for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation, and for at least 2 weeks after treatment with&#xD;
             dabrafenib; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Tumor is not considered accessible by either the investigator or the person&#xD;
                  performing the biopsy (it is determined the risk is too high due to location near&#xD;

             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with dabrafenib,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with dabrafenib; these&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
