      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Title An open-label, randomized, two treatment, multi-site, multiple dose, steady state,&#xD;
      three-way, reference-replicated crossover, pharmacokinetic study to determine the in-vivo&#xD;
      bioequivalence between Asenapine 10 mg sublingual tablet and SAPHRIS® (asenapine) 10 mg&#xD;
      sublingual tablet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Multiple-dose, steady state, three-way reference-replicated crossover study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of Study Pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects 57 randomized to complete 42 subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing Test or Reference drug (EQ 10mg) base sublingual tablets are to be taken twice daily,&#xD;
      once in the morning and once in the evening, for a period of 7 days before crossing-over to&#xD;
      receive the next drug assigned for a period of 7 days, followed by a period of 7 days where&#xD;
      the third drug assigned will be received.. There will be a total of three 7-day treatment&#xD;
      periods during which each subject will receive the test product in one period and the&#xD;
      reference product in two other periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure optimal absorption, subjects will be instructed to place the tablet under the&#xD;
      tongue and allow it to dissolve completely. The tablet will dissolve in saliva. Tablets will&#xD;
      not be crushed, chewed, or swallowed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Housing Subjects will be housed in the clinic or hospital for a multiple days in each period&#xD;
      during treatment and the collection of pharmacokinetic samples. Housing will be provided for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1 and Day 8 or 15 (12-hour confinement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days 6-7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days 13-14&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days 20-21&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators may choose to house subjects during the interim days between specified&#xD;
      in-patient clinic visits, either in the clinic or at an appropriate off-site facility such as&#xD;
      a hotel or motel. Housing offers may be made to each subject population according to the&#xD;
      respective Investigator's judgment as to what is best for his/her patients. Such interim&#xD;
      housing is not to be considered as study visits, but will be offered at the discretion of the&#xD;
      Investigator to all subjects in his/her clinic, at his/her discretion, and simply to improve&#xD;
      subject compliance and attempt to reduce variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be confined for at least 12 hours after initial dosing of either SAPHRIS®&#xD;
      (Asenapine) or Asenapine sublingual tablets. Subjects will be required to remain supine for 6&#xD;
      hours following the initial dose. Subjects may get up briefly in order to relieve themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Washout period There will be no washout period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling time points Blood samples will be collected over a dosing interval on day 7,&#xD;
      following preliminary sampling on days 5 and 6 to confirm steady-state conditions. The&#xD;
      sampling time points are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 5 (1 sample)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 6 (1 sample)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 7 (15 samples) 0.0(pre-dose), 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0,&#xD;
           6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Plan Subjects will fast for at least 8 hours prior to and 4 hours after the&#xD;
      administration of the morning dose of the test or reference treatment on day 7 of each period&#xD;
      (i.e., the days on which blood samples are to be collected to assess the concentration-time&#xD;
      curve). All meals on day 7 will be standardized during the study. Water may be allowed,&#xD;
      except for 1 hour before and 1 hour after drug administration, when no liquid will be&#xD;
      permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will remain in the supine position for the first 6 hours after the first dose,&#xD;
           even if they were previously on a stable dose of asenapine maleate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be adequately hydrated. This may be achieved by administering 240 mL of&#xD;
           water before the overnight fast, 240 mL of water one hour before dosing, and beginning&#xD;
           no sooner than 1 hour after drug administration, 240 mL of water every 2 hours for 6&#xD;
           hours post-dosing. Subjects will not eat or drink for 10 minutes after drug&#xD;
           administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects must be adequately informed of possible cardiovascular adverse effects in the&#xD;
           consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  White blood cell (WBC) counts will be monitored and asenapine maleate sublingual tablet&#xD;
           treatment modified, if necessary, in accordance with the leukopenia, neutropenia and&#xD;
           agranulocytosis warning in the labeling of the reference listed drug product.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects requiring modification of asenapine maleate sublingual tablet treatment will be&#xD;
           dropped from the study and provided with prompt medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature will be monitored during the study and&#xD;
           immediate medical care provided for any significant abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject medical histories, physical examination and laboratory reports, and all&#xD;
           incidents of possible adverse reactions will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyte(s) to measure Asenapine in plasma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asenapine AUC0-tau, Cmax, Tmax, Cmin and %Fluctuation will be estimated for each subject and&#xD;
      period using WinNonlin version 5.2 or higher. The trough samples collected just prior to the&#xD;
      morning dose on Days 5, 6 and 7 in each period will be evaluated to demonstrate that&#xD;
      steady-state has been achieved by the final morning dose in each period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC0-tau,) and Cmin will be natural&#xD;
      log-transformed (ln) prior to statistical analyses. Any ln-transformed parameter where the&#xD;
      observed intra-subject CV for the reference product is at least 30% (swr ≥ 0.294) will be&#xD;
      evaluated using the scaled average bioequivalence (SABE) method. The GLM procedure of SAS&#xD;
      will be used to conduct the SABE analyses, as well as to estimate the intra-subject CV for&#xD;
      the reference product. The statistical model for the GLM procedure will contain only a term&#xD;
      for Sequence*Site. The linearized Scaled Average Bioequivalence statistic and the upper 95%&#xD;
      Confidence Bound on the statistic will be estimated. The ratio of geometric means (T/R) will&#xD;
      also be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma concentrations at each time point, Tmax, %Fluctuation, and any ln-transformed&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameter where the observed intra-subject CV of the reference product is&#xD;
      less than 30% (swr &lt; 0.294), will be evaluated using the average (unscaled) bioequivalence&#xD;
      (ABE) approach will be used. The MIXED procedure of SAS will be used in this case with a&#xD;
      statistical model that includes terms for Sequence, Site, Sequence*Site, Subject nested&#xD;
      within Sequence*Site, Period nested within Site, Treatment, and if necessary, Treatment*Site.&#xD;
      A separate statistical analysis will be done to determine if the Treatment*Site term is&#xD;
      statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) and needs to be retained in the model. If this term is not&#xD;
      significant, it will be dropped from the statistical model for the definitive statistical&#xD;
      evaluation. The ratio of geometric means (T/R) and 90% confidence intervals for the ratio,&#xD;
      based on least-squares means from the analysis of the log-transformed PK Parameter, will be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioequivalence criteria Bioequivalence will be concluded for those primary parameters&#xD;
      evaluated by SABE if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The geometric mean Test-to-Reference ratio falls within the range of 0.800 to 1.250.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 95% upper confidence bound on the linearized SABE statistic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioequivalence will be concluded for those primary parameters evaluated by ABE if:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 90% confidence interval on the geometric mean Test-to Reference ratio is contained within&#xD;
      the interval 0.800 to 1.250.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluctuation for the test product will be evaluated for comparability with the fluctuation of&#xD;
      the reference product.&#xD;
