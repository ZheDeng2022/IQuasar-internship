  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposed research study, the investigators plan to assess the efficacy of gametes'&#xD;
      (egg and sperm) treatment on fertilization as well as pre- and post-implantation embryo&#xD;
      development.&#xD;

      The spermatozoa will be prepared in the standard fashion and utilized for injection after&#xD;
      exposure to a membrane permeabilizing agent. The raw sperm specimen may be selected through a&#xD;
      synthetic, sterile, single-use, culture-tested mesh. The specimen will then be placed in a&#xD;
      37°C environment. After 30 minutes, the selected portion is retrieved from the other side of&#xD;
      the mesh. The spermatozoa will be prepared in the standard fashion will be utilized for&#xD;
      injection or intrauterine insemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injected oocytes will be then exposed to the previously mentioned activating agents for&#xD;
      the purpose of inducing embryo development. The successfully fertilized oocytes will be&#xD;
      further kept in culture for up to 5 days as per standard IVF/ICSI. Results in terms of&#xD;
      fertilization and embryo cleavage will be assessed and monitored for the remainder of the&#xD;
      culture period. Developing embryos selected according to standard criteria will be replaced&#xD;
      to the patient or will be cryopreserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because fertilization failure carries such a high emotional and financial toll on our&#xD;
      patients, at the present time, the only method to generate an embryo for these cases is to&#xD;
      perform assisted oocyte activation in conjunction with ICSI. The research intervention -&#xD;
      assisted oocyte activation - is believed to help alleviate the failed fertilization by&#xD;
      obtaining some zygotes for the patient. In these cases of complete failed fertilization,&#xD;
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) will be performed as a routine clinical treatment&#xD;
      even if they are not enrolled in the study. After several failures, their reproductive&#xD;
      physician may recommend the use of donor spermatozoa instead of the male partner's.&#xD;
