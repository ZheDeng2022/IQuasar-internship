  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether the use of a supplement called xylooligosaccharide (XOS)&#xD;
      increases the number of good bacteria that live in human intestines and can maintain healthy&#xD;
      blood sugar levels, and whether XOS has any unpleasant or unexpected side effects when&#xD;
      consumed at different dosages. Subjects who participate in this study will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive an eight week supply of either a lower dose of XOS or placebo (no active substance).&#xD;
      This will be determined randomly, in a process similar to flipping a coin. Blood samples will&#xD;
      be taken at each visits, including an oral glucose tolerance test. Subjects will also be&#xD;
      asked to collect and bring in stool samples at three different time points during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a 50/50 chance of being assigned to the either study group. This is a&#xD;
      double-blind study which means neither the study investigator nor the subject will know to&#xD;
      which group he/she has been assigned. In case of an emergency, the study doctor can get this&#xD;
      information.&#xD;

      Prebiotics are highly effective and important for many applications in medicine. They are not&#xD;
      absorbed and do not contribute to human nourishment, but rather exert a profound effect on&#xD;
      the human bowel flora. The principal effect on the human bowel flora is to stimulate the&#xD;
      growth of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species. These are benign organisms in that they&#xD;
      are seldom involved in infections or other pathological processes. However, numerous health&#xD;
      promoting benefits of these bacterial genera have been noted, with effects on infectious and&#xD;
      non-infectious disease. They induce host genes involved in innate immunity, sometimes in&#xD;
      collaboration with other elements of the gut flora such as Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and&#xD;
      Lactobacillus casei. Animal studies 2 indicate a protective effect against bacterial&#xD;
      translocation from the GI tract. An extensive cataloguing of genomes of bifidobacteria and&#xD;
      other intestinal bacteria reveals that the bifids play a very significant role in many&#xD;
      important areas such as carbohydrate, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, inorganic ion transport&#xD;
      and metabolism; energy production and conversion; cell wall and membrane biogenesis; signal&#xD;
      transduction mechanisms; transcription and translation; and defense mechanisms .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The metabolic syndrome which includes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, and insulin&#xD;
      resistance has responded to prebiotics in rodent trials; it is estimated that 20-30% of&#xD;
      populations in developed countries have this disease. Parnell and Reimer have demonstrated&#xD;
      that prebiotics oligofructose supplementation has the potential to promote weight loss and&#xD;
      improve glucose regulation in overweight adults likely through suppressed ghrelin and&#xD;
      enhanced PYY1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have completed a study at UCLA studying the effects of XOS on human&#xD;
      microbiota. There were three phases including a 2-week run-in period, 8-week intervention&#xD;
      period, and a 2-week washout. Thirty two volunteers were randomly assigned to take a&#xD;
      supplement containing 1.4 g XOS (1.4g XOS 70P), 2.8 g XOS (2.8g XOS 70P) or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total of 32 subjects were enrolled into the study. One subject from the placebo group and one&#xD;
      from the low dose group dropped out of the study for non specific gastrointestinal complaint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altogether, 120 stool samples were received from 11 low dose subjects, 9 high dose subjects,&#xD;
      and 10 placebo group subjects. Bacterial culture was performed from all the 120 stool samples&#xD;
      received. One placebo group subject, two high dose group subjects, and two low dose group&#xD;
      subjects were excluded from the analyses because of compromised specimen quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bifidobacterium counts of the subjects after high dose XOS intervention was significantly&#xD;
      higher from the base line at 4, 8, and 10 weeks. Similarly, the increase of Bifidobacterium&#xD;
      counts was significantly higher in the high XOS group at 4 weeks compared to the low XOS&#xD;
      group. The low XOS group had significantly higher Bifidobacterium counts compared to the&#xD;
      placebo group subjects at 8 and 10 weeks. The total anaerobic flora counts and to some degree&#xD;
      the total aerobic flora counts of the subjects after high dose XOS intervention were&#xD;
      significantly higher from the base-line at 4 and 8 weeks. The mean changes of total anaerobic&#xD;
      flora counts were significantly higher in the high XOS group at 4, 8, and 10 weeks compared&#xD;
      to the placebo group. Interestingly, also Bacteroides fragilis group counts of the subjects&#xD;
      after high dose XOS intervention were significantly higher from the base line at 4, 8, and 10&#xD;
      weeks and the mean changes were significantly higher in the high XOS group compared to the&#xD;
      low and placebo groups. There were no major significant differences in the counts of&#xD;
      Lactobacillus sp., Enterobacteriaceae, and clostridia between the three dose groups evaluated&#xD;
&#xD;
      The XOS was tolerated well by all study subjects (normal adult). At base-line, most of the&#xD;
      subjects had relatively high counts of Bifidobacterium species with lower counts of&#xD;
      Lactobacillus species. Several different species of each of these genera were present.&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium species showed significant increases in counts in subjects on XOS&#xD;
      supplementation, with the higher dose group showing significantly greater increases than the&#xD;
      lower dose group. Both high and low dose groups showed significantly higher counts of&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium sub-species than the placebo group. Lactobacillus species counts did not&#xD;
      increase significantly in subjects on XOS supplementation. There was a statistically&#xD;
      significant increase in the counts of the B. fragilis group at all time periods for the high&#xD;
      dose XOS group. As mentioned before, bifidobacteria may induce host genes involved in innate&#xD;
      immunity in collaboration with other elements of the gut flora such as B. fragilis group. The&#xD;
      increase in the counts of the &quot;total anaerobes&quot; reflects the increased counts in the&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium and B. fragilis group, both of which are anaerobic. Some Bifidobacterium&#xD;
      species may grow aerobically as well, which may be reflected in the modest increase of the&#xD;
      aerobic counts in the high dose XOS group. In this study, the XOS supplementation had no&#xD;
      significant effect on stool pH or SCFAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a 10 week, randomized, placebo controlled, two arm study&#xD;
      with 20 subjects with metabolic syndrome. Subjects will be randomly assigned to take a powder&#xD;
      mixture containing 2.8 g XOS (2.94g XOS 95P) or placebo.&#xD;
