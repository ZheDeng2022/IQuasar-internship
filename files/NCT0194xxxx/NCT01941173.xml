    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies short-infusion ziv-aflibercept in treating patients with&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer receiving combination chemotherapy. Ziv-aflibercept may stop the&#xD;
      growth of colorectal cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving the drug over a&#xD;
      shorter infusion time may result in improved efficiency and patient satisfaction.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility of a shorter infusion of 30 minutes and 15 minutes of&#xD;
      standard dose ziv-aflibercept when combined with FOLFIRI (folinic acid [leucovorin calcium],&#xD;
      fluorouracil, and irinotecan [irinotecan hydrochloride]) in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Describe the institutional safety experience with this combination using Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 for toxicity grading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ziv-aflibercept intravenously (IV) over 15-30 minutes followed by FOLFIFRI&#xD;
      chemotherapy comprising leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over&#xD;
      90 minutes, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;
