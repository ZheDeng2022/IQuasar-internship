      Introduction :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral antineoplastic agents know a full development in particular targeted therapies. Their&#xD;
      adverse events (AE) lately detected can lead to non compliance or treatment discontinuation&#xD;
      which can be at the origin of disease progression. They can also lead to hospitalization or&#xD;
      recourse to emergency department associating to cost for the society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      A coordinated intervention of cancer network in relation with primary healthcare&#xD;
      professionals, would improve safety of care's patient treated with oral antineoplastic agent&#xD;
      by preventing serious AEs through rapid detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to estimate the effect of coordinated intervention of cancer&#xD;
      network, in terms of number of early or unforeseen recourses to hospital for AE, within the&#xD;
      first 6 months after oral neoplastic agent introduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to estimate the effect of coordinated intervention of cancer&#xD;
      network, within the first 6 months after oral neoplastic agent introduction, in terms of&#xD;
      number of hospitalization for AE, number of consultation for AE, number of early or&#xD;
      unforeseen recourses to hospital for grade 1 / 2 AE, number of AE per detection grade, AE&#xD;
      maximal grade, AE all grade, disease progression, the global survival (death for any causes&#xD;
      and for AE), drug dose-intensity taken by the patient during his treatment, number of&#xD;
      recourses to the health care system, quality of life, patient's satisfaction, medical&#xD;
      economic evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome is the number of early or unforeseen recourses to hospital for AE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are all deaths and deaths from AE, number of hospitalization for AE,&#xD;
      number of consultation for AE, number of early or unforeseen recourses to hospital for grade&#xD;
      1 / 2 AE, disease progression, drug dose-intensity taken by the patient during his treatment,&#xD;
      number of recourses to the health care system, number of AE per detection grade, AE maximal&#xD;
      grade, AE all grade, quality of life, patient's satisfaction, medical economic&#xD;
      evaluationMethodology, design :&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparative, controlled, not randomized, multicenter, prospective, &quot;quasi-experimental&quot;&#xD;
      study, allows estimating evolution of patients according to the existence of a cancer network&#xD;
      in their residence place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of needed subjects: 440 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of the study: 27 months. Inclusion Period: 21 months. length of participation&#xD;
      period for one patient: 6 months. Number of participating centers: 21. Average number of&#xD;
      inclusions a month by center: 4.&#xD;
