  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to investigate the prognosis of patients diagnosed with AF, particularly in relation&#xD;
      to the development of subsequent stroke, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. We will&#xD;
      explore the relationship between these outcomes and a range of risk factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of stroke in AF patients continues to be an area of substantial research&#xD;
      focus. However, comparatively little research has investigated the extent to which HF and MI&#xD;
      also make a substantial contribution to morbidity and mortality in this patient group, and&#xD;
      whether there is overlap in the prognostic factors associated development of stroke, HF, and&#xD;
      MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conen et al. demonstrated that mortality risk in AF patients is partly mediated by the&#xD;
      development of non-fatal stroke, HF, and MI. However, they did not investigate differences in&#xD;
      the cumulative incidence of these conditions between different patient groups (e.g. men and&#xD;
      women), or the relationship between potential prognostic factors and the development of these&#xD;
      conditions. Sets of prognostic factors for stroke and HF in AF patients have been defined&#xD;
      through the development of prognostic models, but these models were developed specifically&#xD;
      for each condition so it is unclear whether these prognostic factors are associated with&#xD;
      increased risk of a particular condition, or simply any major adverse cardiovascular event.&#xD;
      Additionally, some potentially important prognostic factors were not evaluated in these&#xD;
      studies (e.g. anaemia and kidney failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus we chose to conduct an exploratory study of prognostic factors for HF, MI, and stroke in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with AF. We selected our candidate factors from those that have previously&#xD;
      been associated with stroke, HF, or MI (in AF patients or the general population).&#xD;
      Identification of prognostic factors for stroke, HF, and MI in those diagnosed with AF is a&#xD;
      first step toward understanding both the development of these conditions, and the scope for&#xD;
      targeting preventive treatments to improve prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be undertaken using linked electronic health record data for primary and&#xD;
      secondary care from CALIBER. This data set contains a broad range of clinically relevant,&#xD;
      clinically conducted measurements of potential prognostic factors, and also provides a very&#xD;
      large baseline sample from which we can draw a sufficient number of incident AF cases to&#xD;
      investigate our three endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two aims. First, to determine the cumulative incidence of fatal and non-fatal&#xD;
      heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke (ischaemic, haemorrhagic, and NOS)&#xD;
      in patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF). Differences between clinically relevant&#xD;
      groups (e.g. men and women) will be explored. Second, to compare the direction and magnitude&#xD;
      of associations between prognostic factors and the development of these conditions (HF,&#xD;
      stroke, MI) in patients with AF. The following panels of prognostic factors will be&#xD;
      investigated: sociodemographic; anthropomorphic and haemodynamic; behavioural; co-existing&#xD;
      conditions (cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular); blood biomarkers; secondary preventive&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part of the CALIBER (Cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke&#xD;
      studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the NIHR and Wellcome&#xD;
      Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia&#xD;
      National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (GPRD) and other resources. The overarching&#xD;
      aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary&#xD;
      phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a&#xD;
      contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref&#xD;
      09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset).&#xD;
