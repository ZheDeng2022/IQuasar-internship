  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolic events are considered to be a prognostic negative factor and small&#xD;
      studies showed astonishing survival advantages using heparin as prophylactic treatment to&#xD;
      prevent venous thromboembolic events. Based on these assumptions our Charité - Onkologie&#xD;
      (CONKO) study group planned to conduct a randomized trial to investigate the impact of low&#xD;
      molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in a prospective setting in patients with advanced pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer undergoing first line therapy, the CONKO-004 trial. During the preliminary stages we&#xD;
      had to undertake a pilot trial to get information on safety and feasibility of combined&#xD;
      chemotherapy with simultaneous treatment of the LMWH Enoxaparin in patients with advanced&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer who are at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to local cancer&#xD;
      spread.&#xD;

      The trial was a prospective, open-label, single center investigation in patients with&#xD;
      inoperable pancreatic cancer who were treated with first-line chemotherapy in an outpatient&#xD;
      setting. The intensified treatment consisted of gemcitabine 1g/m² (30 min), 5-flourouracil&#xD;
      750 mg/m² (24 h), folinic acid 200 mg/m² (30 min), and Cisplatin 30 mg/m² (90 min) on day 1&#xD;
      and 8; q3w). Beyond initial 3 months of intensified chemotherapy all patients without cancer&#xD;
      progression received further treatment with gemcitabine alone to prevent patients from&#xD;
      cumulative toxicities. The concomitant use of Enoxaparin started on day 1 of chemotherapy&#xD;
      with a fixed dose of 40 mg daily until cancer progression. Dose adjustment for enoxaparin was&#xD;
      recommended in patients with impaired kidney function or thrombocytopenia within the study&#xD;
      according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria guidelines to minimize&#xD;
      bleeding risk. Prophylactic antiemetic therapy and supportive care were provided according to&#xD;
      individual symptoms and demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study used a sequential design to be able to stop the feasibility investigation in case&#xD;
      of severe side effects. After inclusion of three consecutive patients a hold of recruitment&#xD;
      was arranged until all three patients received at least 4 weeks of concomitant enoxaparin&#xD;
      treatment. In absence of serious events the recruitment should be continued until a minimum&#xD;
      of 15 patients received at least 12 weeks concomitant enoxaparin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was approved by the Scientific and Research Ethics Committee of our institution.&#xD;
      The investigation was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice Guidelines. Furthermore, the national principles for the proper execution&#xD;
      of the clinical examination of drugs (&quot;Bundesanzeiger&quot; No. 243 of 30.12.1987), the national&#xD;
      regulations of the German drug law, and the German drug test guidelines were adhered.&#xD;
