    <textblock>
      Participants who have had inactive disease for at least 24 weeks will be enrolled. Half the&#xD;
      subjects will continue on MMF and half the subjects will be tapered off their MMF within 12&#xD;
      weeks. All subjects will continue hydroxychloroquine and small doses of prednisone as needed.&#xD;
      Subject visits to assess endpoints will occur every 4 weeks from Day 0 through Week 24 and&#xD;
      then at Weeks 32, 40, 48, and 60.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline (Treatment Randomization) to Week 24, Week 48, and Week 60</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT-Fatigue scale (FS) is a 13-item questionnaire completed by the patient (participant), that provides a measure of fatigue/quality of life, with a 7-day recall period. The participant scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as 4 minus the participant's response. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-FS score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflected an improvement in the participant's health status. A decrease in the FACIT-FS score reflects worse fatigue/quality of life.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be on concurrent anti-malarial agents (hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine). Hydroxychloroquine is approved by the FDA for the treatment of SLE. Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to help prevent flare in SLE, and to improve skin and musculoskeletal activity in particular.Even lupus nephritis outcomes appear improved on a background of hydroxychloroquine therapy</description>

    <description>Once the subject is randomized into the trial, the prednisone (or other corticosteroid) dose must be stable through Week 36 (24 weeks following protocol taper of MMF), in the absence of flares as described in Section 3.2 of the study protocol, Description of Primary Endpoint. Further taper of prednisone after that point is by the investigator's discretion based on the subject's clinical status.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Disease Damage Index for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLICC/DI): Total Score</title>
        <description>The SLICC/DI measures accumulated damage that has occurred since the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), regardless of cause, in 12 organ systems. SLE damage is defined as an irreversible change in an organ or system that has been present for at least 6 months. The SLICC/DI includes 39 areas of damage in 12 domains, where each item is rated as present or absent; if evidence of damage is present for a particular item, it is given a score of 1. Some items are scored with 2 or 3 points in the case of recurring events or end stage renal disease. The SLICC/DI total score will be computed as the sum of all scores for items indicated as present; scores can range from 0 to 45. Higher scores indicate more damage.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT-F) Fatigue Scale (FS): Total Score</title>
        <description>FACIT-Fatigue scale (FS) is a 13-item questionnaire completed by the patient (participant), that provides a measure of fatigue/quality of life, with a 7-day recall period. The participant scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as 4 minus the participant's response. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-FS score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflected an improvement in the participant's health status. A decrease in the FACIT-FS score reflects worse fatigue/quality of life.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. Higher scores indicate better outcomes while lower scores indicate more disability. The Physical Component Score is comprised of the Physical Functioning Scale, the Role-Physical Scale, the Bodily Pain Scale, and the General Health Scale. It is scaled from 0 to 100 with a score of 0 equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 equivalent to no disability.</description>

        <title>Cumulative Excess Systemic Steroid Dose From Time of Clinically Significant Disease Reactivation to Return to Pre-Flare Dose or End of Trial Participation</title>
        <description>For each participant who experienced disease reactivation, excess systemic steroid dose was summed from the time of clinically significant disease reactivation until the dose returns to pre-flare levels or the end of study participation, whichever occurred first. Excess systemic steroid dose was defined as the total dose given for the flare minus (-) a participant's pre-flare steroid dose. Participants who do not have an increase in their steroid use due to the flare had their excess dose set to zero. Steroids include medications that code to a medication class which includes the terms &quot;glucocorticoid&quot; or &quot;corticosteroid&quot;. Systemic steroids will include any of these steroids that are taken by mouth (PO), intravenous (IV), or intramuscular (IM).</description>

          <description>For each participant who experienced disease reactivation, excess systemic steroid dose was summed from the time of clinically significant disease reactivation until the dose returns to pre-flare levels or the end of study participation, whichever occurred first. Excess systemic steroid dose was defined as the total dose given for the flare minus (-) a participant's pre-flare steroid dose. Participants who do not have an increase in their steroid use due to the flare had their excess dose set to zero. Steroids include medications that code to a medication class which includes the terms &quot;glucocorticoid&quot; or &quot;corticosteroid&quot;. Systemic steroids will include any of these steroids that are taken by mouth (PO), intravenous (IV), or intramuscular (IM).</description>
