  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of using the robotic assisted&#xD;
      device ROSA™ for pedicle screws placement. This device is currently used in cranial&#xD;
      neurosurgery but its applications can be extended to other fields, such as spinal surgery. In&#xD;
      the future, the use of ROSA™ in pedicle screw placement could increase the accuracy and&#xD;
      safety of surgery for the patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The medical device subject of this research is the surgical robot ROSA™ designed for cranial&#xD;
      surgery, and used here in another application, spinal surgery - more specifically for the&#xD;
      placement of pedicle screws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is intended for spine surgeons to treat diseases requiring the placement of pedicle screws&#xD;
      through posterior open surgery approach or minimally invasive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system allows the precise guidance of instruments as defined by the surgeon on patient&#xD;
      radiological images. The expected performance is a good rate of pedicle screws placement,&#xD;
      increasing the performance observed with the conventional method. This system can be&#xD;
      transported from one operating room to another, and stored in a storage room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It interfaces with the most common intra -operative surgical imaging systems (mobile C-arms&#xD;
      available at Montpellier University Hospital). Further versions of the device will enable the&#xD;
      use of 3D intra-operative imaging systems such as the O-arm from Medtronic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of using the robot ROSA™ for&#xD;
      pedicle screws placement. In this study, the robot will be used with an open surgery&#xD;
      approach, which is a first step in demonstrating the potential of the robot.&#xD;
