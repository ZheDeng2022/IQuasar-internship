  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label repeat dose, multicenter, 2-part study to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for GSK525762 given once-daily&#xD;
      (QD) orally. Part 1 of the study is a dose escalation phase to select the recommended Part 2&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) based on the safety, PK, and PD profiles observed after oral administration of&#xD;
      GSK525762. Eligible subjects with select relapsed refractory hematological malignancies&#xD;
      (acute myeloid leukemia [AML], non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma [NHL]and multiple myeloma [MM]), will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the QD and/or BID dosing cohorts until a MTD is established. Subjects may&#xD;
      continue treatment in the study until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent. . Upon determination of the MTD, twice daily (BID) dosing cohorts may&#xD;
      be opened to collect additional safety data and evaluate the preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      GSK525762 administered BID. Part 2 will explore clinical activity at the MTD or RP2D;&#xD;
      separate expansion cohorts will be planned for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      Lymphoma (NHL, including an exploratory sub-cohort of subjects with myc and B-Cell Leukemia&#xD;
      (BCL)2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements/overexpression [double- and triple-hit lymphoma]), and&#xD;
      multiple myeloma (MM). This is the first study of this agent to be conducted in subjects with&#xD;
      these relapsed and/or refractory hematological malignancies for which no standard therapies&#xD;
      are anticipated to result in a durable remission.&#xD;

    <description>The effects of treatment on disease-related symptoms/quality of life was assessed using the Skindex-29 Questionnaire, which inquires about how often (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, All the time) during the previous 4 weeks the participant experienced the effect described in each of 29 items divided into 3 domains: Emotional (10 items), Symptoms (7 items) and Functioning (12 items). Responses to each item are transformed to a linear scale of 100, varying from 0 (no effect) to 100 (effect experienced all the time). Skindex-29 scores were reported as three individual domain scale scores; a scale score is the mean of a participant's responses to items in a given domain. Each domain score ranges from 0 (no effect) to 100 (effect experienced all the time), higher score implies higher impact of skin disease. Baseline was the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Change from Baseline is defined is post-dose visit value minus Baseline.</description>

        <title>Part 1: Number of Participants With Grade Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following clinical chemistry parameters: glucose, prothrombin international normalized ratio (Pro. INR), albumin, amylase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, calcium, calcium ionized, cholesterol, creatinine, creatine kinase, lipase, potassium, magnesium, sodium, triglycerides, alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: death related to AE. Higher grade indicates greater severity. An increase was defined as an increase relative to Baseline. Baseline was the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Data for worst-case post Baseline with any grade increase is presented.</description>

        <title>Part 1: Number of Participants With Grade Change From Baseline in Hematology Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following hematology parameters: hemoglobin, lymphocytes, neutrophils, platelets and leukocytes. The laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: death related to AE. Higher grade indicates greater severity. An increase is defined as an increase in CTCAE grade relative to Baseline grade. Baseline was the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Data for worst-case post Baseline with any grade increase is presented.</description>

          <title>Part 1: Number of Participants With Grade Change From Baseline in Hematology Parameters</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following hematology parameters: hemoglobin, lymphocytes, neutrophils, platelets and leukocytes. The laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: death related to AE. Higher grade indicates greater severity. An increase is defined as an increase in CTCAE grade relative to Baseline grade. Baseline was the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Data for worst-case post Baseline with any grade increase is presented.</description>

        <title>Part 1: Number of Participants With Worst-case Urinalysis Results Post-Baseline Relative to Baseline by Dipstick Method</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected to assess glucose, ketones, occult blood, urine protein, and monoclonal protein (monoclonal pro). The dipstick test gave results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters were recorded as negative, trace, 1+, 2+, 3+ indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. Any increase was defined as any increase in proportional concentrations relative to Baseline. Baseline was the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Data for worst-case post Baseline with any increase is presented.</description>

        <title>Part 1: Number of Participants With Worst Case Vital Signs Results Relative to Baseline: Pulse Rate and Body Temperature</title>
        <description>Vital signs (pulse rate and temperature) were measured after resting for at least 5 minutes in a supine or semi-recumbent position. The clinical concern ranges were: For pulse rate (low &lt;60 beats per minute [bpm] and high &gt;100 bpm); For body temperature (&lt;=35 degrees Celsius or &gt;=38 degrees Celsius). Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changed to (low, normal or high), unless there was no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged, or whose value became normal, were recorded in the &quot;To Normal or No Change&quot; category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed &quot;To Low&quot; and &quot;To High&quot;, so the percentages may not add to 100%. Baseline was the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date.</description>

        <title>Part 1: Number of Participants With Increase to Grade 3 From Baseline in Vital Signs: Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) and Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)</title>
        <description>DBP and SBP were measured after resting for at least 5 minutes in a supine or semi-recumbent position. They were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. For SBP: Grade 0 (&lt;=120 millimeter of mercury [mmHg]), Grade 1 (121-139 mmHg), Grade 2 (140-159 mmHg), Grade 3 (&gt;=160 mmHg). For DBP: Grade 0 (&lt;=80 mmHg), Grade 1 (81-89 mmHg), Grade 2 (90-99 mmHg), Grade 3 (&gt;=100 mmHg). Higher grade indicates greater severity. Baseline was the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. An increase is defined as an increase in grade relative to Baseline grade. Number of participants with increase to Grade 3 from Baseline is presented.</description>

        <description>The effects of treatment on disease-related symptoms/quality of life was assessed using the Skindex-29 Questionnaire, which inquires about how often (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, All the time) during the previous 4 weeks the participant experienced the effect described in each of 29 items divided into 3 domains: Emotional (10 items), Symptoms (7 items) and Functioning (12 items). Responses to each item are transformed to a linear scale of 100, varying from 0 (no effect) to 100 (effect experienced all the time). Skindex-29 scores were reported as three individual domain scale scores; a scale score is the mean of a participant's responses to items in a given domain. Each domain score ranges from 0 (no effect) to 100 (effect experienced all the time), higher score implies higher impact of skin disease. Baseline was the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Change from Baseline is defined is post-dose visit value minus Baseline.</description>

          <description>The effects of treatment on disease-related symptoms/quality of life was assessed using the Skindex-29 Questionnaire, which inquires about how often (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, All the time) during the previous 4 weeks the participant experienced the effect described in each of 29 items divided into 3 domains: Emotional (10 items), Symptoms (7 items) and Functioning (12 items). Responses to each item are transformed to a linear scale of 100, varying from 0 (no effect) to 100 (effect experienced all the time). Skindex-29 scores were reported as three individual domain scale scores; a scale score is the mean of a participant's responses to items in a given domain. Each domain score ranges from 0 (no effect) to 100 (effect experienced all the time), higher score implies higher impact of skin disease. Baseline was the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Change from Baseline is defined is post-dose visit value minus Baseline.</description>

        <title>Part 2: Number of Participants With Non-serious AEs and SAEs and AELDs</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose which results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. AELD is adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment.</description>

        <title>Part 2: Number of Participants With Grade Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following clinical chemistry parameters: glucose, Prothrombin international normalized ratio (Pro. INR), albumin, amylase, ALT, AST, bilirubin, calcium, calcium ionized, cholesterol, creatinine, creatine kinase, lipase, potassium, magnesium, sodium, Triglycerides, ALP. Laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: death related to AE. Higher grade indicates greater severity. An increase was defined as an increase relative to Baseline. Baseline was the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Data for worst-case post Baseline with any grade increase is presented.</description>

The laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: death related to AE. Higher grade indicates greater severity. An increase is defined as an increase in CTCAE grade relative to Baseline grade. Baseline was the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Data for worst-case post Baseline with any grade increase is presented.</description>

        <title>Part 2: Number of Participants With Worst Case Vital Signs Results Relative to Baseline: Pulse Rate and Body Temperature</title>
        <description>Vital signs (pulse rate and temperature) were measured after resting for at least 5 minutes in a supine or semi-recumbent position. The clinical concern ranges were: For pulse rate (low &lt;60 beats per minute [bpm] and high &gt;100 bpm); For body temperature (&lt;=35 degrees Celsius or &gt;=38 degrees Celsius). Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changed to (low, normal or high), unless there was no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged, or whose value became normal, were recorded in the &quot;To Normal or No Change&quot; category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed &quot;To Low&quot; and &quot;To High&quot;, so the percentages may not add to 100%. Baseline was the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date.</description>

        <description>DBP and SBP were measured after resting for at least 5 minutes in a supine or semi-recumbent position. They were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. For SBP: Grade 0 (&lt;=120 millimeter of mercury [mmHg]), Grade 1 (121-139 mmHg), Grade 2 (140-159 mmHg), Grade 3 (&gt;=160 mmHg). For DBP: Grade 0 (&lt;=80 mmHg), Grade 1 (81-89 mmHg), Grade 2 (90-99 mmHg), Grade 3 (&gt;=100 mmHg). Higher grade indicates greater severity. Baseline was the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. An increase is defined as an increase in grade relative to Baseline grade. Number of participants with increase to Grade 3 from Baseline is presented.</description>
