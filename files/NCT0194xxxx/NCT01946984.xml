  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. The most common complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreaticography (ERCP)&#xD;
           is pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Several studies showed that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can prevent&#xD;
           the post ERCP pancreatitis, the investigators used diclofenac vs placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The effect of diclofenac in prevention of that complication, was measured by the number&#xD;
           of patients who developed pancreatitis, and compare it with the placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The investigators collected 199 patients, 17 excluded, 182 completed the study, all of&#xD;
           them underwent the intervention called &quot;ERCP&quot;, and randomized to have either Diclofenac&#xD;
           or Placebo before the procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  All patients signed informed consents for the procedure, and the participation in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between June 2012 and June 2013, 199 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 182 of&#xD;
           whom were included in the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients were excluded from study participation if they had a contraindication for&#xD;
           diclofenac, including patients with recently diagnosed peptic ulcer disease, renal&#xD;
           failure, those who developed acute pancreatitis during the two weeks before ERCP, those&#xD;
           with a history of chronic pancreatitis, and those who did not agree to participate in&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 182 patients who underwent ERCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative, the patients received 75 mg intramuscular(IM) diclofenac or IM normal&#xD;
           saline as placebo. At the end of each procedure, the investigators recorded the details&#xD;
           of the maneuvers performed, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. the total time of the procedure,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. the number of attempts at cannulation,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. the number of pancreatic duct cannulation,&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. the final diagnosis by ERCP,&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. whether a sphincterotomy, a needle-knife papillotomy, or stent placement were&#xD;
                performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum amylase was determined 12 hours after ERCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If the 12-hours serum amylase level was &gt; 3 times the upper normal limit and the&#xD;
                patient exhibited pain or nausea and vomiting, then the patient had pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acute pancreatitis was defined as serum amylase &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal&#xD;
                and associated with epigastric pain, back pain, and epigastric tenderness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Randomization was done by the GI nurse, concealed envelop&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Data were summarized by descriptive statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The Chi square was used to compare categorical patient data.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The Student's t test was used to compare continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Two-tailed P &lt; 0.05 was considered to indicate significance.&#xD;
