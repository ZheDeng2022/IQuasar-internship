      This study is being done to see if we can improve the way we manage patients' airways. In&#xD;
      some instances patients who have a beard, who do not have teeth or have breathing problems&#xD;
      during sleep present a challenge to the anesthesiologist. In such patients, it is sometimes&#xD;
      difficult to provide air/oxygen for breathing using a mask. The study doctors would like to&#xD;
      investigate a new method for holding a mask on the face of those patients. They are&#xD;
      interested in comparing a new method against two older methods. They believe the new method&#xD;
      will deliver a larger amount of air to the lungs. This information may help doctors provide&#xD;
      better care for patients who have beards, no teeth, or breathing problems during sleep.&#xD;

      Goal: To demonstrate that a modified submandibular hand position can overcome shortcomings to&#xD;
      the traditional E-C mask grip during difficult bag mask ventilation by a single practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mask Ventilation is a vital skill that needs to be mastered by virtually all medical&#xD;
      personnel. Whether in an acute care setting or a remote field situation, caregivers well&#xD;
      trained in mask ventilation have the capacity to save lives. Therefore, any advances in this&#xD;
      technique will have widespread and profound impact on morbidity and mortality outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally there are two main styles of mask ventilation, one-handed and two handed mask&#xD;
      grips. After the initiation of one-handed mask ventilation, if the provider experiences&#xD;
      difficulty, a switch is made to a two-handed grip. The two-handed grip has the disadvantage&#xD;
      of requiring a second caregiver to provide tidal volumes to the patient in distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional one-handed grip is taught using the &quot;E&quot; and &quot;C&quot; method. The most usual reason&#xD;
      for failure to ventilate with this method is air leak on the side opposite the stabilizing&#xD;
      hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two-handed grip allows both hands to stabilize most of the circumference of the facemask.&#xD;
      This is valuable because it can overcome an inadequate seal that is due to an unstable&#xD;
      single-handed grip. Failure to obtain adequate seal between the face and a pliable facemask&#xD;
      can also be attributed to variables not related to ventilation technique. For example,&#xD;
      improper fit, patient anatomical variability, edentulousness, and full beard may also&#xD;
      contribute to inadequate seal and deficient masked ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Han et al. have delineated the classification of a difficult airway using a four-point&#xD;
      system, where grade 3 indicates difficult mechanical ventilation (inadequate, unstable, or&#xD;
      requiring two providers) and grade 4 indicates impossible ventilation. Kheterpal et al. later&#xD;
      showed that body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or greater, a beard, Mallampati classification III or&#xD;
      IV, age of 57 yr or older, severely limited jaw protrusion, and snoring were independent risk&#xD;
      factors for a grade 3 airway. Snoring and thyromental distance of less than 6 cm were shown&#xD;
      to be independent risk factors for a grade 4 airway. Both studies utilized the traditional&#xD;
      one-handed grip or a two-handed grip when attempting mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that some of the established risk factors in a difficult airway may be related to&#xD;
      inadequate seal, it is crucial to explore limitations in the traditional methods of mask&#xD;
      ventilation. For example, the traditional &quot;C&quot; and &quot;E&quot; one-handed grip only allows for the&#xD;
      provider to apply pressure to the left border of the facemask. This leaves the right border&#xD;
      of the facemask vulnerable to losing a seal and air escaping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here we propose a novel Sub Mandibular one-handed grip that allows for pressure to be applied&#xD;
      to both the left and right borders of the facemask during masked ventilation. The anesthesia&#xD;
      provider (AP) will stand perpendicular to the long axis of the patient's body, aligning the&#xD;
      AP's umbilicus to the patient's mentum. Next, the AP will place their fifth digit along the&#xD;
      body of the left mandible. The fourth digit will be placed along the body of the right&#xD;
      mandible. The AP will rotate clockwise at the hip while keeping their elbow against their&#xD;
      body to lift the patient's chin to 45 degrees. This rotational force adds strength to the&#xD;
      chin lift maneuver. The AP will avoid pressing the soft tissue in the submental triangle. The&#xD;
      first digit will be used to apply pressure to the left border of the facemask while the&#xD;
      second and third digits will be used to apply pressure to the right border of the facemask.&#xD;
      Accordingly, the provider will be able to apply pressure to both the left and right borders&#xD;
      of the facemask with the intention of eliminating the right-sided air leak often observed&#xD;
      while utilizing the traditional &quot;C&quot; and &quot;E&quot; one-handed technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A demonstration of each of the 3 grips will be shown to the qualifying AP either on an awake&#xD;
      patient or a staff member. The AP will be asked to provide return demonstrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . After informed consent is obtained baseline vital signs will be documented. An intravenous&#xD;
      line will be started and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) standard monitoring&#xD;
      devices will be placed. Study subjects (n=6 in each) will be stratified into the following&#xD;
      patient groups: edentulous, bearded, obstructive sleep apnea, Mallampati Class III or IV, and&#xD;
      previous neck radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects assigned a Mallampati Class I or II with no comorbidities will serve as the control&#xD;
      group (n=6). Mallampati Class I patients will be defined as those patients with clear&#xD;
      visualization of the tonsils, uvula, and soft palate during inspection of the oral cavity by&#xD;
      the provider. Mallampati Class II patients will be defined by visualization of the hard and&#xD;
      soft palate, and upper portion of the tonsils and uvula. Mallampati Class III patients will&#xD;
      be defined by visualization of the soft and hard palate, and base of the uvula. Mallampati&#xD;
      Class IV patients will be defined by visualization of the hard palate only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of anesthesia care providers, faculty and Advanced Practice Nurse Anesthesia&#xD;
      (APN-A) (formerly known as Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists/(CRNAs), will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Data collected about the professional participants will include&#xD;
      gender, dominant hand, grip strength and age range. These participants will be asked to use&#xD;
      the hand dynamometer and their score will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be undergoing standard IV induction of general anesthesia by anesthesiology&#xD;
      attending staff with 2 Î¼g/kg fentanyl and 2 mg/kg propofol, as well as 1 to 2mg of midazolam&#xD;
      and 1mg/kg of lidocaine at the anesthesiologist's discretion. After loss of consciousness&#xD;
      patients will receive 2 mg/kg of succinylcholine in preparation for intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After induction of general anesthesia and before placement of the endotracheal tube (ETT) or&#xD;
      laryngeal mask airway (LMA), the experienced anesthesia provider will attempt to ventilate&#xD;
      the patient using an adult sized facemask. Each facemask will be pre-inflated with 150cc of&#xD;
      room air and facemask will be placed over patient's oral cavity utilizing the traditional&#xD;
      one-handed C and E technique. The anesthesia provider will then provide a chin lift maneuver&#xD;
      to 45 degrees and activate the ventilator 45 seconds after succinylcholine administration. A&#xD;
      preset tidal volume of 8cc/kg will be delivered for 8 breaths. Any air leak will be noted and&#xD;
      provider will attempt to minimize air leak. Tidal volumes (TV), peak airway pressures(PAP)&#xD;
      will be recorded at each breath by an independent observer as well as heart rate (HR), oxygen&#xD;
      saturation rate (spO2) and presence/absence of Carbon dioxide ( + /- CO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same process delivering 8 breaths with the same data parameter collection will be&#xD;
      repeated using the novel sub mandibular grip followed by the two-handed grip. Each of the&#xD;
      facemask techniques is estimated to take 1.5 minutes for a total 5 of minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the cases where tidal volume achieved is a level below 1cc/kg, an oral airway will be&#xD;
      used, the ventilation reinstituted, and the provider will record a new set of data using the&#xD;
      three techniques as described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient cannot be ventilated after placement of the oral airway, an endotracheal tube&#xD;
      (ETT) will be placed following standard hospital protocol and the study for this patient will&#xD;
      be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All providers will have experience of 12 months or greater in airway management. We will&#xD;
      recruit anesthesia providers of both genders. Because grip strength can vary between&#xD;
      providers we will measure grip strength using a dynamometer (BASELINEÂ® Hydraulic Hand&#xD;
      Dynamometer). The anesthesia providers' age range, gender, grip strength and hand size (tip&#xD;
      of 2nd digit to wrist length) will be recorded. The AP will be tested with the dynamometer in&#xD;
      the dominant hand. The arm will be held at the side of the body. The base of the dynamometers&#xD;
      should rest at the heel of the palm while the handle should rest on the four fingers. The&#xD;
      (AP) should squeeze the handle with maximum isometric effort, which is maintained for about 5&#xD;
      seconds. No other body movement is allowed. The AP will be encouraged to give a maximum&#xD;
      effort. The AP grip strength in pounds will be recorded.&#xD;
