  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The skin and intestinal tracts of humans are covered with microbes, and the gene products of&#xD;
      these microbes are collectively known as the human microbiome. Many studies in recent years&#xD;
      have linked the microbiome to many aspects of human health and disease. Premature infants are&#xD;
      vulnerable to invasive infections, some of which may originate from the microbes that&#xD;
      colonize the skin and in the intestinal tract. Therefore, determining the patterns of early&#xD;
      life colonization and the sources of colonization in these infants may be critical to&#xD;
      determining infectious risks. This prospective study is proposed to identify the sources of&#xD;
      microbes that colonize extremely low birth weight (ELBW; &lt;1000 g birth weight) infants&#xD;
      immediately following birth through the first month of life. The study team plans to&#xD;
      non-invasively survey the skin and stool of ELBW preterm infants in combination with sampling&#xD;
      of their mothers' skin and stool and the intensive care nursery (ICN) environment. As&#xD;
      controls, the study team will perform a similar survey of full term mother-infant pairs.&#xD;
      Samples will be analyzed using high throughput sequencing techniques to determine microbial&#xD;
      content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical barrier sprays or emollients are commonly used early in life in the ELBW infant to&#xD;
      reduce insensible water loss and enhance the integrity of the skin barrier. The effect of&#xD;
      these treatments on the development of the skin microbiome remains unknown. As part of this&#xD;
      study, the study team also proposes the application of two different skin barrier therapies&#xD;
      to small areas on infant's legs to determine the effects of the different treatments on skin&#xD;
      colonization. While all parts of the study are described in this summary and the detailed&#xD;
      description, the remainder of the record focuses on this interventional portion of the study&#xD;
      (Group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are outlined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To elucidate the relationship between microbes in the health care environment and&#xD;
           colonization patterns of the intestinal tracts in preterm and term infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To understand the relationship between mode of delivery, the health care environment,&#xD;
           and the colonization of the skin in preterm and term infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the effects of topical skin barrier therapies on the colonization patterns&#xD;
           of the skin in preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To ascertain the relationship between the composition of the microbes colonizing preterm&#xD;
           and term infants and the development of mucosal and systemic immunity to those microbes.&#xD;

      The long term goals of this project are to understand what constitutes protective and&#xD;
      beneficial gut and skin microbial communities and determine approaches to foster and preserve&#xD;
      these communities. By defining the gut and skin-associated microbiological communities and&#xD;
      how these communities are affected by the environment and medical interventions including&#xD;
      barrier therapies, the study team will make essential first-steps towards achieving these&#xD;
      long term goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design &amp; Procedures Study Groups: Potential subjects will be identified among Duke&#xD;
      Hospital-admitted women with expectant preterm (≤30 weeks gestation) or term delivery. A&#xD;
      total of 45 infants will be enrolled into one of three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm microbiome Group 1 (n=10, ELBW preterm infants) will be part of an intensive survey&#xD;
      of infant colonization with bacteria and fungi in addition to the intensive care environment.&#xD;
      This will be a strictly observational group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin microbiome Group 2 (n=30, ELBW preterm infants) will be prospectively evaluated for the&#xD;
      development of the skin microbiome in the context of a topical skin therapy typically used in&#xD;
      the study nursery. Each infant will serve as his/her own control with a well-circumscribed,&#xD;
      small area of the anterior thigh left untreated as the control area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full term microbiome Group 3 (n=5, full term infants) will be surveyed for skin and&#xD;
      intestinal colonization and serve as a control group. This will be a strictly observational&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm and Full Term One-time Group 4 (n=100 preterm infants born at &lt; 2000 grams and 100&#xD;
      full term). This will strictly be an observational group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive Microbiome Survey of Preterm Infants: Biological and environmental samples will&#xD;
      be collected from enrolled mother and infant subjects (Study Group 1) from the time of&#xD;
      delivery through the first two weeks of life. For stool samples, a minimum of 1 gram will be&#xD;
      collected. For blood samples, 4 ml will be collected. Infant stool samples will be collected&#xD;
      from diapers. Maternal stool and vaginal samples will be collected at the time of caesarian&#xD;
      section using a sterile nylon swab of the distal rectum and vagina. Skin samples will be&#xD;
      collected by gentling rubbing the target area with a sterile nylon swab moistened with&#xD;
      sterile saline. Breast milk samples will be scavenged from left over material after the&#xD;
      feeding of each infant. Since breast milk undergoes a single thaw from frozen storage per&#xD;
      feeding, excess milk may not be stored for subsequent feedings and would be put to waste. A&#xD;
      portion of stool, blood, and breast milk samples will be placed into sterile, nucleic&#xD;
      acid-free tubes. An additional portion of stool, blood, and breast milk samples will be&#xD;
      placed into sterile, nucleic acid-free tubes containing the preservative RNA later. All&#xD;
      stool, breast milk, and blood samples will be frozen at -20°C within 1 hour of collection.&#xD;
      Remaining samples will be placed at 4°C within 18 hr of collection. Samples will be&#xD;
      transferred to -80°C storage within 24 hours of collection. A label carrying a unique sample&#xD;
      number will be placed on each sample as it is collected. A binder with sample labels and a&#xD;
      log of sample numbers, time of collection, sample type key, and special notes regarding&#xD;
      collection, will be placed at the bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is standard of care for ELBW infants in the Duke Intensive Care Nursery that non-sterile&#xD;
      gloves are worn by all providers and family members for contact with the infant for the first&#xD;
      two weeks of life. Providers and relatives will be asked to place used gloves in a zip-lock&#xD;
      bag at the bedside after contact with the infant. The gloves will be grouped into zip-lock&#xD;
      bags by provider type (medical provider, nurse, or ancillary staff) or relative. The bags&#xD;
      will be collected each shift or day. Glove samples will not be labeled or linked with&#xD;
      individual providers or relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When available, scavenged serum will be used for assessment of antibody specificity in&#xD;
      relationship to colonization patterns of each infant. In some cases, stool samples will be&#xD;
      analyzed for the presence, quantity and specificity of mucosal immunoglobulins. A video&#xD;
      recorder will be positioned above the incubator on a tripod attached to the incubator&#xD;
      vertical rail to capture changes in the infant's environment, including medical or nursing&#xD;
      interventions. The camera will be positioned to capture the infant and the inside incubator&#xD;
      surroundings, while avoiding the faces of those interacting with the infants to preserve&#xD;
      anonymity. When hands or instruments are placed inside the incubator, they will be recorded.&#xD;
      Video will be downloaded onto an external hard drive every 24 hours, and then onto a secure&#xD;
      computer server for analyses. Video recording will be continuous for two weeks except for the&#xD;
      period of time it takes to change the memory card. The video will be coded for the start and&#xD;
      stop times of all clinical care events in order to explore the influence of environmental&#xD;
      changes on the diversity of the infant's microbiome using Mangold Interact software.&#xD;
      Inter-rater reliability will be checked by having video coders score a 30-minute period of&#xD;
      each video, then computing Cohen's kappa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiome Survey of Full Term Infants: The study team will perform a more limited survey of&#xD;
      five full term infants as a control group (Study Group 3). Samples will be collected from&#xD;
      mothers and infants. Samples will be collected daily while the mother and infant are in the&#xD;
      hospital, which is generally expected to be approximately three days. At hospital discharge,&#xD;
      the parents will be sent home supplies in a prepaid return mailing envelope to be used to&#xD;
      collect skin and stool samples when the infant reaches two weeks of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin Microbiome Substudy Plan: A controlled study of a commonly used skin treatments (No&#xD;
      Sting protective spray and no treatment) will be performed in 30 ELBW infants (Study Group 2)&#xD;
      to determine if No Sting promotes different skin microbial colonization. The current standard&#xD;
      of skin care for ELBW infants in the Duke ICN is application of No Sting to all external&#xD;
      exposed, non-mucosal areas shortly after birth and again at one week of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quarter 1.5 x 3 inch silicon patch with two holes will be applied to each of the infant's&#xD;
      thighs. One hole in each patch will be left untreated (control) while the other is treated&#xD;
      with No Sting. The patches will be used to define the treatment and no treatment areas. The&#xD;
      remainder of the infant's skin will be treated with No Sting therapy at birth and seven days&#xD;
      of life, as per the current standard of care. Daily sampling of each of the sites (No Sting,&#xD;
      and untreated) will be performed by gentle application of a nylon swab for the first two&#xD;
      weeks of life, and then twice weekly until one month of age. Samples will be analyzed for&#xD;
      microbial content. Additional sampling will include infant stool as well as maternal skin,&#xD;
      vaginal, perirectal, and stool samples as outlined in Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will use non-invasive skin probes to perform daily assessments of&#xD;
      transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin pH. TEWL will be measured using the DermaLab® TEWL&#xD;
      probe (Cortex Technology, Hadsund, Dermark), which consists of an open probe with paired&#xD;
      sensors placed at different distances from the skin. Humidity and temperature are measured in&#xD;
      each sensor to calculate vapor pressure gradients. The difference between two vapor pressure&#xD;
      gradient measures is representative of TEWL at that point on the skin [19, 20]. Environmental&#xD;
      humidity levels will also be measured using the DermaLab® before obtaining the TEWL measures.&#xD;
      The average humidity readings from the two sensors will be recorded as environmental&#xD;
      humidity. The probe will be thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol prior to and between uses to&#xD;
      minimize cross-contamination or microbial transmission. The ethanol will be allowed to air&#xD;
      dry prior to use of the probe. The Extech PH100 meter will be used to measure skin pH in the&#xD;
      range of 0.00 to 14.00. The small flat surface electrode provides a non-intrusive accurate&#xD;
      measure of pH. No Sting will be reapplied on day seven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm and Full Term One-time Microbiome Survey (Study Group 4): One hundred preterm infants&#xD;
      born at &lt; 2000 grams and 100 full term infants will be included for a one-time data&#xD;
      collection of infant only microbiome samples. For premature infants environmental samples&#xD;
      will also be collected. The same procedures described for Study Group 1 and 2 above will be&#xD;
      used for this single data collection.&#xD;
