  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if the use of tranexamic acid, a safe and effective&#xD;
      antifibrinolytic, in patients with intertrochanteric hip fractures will result in a reduction&#xD;
      in blood transfusion rates. Treatment will be administered pre-operatively as well as at the&#xD;
      time of surgical incision. The primary outcome will be need for blood transfusion. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include calculated perioperative blood loss, length of stay, cost of inpatient&#xD;
      care, and rate of adverse events, including DVT, PE, infection, MI, cerebrovascular event,&#xD;
      need for re-hospitalization or re-operation and 30 day mortality.&#xD;

      All patients meeting specified criteria will be recruited for enrollment into the study.&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained from the patient or health care proxy upon diagnosis of&#xD;
      intertrochanteric hip fracture by the on-call orthopedic resident or research coordinator. At&#xD;
      that time, each patient will be randomized into one of two cohorts (Figure 1) by the&#xD;
      hospital's Investigational Pharmacy using computer generated randomization and allocation&#xD;
      concealment. The Investigational Pharmacy will also be responsible for the storage,&#xD;
      preparation and distribution of both the tranexamic acid and the placebo injections. The two&#xD;
      patient groups will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 1g of intra-venous tranexamic acid upon presentation to the emergency department and&#xD;
           again at the time of surgical incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Placebo injections upon presentation to the emergency department and again at the time&#xD;
           of surgical incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both patients and the treating surgeons will be blinded with regard to placebo vs. treatment&#xD;
      until completion of the study. All patients will be treated surgically with a long&#xD;
      trochanteric femoral nail (TFN). Blood transfusion criteria will remain consistent with&#xD;
      hospital standards (Hb&lt;8 g/dL or symptomatic anemia) as determined by an independent, blinded&#xD;
      medical team who will follow the patient throughout the hospital stay. Total number of blood&#xD;
      transfusions received will be documented upon patient discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be permitted to weight bear as tolerated post-operatively and deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis will be standardized: subcutaneous heparin, 5000 units every 8&#xD;
      hours beginning upon admission until 12 hours prior to surgery and beginning 6 hours after&#xD;
      surgery for a total of 6 weeks. Calf mechanical compression devices will also be utilized&#xD;
      during the inpatient stay and will remain on at all times with the exception of physical&#xD;
      therapy sessions. Diagnostic studies to assess for thromboembolic events (i.e. DVT, pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism (PE), and stroke) will be ordered only if the patient develops clinical signs or&#xD;
      symptoms that justify their use. Patients will be followed at regular intervals (6wk, 3mo,&#xD;
      6mo, 1 year) and at each time point the patient will be asked to report any adverse events&#xD;
      (DVT, PT, Stroke, myocardial infarction, infection, hospitalization) that have occurred since&#xD;
      their last visit. In cases where patients are unable to accurately report their medical&#xD;
      history, care providers will be questioned and records will be obtained from care facilities&#xD;
      if necessary. An attempt will be made to contact any patient who is lost to follow-up via&#xD;
      telephone and U.S. Mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of the study will be monitored by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board at 6&#xD;
      month intervals and the study will be discontinued at their discretion based on the number of&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
