    <textblock>
      Major non-cardiac surgery has a high degree of morbidity and mortality. Recently, measurement&#xD;
      of a patient's preoperative cardiorespiratory reserve, performed non-invasively by&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing, has been shown to be predictive of outcome following&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery. All patients prior to major surgery are starved for a minimum of 6 hours&#xD;
      and often longer prior to major elective surgery. It has been shown that elite athletes who&#xD;
      are hypohydrated have reduced exercise capacity and lower cardiorespiratory function. These&#xD;
      results are further exaggerated in &quot;non-trained&quot; individuals. Therefore, the starvation&#xD;
      policy prior to surgery may have a deleterious effect on outcome after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 AIMS This is a pilot study of health volunteers to assess the role of carbohydrate (CHO)&#xD;
      (preload) and carbohydrate-protein (CHO-P) (Highfive energy source 1 in 4) in improving&#xD;
      aerobic capacity after a period of fasting mimicking the current starvation policy prior to&#xD;
      surgery. Both of these have similar calorific value and only differ in the amount of&#xD;
      carbohydrate and protein supplementation.&#xD;

      2 OUTLINE OF STUDY METHODOLOGY (See Appendix D) The methodology of the testing is outlined&#xD;
      below:-&#xD;
&#xD;
      STARVATION POLICY The three exercise tests will be undertaken on three separate days but at&#xD;
      the same time in the morning to minimise the starvation time and ensure consistency. All&#xD;
      patients will be asked not to partake in strenuous exercise 24 hours prior to the test as&#xD;
      this could affect hydration and performance status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starvation exercise test Participants will be asked to starve from midnight prior to the&#xD;
      test. They may have a small glass of water at 6am on the day of the test. This is in line&#xD;
      with the current starvation policy at the Freeman Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHO loaded test Participants will be asked to drink an isotonic carbohydrate loaded drink&#xD;
      (preload) appendix E the night before the test and also two hours prior to the CPX test. This&#xD;
      type of clear drink has been shown to be emptied from the stomach within 2 hours and as such&#xD;
      can be administered safely on the day of surgery. They again will be asked to starve from&#xD;
      midnight prior to the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHO-P loaded test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to drink an isotonic carbohydrate drink (Highfive energy source&#xD;
      4:1) the night prior to the test and also two hours prior to the CPX test. Again, it has been&#xD;
      shown that this type of drink is emptied from the stomach rapidly. They again will be asked&#xD;
      to starve from midnight of the test&#xD;
&#xD;
      CARDIOPULMONARY EXERCISE TESTING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary exercise measurements are conducted in the consistent environment of the&#xD;
      preassessment clinic in Clinic H, Freeman Hospital. CPX equipment includes an electronically&#xD;
      braked cycle ergonometer, 12 lead ECG and a metabolic cart. The ECG allows online monitoring&#xD;
      of all leads for rate and rhythm, and can measure changes in any S-T segment&#xD;
      depression/elevation suggestive of cardiac ischaemia. The metabolic cart has oxygen and&#xD;
      carbon dioxide analysers with a response time enabling breath-by-breath measurement.&#xD;
      Calibration is ensured before each test. VO2, VCO2, heart rate, minute ventilation, and work&#xD;
      rate are displayed continuously throughout the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting up the CPX test Patients have ECG leads applied before getting on the bike, and are&#xD;
      coached on the mouthpiece and communication during the test. They are instructed to give&#xD;
      their 'best effort' but to stop if they feel dizzy or faint. The increment in work rate is&#xD;
      predetermined using equations for an estimate of expected work capacity, to aim for the test&#xD;
      duration to be approximately 6-10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPX Test protocol Initially, 2 - 5 minutes of resting data is performed, ensuring patient&#xD;
      comfort, and that the Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) falls below 1, indication the patient&#xD;
      is not hyperventilating. Next, there is 1-3 minutes of unloaded cycling, followed by a graded&#xD;
      increase in incremental workload. The leg speed throughout the test is maintained at 50-60&#xD;
      rpm to ensure constant effort. The patient is given verbal feedback and encouragement&#xD;
      throughout the test. The test is stopped by the patient due to fatigue, pain, light&#xD;
      headedness, or when they fail to maintain greater than 30 rpm for more than one minute&#xD;
      despite encouragement. On completion of the exercise phase of the test, the patient is&#xD;
      further monitored during the recovery period until heart rate reaches within 10% of pre-test,&#xD;
      and all ST segments have normalised if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise data processing Results are presented in standard nine-panel format compiled by CPX&#xD;
      software. Further analysis for sub maximal parameters related to cardiopulmonary reserve is&#xD;
      undertaken by trained personnel&#xD;
