      The purpose of the mPeer2Peer Study (mP2P) is to see if we can use a smartphone and a Peer&#xD;
      Navigator (PN) to improve medical care for HIV-positive people who have been out of HIV care&#xD;
      for over one year.&#xD;

      Research Question&#xD;
&#xD;
      Can real-time collection of patient-level data using smartphones be feasibly and effectively&#xD;
      utilized by peer navigators to deliver timely and individualized support interventions&#xD;
      outside of a clinical setting, thereby facilitating improved engagement in HIV care and&#xD;
      medication adherence for HIV-infected drug users?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal benefit from antiretroviral therapy (ART) is contingent upon consistent engagement in&#xD;
      HIV care and reliable medication adherence. HIV-infected intravenous drug users (IDUs) delay&#xD;
      entrance into and under-utilize medical care. Those who access HIV care are frequently lost&#xD;
      to follow up or are intermittent users. Out-of-care IDUs are more likely to develop AIDS,&#xD;
      have reduced survival, engage in risky behavior and place others at risk for HIV&#xD;
      transmission; therefore, evidence-based tools to promote engagement of IDUs in care are&#xD;
      urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic-based, individualized support delivered by case managers or patient navigators&#xD;
      improves engagement in HIV care for many patients, but few settings have sufficient resources&#xD;
      to offer adaptive, individualized, long-term support to all who need it. Mobile health&#xD;
      (mHealth) technologies able to collect patient-level data in real time and to facilitate&#xD;
      responsive communication hold promise as an effective strategy to optimize HIV care and&#xD;
      medication adherence for IDUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this pilot feasibility trial planning grant is to obtain feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability and trial optimization data to inform the design and implementation of a&#xD;
      randomized trial to fully evaluate the hypothesis. To accomplish this objective, specific&#xD;
      aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. To evaluate the feasibility and participant acceptability of mHealth-enhanced&#xD;
      peer navigation to improve retention in care for out-of-care, ART-eligible IDUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the mobile phone-based intervention, participants will utilize a smartphone interface to&#xD;
      report perceived barriers to accessing care and adhering to prescribed therapies. Through&#xD;
      repeated quantitative and qualitative evaluations, investigators will assess feasibility,&#xD;
      participant acceptability and logistical challenges (e.g., retention, participant burden,&#xD;
      device loss, data quality, response fatigue, perceived support) of the intervention sustained&#xD;
      over one year of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. To define trial elements required for optimization of a future randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial of mHealth-enhanced peer navigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term effectiveness of mHealth interventions (i.e., maintenance of sustained HIV RNA&#xD;
      suppression over years), will require large and expensive clinical trials. In prudent&#xD;
      preparation for a future trial, investigators will collect preliminary efficacy data&#xD;
      comparing the peer-navigation/smartphone intervention to usual care for several alternative&#xD;
      endpoints, including time to ART initiation, missed visit frequency, and rate of virologic&#xD;
      suppression. Investigators will also define the optimal patient load and scope of work for&#xD;
      peer navigators and the intensity and frequency of electronic communication that facilitate&#xD;
      meaningful peer support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient navigators have been successfully employed to assist persons utilizing complex&#xD;
      medical services. In contrast to the medical case management paradigm, which tends to involve&#xD;
      delivery of specific, predefined services, patient navigation features responsive, flexible&#xD;
      problem-solving to overcome perceived barriers to care. The World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      recommends psychosocial support for all HIV-infected persons and has promoted the use of&#xD;
      peers in addressing care and retention needs. In resource-constrained settings, peers trained&#xD;
      for specific health-related tasks represent a potentially cost-efficient and sustainable&#xD;
      workforce. Besides addiction and mental health co-morbidity, HIV-infected IDUs often have&#xD;
      limited income, education, insurance, and social support, unstable housing and food&#xD;
      insecurity. Poor health literacy, negative experiences with medical institutions and negative&#xD;
      health-related beliefs may pose additional barriers to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of peer navigators in HIV care is to influence areas which impact engagement in&#xD;
      care, namely to: 1) Educate and counsel regarding acceptance of HIV diagnosis and&#xD;
      understanding of HIV prevention and treatment, 2) Assist in overcoming practical barriers to&#xD;
      care (e.g., accessing social services like drug treatment, housing or transportation&#xD;
      assistance, 3) Identify and reduce sources of instability, 4) Facilitate patient coping&#xD;
      through life skills training, and 5) Improve patient-provider communication. Data suggest&#xD;
      that peer-led interventions should be personalized and practical, addressing individual&#xD;
      concerns and barriers rather than group-level support.8 The frequency and intensity of&#xD;
      patient-peer interaction needed for this individualization and the extent to which mobile&#xD;
      technology can improve communication toward this end need clarification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mHealth approaches to optimizing HIV care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of mobile cellular devices has grown rapidly worldwide, increasing from 2 billion&#xD;
      subscriptions in 2005 to an estimated 5.3 billion at the end of 2010.9 The promise of mobile&#xD;
      health (mHealth) technologies for strengthening health care delivery in resource-limited&#xD;
      settings has been acknowledged by the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in&#xD;
      development of its strategic plan. Short Message Service (SMS) text messages were recently&#xD;
      shown in a large randomized trial to be an effective intervention for smoking cessation. Text&#xD;
      messages have also been effectively utilized to improve attendance at clinic appointments,&#xD;
      although few data are available from HIV clinics. ART dose reminder messages sent with pagers&#xD;
      or mobile phones have been used in several settings to improve adherence. Two recent&#xD;
      randomized mHealth studies in sub-Saharan Africa have demonstrated benefit of weekly text&#xD;
      messages for improving adherence and rates of viral suppression. Additional randomized trials&#xD;
      of SMS adherence reminders are under development in India and Cameroon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for Peer Navigators (PNs) working with HIV-infected IDUs is that similar&#xD;
      backgrounds and shared experiences will strengthen relationships and provide PNs access and&#xD;
      credibility not easily achieved by medical professionals. HIV infection among IDUs is&#xD;
      transmitted through drug-using networks. However, these same peer networks have also served&#xD;
      as the vehicle for several peer-driven interventions with demonstrated efficacy in reducing&#xD;
      HIV risk behavior, often outperforming traditional approaches. With lower-income, poorly&#xD;
      educated, predominantly minority HIV-infected IDUs, investigators propose that having a&#xD;
      knowledgeable 'peer' provide counsel and support during entrance to care and ART initiation,&#xD;
      and remain a stable presence into the maintenance phase could directly addresses many of the&#xD;
      barriers encountered by this community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be primarily recruited from the existing ALIVE cohort. Additional&#xD;
      participants will be recruited among patients who have received HIV care in the past at the&#xD;
      Johns Hopkins Moore Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total sample size for this study will be 60, with 30 participants in each study arm.&#xD;
      Because the main objective of this study is to demonstrate feasibility and acceptance of a&#xD;
      mHealth intervention, analysis of the data generated will largely be exploratory and&#xD;
      descriptive, rather than driven by a priori hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In November 2012, the ALIVE Study identified 54 participants who meet the criteria for both&#xD;
      being out of HIV care and recent drug use. The Moore Clinic clinical staff estimates that&#xD;
      around 180 patients could meet these criteria, providing a combined pool of roughly 230&#xD;
      individuals from which the study can begin recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be approached at their regular visit by their interviewer and the&#xD;
      Research Coordinator about participating in a new study. Invitation will be determined by&#xD;
      clinic interviewers or staff, who will notify the Research Coordinator if a participant is&#xD;
      eligible. Potential participants will be contacted at the ALIVE Study or the Moore Clinic,&#xD;
      based on recent data or records. If an ALIVE participant self-reports to a study interviewer&#xD;
      that they have never been in care or have been out of care for over a year, they will be&#xD;
      referred to the study coordinator for more information and screening. Eligible individuals&#xD;
      who confirm they have not received any HIV care in the past year will be assisted in&#xD;
      scheduling an appointment with a primary care provider at the Moore Clinic. Only participants&#xD;
      who attend their first HIV care visit (confirmed through the electronic medical record) will&#xD;
      undergo enrollment and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of Moore clinic efforts to identify out-of-care persons, they periodically review&#xD;
      their records and contact individuals directly to clarify if patients are seeing another&#xD;
      provider or to support them to re-engage in care at the Moore clinic. The clinic (namely&#xD;
      Jeanne Keruly and her staff) will share this information on out-of-care Moore clinic patients&#xD;
      with the mP2P study and will assist us in identifying when out-of-care persons are scheduled&#xD;
      for an appointment. At their subsequent visit, Moore Clinic patients will meet with the&#xD;
      coordinator (preferably that day) for more information and screening. The study will use a&#xD;
      recruitment script and screening tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants may also be referred to the study coordinator for eligibility&#xD;
      screening from Moore Clinic providers who encounter patients who have been lost to follow-up&#xD;
      (i.e. have not seen their primary HIV provider for over one year), but present to the clinic&#xD;
      for a new visit, because of an administrative issue or urgent care appointment. With provider&#xD;
      assent, the recruiter will approach these patients, explain the study and if interested, and&#xD;
      schedule them to attend an enrollment visit where consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent Process&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Research Coordinator will read the consent form aloud to each enrolling participant&#xD;
      before providing training and instruction in the use of all devices. The study participant&#xD;
      will sign then their name and date the form, as will the Coordinator. A copy of the consent&#xD;
      form will be provided to the client.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who are cognitively impaired to the extent that they either cannot give informed&#xD;
      consent or cannot give self-report will be excluded. Self-report is a central outcome&#xD;
      measure; including participants who cannot do it would invalidate the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part of the evaluation of the intervention will include elicitation of feedback from the peer&#xD;
      navigator staff regarding their impressions about the effectiveness of the intervention,&#xD;
      unforeseen challenges and best practices. As part of monthly staff meetings with the study&#xD;
      coordinator and PN clinical supervisor, a 30-60 minute focus group will be conducted with&#xD;
      peer navigators. Because their conversations will be audio recorded and analyzed, their&#xD;
      participation in the focus groups constitutes research. Written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from PNs by the study coordinator at each of these sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer Health Navigation&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first HIV care visit, participants will return to the Wood Clinic for a baseline&#xD;
      interview and randomization into one of the two study arms (PN or treatment as usual).&#xD;
      Investigators modeled the peer navigation intervention after several HIV prevention trials&#xD;
      that aimed to assist high-risk individuals in overcoming logistical barriers to receiving&#xD;
      social services and medical care. Peer Navigators will be part-time employees of the study,&#xD;
      hired through Johns Hopkins School of Public Health (JHSPH) Human Resources procedures, and&#xD;
      will work approximately 10-15 hours per week, meeting study participants in person or by&#xD;
      phone to discuss strategies to remain engaged in care and overcome logistical challenges&#xD;
      encountered in the health care system. Persons living with HIV who have successfully&#xD;
      navigated the health care system and who are receiving ongoing HIV care will be encouraged to&#xD;
      apply, but HIV-positive status will not be a requirement of the position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PN will log all PN-participant contacts daily using the eMOCHA system. This will allow an&#xD;
      assessment of the level of intensity of PN-participant contact that may be associated with&#xD;
      clinical benefit, as well as inform the appropriate caseload for PNs. The frequency,&#xD;
      duration, and nature of each PN/patient interaction as well as an assessment of action plan&#xD;
      goals and identified barriers will be compared to outcomes from the study aims, including&#xD;
      time to ART initiation, missed visit frequency, and rate of virologic suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study coordinator will serve as the operational supervisor for peer navigators, and will&#xD;
      be responsible for facilitating communications among PNs and research staff. The study&#xD;
      coordinator will provide technical assistance with the web-based patient tracking software&#xD;
      and assist with review of participant-specific data. The coordinator will be responsible for&#xD;
      matching PNs with eligible participants, ensuring that all data are collected according to&#xD;
      the schedule and specifications in the research protocol, organizing the training and hiring&#xD;
      of PNs, and for setting up regular operational supervision meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A co-investigator (Dr. Hutton) trained in clinical psychology with extensive experience with&#xD;
      HIV-infected persons with substance abuse will serve as the clinical supervisor for peer&#xD;
      navigators. She will be responsible for organizing regular clinical supervision sessions to&#xD;
      review case studies, address issues of PN/counseling overlap and discuss issues arising from&#xD;
      the execution of the work. These sessions should be a mix of group and individual level&#xD;
      supervision. The clinical supervisor should help PNs deal with issues of setting boundaries&#xD;
      with participants and developing methods for dealing with urgent issues. Clinical supervisors&#xD;
      will ensure that clinical assistance is available for PNs when situations arise in which a&#xD;
      licensed mental health worker's assistance is needed. Additional support will be provided by&#xD;
      clinicians and HIV care providers who have been trained to address the specific medical needs&#xD;
      of IDUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feedback about perceived logistical challenges related to PN/participant interaction and the&#xD;
      overall conduct of the study will be collected at monthly meetings by the operational&#xD;
      supervisor. The entire team of investigators will compile and review these comments at&#xD;
      quarterly meetings throughout the study. At 3 months and 9 months after the start of the&#xD;
      study, the monthly PN meeting will consist of a formal focus group, led by a co-investigator&#xD;
      with qualitative research methods expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ecologic Momentary Assessment (EMA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMA refers to using electronic handheld data collection devices to collect real-time&#xD;
      information about stress, drug cravings and drug use participants in the context of their&#xD;
      daily routine, rather than in a research study. In this study, participants will be given a&#xD;
      smartphone to carry for up to one year. The current phone model used is the Motorola Droid&#xD;
      X2, running applications developed using a software platform created by the Center for&#xD;
      Clinical Global Health Education (CCGHE) at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The&#xD;
      application, named the electronic Mobile Open-source Comprehensive Health Application&#xD;
      (eMOCHA), has been used to support community health workers in resource poor areas heavily&#xD;
      impacted by HIV. It has been modified by the CCGHE programming team specifically for this&#xD;
      study. A staff member will train participants in how to use the eMOCHA interface and all&#xD;
      relevant features of the smartphone. Participants will be required to show they can run a&#xD;
      &quot;demo&quot; questionnaire before commencing use in the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smartphone-based data collection from participants in the intervention arm will commence two&#xD;
      business days following randomization, to allow for troubleshooting of device problems and&#xD;
      participants' increased familiarity with the eMOCHA interface. At scheduled data-collection&#xD;
      times, the participant's phone will generate an audible alert and the eMOCHA application will&#xD;
      automatically launch. To protect confidentiality, every eMOCHA session will begin with a&#xD;
      password-entry screen containing no other information. Frequency and length of EMA sessions&#xD;
      will be dynamic over the course of the study in order to individualize the intervention and&#xD;
      collect process data related to Aim 2. By default, participants will receive two prompts&#xD;
      daily for the first three months of the study. Based on participant feedback, rate of EMA&#xD;
      response and level of engagement in HIV care, the protocol may be converted to a &quot;maintenance&#xD;
      phase&quot; of less frequent prompts after the initial three-month in-person study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each eMOCHA session will feature multiple-choice and free-text question items related to&#xD;
      three domains: engagement in HIV care (retention and adherence), drug/alcohol use, and mood.&#xD;
      The drug use items will query participants regarding the intensity of drug cravings and the&#xD;
      occurrence of any drug use. The brief version of the Profile of Mood States (POMS) will be&#xD;
      used to assess moods such as anger, depression and anxiety. Within each domain, the eMOCHA&#xD;
      application will guide the participant through three steps that (1) assess the participant's&#xD;
      current experiences or symptoms, (2) assess barriers to engagement in care, and (3) provide&#xD;
      support messages or information. Peer navigators will monitor the responses of each&#xD;
      participant over time, and will contact the participant if he or she reports specific&#xD;
      problems, or appears to have increasing levels of self-reported negative mood states, drug&#xD;
      use, or poor medication adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twice each day, the smartphone will signal the participant to answer a questionnaire.&#xD;
      Participants will have 15 minutes to respond after notification. The alarms can occur between&#xD;
      9:00 am and 9:00 pm. One alarm will go off at a random time every day and the other alarm&#xD;
      will always go off at 9:00 pm to recap what happened during your day. The questions should&#xD;
      take about five minutes every day. Also, if participants use drugs or have a craving to use&#xD;
      drugs, they should report this event using a questionnaire that is similar to the random&#xD;
      questionnaire, but tailored to contain more drug-specific content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global Positioning System (GPS) Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a continuation of previous efforts during the EXACT Study, investigators will compare&#xD;
      global positioning systems (GPS) data and neighborhood-level psychosocial stress indicators&#xD;
      with drug-related EMA behavioral data. Participants' location will be recorded every five&#xD;
      minutes using the smartphone's internal GPS. GPS data will be encrypted and transferred&#xD;
      wirelessly to a secure server daily. The GPS data on the phone will be deleted after&#xD;
      transfer. Participants' daily EMA data will be compared to weekly ACASI data and tagged with&#xD;
      GPS data to construct a temporal and spatial profile of drug use and psychosocial stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological Samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every three months, a trained phlebotomist will draw 10mL of whole blood to place in a&#xD;
      repository, using approved biosafety procedures. Current research is actively investigating&#xD;
      several promising biological markers of stress. If, as anticipated, a valid and reliable&#xD;
      biomarker of longer-term stress (on the order of weeks to months) is identified, blood&#xD;
      samples from the repository will be tested at an appropriate laboratory. Genetic studies may&#xD;
      include both host and viral genetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and assessment of HIV care utilization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both study arms will return to the Wood clinic every three months to collect&#xD;
      reimbursement for participation and to complete a follow-up questionnaire assessing the same&#xD;
      domains evaluated in the baseline questionnaire. The study will also collect 10mL (2&#xD;
      teaspoons) of blood serum for storage and future testing. This study visit should take about&#xD;
      30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will uniquely benefit from an existing data sharing agreement with the Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort (JHHCC) study, which will allow highly accurate and timely&#xD;
      ascertainment of care utilization endpoints ART prescription and pharmacy fill dates will be&#xD;
      collected from this database to verify participant-reported dates of ART initiation.&#xD;
      Appointment data are electronically managed through the Moore Clinic Registration System&#xD;
      (Epic Enterprise Scheduling Software, Madison, WI). All ambulatory visits scheduled are input&#xD;
      into this system at the point of service or through incoming calls by staff trained in the&#xD;
      use of this database. When a patient registers on the day of the appointment, the visit is&#xD;
      keyed as a completed visit. JHHCC data are available for download within approximately two&#xD;
      weeks of being entered into the system. Importantly, assessing clinic attendance and&#xD;
      prescription of ART using this external database will allow assessment of the main endpoints&#xD;
      for all randomized participants even if some are not retained in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will conduct in-depth, qualitative interviews among the 30 participants in the&#xD;
      intervention arm. Ten will be randomly selected to complete an interview after 3-6 months of&#xD;
      the intervention, in order to provide feedback that may be used to refine the intervention&#xD;
      during the subsequent trial period; the remaining 20 will be interviewed at the end of&#xD;
      follow-up to collect data about their overall experience with the intervention. In order to&#xD;
      start processing the data, memos will be developed by the interviewer as data are collected.&#xD;
      Interviews will be semi-structured; interview guides will have predefined main themes, but&#xD;
      these guides are meant to be dynamic and will allow new topics to emerge during the course of&#xD;
      the interview. Important topics will include: (1) satisfaction and challenges with eMOCHA&#xD;
      interface, (2) satisfaction with relationship to peer navigator (3), perceived intrusiveness&#xD;
      of the intervention, (4) ongoing challenges to engagement in HIV care, (5) ways the&#xD;
      smartphone may facilitate getting HIV care information/help (e.g. from informal support&#xD;
      networks, the internet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus groups conducted with the peer navigator staff will allow the investigator team to get&#xD;
      a better understanding about the effectiveness of the intervention, unforeseen challenges and&#xD;
      best practices. These will occur as part of monthly staff meetings with the study coordinator&#xD;
      and PN clinical supervisor, last 30-60 minutes, and will be audio-recorded for later thematic&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither investigators nor participants will be blinded to which of the study arms individuals&#xD;
      are randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for use of a non-treatment group&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to justify spending resources for new, technology-based interventions, it is&#xD;
      essential to demonstrate that they add value compared to currently available care. The Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins Moore Clinic employs a limited number of full-time social workers, nurses, and peer&#xD;
      advocates who share responsibility for coordinating outpatient HIV care and facilitating&#xD;
      referrals for ancillary services. While this level of staffing is inadequate to provide&#xD;
      comprehensive, individualized case management for every patient, patients who desire&#xD;
      assistance with an aspect of their care have same-day access to this support, which&#xD;
      represents the currently available standard of care. Nearly all new patients seen in the&#xD;
      Moore Clinic meet with a social worker after completing the initial intake visit with their&#xD;
      medical provider, and may schedule follow-up meetings as needed or be seen on a walk-in&#xD;
      basis. Control-group participants will work with clinic-based support staff for coordination&#xD;
      of their care, meaning peer navigators will not actively facilitate interaction between&#xD;
      control group participants and clinic providers after the initial HIV care visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant removal criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants may terminate their participation in the study at any time. If the&#xD;
      smartphone is lost, stolen or damaged during use, the study will assign a new one at no&#xD;
      charge. Participants never have to pay to replace a device. However, if a second smartphone&#xD;
      is lost, stolen or damaged, they will be asked to leave the mP2P Study. This will not affect&#xD;
      their participation in the ALIVE Study or their clinical care with the Moore clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certificate of Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mP2P study will collect data from a population of persons who formerly or currently&#xD;
      engage in illegal reportable activities, namely drug use. As the mP2P study is designed as a&#xD;
      sub-study of the ALIVE cohort, modifications will be made to the existing Certificate of&#xD;
      Confidentiality issued by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (DA-87-042) to protect&#xD;
      sensitive information reported by participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Process and Documentation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will take place at Johns Hopkins University, and will be carried out by the&#xD;
      Project Coordinator. Additional study staff may be trained in consent procedures, to provide&#xD;
      backup to the study. The Coordinator will read the consent form aloud while the potential&#xD;
      participant reads along. The participant will be able to ask any questions during the consent&#xD;
      process and before signing the form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimal risk: The probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research&#xD;
      are not greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during routine physical&#xD;
      and psychological examinations or tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smartphone (EMA): Participants may feel hassled or annoyed by the EMA prompts. Also, some of&#xD;
      the questions are personal and they might not feel comfortable answering those questions.&#xD;
      Participants who are unfamiliar with smartphones or other electronic devices could feel some&#xD;
      discomfort or frustration in dealing with these technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smartphone (GPS): The main risk from carrying the GPS unit is loss of privacy. Using a GPS&#xD;
      device will not significantly increase participants' risk burden more than they currently&#xD;
      experience. Many participants already use mobile phones daily, which contain a system by&#xD;
      which a user's location can be tracked. Encrypted data will be wirelessly uploaded to a&#xD;
      secure server and erased from the device daily. The risks and procedures regarding the&#xD;
      smartphone will be explained during both screening and consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phlebotomy: Phlebotomy is performed by drawing blood from a vein in the forearm or&#xD;
      antecubital fossa. This may cause pain during the insertion of the needle or slight bruising&#xD;
      afterward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACASI: Some questions in the ACASI questionnaire are personal and participants might feel&#xD;
      uncomfortable or upset about answering them. Participants may refuse to answer any question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality: Although precautions will be taken to protect privacy, there is the chance&#xD;
      that confidentiality can be broken. All data collected outside the study clinic are protected&#xD;
      by the Certificates of Confidentiality for the ALIVE I and ALIVE II studies. Participants&#xD;
      will be reminded of the legal requirements for confidentiality within the ALIVE Study.&#xD;
      Confidentiality risks will be minimized by using study materials without personal&#xD;
      identifiers, using only unique study numbers, and by following strict procedures in data&#xD;
      collection, data entry, and data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer Navigators will know participants by name and may have contact information for&#xD;
      participants stored on their own mobile phones, but will not carry any information linking&#xD;
      participants' identities with study-related information outside the locked offices of the&#xD;
      Wood Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Level of Research Burden&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers in this project will have their normal daily activities interrupted twice per day.&#xD;
      However, each interruption for an EMA response should take only 3-5 minutes. One purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to find out if this is too high of a burden for this population. The maximum&#xD;
      total daily time devoted to the study should be a no more than 15 to 20 minutes, even with&#xD;
      event-generated responses. Each weekly visit should take about 30 minutes, not including time&#xD;
      spent in the waiting room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Potential Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may not benefit directly for being in this study. Benefits to society include&#xD;
      helping us to understand research techniques that can promote engagement in HIV care as well&#xD;
      as improve data collection. The research may help society understand the environment in which&#xD;
      people use drugs and the specific challenges IDUs may encounter when accessing HIV care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting Unanticipated Problems/Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      No adverse events are anticipated as part of the study. However, participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to contact the Principal Investigator, Dr. Kirk, the Research Coordinator, Mr.&#xD;
      Genz, or the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board (IRB) if they feel they have been&#xD;
      harmed during the course of study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 24-hour access to an on-call provider through the Moore Clinic. If&#xD;
      needed, this communication will be facilitated by the study smartphone, which has important&#xD;
      clinic and study-related numbers pre-programmed. Participants' will be formally evaluated&#xD;
      with questionnaires and in-person interviews every three months at the ALIVE clinic by&#xD;
      research staff, at which time they can report any unforeseen challenges related to their&#xD;
      participation. They will have the ability to leave non-urgent messages for the study&#xD;
      coordinator or peer navigator, which will be answered within one business day.&#xD;
