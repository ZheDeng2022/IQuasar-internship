      The purpose of this study is to see if the Artificial Pancreas (AP) Platform can successfully&#xD;
      control blood sugar in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus on insulin pump therapy in a&#xD;
      hospital setting. Investigators will also be studying to see if the heart rate informed&#xD;
      Control To Range (hrCTR) can improve the performance of the system during and immediately&#xD;
      after exercise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The artificial pancreas (AP), known as Closed-Loop Control of blood glucose in diabetes, is a&#xD;
      system combining a continuous glucose monitor (glucose sensor), a control algorithm (complex&#xD;
      mathematical formulas), and an insulin pump. The algorithms are intended to maintain your&#xD;
      blood glucose level within a certain range. This is called Control-to-Range. The algorithms&#xD;
      are intended to maintain your blood glucose level within a certain range. The algorithms run&#xD;
      on a portable AP platform on an Android smart phone, called the Diabetes Assistant (DiAs)&#xD;
      Medical Platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, researchers hypothesize that the heart rate informed Control To Range (hrCTR)&#xD;
      will limit the risk for hypo and hyperglycemia during and immediately after exercise in&#xD;
      adolescents 12 - 17 years of age and assess if the hrCTR will improve additional measures of&#xD;
      overall short term glycemic control in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be performed at both Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of&#xD;
      Virginia. IRB approvals have been obtained at both institutions.&#xD;
