  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attending day care centres with programs specifically designed for patients with dementia is&#xD;
      believed to postpone admittance to nursing home as well as increase quality of life and&#xD;
      well-being for both patients and their family caregivers. We aim to investigate to what&#xD;
      degree attendance in day care centres with programs for people with dementia is effective for&#xD;
      patient and their caregivers whilst also cost efficient for society. The study consists of a&#xD;
      quasi-experimental trial with comparison group. 400 patients with dementia, along with a&#xD;
      family caregiver, will be included in the trial. Effects will be measured at baseline, after&#xD;
      one and two years. Data collection will be made at three levels; at patient level with&#xD;
      measures of cognition, depression, quality of life, functioning in activities in daily&#xD;
      living, neuropsychiatric symptoms and death; at caregiver level with measures of depression,&#xD;
      level of burden and quality of life; and at societal level with measures of nursing home&#xD;
      admittance, hospital stays and use of other health resources. Additionally,a qualitative&#xD;
      interview study will include 20 dyads from the main trial. The main focus will be on how&#xD;
      attending day care centre programs for patients with dementia affect the lives of both&#xD;
      patients and caregivers. Five of these dyads will be followed closely throughout the&#xD;
      participation period to be used as case examples.&#xD;

      A quasi experimental trial with a comparison group will be performed to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of the day care centre programs by comparing results from municipalities with (intervention&#xD;
      group) and without (comparison group) a day care centre program designed for people with&#xD;
      dementia using standardized assessment tools. Furthermore, a survey will be used to explore&#xD;
      the communication and co-operation between the professional staff at the day care centre, the&#xD;
      patients and the family carers by administering questionnaires to all three parties. Only&#xD;
      patients with mild degree of dementia will be asked to participate in the questionnaire.&#xD;
      Finally, qualitative interviews will be made with 20 dyads of patients and family carers to&#xD;
      collect their in depth experience with the day care centre program. Five of these patients&#xD;
      and their family carers will be followed closely as case examples for two years.&#xD;
