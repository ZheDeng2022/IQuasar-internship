      Over the last 20 years, cervical screening programs have had huge success in reducing&#xD;
      cervical cancer rates. These programs have done this by screening women at risk of developing&#xD;
      cancer with regular smear tests. Women with abnormal smears are followed up in colposcopy&#xD;
      clinics, and where needed, cervical surgery is performed to remove pre-cancerous areas on the&#xD;
      cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery to the cervix can include LLETZ (Large loop excision of the transformation zone)&#xD;
      treatment or cone biopsy. Many studies in the last few years have looked at the impact that&#xD;
      this necessary surgery can have on the function of the cervix. These studies have mainly&#xD;
      found an association between LLETZ treatment and an increased risk of preterm labour. There&#xD;
      have been no large studies investigating the effect cervical surgery may have on fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to examine the impact that cervical surgery may have on a&#xD;
      woman's future fertility. It has been postulated that cervical surgery may cause the cervix&#xD;
      to close, preventing sperm getting through or that it may cause changes in the secretions of&#xD;
      the cervix, secretions that are necessary for normal interaction with sperm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to send a questionnaire to women who have attended colposcopy.&#xD;
      The investigators will ask these women a series of questions relating to fertility desires&#xD;
      and divide the women in to two groups depending on whether the women needed cervical surgery&#xD;
      for pre-cancerous lesions or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: That cervical surgery has an impact on the function of the cervix and on&#xD;
      fertility.&#xD;

      With an increasing amount of young women undergoing cervical surgery for the treatment of&#xD;
      CIN, the fertility consequences need to be investigated. Infertility is estimated to affect&#xD;
      approximately one in six to one in ten couples and only about half of these seek medical&#xD;
      assistance. Causes of infertility include anovulation, tubal occlusion, endometriosis,&#xD;
      cervical and male factor. In approximately one third of cases, there is no cause found as to&#xD;
      why a couple are unable to conceive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many recent studies have looked at the likely association between cervical surgery and&#xD;
      increased risk of preterm labour. It has also been suggested in an Australian study that even&#xD;
      women with untreated CIN have a higher risk for preterm delivery, although it is unclear&#xD;
      whether this is related to the CIN itself, HPV effect or inflammatory changes in the cervix.&#xD;
      Studies are needed to clarify this further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few studies published in the literature, investigating the possibility that&#xD;
      cervical surgery has an effect on long term fertility. Most of these studies are small and&#xD;
      under-powered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kennedy et al in 1993 raised the possibility of cervical stenosis and amucorrhoea following&#xD;
      LLETZ in their retrospective study. In this study, 15 out of 2315 women who had LLETZ, were&#xD;
      subsequently seen in a fertility clinic. 2 out of these 15 women studied had cervical&#xD;
      stenosis. The authors advised caution with the use of LLETZ in young women with mild to&#xD;
      moderate dyskaryosis, although the investigators did concede that their numbers were small to&#xD;
      draw definite conclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bigrigg et al in 1994 performed a case controlled questionnaire regarding the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of LLETZ and this involved questions regarding infertility. There were 250 matched&#xD;
      pairs- women who had had a LLETZ (study group) and those women identified who had normal&#xD;
      cytology from their database (control group), for the entire study, but only 134 women&#xD;
      answered the questions on infertility (72 in the LLETZ group and 62 in the control group).&#xD;
      The investigators reported no apparent difference in infertility between the groups. Again&#xD;
      this study was limited by size -72 in the study group and 62 in the control group could&#xD;
      remember how long it took to conceive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cruickshank et al in 1995, followed up 653 women following LLETZ with a questionnaire and&#xD;
      found that none of the women subsequently investigated for infertility were found to have&#xD;
      cervical stenosis or amucorrhoea. Again this study was limited by size and incomplete&#xD;
      response rates. Of the 653 women, the majority reported that they had not stopped&#xD;
      contraception since their treatment - 452. Only 57 women reported trying to become pregnant,&#xD;
      of whom 11 succeeded, but 144 women did not answer this question on intention to become&#xD;
      pregnant. It is difficult to draw conclusions from this incomplete data and small numbers&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the cervix is necessary for sperm transit and subsequent fertility, it is likely that&#xD;
      factors, which affect the cervix, would also affect fertility. Therefore, women who attend&#xD;
      colposcopy for abnormal cervical cytology may be already at increased risk of fertility&#xD;
      problems which treatments such as surgery may accentuate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In relation to cervical surgery, three potential mechanisms of damage have been proposed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cervical stenosis - needs to be complete to prevent sperm entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary infection leading to ascending infection and tubal damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Changes in physical characteristics of cervical mucus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However it must be noted that not all surgery on the cervix is the same. Specimens from LLETZ&#xD;
      and cone treatments vary in size considerably and as would be intuitively suspected but also&#xD;
      has been confirmed by studies, the thickness and volume of the specimens can predict the&#xD;
      relative risk of pregnancy related morbidity. No study has looked at whether this size effect&#xD;
      also relates to fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies suggest that sub-fertile women who attend for IVF are more likely to have&#xD;
      abnormal cervical cytology. As this is HPV related, they may also be more likely to have had&#xD;
      other sexually transmitted infections. These may have caused tubal damage, thus leading to&#xD;
      infertility problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychological impact of receiving abnormal smear results and having to attend colposcopy&#xD;
      has also been investigated. Recent studies now show that women are concerned and have anxiety&#xD;
      about the potential effect that such results and treatments will have on patients' long term&#xD;
      fertility. To be able to adequately reassure women that there will be no negative&#xD;
      consequences to their reproductive health it is vital that the investigators research the&#xD;
      fertility effects as well as the obstetric effects that possible treatments may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to investigate the relationship between cervical surgery and&#xD;
      infertility in a large group of women who have attended the colposcopy clinic in the National&#xD;
      Maternity Hospital, Holles Street between the years 2001 and 2007.&#xD;

        identify those women who have had a LLETZ procedure and those who have had a cone biopsy&#xD;
        will be identified by accessing pathology records for cone biopsies for the specified&#xD;
