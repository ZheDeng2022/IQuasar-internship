  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a study drug called CPX-351. This drug has&#xD;
      been tested in adults but not yet in children and adolescents. This study tests different&#xD;
      doses of the drug to see which dose is safer in children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have blood cancer are being asked to take part in this study . Blood cancers may&#xD;
      include leukemia and lymphoma. Patients able to be in this study have already been treated&#xD;
      with standard chemotherapy for their disease and the disease is still growing or has come&#xD;
      back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPX-351 is a drug that is not yet approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) and is only used in research studies like this one. CPX-351 is made up of two&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs that patients may have already received called cytarabine and daunorubicin&#xD;
      that are now packaged together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another purpose of this study is to collect blood samples for special research studies.&#xD;
      Researchers want to study how much of the CPX-351 is in the body over time. These studies are&#xD;
      call pharmacokinetic studies or PK studies for short. PK studies require the collection of&#xD;
      several blood samples before and after participants are given the study drug.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline is a frequently used chemotherapy platform&#xD;
      for both newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies. Synergistic antitumor activity has been demonstrated between&#xD;
      cytarabine and daunorubicin that is dependent upon the ratio of the drugs with the best&#xD;
      therapeutic effect observed with a cytarabine to daunorubicin ratio of 5:1 in in vitro and in&#xD;
      vivo models. CPX-351 is a liposomal preparation of cytarabine and daunorubicin that maintains&#xD;
      this therapeutic drug ratio 24 hours post infusion. The altered biodistribution from&#xD;
      encapsulation may result in a greater therapeutic effect in patients with relapsed&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies and demonstrate greater tolerability than non-liposomal cytarabine&#xD;
      and daunorubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single institution phase-I pilot study that aims to assess the pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      toxicity and tolerability of CPX-351 in pediatric and young adults with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies. Subjects will receive a single course of CPX-351 administered on&#xD;
      Days 1, 3, and 5. The study will first open to children in a dose exploration phase, and then&#xD;
      be available to an expanded cohort, which will be open to children and young adults once a&#xD;
      tolerable dose has been determined.&#xD;
