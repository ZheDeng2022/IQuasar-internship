  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (CA) is a leading public health problem causing nearly one&#xD;
      third of a million deaths annually in the US, accounting for half of all cardiovascular&#xD;
      deaths and surpassing deaths from stroke, heart failure, and breast and lung cancer combined.&#xD;
      Twenty to fifty percent of CA patients (pts) can be resuscitated initially but many die&#xD;
      before hospital discharge or suffer permanent neurologic damage. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH)&#xD;
      improves survival and neurological outcomes. Despite aggressive, targeted post arrest&#xD;
      management, including TH, approximately 50% of pts die before leaving the hospital due to&#xD;
      global ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) known as the &quot;post arrest syndrome&quot;, 1 which is a&#xD;
      sepsis-like state characterized by elevated markers of cellular inflammation and injury. It&#xD;
      is believed that TH works by decreasing the body's basal metabolic rate (BMR) and attenuating&#xD;
      the systemic inflammatory response (SIR). However, specific triggers of the intense&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory response are unclear. This &quot;gap&quot; in knowledge must be closed to identify&#xD;
      targeted therapy to decrease IRI and improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood flow to the gut is decreased markedly and intestinal tissue becomes ischemic during CA&#xD;
      and CPR, particularly when vasoconstrictor drugs such as epinephrine, are given. IRI of the&#xD;
      intestine increases intestinal permeability leading to intestinal microbial translocation and&#xD;
      endotoxin release that can stimulate and perpetuate systemic inflammation and cause&#xD;
      subsequent multi-organ dysfunction. Endotoxin also increases body temperature and energy&#xD;
      expenditure and may attenuate TH induced reductions in BMR and hence, decrease efficacy. The&#xD;
      purpose of this novel pilot study is to detect systemic endotoxin release following CA in&#xD;
      humans and determine association with cytokine activation, and BMR alterations during TH.&#xD;

      Hypothesis 1 Intestinal ischemia during and following Caridac Arrest leads to increased gut&#xD;
      permeability and endotoxin release that stimulates the Systemic Inflammatory Response that is&#xD;
      responsible for subsequent death and disability after resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Different degrees of systemic endotoxin activity variably affect Basic&#xD;
      Metabolic Rate during Therapeutic Hypothermia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial samples of blood, stool and expired gas will be measured at predetermined timepoints&#xD;
      after ROSC from cardiac arrest.&#xD;
