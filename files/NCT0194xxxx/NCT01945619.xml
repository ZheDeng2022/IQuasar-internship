  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects have a type of blood cell cancer, other blood disease or a genetic disease for which&#xD;
      they received a stem cell transplant. After transplant while the immune system grows back the&#xD;
      subjects have an infection with one or more of three viruses - Epstein Barr virus (EBV),&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) or adenovirus - that has persisted or come back despite standard&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adenovirus is a virus that causes symptoms of a common cold normally but can cause serious&#xD;
      life-threatening infections in patients who have weak immune systems. It usually affects the&#xD;
      lungs and can cause a very serious pneumonia, but it can also affect the gut, the liver, the&#xD;
      pancreas and the eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMV is a virus that can also cause serious infections in patients with suppressed immune&#xD;
      systems. It usually affects the lungs and can cause a very serious pneumonia, but it can also&#xD;
      affect the intestinal tract, the liver and the eyes. Approximately 2/3 of normal people&#xD;
      harbor this virus in their body. In healthy people CMV rarely causes any problems because the&#xD;
      immune system can keep it under control. If the subject and/or the subject's donor are&#xD;
      positive for CMV, s/he is at risk of developing CMV disease while his/her immune system is&#xD;
      weak post transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EBV is the virus that causes glandular fever or kissing disease. It is also normally&#xD;
      controlled by a healthy immune system, but when the immune system is weak, it can cause&#xD;
      fevers, enlarged lymph nodes and sometimes develop into a type of cancer called lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This treatment with specially trained T cells (called CTLs) has had activity against these&#xD;
      viruses when the cells are made from the transplant donor. However, as it takes 2-3 months to&#xD;
      make the cells, that approach is not practical when the subject already has an infection. We&#xD;
      want to find out if we can use CTLs which have already been made from another donor that&#xD;
      match the subject and his/her donor as closely as possible and if the CTLs will last in the&#xD;
      body and have activity against these viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study these cells were given to 50 patients with viral infections post transplant&#xD;
      and over 70% had a complete or partial response. The purpose of this study is to make CTL&#xD;
      lines leftover from that previous study available to patients with viral infections that have&#xD;
      not responded to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These virus-specific CTLs are an investigational product not approved by the FDA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CTL lines were made at Baylor College of Medicine from donors for other transplant&#xD;
      patients or other normal donors from the National Marrow Donor Program. All donors were&#xD;
      screened in the same way as blood donors. When the CTL lines were made, blood was taken from&#xD;
      the donors and used to grow T cells. To do this, we first infected a type of blood cells&#xD;
      called monocytes with a specially produced adenovirus gene that also carries part of the CMV&#xD;
      gene. The monocytes with these new genes then stimulated the T cells. This stimulation&#xD;
      trained the T cells to kill cells with this part of the CMV virus or with adenovirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We then grew these CTLs with more stimulation with EBV infected cells (which we made from&#xD;
      donor blood by infecting them with EBV in the laboratory). We also put the adenovirus that&#xD;
      carries the CMV gene into these EBV infected cells so that they too had CMV and adenovirus&#xD;
      proteins. These EBV infected cells were treated with radiation so they cannot grow. By this&#xD;
      type of culture, we grew out T cells that can see and attack cells infected with EBV,&#xD;
      adenovirus or CMV. Once we made sufficient numbers of T cells we tested them to make sure&#xD;
      they killed cells infected with these viruses and then froze them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cells will be thawed and injected into an intravenous line over 1-5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants on this study will get the same dose of cells. However if the subject's&#xD;
      infection responds to the CTLs, s/he may be offered up to 4 more doses at two-week intervals.&#xD;
      If the infection does not respond, the doctors may also try a line from a different donor.&#xD;
