    <textblock>
      Depression carries the largest burden of all medical disorders in middle to high income&#xD;
      countries, as determined by the World Health Organization. Despite many antidepressant&#xD;
      strategies, only a third of patients get well after their first treatment and a third remain&#xD;
      ill after several treatments. Moreover, antidepressant treatments all have a delayed action&#xD;
      ranging up to several weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine (KET) has been used for decades as a sedative and anesthetic. In treatment-resistant&#xD;
      depressed patients(TRD), an intravenous dose much lower than necessary for anesthesia may&#xD;
      produce a robust antidepressant effect and may even abolish suicidal thoughts within hours,&#xD;
      peaking within 24 hours. But, its antidepressant effect generally lasts only days.Previous&#xD;
      studies examining KET in TRD have been critiqued for lack of an effective placebo measure due&#xD;
      to brief perceptual experiences associated with KET. Thus, the current study compares KET&#xD;
      against a short-acting sedative. The phases of this study compare response to a single KET&#xD;
      injection to 6 injections over 2 weeks. Next, KET responders are given 1 injection a week for&#xD;
      3 weeks of either KET or the sedative agent to determine if beneficial effects of KET are&#xD;
      maintained, and to assess duration of its benefits after repeated administration. The genetic&#xD;
      profile of patients for a substance promoting contacts between cells and brain will be&#xD;
      determined to investigate if response to KET could be predicted with that blood test. This&#xD;
      substance, as well as several chemicals that produce inflammation, will also be measured in&#xD;
      the blood to investigate their role in the effect of KET. Patients will receive, in total, no&#xD;
      more than the equivalent of two to three anesthetic dose of KET. Results from this study will&#xD;
      help establish the beneficial effects of a single KET injection as a rapid intervention for&#xD;
      major depression, and to investigate the possibility of obtaining a prolonged antidepressant&#xD;
      effect with repeated injections.&#xD;

      Major depressive disorder (MDD) carries worldwide the largest burden of diseases among&#xD;
      mental, neurological, and substance-use disorders measured in Disability Adjusted Life Years&#xD;
      (DALYs), according to the World Health Organization (WHO).1 In turn, MDD has the highest&#xD;
      DALYs in middle to high income countries, with ischemic cardiac diseases being second.2&#xD;
      Although there are effective treatments for MDD, a large proportion of patients do not&#xD;
      achieve remission even after several attempts, and any significant response, when it&#xD;
      manifests itself, takes place a delay of a few weeks.3,4 There is always urgency to treat MDD&#xD;
      because although patients may have been ill for several weeks, months, and sometimes years,&#xD;
      they are often in a crisis situation when they consult. The nature of the crisis may be&#xD;
      familial, financial/professional, or the consultation may take place because of intense&#xD;
      personal suffering, possibly involving suicidal ideation. Consequently, rapid therapeutic&#xD;
      action and high remission rates represent the two major unmet needs for MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last few years, considerable attention has been dedicated to the glutamate system as a&#xD;
      possible contributor of the antidepressant response. The most striking breakthrough has been&#xD;
      the rapid antidepressant response of intravenous ketamine using doses that are about a&#xD;
      quarter of the routinely utilized anesthetic dose in children and adults.5,6 Unlike many&#xD;
      anesthetic agents, ketamine does not depress cardiovascular and respiratory parameters.7 The&#xD;
      primary action of ketamine is to block N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The&#xD;
      antidepressant response to ketamine often manifests itself within a few hours, but is&#xD;
      generally maximal after 24 hours.8 Importantly, a single infusion produces in the most&#xD;
      subjects a robust decrease of suicidal ideation.9,10 The drawback of this approach is,&#xD;
      however, that its benefits generally disappear within a week.6 Consequently, much clinical&#xD;
      work remains to be carried out in order to better understand and maintain the antidepressant&#xD;
      response of ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim #1: The first aim of this proposal is to characterize the antidepressant action&#xD;
      of a single dose of ketamine in a truly double-blind paradigm. Indeed, even the low doses of&#xD;
      ketamine (0.2-0.5 mg/kg)8,11 produce mild derealization and therefore the use a mere saline&#xD;
      solution in prior studies has been inadequate as a control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To show that the infusion of a low dose of the short-acting benzodiazepine midazolam&#xD;
           will serve as an adequate active control for ketamine. It is hypothesized that because&#xD;
           midazolam produces marked sedation, it will serve as an adequate control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if the brain-derived neutrophic factor (BDNF) mediates the antidepressant&#xD;
           response. In mice, a VAL/MET polymorphism for the BDNF gene, ketamine is devoid of&#xD;
           effects. The influence of this polymorphism will be evaluated in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim #2: The second goal of this proposal is to attempt enhancing and prolonging the&#xD;
      antidepressant effect of ketamine by giving it repeatedly at a rate of three infusions per&#xD;
      week for two consecutive weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess whether ketamine responders will improve further after a six infusions over&#xD;
           two weeks. It is hypothesized that ketamine non-responders following a single infusion&#xD;
           will not show a significant improvement with repeated infusions of ketamine at a dose of&#xD;
           0.5 mg/kg given three times a week for two weeks, but that in responders repeated&#xD;
           ketamine will produce a more robust and sustained antidepressant action than a single&#xD;
           infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess whether the inflammatory status of the depressed patients is altered by the&#xD;
           response to ketamine. Pro-inflammatory mediators and cortisol are generally elevated in&#xD;
           depression while melatonin is decreased. These anomalies are typically restored with&#xD;
           effective treatments. This will be investigated in the light of the rapid antidepressant&#xD;
           effect of ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim #3: The third goal of this proposal is to prolong the antidepressant effect of&#xD;
      ketamine. In this third consecutive phase of the project, ketamine-responsive patients will&#xD;
      receive ketamine on a once weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1)To demonstrate that the antidepressant effect of ketamine will be sustained over four weeks&#xD;
      using a single infusion per week. The antidepressant response to a single infusion of&#xD;
      ketamine disappears within 7 days. It is hypothesized that repeated infusions of ketamine, at&#xD;
      an interval of one week for four weeks, will maintain the antidepressant effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2)To assess how long the antidepressant effect of repeated ketamine infusions will last in&#xD;
      follow up. After the first three phases of this project that will last about eight weeks, the&#xD;
      average duration of a standard antidepressant medication trial, the responders will be&#xD;
      monitored to follow their clinical evolution. It is hypothesized that the responders will&#xD;
      show a longer maintenance of their response than after the first infusion in phase one of the&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase I: the double-blind crossover. After patients will have been deemed eligible to&#xD;
           participate in the study, blood will be drawn for genotyping and various assays (BDNF&#xD;
           Val/Met, BDNF, morning melatonin and salivary cortisol, C-reactive protein, IL-1β, IL-2,&#xD;
           IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and anti-inflammatory factors IL-4 and IL-10, as&#xD;
           previously done in our laboratory).101-102 They will be randomized to receive&#xD;
           intravenously either 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine (the readily available racemic mixture) or 30&#xD;
           µg/kg of midazolam as a 250 ml infusion (prepared in our unit) over 40 minutes, given by&#xD;
           a research nurse in the presence of a study physician. Their antidepressant drug regimen&#xD;
           will not be altered throughout the study. A clinician will evaluate their clinical&#xD;
           status prior to the infusion, using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale&#xD;
           (MADRS)103 and the Clinical Global Intensity-Severity (CGI-S)104 and the patients will&#xD;
           rate themselves using the Quick Inventory Depressive Symptoms-Self-report (QIDS-SR)105&#xD;
           and a self-report questionnaire rating suicidality. The patients will be assessed using&#xD;
           the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-positive symptom scale106 at baseline (before the&#xD;
           infusion), time 0 (immediately after infusion is complete), then at 60 and 120 minutes&#xD;
           post time 0. The CGI-Improvement (CGI-I)104 will be used to obtain a clinical evaluation&#xD;
           of overall change of their condition after two hours before discharging the patients two&#xD;
           hours after the infusion. The patients will come in the next day for an evaluation using&#xD;
           the MADRS, CGIs, and the QIDS-SR and will be asked to guess what drug they received.&#xD;
           Four days after the infusion, the patients will repeat the QIDS-SR at home, and they&#xD;
           will come in for an evaluation at day 7. If the patients did not respond, or if they&#xD;
           returned to 80% of their MADRS score before the infusion, they will receive either&#xD;
           ketamine or midazolam to complete the crossover protocol. If the patients are&#xD;
           maintaining more than a 20% improvement of their baseline MADRS score, they will be&#xD;
           asked to come in on a weekly basis for an assessment, and will be asked to complete a&#xD;
           QIDS-SR twice a week (at days 10, 14, 18, 21, and so on) in order to assess how long the&#xD;
           therapeutic effect lasts. Patients who have not response to their second infusion or&#xD;
           those found to have relapsed during the weekly follow-up visits, will continue into&#xD;
           phase II. Patients who are unable, ineligible, or unwilling to enter phase II will be&#xD;
           given a recommended treatment plan and returned to their family physician with a&#xD;
           consultation plan, or additional/alternative treatment options at the discretion of the&#xD;
           study physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to obtain an objective measure of their activity level and of the pattern of&#xD;
           their sleep-wake cycle, patients will wear an actimeter watch for several days during&#xD;
           screening and throughout the protocol. The data will be downloaded weekly during the&#xD;
           visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase II: the repeated treatment over two weeks. Once patients are deemed not to have&#xD;
           responded to the second infusion or have lost their improvement (relapsing to a MADRS&#xD;
           score over 80% of their baseline score prior to the second infusion), they will receive&#xD;
           repeated ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg). They will be given 3 infusions per week for two&#xD;
           weeks. On visit 6 of phase 2 the patients will be assessed using the Brief Psychiatric&#xD;
           Rating Scale-positive symptom scale106 at baseline (before the infusion), time 0&#xD;
           (immediately after infusion is complete), then at 60 and 120 minutes post time 0. Their&#xD;
           clinical status will be assessed prior to each infusion using the MADRS, the CGI-S, the&#xD;
           CGI-I, and they will rate themselves using the QIDS-SR and a self-report questionnaire&#xD;
           rating suicidality. Patients will be assessed two to three days after the sixth&#xD;
           infusion. The ratings throughout phase II will help determine whether repeated&#xD;
           administration produces a greater and sustained improvement than a single infusion.&#xD;
           Biological assays will be repeated at the end of Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Phase III: the repeated treatment over four weeks and the naturalistic follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two to three days after the sixth infusion, patients not achieving a 50% improvement of their&#xD;
      MADRS score, when compared to their baseline score prior to the first of the six infusions,&#xD;
      will be taken out of the study and offered to be treated in our Research Unit using&#xD;
      additional pharmacological and/or psychotherapeutic approaches. Patients improving by 50% or&#xD;
      more on the MADRS scale will receive ketamine once a week for four weeks. They will be&#xD;
      assessed using the same scales as mentioned above prior to each infusion. Patients will be&#xD;
      assessed two to three days after the fourth weekly infusion. The ratings throughout phase III&#xD;
      will help determine whether repeated administration of ketamine is effective to maintain the&#xD;
      beneficial action of a relatively more intense regimen of ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of the patients reaching more than 80% or more of their MADRS score, when compared&#xD;
      to their baseline score prior to the last four infusions, will cease and will be offered to&#xD;
      be treated in our Research Unit using additional pharmacological and/or psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      approaches. Patients maintaining more than 20% improvement will be assessed weekly to&#xD;
      determine how long the therapeutic effects of ketamine last. Biological assays will be&#xD;
      repeated at the end of Phase III.&#xD;
