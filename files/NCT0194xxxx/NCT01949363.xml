      This study is a Phase I, open label, non-randomized, dose-frequency escalation&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics study among 24 healthy male and female subjects, aged 18 to 45 years to&#xD;
      determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of high-, multi-dose cefixime for the treatment of&#xD;
      reduced susceptibility gonorrhea. Stage 1(Cohorts A and B) will examine the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of single 400mg and 800mg dose of cefixime. Stage 2(Cohorts C and D) subjects will take 800mg&#xD;
      of cefixime every 12 hours for 2 doses. If that dosing regimen is well tolerated, the&#xD;
      dose-frequency will escalate to 800mg every 8 hours for 3 doses, and serum levels of cefixime&#xD;
      will be measured. Study duration is approximately 47 weeks.&#xD;

      This study is a Phase I, open label, non-randomized, dose-frequency escalation&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics study among 24 healthy male and female subjects, aged 18 to 45 years to&#xD;
      determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of high multi-dose cefixime for the treatment of&#xD;
      reduced susceptibility gonorrhea. The study will occur in two stages as described below.&#xD;
      Stage 1: Confirm/establish the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 400mg and 800mg doses of cefixime&#xD;
      tablet. Stage 2: Define dosing frequency necessary to achieve total serum cefixime levels&#xD;
      that exceed 2.0 mcg/mL for over 20 hours. Stage 1 (Cohorts A and B): Six subjects will be&#xD;
      admitted to the Johns Hopkins Bayview Clinic Trials Unit to assess each dosing regimen, for a&#xD;
      total of 12 subjects. At time=0, subjects will undergo baseline serum cefixime levels,&#xD;
      followed by ingestion of cefixime. Serum collections will occur at times 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12,&#xD;
      16, 20, and 24 hours. Cohort B will have the same serum collection time points as Cohort A.&#xD;
      Cohorts A &amp; B will be run nearly simultaneously as logistically feasible. Stage 2 (Cohorts C&#xD;
      and D): After determining the PK parameters of single dose 800mg, the PK simulation model&#xD;
      will be repeated, adjusting the model as needed based on findings from study Stage 1.&#xD;
      Assuming there are no major discrepancies between Figure 2 (above) and the new PK&#xD;
      simulations, the following regimens will be tested, beginning with Cohort C. Six subjects per&#xD;
      dosing regimen, Cohorts C and D, will be admitted to the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical&#xD;
      Center, for a total of 12 subjects. The 800mg q12 hour x 2 regimen (Cohort C) will be tested&#xD;
      first. For Cohort C, serum cefixime levels will be drawn at 12, 16, and 26 hours. If the q12&#xD;
      regimen is deemed safe and tolerable after review by the SMC, Cohort D will commence with the&#xD;
      800mg q8 hour x 3 regimen. Total serum cefixime levels will be drawn for Cohort D at 8, 16,&#xD;
      20 and 26 hours (see Section 7.2). All Stages, All Cohorts: All samples collected for PK&#xD;
      analysis will be shipped to the University of Toledo, Dr. Jeffrey Blumer's HPLC lab for&#xD;
      processing. Specimens will be analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for&#xD;
      total cefixime concentration levels. Targeted clinical evaluations will be used to monitor&#xD;
      for subject reported side effects. Subjects will be asked about specific symptoms they may&#xD;
      have experienced, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, flatulence, headache,&#xD;
      and rash, or any other symptoms. Additionally, subjects will be asked to maintain a Subject&#xD;
      Diary (Appendix E) from Study Day 0 through Day 7 to record information about any symptoms&#xD;
      experienced or medications taken. Study duration is approximately 47 weeks.&#xD;
