      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding the combination of abiraterone&#xD;
      acetate and prednisone with or without enzalutamide to hormonal therapy can help to control&#xD;
      prostate cancer when given before surgery. The safety of the drug combination will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      (like the roll of dice) to 1 of 2 groups. You will have a 2 out of 3 chance of being assigned&#xD;
      to Group A and a 1 out of 3 chance of being assigned to Group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group A, you will receive hormonal therapy (LHRH), abiraterone acetate,&#xD;
      prednisone, and enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group B, you will receive LHRH, abiraterone acetate, and prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor will decide what hormone therapy you will receive, will explain when and how&#xD;
      you should take it, and explain any risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, you will take 4 abiraterone acetate tablets by mouth each day (all at the same&#xD;
      time) at least 1 hour before a meal or 2 hours after a meal. You will also take 1 tablet of&#xD;
      prednisone by mouth 1 time each day to help lower the risk of side effects caused by&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group A, you will also take 4 capsules of enzalutamide by mouth each day. You&#xD;
      should take enzalutamide at about the same time every morning. Enzalutamide can be taken with&#xD;
      or without food. If you miss a dose, you should NOT take another dose until the next day. You&#xD;
      should tell the study doctor as soon as possible if you miss a dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About every 28-days is called a cycle. You should return all unused study drug and/or empty&#xD;
      pill bottles at the end of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your&#xD;
           prostatic specific antigen (PSA) level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 15 of Cycles 1, 2 and 3, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check your liver&#xD;
      function. These tests may be done at your local doctor's office and the results faxed to MD&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This blood will also be&#xD;
           used to check your PSA level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The testing on Cycles 2, 4 and 6 may be done at your local doctor's office and the results&#xD;
      faxed to MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 14 days before surgery and at your End of Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This blood&#xD;
           will also be used to check your PSA level, your blood sugar levels, and blood-clotting&#xD;
           function. You will be asked to fast for at least 8 hours before these blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a chest x-ray or a CT scan of the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 cycles of study treatment, you will have surgery to remove your prostate. You will be&#xD;
      asked to sign a separate consent form for this surgery, and the risks will be discussed with&#xD;
      you. Your leftover prostate gland tissue from surgery will be collected and used for&#xD;
      biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 4 to 8 weeks after your surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) drawn for routine tests. This blood will also be used to&#xD;
           check your PSA, testosterone, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive the study drugs for about 6 months. You will be taken off study early if the&#xD;
      disease gets worse, if you have intolerable side effects, or if your study doctor thinks it&#xD;
      is in your best interest to stop, or of you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the visits after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Abiraterone acetate is FDA approved in combination with&#xD;
      prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
      who have received prior chemotherapy containing docetaxel. Prednisone is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available as a corticosteroid. Enzalutamide is FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available for the treatment of certain types of prostate cancer. Their combination with&#xD;
      hormone therapy in patients with prostate cancer is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 69 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
