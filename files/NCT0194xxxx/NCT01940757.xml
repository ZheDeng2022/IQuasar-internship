  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An experimental hookworm infection model is being developed to provide early proof-of-concept&#xD;
      that a hookworm vaccine targeting the blood-feeding pathway of adult hookworms is feasible&#xD;
      and efficacious. The proposed model consists of vaccinating healthy, hookworm-na誰ve adults&#xD;
      with a candidate hookworm vaccine, followed by challenging them with the investigational&#xD;
      product, Necator americanus Larval Inoculum to assess the effect of vaccination on infection.&#xD;
      The first proposed study will be a feasibility study that will consist of administering&#xD;
      different doses of the Necator americanus Larval Inoculum to healthy adult volunteers to&#xD;
      determine the optimal dose (i.e., number of infectious larvae) that is safe, well-tolerated&#xD;
      and results in consistent infection.&#xD;

      Open-label, dose-escalation clinical study in healthy, hookworm-na誰ve adults:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study site: George Washington Medical Faculty Associates, Washington, DC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of participants: up to 30 in 3 cohorts of 10 volunteers each&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort 1, ten (10) volunteers will receive an inoculum of 25 infectious Necator americanus&#xD;
      larvae. In Cohort 2, ten (10) volunteers will receive an inoculum of 50 infectious Necator&#xD;
      americanus larvae. In the optional Cohort 3, ten (10) volunteers will receive an inoculum of&#xD;
      75 infectious Necator americanus larvae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohorts will be enrolled in a staggered fashion with safety data assessed prior to larval&#xD;
      dose escalation. Cohort 2 will be inoculated no earlier than 8 weeks after the last volunteer&#xD;
      is inoculated in Cohort 1. The optional Cohort 3 will be inoculated no sooner than 8 weeks&#xD;
      after the last volunteer is inoculated in Cohort 2. Cohort 3 will be enrolled only if the&#xD;
      tolerability of the experimental infection of Cohort 2 is acceptable and does not result in&#xD;
      significant adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each cohort, after Study Day 70, but before Study Day 77, up to 5 volunteers will&#xD;
      undergo capsule endoscopy in order to visualize and count adult N. americanus hookworms&#xD;
      residing in the intestine. Informed consent for capsule endoscopy will be obtained separately&#xD;
      from the primary study, and agreement or refusal will not impact on a subject's eligibility&#xD;
      to enroll or continue participation in the primary study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three months after larval administration, or at the time of study withdrawal, all&#xD;
      participants will receive a 3-dose treatment of albendazole (400 mg per dose) for clearance&#xD;
      of experimental infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Larval inoculum schedule: Study Day 0 (single application)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Route: applied to intact skin on the volar aspect of forearm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doses of N. americanus Larval Inoculum to be tested: 25, 50 and 75 infectious larvae&#xD;
           (high dose optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study duration: 6 months per study participant; total duration of the study estimated at&#xD;
           approximately 13 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthelmintic treatment: 3 months post larval inoculum, or at study withdrawal, 3-dose&#xD;
           treatment with 400 mg albendazole&#xD;
