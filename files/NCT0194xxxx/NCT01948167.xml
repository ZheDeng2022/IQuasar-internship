      Investigators will innovatively combine risk factor research and evidence-based prevention&#xD;
      programs, to advance knowledge on personalized approaches to prevention that may be able to&#xD;
      better &quot;bend trajectories&quot; of depression that surge throughout adolescence. A randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial will examine the benefits of matching youth to two depression prevention&#xD;
      programs of Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training (IPT-AST) and Coping with&#xD;
      Stress (CWS) for the prevention of depression in adolescents. These two programs are designed&#xD;
      to address distinct risk factors for depression - CWS addresses cognitive risks and IPT-AST&#xD;
      addresses interpersonal risks. A total of 210 participants across two sites, University of&#xD;
      Denver and Rutgers University, will be stratified on cognitive and interpersonal risk and&#xD;
      randomized to the two conditions. The goals of the study are to (1) demonstrate that&#xD;
      prevention programs can modify depression trajectories among youth by examining within person&#xD;
      changes in trajectories over time (three years before and three years after the prevention&#xD;
      programs) and by comparing trajectories of prevention youth with changes in same aged&#xD;
      cohorts; (2) evaluate a personalized prevention approach to bending depression trajectories&#xD;
      by matching and mismatching youth to either CWS or IPT-AST based on individual risk profiles;&#xD;
      (3) examine mechanisms of bending depression trajectories and test whether the prevention&#xD;
      programs operate via their hypothesized processes; and (4) explore how genetic&#xD;
      susceptibility, emotion regulation, and temperament may affect individual response to IPT-AST&#xD;
      and CWS. By implementing evidence-based prevention programs after 3-years of prospective&#xD;
      naturalistic data collection, this study will contribute essential data on personalized&#xD;
      medicine and altering developmental trajectories of first-onset depression.&#xD;
