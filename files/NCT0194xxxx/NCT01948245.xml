    <textblock>
      The purpose of the investigation is to compare two catheter lock solutions (TaurolockTMHep100&#xD;
      and Heparin 100 IE/ml), on the occurence of catheter related blood stream infection, in&#xD;
      patients with intestinal failure and a central venous access device for home parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with long-term intestinal failure are dependent on Home Parenteral Nutrition(HPN)&#xD;
      delivered through a central venous access device(CVAD), placed as a subcutaneous tunneled&#xD;
      catheter(Broviac). Catheter Related Blood Stream Infections(CRBSI) is a frequent complication&#xD;
      leading to increased morbidity, hospital admissions, cost, and risk of repeated replacement&#xD;
      of their tunneled catheter. The infections often originate from contamination of the catheter&#xD;
      hub, and growth of microorganisms on the inner lumen of the catheter imbedded in a biofilm.&#xD;
      To prevent infections good hygiene guidelines and the use of a catheter lock solution is&#xD;
      applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare two catheter lock solutions, TaurolockTMHep100 and&#xD;
      Heparin 100 IE/ml, on the occurence of CRBSI. The secondary objectives are to compare the two&#xD;
      devices according to other efficacy parameters, time to infection, cost and resource utility,&#xD;
      tolerability and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a prior high risk of CRBSI will be included. Patients will instill the solution&#xD;
      in their CVAD after each infusion of HPN, varying between minimum twice per week to once&#xD;
      daily, depending on their individual HPN programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the blinded randomization the patients will be paired according to gender, age and&#xD;
      prior infection risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the instillation will be 24 month or until outcome(CRBSI) accure.&#xD;
