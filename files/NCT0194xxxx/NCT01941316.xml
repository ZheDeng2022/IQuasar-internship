      The purpose of this study is to determine a well-tolerated dose of Carfilzomib in combination&#xD;
      with Irinotecan (Phase 1b portion of the study) in subjects with relapsed small and non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer or other irinotecan-sensitive cancers and to assess the 6 month survival of&#xD;
      relapsed small cell lung cancer patients treated with this combination therapy. **The Phase&#xD;
      1b portion of the study is now complete**.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 portion of the study. The safest, maximally tolerated dose established as established&#xD;
      in Phase 1 for Phase 2 is as follows -- Carfilzomib will be provided at 20/36 mg/m2 with&#xD;
      Irinotecan dosed at 125 mg/m2. The purpose of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to assess 6&#xD;
      month survival of relapsed small cell lung cancer ins subjects treated with this combination&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small cell lung cancer accounts for approximately 15% of all lung cancer diagnoses in the&#xD;
      United States (US), with 60-80% response rates to platinum-based chemotherapy in extensive&#xD;
      disease. Despite its sensitivity to chemotherapy, small cell lung cancer is characterized by&#xD;
      its tendency to spread to other locations in the body such as the bloodstream and other&#xD;
      organs such as the liver. Currently, the only FDA-approved second-line therapies are oral and&#xD;
      parenteral topotecan, although irinotecan is also commonly used in primary and relapsed&#xD;
      disease. Novel combination therapies are desperately needed in this disease. in order to&#xD;
      improve survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carfilzomib (also known as Kyprolis) is an anti-cancer drug classified as a selective&#xD;
      proteasome inhibitor. Proteasome inhibition affects the levels of numerous cell cycle control&#xD;
      proteins, apoptosis (i.e., cell death), cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and chemoresistance&#xD;
      proteins. Chemically, it is a tetrapeptide epoxyketone, similar to epoxomicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carfilzomib and other proteasome inhibitors interrupt cellular pathways integral to the&#xD;
      survival of small cell lung cancer, namely the apoptic pathway involving activated nuclear&#xD;
      factor-kB (or NF-kB). NF-kB activates the transcription of anti-apoptotic and proliferation&#xD;
      genes, mediating tumor cell survival in response to cytotoxic stress thus resulting in&#xD;
      chemoresistance, a common problem in small cell lung cancer. Carfilzomib prevents the&#xD;
      breakdown of IkB, a protein which inhibits NF-kB, controls levels of the anti-apoptotic gene&#xD;
      Bcl-2 and the tumor suppressor p53. Overexpression of Bcl-2, a key mediator of resistance to&#xD;
      apoptosis following chemotherapy, which is an important problem in small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, Carfilzomib is combined with Irinotecan. Irinotecan, a camptothecins, inhibits&#xD;
      topoisomerase I, thought to be important in the growth and spread of cancer. As a class,&#xD;
      camptothecins have shown efficacy in small cell lung cancer in a variety of settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topoisomerase-1 is thought to cause apoptosis via mechanisms other than NF-kB, adding to the&#xD;
      potential synergy of these compounds. In addition, topoisomerase-1 is overexpressed in the&#xD;
      majority of subjects with SCLC and decreased degradation of this enzyme is expected to lead&#xD;
      to further enhancement of this mechanism of apoptosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pivotal phase III study which led to FDA approval of topotecan in relapsed small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer was by Von Pawel et al, and included 211 subjects with sensitive (&gt; 60 days since&#xD;
      prior therapy) relapse and randomized them to either topotecan (107 subjects) daily for 5&#xD;
      days or to cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine (CAV), each given every 21 days.&#xD;
      Topotecan showed no significant improvement in the median time to progression (13.3 weeks&#xD;
      vs.12.3 weeks, p=0.552) or median survival (25 weeks vs. 24.7 weeks, p=0.795), however,&#xD;
      subjects treated with topotecan had improvement in cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea,&#xD;
      hoarseness, anorexia, and fatigue) as well as hematologic toxicity. Irinotecan, has&#xD;
      established activity in small cell lung cancer, as well as non-small cell lung cancer,&#xD;
      colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this Phase 2 study patients will be treated with the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      Carfilzomib 25/30 mg/m2 as stepped up dosing determined in Phase 1b and 125mg/m2 of&#xD;
      Irinotecan.&#xD;
