    <textblock>
      Rationale: Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is an inflammatory back pain disorder affecting up&#xD;
      to 24% of young chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients. For general practitioners (GPs) it is&#xD;
      difficult to distinguish axSpA patients in the large amount of CLBP patients. In previous&#xD;
      studies a referral rule for axSpA applicable in CLBP patients was developed and validated.&#xD;
      The next step is to investigate the impact of the referral rule in daily practice. This&#xD;
      impact analysis will test if the referral rule will be beneficial or harmful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the clinical impact of a referral rule in young patients presenting at&#xD;
      the general practitioners with chronic low back pain, who are at risk for axSpA, compared to&#xD;
      usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A cluster randomized clinical trial. Study population: Primary care patients&#xD;
      with chronic low back pain, aged 18-45 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): GPs are randomized in clusters either to use directly the&#xD;
      referral rule or use the referral rule after 4 months. The referral rule consists out of four&#xD;
      variables, a positive ASAS inflammatory back pain questionnaire, a positive family history&#xD;
      for spondyloarthritis, a good reaction to NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and&#xD;
      back pain duration longer than 5 years. If at least two out of four variables are present a&#xD;
      referral to the rheumatologist is advised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is a change in the Roland Morris&#xD;
      Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) compared to baseline in the CLBP patients with or without use&#xD;
      of the referral model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary parameters: Quality of life measurements, cost-effectiveness, pain and fatigue and&#xD;
      referral to rheumatologist and diagnosis of axSpA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The burden and risks associated with participation are minimal. No medical intervention is&#xD;
      taken place. If the GP of the patients is randomized to the referral model, the patient is&#xD;
      checked for the risk of axial spondyloarthritis, by the non-invasive referral model. If the&#xD;
      referral model is positive a referral to the rheumatologist is advised. Is the GP is&#xD;
      randomized to the 'usual care' there is no difference in the treatment of low back pain than&#xD;
      nowadays. A GP is still allowed to treat the CLBP patients optimal and a referral to the&#xD;
      rheumatologist is allowed but not actively advised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participating CLBP patients are asked to fill several questionnaires at four different&#xD;
      time points, at baseline, after 12 months and after 24 months. In total there are 8&#xD;
      questionnaires and four separate questions. The questionnaire are designed to fill out by the&#xD;
      patient themselves. The total time to fill in the questionnaire is estimated to be 30&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the CLBP patients, up to 24% of the back pain complaints are caused by axSpA, but&#xD;
           the GPs are not (yet) aware of this disease. When a CLBP patient is participating in&#xD;
           this study, the chance of having axSpA as cause for the back pain is investigated. This&#xD;
           a benefit for a CLBP patients since there is effective treatment for axSpA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the GP it is very difficult to distinguish an axSpA patients in the large amount of&#xD;
           CLBP patients. If it appears that the validated referral rule has an impact on CLBP and&#xD;
           GPs, the next step will be implementation of this referral model in daily practice and&#xD;
           it will become a helpful tool for the GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the society, CLBP is a great socioeconomic burden for the society. When one of the&#xD;
           causes for CLBP, namely axSpA is diagnosed and treated in an earlier stage this will&#xD;
           lead to a decreased sick leave because of back pain and is therefore potentially&#xD;
           cost-effective.&#xD;
