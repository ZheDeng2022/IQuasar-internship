      It is recognized that gastroscopy can miss intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and early gastric&#xD;
      cancer. This could conceivably be due to the fact that these lesions may only present as&#xD;
      subtle mucosal changes on conventional white light endoscopy (WLE) and thus be easily missed.&#xD;
      In narrow band imaging (NBI) a rotating interference narrow band filter is interposed after&#xD;
      the xenon light source such that when the NBI mode is switched on, discrete blue and green&#xD;
      wavelengths are used and this improves mucosal surface contrast and facilitates visualization&#xD;
      of mucosal details. A new NBI system is available that allows brighter illumination. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that bright -NBI is superior to WLE in detecting focal gastric lesions such as&#xD;
      gastric intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and early gastric cancer in subjects undergoing&#xD;

      Background It is recognized that gastroscopy can miss intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and&#xD;
      early gastric cancer (EGC)[1-3]. This could conceivably be due to the fact that EGC, as well&#xD;
      as premalignant changes, may only present as subtle mucosal changes on conventional white&#xD;
      light endoscopy (WLE) and thus be easily missed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chromoendoscopy has been used routinely in some centers during upper gastrointestinal (UGI)&#xD;
      endoscopy in an attempt to improve mucosal contrast and detect subtle mucosal lesions[4].&#xD;
      However, this is not the norm in most centers due to the inconvenience of dye spray. Narrow&#xD;
      band imaging (NBI) facilitates the examination of the mucosal surface without a need for&#xD;
      chromoendoscopy. It is based on the principle that the depth of penetration of light is&#xD;
      wavelength dependent, with shorter wavelengths resulting in more superficial penetration i.e.&#xD;
      blue light penetrates most superficially (mucosal imaging) while red light penetrates the&#xD;
      deepest (submucosal imaging). In NBI a rotating interference narrow band filter is interposed&#xD;
      after the xenon light source such that when the NBI mode is switched on, discrete blue and&#xD;
      green wavelengths are used and this improves mucosal surface contrast and facilitates&#xD;
      visualization of mucosal details[5]. Magnifying endoscopy (ME) is useful in assessing the&#xD;
      gastric mucosal pit pattern and microvessel of gastric mucosal lesions, thus providing the&#xD;
      possibility of predicting the histological nature of the mucosal lesion. Studies from Japan,&#xD;
      a country with a high population risk for gastric cancer, which were based on preselected&#xD;
      high risk patients or patients with known precancerous lesions or EGC, showed that NBI and&#xD;
      NBI-ME could diagnose precancerous lesions such as intestinal metaplasia (IM)[6] as well as&#xD;
      EGC[7-11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is a lack of published data on the clinical utility of NBI in the detection of&#xD;
      gastric intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and EGC in the unselected general population. A&#xD;
      recent study from Singapore looked at the utility of NBI and NBI-ME in patients aged 35 to 70&#xD;
      years undergoing diagnostic UGI endoscopy and found that the detection rate of focal lesions&#xD;
      was increased from 43.7% to 58.8% with NBI, compared to WLE. Among the additional lesions&#xD;
      detected, NBI-ME identified 97.1% as IM, 1.4% as EGC and 1.4% as benign. The EGC was a&#xD;
      synchronous cancer missed by WLE but detected by NBI[12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current NBI system is limited by the dark endoscopic view. This has the potential&#xD;
      limitation of making the detection of subtle lesions more difficult and lesions could be&#xD;
      missed. A new prototype NBI system has been designed that has a brighter appearance. This&#xD;
      prototype bright NBI coupled with high definition resolution is likely to overcome this&#xD;
      drawback of original NBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We hypothesize that bright -NBI is superior to WLE in detecting focal gastric&#xD;
      lesions such as gastric intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and EGC in subjects undergoing&#xD;
      diagnostic upper GI endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Setting and trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A randomized controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria: 1) Subjects aged &gt; 50 years undergoing diagnostic or screening upper&#xD;
           GI endoscopy; 2) ability to provide a written consent to trial participation. Exclusion&#xD;
           criteria: 1) presence of active gastrointestinal bleeding; 2) presence of coagulopathy&#xD;
           precluding biopsies; 3) absence of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The protocol will be approved by local Institutional Review Board. Trial subjects will&#xD;
           sign informed consent prior to UGI endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects are randomized to undergo UGI endoscopy in either WLE or bright light NBI&#xD;
           modes, using a high definition gastroscope (Olympus 190 or 290 series). An endoscopy&#xD;
           assistant will then open the next numbered sealed envelop at the instruction of the&#xD;
           endoscopist. For subjects randomized to WLE, the entire examination will be performed&#xD;
           using white light. For subjects randomized to NBI, the NBI mode will be switched on&#xD;
           before insertion into the stomach. Once the gastroscope is inserted into the duodenum,&#xD;
           the endoscopist can switch back to WLE to examine the duodenal mucosa. Before withdrawal&#xD;
           from the duodenum back into the stomach, the NBI mode will be switched on and gastric&#xD;
           mucosal examination carried out in the NBI mode. After the gastric examination findings&#xD;
           using NBI have been recorded, the endoscopist is allowed to re-examine the gastric&#xD;
           mucosa using white light, but any additional findings will not be recorded in the study&#xD;
           data sheet. During withdrawal into the esophagus, the endoscopist can switch back to WLE&#xD;
           to examine the esophageal mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recorded parameters include 1) presence or absence of focal lesions and the suspected&#xD;
           diagnosis such as a) IM; b) cancer; c) early cancer; d) gastric ulcer or erosion; e)&#xD;
           other focal lesions. Switching from WLE to NBI and vice versa is allowed at the&#xD;
           discretion of endoscopist after detection of a lesion. Endoscopists may elect to remove&#xD;
           these lesions using WLE. Magnification is allowed in either group. IM is diagnosed on&#xD;
           white light endoscopy based on by whitish color change with plaques, patches, or&#xD;
           homogeneous discoloration on the gastric mucosa[13].High definition white light&#xD;
           endoscopy may possibly visualize the villous pattern. IM is diagnosed on NBI based on&#xD;
           the criteria such as light blue crest and villous morphology[14, 15]. Early cancer may&#xD;
           present on white light endoscopy with varied non-specific features such as a subtle&#xD;
           polypoid protrusion, a superficial plaque, ulcer, depression, or even a mucosal&#xD;
           discoloration. However distortions of the mucosal pit pattern and microvascular pattern&#xD;
           on NBI have been found to be characteristic[6].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Lesion size is measured by a comparison to known diameter of open forceps and grouped&#xD;
           into size categories. The decision to perform hot/ cold biopsies or snaring is left to&#xD;
           the endoscopist. Each lesion is retrieved separately for pathologic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recognizing that the incidence rate of cancer may be low from the study populations[16],&#xD;
           the decision was made to use as a surrogate intestinal metaplasia, a known premalignant&#xD;
           lesion, as the main outcome variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Methods of randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Randomization sequence will be generated using a computer program in blocks of 20&#xD;
                of equal assignment pertaining to individual endoscopists who participate in the&#xD;
                trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Primary outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Detection rate of IM&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Secondary outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Detection rate of gastric cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Aggregate detection rate of focal gastric lesions The diagnostic performance&#xD;
                     of the imaging modality will form ancillary analyses. Histology will be the&#xD;
                     gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the UGI endoscopy study that compared NBI with WLE in the general population, it was&#xD;
           found that most focal lesions were due to IM and that after age 50 years, the prevalence&#xD;
           rate of IM was 36%[12]. In this study, WLE detected IM in 4.4% of cases, whereas NBI&#xD;
           detected IM in 16.2% of cases. We arbitrarily assumed that HD WLE increase the detection&#xD;
           rate of IM to 10%, while keeping the IM det4ection rate by NBI to 16.2%. We determine&#xD;
           our sample size to detect a 6.2% difference with a power of 80% and a two sided type 1&#xD;
           error of 0.05. A total of 464 patients will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Timetable of work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will continue until the intended subject size of 464 subjects is reached. .&#xD;
