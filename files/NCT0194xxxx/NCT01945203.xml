  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in patients with end-stage&#xD;
      renal disease (ESRD), which means that it is important to find out risk factors of CVD in&#xD;
      order to prevent or treat it. In recent years, there has been more and more recognition of a&#xD;
      very high prevalence of CV calcification in the ESRD population. Many observational cohort&#xD;
      studies have shown that CV calcification in these patients can predict mortality, CV&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity. Electrolyte imbalance is easily found in the ESRD patients which may&#xD;
      result in vessel calcification. Calcification leads to arterial stenosis and increasing&#xD;
      arterial stiffness and then heart afterload, both contribute to the development of CVD.&#xD;
      Besides, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia pave the way for a chronic,&#xD;
      immune-mediated vascular inflammation and cardiovascular disease. These factors are prevalent&#xD;
      in ESRD patients, which would also cause arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness and stenosis&#xD;
      would increase the risk of CV events and mortality. Aortic pulse wave velocity is strongly&#xD;
      associated with the presence and extent of atherosclerosis and constitutes a forceful marker&#xD;
      and predictor of cardiovascular risk. At the same time, high prevalence of peripheral artery&#xD;
      occlusion disease (PAOD) should also be found while arterial stiffness and stenosis, which&#xD;
      would increase the condition of infection and gangrene. Thus, life safety and quality would&#xD;
      be influenced severely and early detection might prevent future amputation. As compared with&#xD;
      HD or pre-dialysis patients, uremic patients treated with PD have a higher risk for metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. Therefore, more studies to evaluate the condition of arterial stiffness and PAOD,&#xD;
      especially in PD patients, are needed for future management and preventions of CV related&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
