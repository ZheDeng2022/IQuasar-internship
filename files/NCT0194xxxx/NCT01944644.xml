  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled phase II study of the effects of Low&#xD;
      Field Magnetic Stimulation (LFMS) on brain circuitry of adults with treatment-resistant Major&#xD;
      Depressive Disorder (MDD). Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to double-blind&#xD;
      treatment with three 20 minute sessions of either (1) active LFMS or (2) sham LFMS. Resting&#xD;
      state fMRI will be performed at baseline and following the third and final treatment session.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A minimum of 60 subjects will enter the double-blind treatment phase of the study. This trial&#xD;
      will be conducted according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines and the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients before&#xD;
      protocol-specified procedures are carried out. The subjects will be drawn from an outpatient&#xD;
      sample of patients with current Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) diagnosed with the use of the&#xD;
      Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LFMS will follow a previously published protocol for the treatment of a Major Depressive&#xD;
      Episode (Rohan et al. 2004). LFMS treatments will be delivered with a prototype LFMS device&#xD;
      manufactured by Tal Medical. LFMS sessions consist of proton echo-planar magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopic imaging (EP-MRSI) and will be 20min in duration. LFMS exposes subjects to&#xD;
      magnetic fields of the same magnitude and frequency used in clinical MR-Spectroscopic imaging&#xD;
      of the brain. Sham LFMS will consist of a three-dimensional spoiled gradient echo sequence of&#xD;
      the same duration as active LFMS and which provides auditory stimulation indistinguishable&#xD;
      from active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of a treatment session, the subject will sit in front of and position his&#xD;
      head within the open bore of the Tal Medical LFMS device. The device will be pre-programmed&#xD;
      to deliver active or sham treatment so that the subject, operator, and all investigators are&#xD;
      blinded to active treatment vs. sham. Immediately before and after each treatment session,&#xD;
      the PANAS, Ham-D-6, and Visual Analog Mood Scale will be administered and the patient will be&#xD;
      monitored for any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo two sessions of neuroimaging: On the Friday prior to the first&#xD;
      treatment session (Day 0) and on the day of the third and final treatment session (Day 7).&#xD;
      Each session of neuroimaging will be 50 minutes in duration and include three imaging&#xD;
      modalities: Resting State fMRI (rsfMRI), Arterial Spin Labeling MRI (ASL), and Diffusion&#xD;
      Tensor Imaging (DTI). In addition, we will obtain high-resolution anatomical volumes (SPGR)&#xD;
      for each subject for the purpose of transforming each individual's imaging data into a common&#xD;
      space for group comparisons. Subjects will lie still in the scanner and will be instructed to&#xD;
      let their mind &quot;wander freely&quot; during the acquisition of the resting state fMRI scan, which&#xD;
      will last 6 minutes (Anon 2001). They will also be instructed to lie still during the ASL and&#xD;
      DTI scans (each lasting 8 minutes). In addition, we will obtain a high-resolution T1-weighted&#xD;
      (MP-RAGE) anatomical scan for co-registration of each individual's imaging data into a common&#xD;
      space for group statistics..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting state fMRI will be used to measure the functional connectivity within the default&#xD;
      mode network (DMN) and other circuits that are known to function abnormally in MDD (Greicius&#xD;
      et al. 2007). ASL will be used to measure the regional blood flow within individual nodes of&#xD;
      this circuitry, while DTI will measure the structural integrity of the connections between&#xD;
      nodes. Measurements at baseline will be compared to measurements post-LFMS in both active&#xD;
      treatment and sham groups.&#xD;

    <time_frame>7 days after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is to compare the 6 Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale from the Screen to after 3 Sessions of Active or Sham LFMS (7 days post-baseline). The Hamilton Scale for Depression 6 item subscale scores range from 0-24. Higher scores indicate greater severity of depression. Total scores are reported with no subscales.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A Visual Analog Scale is a measurement of subjective characteristics that cannot be directly measured. Using this self questionnaire, subjects specify their level of depression along a continuous line between two end-points ranging from 0-100 (higher score means better mood).</description>

    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Score (PANAS) - Negative Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) measures both positive affect and negative affect. Participants in the PANAS are required to respond to two 20-item subscales using 5-point scale that ranges from very slightly or not at all (1) to extremely (5). This negative subscale captures self-rated scale of symptoms of depression ranging from 0-50 (higher score means worse depression).</description>

        <title>Positive and Negative Affect Score (PANAS) - Negative Subscale</title>
        <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) measures both positive affect and negative affect. Participants in the PANAS are required to respond to two 20-item subscales using 5-point scale that ranges from very slightly or not at all (1) to extremely (5). This negative subscale captures self-rated scale of symptoms of depression ranging from 0-50 (higher score means worse depression).</description>

Active Low Field Magnetic Stimulation treatments will be delivered with a prototype LFMS device manufactured by Tal Medical. LFMS sessions consist of proton echo-planar magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (EP-MRSI) and will be 20min in duration. LFMS exposes subjects to magnetic fields of the same magnitude and frequency used in clinical MR-Spectroscopic imaging of the brain.&#xD;
