  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) is characterized by affective instability and&#xD;
      irritability, diagnosed in 5% of reproductive-age women. Although causing severe insult to&#xD;
      patients' functioning and quality of life, ~40% do not respond to conventional treatment&#xD;
      options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to examine a novel therapeutic approach for the&#xD;
      treatment of affective instability in PMDD: brain-guided training (i.e.NeuroFeedBack, NF)&#xD;
      probed by prefrontal EEG alpha asymmetry. PMDD patients will be randomly assigned to either a&#xD;
      real or sham EEG-NF protocol, and undergo simultaneous fMRI-EEG scans before and after&#xD;
      training period. Comprehensive psychological assessment will be performed for outcome&#xD;
      measure. The investigators hypothesize that EEG-NF treatment will enhance affective&#xD;
      stability, thus improving patients' daily lives.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological and clinical studies consistently show that approximately 2-8% of all&#xD;
      premenopausal women suffer from premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) - a serious pattern of&#xD;
      distressing symptoms beginning at the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and terminating&#xD;
      shortly after the onset of menses. The most common psychological symptoms reported by women&#xD;
      with PMDD are mood lability and irritability, and to a lesser extent a depressed mood or&#xD;
      diminished interest and pleasure. In contrast to the milder premenstrual syndrome (PMS), PMDD&#xD;
      is a severe mental disorder which can in some cases even trigger suicidal thoughts and&#xD;
      attempts. Sadly, many women do not respond to currently available pharmacological treatments,&#xD;
      while others suffer from their side effects throughout the month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study aims to examine the clinical effectiveness of a novel therapeutic approach&#xD;
      for treating emotional instability in PMDD. The investigators plan to use a clinical model of&#xD;
      weekly brain-guided training (i.e. NeuroFeedBack, NF) to gain better self control of affect&#xD;
      and its regulation. Feedback will be based on modulating pre-frontal EEG Alpha waves, a&#xD;
      technique shown in prior studies to have a therapeutic effect in affective symptoms; however&#xD;
      the brain circuitry which underlies such effects is largely unknown. By using simultaneous&#xD;
      fMRI and EEG the investigators intend to unveil the neural correlates of response to such&#xD;
      treatment and to provide new markers for clinical trajectory in PMDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospectively diagnosed PMDD women will be randomly assigned to either a real or sham EEG-NF&#xD;
      protocol. During the training, patients will be instructed to &quot;Think Positively&quot; in order to&#xD;
      actively manipulate brain areas that are related to positive experiences, while viewing a&#xD;
      stream of various faces with different expressions. Following each facial image, feedback&#xD;
      based on the alpha asymmetry score will be given to the patient regarding their ability to&#xD;
      generate positive thoughts during the stream of faces. However, only the women within study&#xD;
      group will receive accurate feedback. To obtain a neural and hormonal profile, patients will&#xD;
      undergo simultaneous EEG-fMRI testing before and after training, and blood samples of hormone&#xD;
      levels will be gathered. Comprehensive psychiatric and psychological assessment will be&#xD;
      performed as an outcome measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the NF protocol will enhance affective stability, thus&#xD;
      improving daily functioning and quality of life among PMDD patients, without the need for&#xD;
      pharmacological agents, intrusive techniques or time consuming interventions. Moreover, this&#xD;
      treatment method is individually tailored to the needs and symptoms of the patient and can be&#xD;
      used periodically rather than continuously. The patient remains in control throughout the&#xD;
      procedure, and can potentially learn to use this technique on a continuous basis, beyond the&#xD;
      scope of the clinical trial.&#xD;
