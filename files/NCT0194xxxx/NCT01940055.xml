      Goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of a Treadmill Rehabilitation Platform (TRP) for task-orientated&#xD;
      rehabilitation that provides an adapted, blended approach among older adults with balance,&#xD;
      mobility, and cognitive impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examine the feasibility and benefits of a novel dual-task intervention to address mobility&#xD;
      and cognitive decline with age using engaging interactive video games during treadmill&#xD;
      walking and recumbent cycling.This will include evaluation of the effects of two&#xD;
      interventions, one using treadmill walking and the second a recumbent cycle ergometer on&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Core balance&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cardiac fitness, exercise endurance&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Gaze control&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Gait performance measure (walking stability and spatial-temporal gait parameters)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Specific executive cognitive function (processing speed, cognitive inhibition, working&#xD;
           memory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Dual task function during treadmill walking&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dual-task exercise program will improve core balance and walking function to a greater&#xD;
           extent in the Treadmill walking group compared to recumbent cycle group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Executive function will improve equally in both the treadmill walking and recumbent&#xD;
           cycle group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dual task exercise programs will have significant effect on gaze stability and cardiac&#xD;
           fitness equally for both the treadmill and recumbent cycling groups.&#xD;

      Study design: A phase II, Pilot-Randomized clinical trial. Sample size will be 15 volunteer&#xD;
      older adults for each group, aged between 70-80 years old living in the community and&#xD;
      attending the Reh-Fit center for exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals attending the Reh-Fit center for exercise and physical activity. This will be&#xD;
      coordinated and organized by staff at Reh-Fit center who will inform their members about this&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will receive a 45 minute program of combined exercise and cognitive&#xD;
      activities twice a week for 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group will receive the dual-task treadmill walking program (DT-TW) and the 2nd group will&#xD;
      receive the dual-task recumbent cycling program (DT-RC). Both programs will contain the same&#xD;
      cognitive activities delivered through interactive &quot;cognitive&quot; video games.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual-task treadmill walking program (DT-TW):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 minute warm up and cool down at a speed equivalent to a comfortable walking speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 minutes of dual-task treadmill walking at 2-3 speed levels . Speed will be selected&#xD;
           NOT to exceed 60% of Max-HR, Heart rate (HR), blood. Heart rate, blood pressure and&#xD;
           Perceived exertion (Per the Borg 1-10 scale) will be measured at 5 minute intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual-task recumbent cycling program (DT-RC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 minute warm up and cool down at a per-determined speed and resistance where heart rate&#xD;
           wold not exceed 40 percent of age maximum ( 220 minus age)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 minutes of dual-task (treadmill walking group or recumbent cycle group) training,&#xD;
           while performing concurrent cognitive games with a few minutes of rest periods in&#xD;
           between as required. The intensity of cycling will be selected achieve 50- 60% of&#xD;
           Max-HR. Heart rate, blood pressure and Perceived exertion (Per the Borg 1-10 scale) will&#xD;
           be measured at 5 minute intervals&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participant five to eight computer games will be selected to play during walking or&#xD;
      cycling from a collection of over 60 purchased form Big Fish Games (www.bigfishgames.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A commercial motion mouse (Gyration Air Mouse, USA) was secured to a head band and used as&#xD;
      the computer input device to control on-screen cursor motion with head rotation (left-right).&#xD;
      This motion Mouse has inertial sensors used to derive angular position signals. With this&#xD;
      simple method, seamless and responsive hands-free interaction with most computer applications&#xD;
      is made possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computer games involve goal- directed cognitive activities which includes a mix of (a)&#xD;
      precision movements to interact with game targets, (b) the presence of distractors, (c)&#xD;
      search and matching tasks, and (d) working memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis and Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical data: Age, sex, fall history, Mini Mental score Examination (MMSE)&#xD;
      greater than 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Community Health Activities Model Program for Seniors questionnaire (CHAMPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac fitness measured by Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) Cycle Ergometer&#xD;
      Sub-maximal test (ACSM's Guidelines for Exercise Testing and . During the test, heart rate&#xD;
      (HR), blood pressure (BP), revolution per minute (RPM) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE)&#xD;
      were recorded at 5 minutes interval (Borg, 1982).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validated performance-based measures of balance; (i) Clinical Test of Sensory Integration of&#xD;
      Balance , (ii) Five-Time Sit-to-Stand Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Walking endurance will be measured using the 6-minute walk test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spatial and Temporal Gait Variables will be measured during treadmill walking at a fixed&#xD;
      speed of 0.9 meter per second. A treadmill instrumented with a Force Sensory Array(FSA)&#xD;
      pressure mat (Vista Medical, Ca) will be used for this purpose . Each participant will walk&#xD;
      for two minutes and the following variables (average and coefficient of variation of 60&#xD;
      consecutive steps); will be determined: stance duration, swing time, step time, step length&#xD;
      and step width.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual task walking performance: A custom computer application which works with the Gyration&#xD;
      motion mouse was developed for this purpose. The cognitive game task was similar to the&#xD;
      Useful Field of View test the (UFOV). The goal of the test game is to move a paddle (game&#xD;
      sprite) to catch falling bright circle objects (targets) moving vertically top to bottom, and&#xD;
      to avoid other shape (or colors) game objects (dis-tractors). The objects appear at user&#xD;
      defined fixed intervals (e.g. 2 seconds) and at random locations on the monitor. The game is&#xD;
      instrumented with an assessment module. This generates a logged game file recording (80 Hz)&#xD;
      the following signals associated with player performance with respect to game events: (i)&#xD;
      time index and coordinates of each game object and (ii) position coordinates of the game&#xD;
      paddle (slaved to head rotation). Features of the test game events provide a basis for&#xD;
      objective quantification of cognitive functions, which include. (i) game success rate&#xD;
      (percentage of target caught), (ii) average motor response time (time from appearance of the&#xD;
      target to start of the paddle movement), (iii) average movement execution time (iv) movement&#xD;
      efficiency. The cognitive game task is first performed in standing (single tasks) and then&#xD;
      during treadmill waking at 0.9 m/s (dual-task walking condition). The difference in spatial&#xD;
      -temporal gait variables during walk alone ( as describe above) and dual task walking&#xD;
      condition will be used to index dual-task performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gaze Stability Test: A custom computer application was developed for this purpose. This&#xD;
      consists of tracking a bright visual target moving horizontally left and right on a computer&#xD;
      display at fixed amplitude (80% of the monitor width) at a frequency of 0.4 Hz. A 70 m&#xD;
      monitor was used, positioned at eye-level, 100 cm away from the participant. This results in&#xD;
      head horizontal rotations of between 30 to 40 degrees, left and right of center. The test&#xD;
      procedure involves a closed loop tracking task (with respect to head). In this task two&#xD;
      cursors of different colors appear on the monitor. One is the target cursor and the 2nd&#xD;
      cursor is slaved to head rotation via the head mounted motion mouse. The task goal is to&#xD;
      overlap the two cursors during the cyclic left-to-right cursor motion. In this task foveation&#xD;
      is necessary to determine the amount of overlap (error) between the target cursor and the&#xD;
      head cursor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nero-psychological tests: We will use the Standardized Nero-psychological tests targeting&#xD;
      executive functions: This includes a test battery of three executive functions (Trial Making&#xD;
      Test A-B, verbal fluency, and visual Search.). Also, The National Institutes of Health (NIH)&#xD;
      toolbox cognitive tests, targeting executive functions that include dimensional change card&#xD;
      sort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Trial Making test (A &amp; B): It is a valid and reliable well-established test, which is a&#xD;
           valid measure to target speed of processing, response inhibition and task-switching.&#xD;
           This test is graded by time. It has been used widely in clinical evaluations for the&#xD;
           assessment of deficits in cognitive function. It is administered in two parts: 1) Trial&#xD;
           Making test form A, the subject is required to draw lines sequentially connecting&#xD;
           numbered circles arranged randomly on a page as quickly as possible; 2) Trial Making&#xD;
           test form B is a more demanding task as it requires the subject to connect circles&#xD;
           containing numbers and letters in an alternating sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Verbal fluency: It is a test of working memory and language in which participants have&#xD;
           to say as many words as possible from a category in a given time (usually 60 seconds).&#xD;
           The test includes both semantic and phonemic sections, and has been shown to be highly&#xD;
           reliable and valid among elderly population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Visual search test: It is a test of speed of processing, cognition inhibition and&#xD;
           attention in which the participants have to look for a target stimulus among dis-tractor&#xD;
           stimuli (usually 60 seconds). The test measures both reaction time and the number of&#xD;
           selected items. It has been shown to be reliable and valid measure among elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dimensional change card sort: It is a test of working memory and cognitive inhibition in&#xD;
           which the participants are asked to match sets of two test pictures that differ in color&#xD;
           to target pictures (usually 10 seconds). The test measures both reaction time and the&#xD;
           number of selected items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed by a blinded assessor prior to beginning the intervention and&#xD;
      within one week of completing the 10 week program. Pre and post intervention assessment will&#xD;
      be spread over two days, each lasting approximately 60 minutes with ample rest periods.&#xD;
      Performing the balance and treadmill walking assessments while performing concurrent&#xD;
      cognitive tasks may be difficult and participants may lose their balance. The treadmill is&#xD;
      equipped with safety side rails which are within easy reach, and participants will be fitted&#xD;
      with a safety harness secured above to a support system. Also during all tests, a Physical&#xD;
      Therapist will stand behind or beside the participants to provide assistance if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare and test the difference in baseline values of demographic data, walking&#xD;
      ability and the validated performance-based measures of balance between groups circuits&#xD;
      training with Mann-Whitney U test for ordinal scale outcomes and student's t-test for&#xD;
      independent groups assuming equal variances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixed model repeated measure (ANOVA) will be used to examine the within group and between&#xD;
      group effects on the dependent variables representing cardiac fitness, core balance, walking&#xD;
      stability and dual-task walking performance, , gaze stability, and executive cognitive&#xD;
      function parameters (Hypothesis 1); Executive function (Hypothesis 2); Gaze control and&#xD;
      cardiac fitness (Hypothesis 3).&#xD;
