      The purpose of this study is to study whether percutaneous chronic total occlusion (CTO)&#xD;
      revascularization, by the use of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), stenting,&#xD;
      guidewire, and catheter, improves a patient's quality of life and their left ventricular&#xD;
      function, reduces angina severity, and improves long-term survival.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to study whether percutaneous chronic total occlusion (CTO)&#xD;
      revascularization, by the use of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), stenting,&#xD;
      guidewire, and catheter, improves a patient's quality of life and their left ventricular&#xD;
      function, reduces angina severity, and improves long-term survival. The study will consist of&#xD;
      the two following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective patients This group will consist of consecutive patients that have already&#xD;
      undergone CTO PCI by the PHI CTO team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will be contacted by telephone for informed consent and will be asked how&#xD;
           they are feeling and if they have seen any doctors for their heart conditions. The&#xD;
           patient will also be asked if they are taking antiplatelet medicines as prescribed, and&#xD;
           if there have been any changes in on their medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If more than 12 months have passed since the procedure, the patients will be queried&#xD;
           regarding medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the patient cannot be contacted, then analysis of data will be limited to&#xD;
           de-identified data collected from the chart, procedure angiogram, and the procedure&#xD;
           report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective patients This group will consist of patients in which the CTO procedure will be&#xD;
      performed by the PHI CTO team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A clinical assessment will be performed before the stent procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A blood sample will be taken for routine blood chemistry and hematology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medications will be prescribed to prevent blood clots&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up will occur 6 and 12 months post-procedure&#xD;

        having evidence of myocardial ischemia who have had or are scheduled to have percutaneous&#xD;
        chronic total occlusion (CTO) revasulcarization by Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Subjects experiencing clinical symptoms considered suggestive of ischemic heart&#xD;
             disease (eg, chest pain or discomfort or symptoms considered by the investigator to&#xD;
             represent anginal equivalents) or having evidence of myocardial ischemia (eg, abnormal&#xD;
             functional study) attributed to the CTO target vessel and scheduled for clinically&#xD;
             indicated percutaneous CTO revascularization or are subjects with multi-vessel disease&#xD;
