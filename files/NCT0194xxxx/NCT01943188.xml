    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and best way to give stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy and T-cell infusion in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.&#xD;
      Giving total body irradiation before a T-cell infusion stops the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing or killing them. After treatment, stem cells are collected from&#xD;
      the patient's blood and stored. Chemotherapy is given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem&#xD;
      cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming&#xD;
      cells that were destroyed by the radiation therapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Conduct a safety and feasibility study of stereotactic radiotherapy with autologous T-cell&#xD;
      infusion for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the progression free survival at one year. II. Determine the overall survival at&#xD;
      one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEREOTACTIC BODY RADIATION THERAPY (SBRT): Patients undergo standard of care SBRT over 1-2&#xD;
      weeks according to tumor volume and location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LYMPHODEPLETION: Beginning 3 weeks later, patients receive cyclophosphamide orally (PO) twice&#xD;
      daily (BID) for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REINFUSION OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS (PBMC): Within 3-14 days of completing&#xD;
      lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide, patients undergo autologous PBMC infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 week, 4 weeks, and monthly&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The duration from SBRT treatment to documented disease progression or death, assessed at 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The level of PFS will be tabulated at each follow-up interval. The percentage of individuals free from disease progression will be computed with exact 95% confidence intervals. PFS will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier curves and medians with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

    <measure>Level of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The correlations of CTCs and changes in signaling as measured by nano-immunoassay (NIA) to clinical response will be assessed. NIA measurements for 20 protein isoforms will be analyzed. Measurements will be analyzed as continuous variables for each sample. The distribution of each isoform will be summarized with medians and interquartile ranges. Quantile plot and box-Cox models will be used to determine whether to transform the data prior to analysis. A protein isoform signature predictive of clinical response will be constructed using the Lasso R glmnet package.</description>
