  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lack of appetite and weight loss are a common side effect of ADHD therapy with amphetamines&#xD;
      such as methylphenidate. Lack of sufficient food intake has been shown to have negative&#xD;
      effects on weight and height as well as learning and memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no current treatment to prevent this loss of appetite except discontinuation or&#xD;
      reduction of the methylphenidate. Discontinuation or reduction of the drug can cause the&#xD;
      return of ADHD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of two doses of a drug,&#xD;
      cyproheptadine, vs placebo to find out if cyproheptadine prevents the appetite suppression&#xD;
      associated with methylphenidate.&#xD;
