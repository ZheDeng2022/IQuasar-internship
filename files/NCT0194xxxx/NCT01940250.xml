    <textblock>
      Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease caused by a number of&#xD;
      different viruses - a small proportion of children infected with a particular type of&#xD;
      enterovirus (EV71) develop neurological and systemic complications that may prove fatal. Very&#xD;
      large epidemics of EV71 related HFMD have occurred across Asia in recent years; in 2011, in&#xD;
      excess of 100,000 Vietnamese children were diagnosed with HFMD and 164 died.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In children with severe HFMD the particular part of the brain that regulates the heart, blood&#xD;
      circulation, and breathing responses can be affected. Management of this complication is very&#xD;
      difficult and we currently use an expensive drug (milrinone) that is hard to obtain and has&#xD;
      significant side effects, without having good evidence that it is effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesium sulphate (Mg) is a cheap, readily available drug that has been used in other&#xD;
      diseases with similar complications, and we have preliminary data from a small case series&#xD;
      that suggests it might be a good treatment for HFMD patients with signs indicating this type&#xD;
      of brain involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We think that early intervention with Mg, when signs of brain involvement are still&#xD;
      relatively mild, will control this problem better than waiting until it is well established&#xD;
      and giving milrinone as at present, and this in turn may prevent progression to severe&#xD;
      disease. The aims of the project are to evaluate the effects of Mg on hypertension, signs of&#xD;
      brain dysfunction, outcome (death or neurological sequelae), changes in a variety of blood&#xD;
      and urine components, and measures of cardiovascular function, in severe HFMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Children on&#xD;
      the pediatric intensive care unit with a clinical diagnosis of hand, foot and mouth disease&#xD;
      will be eligible for enrolment if the blood pressure exceeds the internationally recognized&#xD;
      threshold for Stage 1 hypertension, they exhibit at least one other sign of brain stem&#xD;
      dysfunction, and there is written informed consent by a parent or guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the randomization, patients will receive an initial loading dose followed by a&#xD;
      maintenance infusion, of either Mg or identical placebo for 72 hours; all staff involved in&#xD;
      patient care will remain unaware of the treatment allocation, but staff from another&#xD;
      department will monitor Mg blood levels to ensure safety and adequate dosing. A total of 190&#xD;
      patients (95 in each arm) will be recruited.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease caused by a variety of&#xD;
      enteroviruses. A small proportion of those infected with enterovirus 71 (EV71) develop&#xD;
      neurological and systemic complications that may prove fatal. Over the past 15 years EV71&#xD;
      related HFMD has caused increasing epidemics of HFMD across Asia; in 2011, in excess of&#xD;
      100,000 Vietnamese children were diagnosed clinically with HFMD and 164 died. The&#xD;
      neurological problem of most concern is brainstem encephalitis, causing autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system (ANS) dysregulation that may progress rapidly to cardiopulmonary failure. Management&#xD;
      of ANS dysregulation is difficult even in sophisticated western intensive care units. The&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, Milrinone, was reported to control hypertension and support&#xD;
      myocardial function in a small informal study of severe HFMD compared to historical controls,&#xD;
      but in practice treatment remains largely empirical. ANS dysregulation also occurs in severe&#xD;
      tetanus and there is a body of evidence indicating that intravenous magnesium sulphate (Mg)&#xD;
      is effective in controlling tetanus-associated cardiovascular instability. Mg is also used&#xD;
      widely for eclampsia, severe asthma and pulmonary hypertension, and there are reports of&#xD;
      rapid control of life-threatening autonomic hyperreflexia in patients with spinal lesions.&#xD;
      Formal safety data in children are limited, but adverse effects appear to be infrequent. In a&#xD;
      series of 24 severe EV71 confirmed HFMD cases managed recently at the Hospital for Tropical&#xD;
      Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Mg was added when hypertension remained poorly controlled despite&#xD;
      high-dose Milrinone. In all cases the blood pressure (BP) reduced within 30-60 minutes and&#xD;
      remained stable subsequently on a continuous Mg infusion for 48-72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that early intervention with Mg, when ANS dysregulation first becomes&#xD;
      apparent, will control cardiovascular instability and prevent progression to severe disease.&#xD;
      The main aims are as follows:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effects of Mg on hypertension and ANS dysregulation in severe HFMD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effects of Mg on outcome (death or neurological sequelae) in severe HFMD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate changes in plasma/urine catecholamine levels, cardiac output and systemic&#xD;
           vascular resistance (SRV) in severe HFMD, and to assess the impact of Mg on these&#xD;
           parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan a randomized double blind trial comparing intravenous Mg with placebo in children&#xD;
      admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with clinical HFMD, ANS dysregulation, and&#xD;
      Stage 1 hypertension. Patients will be eligible for enrolment if the arterial blood pressure&#xD;
      exceeds the 95th centile for age, gender and length/height for at least 30 minutes while the&#xD;
      child is not distressed, they exhibit at least one other criterion for ANS dysregulation, and&#xD;
      a parent/guardian gives written informed consent. Specific renal and cardio-respiratory&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A loading dose of 50mg/kg of either Mg or identical placebo will be given over 20 minutes&#xD;
      followed by a maintenance infusion for 72 hours according to response, aiming for Mg levels&#xD;
      2-3 times normal in the treatment arm. All staff involved in clinical care will be blind to&#xD;
      the treatment allocation, and Mg levels will be monitored and adjusted by independent doctors&#xD;
      from another clinical facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be a composite endpoint of disease progression defined as&#xD;
      occurrence of any of the following within 72 hours: specific blood pressure criteria&#xD;
      necessitating addition of milrinone, need for ventilation, development of shock, or death.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will include presence of neurological sequelae at discharge in survivors,&#xD;
      and various measures of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance, catecholamine and&#xD;
      cytokine levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on 1:1 randomization, an anticipated relative reduction of the risk of progression of&#xD;
      50% (from 50% in the control arm to 25% in Mg recipients, information from our case series&#xD;
      plus indirect evidence from studies on severe tetanus), 90% power and a two-sided 5%&#xD;
      significance level, 85 patients per treatment group are required. To allow for some&#xD;
      violations of our assumptions and losses to follow-up, we plan to recruit 190 patients (95&#xD;
      patients per treatment arm) into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the very large numbers of HFMD cases being seen in hospitals in Asia currently, if Mg&#xD;
      is shown to be effective in controlling ANS dysregulation and preventing severe HFMD&#xD;
      complications this would be of major importance for paediatric care throughout the Asian&#xD;
      region. Mg is cheap, readily available and safe whereas milrinone is expensive, has a&#xD;
      significant side effect profile and is often not available outside major centres.&#xD;

If the systolic BP increases to the levels detailed in the study protocol for treatment failure, action will be taken as indicated&#xD;
If the systolic BP decrease rapidly more than 25% over 15 minutes&#xD;
If the plasma Mg level &gt; 2.5 mmol/l or &lt; 1.8 mmol/l a 25% increase or decrease in the infusion rate will be implemented as appropriate.</description>
