  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung disease primarily caused by&#xD;
      smoking. COPD creates a tremendous burden to the healthcare system, as disease exacerbations&#xD;
      result in frequent, prolonged hospitalizations. While originally considered a disease&#xD;
      specific to the lung, data have shown that COPD is associated with substantial cardiovascular&#xD;
      (CV) morbidity and mortality. Exacerbations of COPD requiring hospitalization result in&#xD;
      marked patient deterioration, and heightened CV risk. The cause of the increased CV risk with&#xD;
      stable COPD, and the exaggerated CV risk during exacerbations of the disease are unknown;&#xD;
      however, it may be due to chronic inflammation which is exacerbated with a flare-up of the&#xD;
      disease, and/or chronic inactivity which is similarly worsened with bed-rest during a&#xD;
      hospitalization. Despite the impact of COPD on healthcare, there are relatively few studies&#xD;
      examining how COPD inpatient care impacts on patient outcomes, inflammation and CV risk.&#xD;
      Disease management programs, such as pulmonary rehabilitation and patient self-management&#xD;
      education, are part of guideline therapy for COPD; however, these are not regularly&#xD;
      implemented following a hospitalization, and how these interventions affect patient outcomes,&#xD;
      behavior, physical activity, inflammation and CV risk have not been well studied. The&#xD;
      proposed long-term project will examine how typical inpatient COPD care, and how early&#xD;
      referral to chronic disease management programs after hospital discharge, affect patient&#xD;
      outcomes. This grant brings together an outstanding group of researchers who have the&#xD;
      necessary clinical, content and methodological expertise to successfully complete this work.&#xD;
      These studies will provide invaluable information about inpatient and outpatient management&#xD;
      for a disease which has a tremendous impact on healthcare.&#xD;

      AIM 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To examine pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes in COPD patients from the time of&#xD;
      their acute hospital admission until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: AECOPD is associated with systemic inflammation, prolonged bed-rest and increased&#xD;
      CV risk. Proper medical management strategies such as appropriate systemic corticosteroids,&#xD;
      mobilization, and bedside education may reduce systemic inflammation and improve vascular&#xD;
      function, while improving patient self-efficacy and health outcomes and reducing hospital&#xD;
      length of stay (LOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Treatment-specific factors such as pharmacological management, patient education&#xD;
      and inpatient mobilization will affect LOS, as well as pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes&#xD;
      at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: For this cross-sectional study, consecutive patients admitted to the University&#xD;
      of Alberta Hospital Pulmonary ward with a diagnosis of an AECOPD (with BNP &lt;500 pg/ml and&#xD;
      Troponin &lt;1.0 mcg/L), not requiring ventilatory support in the form of non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation (NIV), will be approached for recruitment. In-hospital patient management will be&#xD;
      left to the discretion of the admitting physician, and will follow the new AHS admission&#xD;
      order sets for AECOPD, which are based on current guidelines1. Dr Bhutani assisted in the&#xD;
      development of these order sets. The order sets standardize pharmacological and&#xD;
      non-pharmacological management of AECOPD; however, variance in patients need and time to&#xD;
      delivery of these interventions will be present. Treatment will not be otherwise altered&#xD;
      during this study, except the timing of the administration of short acting bronchodilators as&#xD;
      it relates to the measurement of arterial stiffness and vascular function. 24 hours after&#xD;
      recruitment, the research team will begin collecting patient/clinical treatment information&#xD;
      on a daily basis (see Appendix B for list). 48 hours after admission, patients will be given&#xD;
      an activity monitor to quantify daily physical activity. On the same day, vascular assessment&#xD;
      through the measurement of pulse wave velocity, vascular function, lung function as well as&#xD;
      serum markers of systemic inflammation (TNF-alpha, MMP-2, IL-6 and CRP) and exhaled nitric&#xD;
      oxide (eNO), will be collected (this is in addition to usual blood work required for patient&#xD;
      management). This will be repeated on days 5, 10, day of discharge and day 14 post discharge.&#xD;
      Self efficacy and a 6-minute walk test will be performed on the day of discharge and on day&#xD;
      14 following discharge, while three-day physical activity will be determined at 14 days post&#xD;
      discharge. BODE index will be determined at discharge and at 14 days post discharge (see&#xD;
      Appendix C for data collection schedule).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection &amp; Recruitment: All Aims will be registered at (www.clinicaltrials.gov),&#xD;
      submitted for approval through the University of Alberta Health Research Ethics Board (HREB),&#xD;
      and informed consent will be obtained from each study patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since most of patients with COPD who are hospitalized initially present to, and are assessed&#xD;
      in the Emergency Department (ED), they will be recruited from this setting by the ED study&#xD;
      team. All patients with a diagnosis of AECOPD who are admitted to the pulmonary ward, meeting&#xD;
      the above criteria, will be screened for enrollment. If entered into the study, baseline&#xD;
      information (Appendix A) will be collected at that time. Through collaborative and primary ED&#xD;
      research activity, Dr Rowe's Emergency Medicine Research Group maintains research nurse&#xD;
      coverage for the U of A hospital ED from 07:00 - 23:00 Monday - Friday and 10:00 - 20:00&#xD;
      Saturday and Sunday. These research nurses act as the main recruitment source within the&#xD;
      University of Alberta Hospital ED and this site has been a leading Canadian recruitment&#xD;
      centre in a number of clinical research studies. Eligible patients with AECOPD will be&#xD;
      approached to enter the study as required and informed written consent will be obtained. A&#xD;
      Refused, Missed or Otherwise (RMO) excluded database will be maintained to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of a larger study and to assess the generalizability of the enrolled sample to&#xD;
      all cases. In the event that a patient presents after research staff hours, the patient will&#xD;
      be approached by the research staff to discuss the study and obtain consent and begin&#xD;
      collection of all data. AHS data indicates that ~450 COPD patients are admitted at the U of A&#xD;
      hospital each year. Dr Rowe's research team has demonstrated success at recruiting through&#xD;
      the ED120,121, and therefore recruiting 100 patients over 2 years is feasible&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Handling: Upon enrollment a data collection form (Appendix A) will be completed for all&#xD;
      patients by the ED research team. The research team will collect patient/clinical treatment&#xD;
      information daily (see Appendix B), and outcome data per protocol (see Appendix C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: All data will be entered into a custom-developed secure anonymized database.&#xD;
      Data analyses will be performed using StataCorp. 2009. Stata Statistical Software: Release 11&#xD;
      (College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). Continuous data will be reported as means and standard&#xD;
      deviations (SD) or median and interquartile ranges (IQR). Chi-square testing will be used for&#xD;
      bi-variable analyses of dichotomous variables; continuous variables will be compared using&#xD;
      t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests. Two-tailed results p &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant. The influence of patient characteristics and treatment factors on the dependent&#xD;
      variables (i.e. inflammation, vascular function, self efficacy and LOS) will analyzed through&#xD;
      a multiple linear or logistic regression models as appropriate. For the linear regression&#xD;
      model, clinically relevant and statistically significant (at the p &lt; 0.1 level) independent&#xD;
      variables will be included. For the logistic regression model, several dependent variables&#xD;
      will be explored; clinically relevant and statistically significant (at the p &lt; 0.1 level)&#xD;
      independent variables will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: A convenience sample of COPD patients will be recruited and efforts will be made&#xD;
      to provide reasonable confidence intervals on important variables and outcomes; a minimum&#xD;
      sample size of 100 COPD cases will be collected. This will be sufficient for multiple&#xD;
      regression analyses including up to 10 predictors and would provide narrow 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals (CI) for variable estimates of ~10% for mid-range variables and 6%. for&#xD;
      extreme-range variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To examine the impact of early PR following hospital discharge on QoL, pulmonary/CV&#xD;
      outcomes and AECOPD hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: In addition to typical improvements in QoL and exercise tolerance, studies have&#xD;
      shown that PR increases self-efficacy, physical activity while reducing CV risk in stable&#xD;
      COPD patients. Patients recently discharge from hospital following AECOPD represent the&#xD;
      sickest patients with greatly reduced QoL, exercise tolerance, self-efficacy and physical&#xD;
      activity and greatly elevated CV risk. Exactly how these improve with PR reduce CV risk and&#xD;
      hospitalizations following PR requires examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients who receive early PR will have improved QoL, pulmonary/CV outcomes and&#xD;
      less hospitalizations for COPD in the 6 months following hospital discharge. PR will improve&#xD;
      self efficacy, physical activity and QoL while reducing CV risk as compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design &amp; Subject Recruitment: All patients admitted to the pulmonary ward for an&#xD;
      AECOPD, including those who have completed Aim 1, will be offered participation into this arm&#xD;
      of the study. Patients found to have an acute cardiac injury during admission, mobility&#xD;
      issues or residence outside the greater Edmonton area will be excluded. Consenting patients&#xD;
      will be subsequently randomized into one of two groups: early PR versus usual care. Patients&#xD;
      randomized to early PR will be enrolled within 1 month of discharge into a PR program, while&#xD;
      usual care patients will be followed-up by their most responsible physician as determined by&#xD;
      the admitting team. The PR group will be enrolled in the Breathe Easy Program at the Center&#xD;
      for Lung Health, and will proceed through the program in a typical fashion. All patients will&#xD;
      be followed up 6 months after discharge and will be interviewed to assess disease status,&#xD;
      management review and if there has been a history of recurrence or relapse of the AECOPD.&#xD;
      Hospital admissions and length of stay data will be obtained through electronic medical&#xD;
      records. Patient assessments will include: quality of life, 6min walk, dyspnea,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, physical activity, pulse wave velocity, vascular function, systemic&#xD;
      inflammation (TNFα, MMP-2, IL-6 and CRP) and FeNO. All data will be collected before,&#xD;
      immediately after and 6month after PR. The control group will have the same data collected at&#xD;
      the same scheduled time. See above for descriptions of methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Handling: Data will be entered onto a secure anonymized database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: The influence of PR on QoL, 6min walk, dyspnea, self-efficacy, physical&#xD;
      activity, pulse wave velocity, vascular function, systemic inflammation and eNO will be&#xD;
      analyzed using a multivariate mixed-model MANOVA with treatment (PR vs. usual care) being a&#xD;
      fixed between-group variable and time (pre, immediate post, 6months post) as a repeated&#xD;
      variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Based on previous work84,95,96,101-105, a sample size of 50 in each group (100&#xD;
      total) will be sufficient to detect a between-group differences in QoL, 6min walk, PWV,&#xD;
      dyspnea and hospital readmission rates following PR (α=0.05, β=0.8). Based on our recent&#xD;
      work, this sample could detect a 10% difference in physical activity following PR (α=0.05,&#xD;
      β=0.8). One hundred patients will also to allow for stratification of physiological and&#xD;
      psychological responses with PR.&#xD;
