      The main purpose of this study is to examine changes in patient-reported symptoms during the&#xD;
      first two cycles of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC) and breast cancer, among patients who receive standard care&#xD;
      plus a proactive nursing intervention relative to patients who receive standard care alone.&#xD;
      Interventions to improve symptom management and prevent urgent care needs in both the clinic&#xD;
      and hospital for patients receiving chemotherapy with curative intent are needed to enhance&#xD;
      the quality of cancer care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      -  Participants with NSCLC, CRC or breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant or adjuvant&#xD;
           chemotherapy will be asked to fill out self-report questionnaires at their first&#xD;
           chemotherapy administration visit, in order to measure patient-reported symptoms,&#xD;
           psychological distress, and satisfaction with oncology care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will then be randomized into one of the two study groups: standard care&#xD;
           with proactive phone calls from nurse practitioners or standard care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants assigned to the standard care group will be treated by their care team as&#xD;
           would any other cancer patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants assigned to the intervention group will receive four proactive phone calls&#xD;
           from nurse practitioners designed to discuss symptom burden and management. Proactive&#xD;
           phone calls will occur 2-4 days after chemotherapy administration and 5-7 days after&#xD;
           chemotherapy administration, during cycles 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to fill out the same set of questionnaires during their&#xD;
           second and third chemotherapy administration visits, to assess patient-reported&#xD;
           symptoms, psychological distress, and satisfaction with oncology care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical records will be reviewed at 24-weeks following the first chemotherapy&#xD;
           administration visit, to evaluate frequency of urgent outpatient cancer center visits,&#xD;
           emergency department visits, and hospital admissions that occurred during the study&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
