    <textblock>
      Prospective, observational cohort study to investigate the prevalence of sleepiness and&#xD;
      sleep-related breathing disorders in patients with Fabry disease (FD). For this, an Epworth&#xD;
      Sleepiness Score (ESS) and ambulatory overnight respiratory polygraphy (oRP) is obtained in&#xD;
      all subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are 76 patients with Fabry disease in the region of eastern Switzerland who are&#xD;
      observed and treated in the University Hospital Zurich. All patients are encountered in&#xD;
      retrospective cohort study, and all patients are asked to participate in the study by&#xD;
      obtaining written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible Fabry patients are investigated by completion of ESS and one ambulatory overnight&#xD;
      respiratory polygraphy (oRP). An ESS over 11 is defined as excessive daytime sleepiness(EDS).&#xD;
      An apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) over 5 per minute is defined as sleep apnoea. Distinction of&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and central sleep apnoea (CSA) is performed by analysis of&#xD;
      oRP. Medical history, clinical and laboratory data, and current treatment will be extracted&#xD;
      from patient files and the retrospective cohort study, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are asked to participate in the study at clinically regular follow-up visits.&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, the subjects are provided for reviewing in- and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. For this, additional laboratory analyses and completion of ESS and patient's health&#xD;
      questionnaire (PHQ-9) is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening visit is encountered in the routine clinical follow-up examination. After&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent, the subjects are provided for reviewing in- and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. For this, the laboratory results (s. exclusion criteria), which are part of the&#xD;
      routine follow-up examination, are checked, and PHQ-9 and ESS are completed together with the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of fulfilling all inclusion criteria without presence of exclusion criteria, the&#xD;
      patients are scheduled by telephone call for visit 1 (oRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible Fabry patients are investigated one ambulatory overnight respiratory polygraphy&#xD;
      (oRP). For this reason, the subjects are asked to pick-up and learn the self-administration&#xD;
      of the oRP device (ApneaLink™ Plus (ResMed)). The oRP itself is easily performed at subject's&#xD;
      home. The following day, the patients need to return the device, or, alternatively, they can&#xD;
      send it by post. After oRP, there is no need for further visits for purpose of the study. The&#xD;
      subjects are informed about the results of oRP during the next regular clinical follow-up&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORP is a non-invasive medical examination technique, which is routinely applied to detect&#xD;
      sleep-related breathing disorders. For purpose of the oRP, the ApneaLink™ Plus (ResMed), a&#xD;
      home sleep testing diagnostic device that provides simple, cost-effective and reliable&#xD;
      results, is applied. The subjects will be instructed in the usage of the device, so that they&#xD;
      can install themselves in the study night.&#xD;
