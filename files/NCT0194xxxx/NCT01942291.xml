  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with reduced plasma concentration of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol&#xD;
      are more susceptible to oxidative stress and often present reduced endothelial function,&#xD;
      which has been mainly related to this susceptibility. Studies in animal and cell models have&#xD;
      demonstrated that niacin activates both GPR-109A in leukocytes and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)&#xD;
      pathway promoting strong anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. . In this context, the&#xD;
      aim of this study was to investigate the short-term effect of niacin on endothelial function&#xD;
      and verify the existence of interaction of PGD2 receptor antagonist, i.e. laropiprant (LRPT),&#xD;
      in subjects with low HDL-cholesterol (HDL -C).&#xD;

      Study design and treatments The study was randomized, double-blind, controlled, using a 2-way&#xD;
      crossover design with both treatment periods and washout time lasting 7 days. Subjects were&#xD;
      allocated by simple randomization to extended-release niacin 1g/day alone (ERN, Metri, Libbs&#xD;
      Farmacêutica, São Paulo, Brazil) or niacin associated with LRPT 1g/20mg (ERN/LRPT,&#xD;
      Cordaptive, Merck, São Paulo, Brazil). Medications were kindly supplied by Libbs and Merck.&#xD;
      Plasma samples and brachial artery reactivity were obtained at baseline, 7th day of treatment&#xD;
      1, 7th day after washout and 7th day of treatment 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Measurements The following blood measurements were performed using the Modular Hitachi&#xD;
      system and Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany) reagents: glucose (GOD-PAP), triglycerides&#xD;
      (TG)(GPO-PAP), HDL-C (HDL-C plus 3rd generation) and C-reactive protein (CRP)&#xD;
      (high-sensitivity CRP, Cardiophase, Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany). LDL cholesterol was&#xD;
      calculated by the Friedewald formula. HDL size was measured by laser scattering (Zetasizer -&#xD;
      Nanoseries DTS 1060, Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK). Total and direct bilirrubin&#xD;
      was measured by the Jendrassik-Grof method (Roche/Hitachi analyzer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity was measured by an endogenous assay. Aliquots&#xD;
      of the whole plasma (in which LCAT activity was inhibited by DTNB 9 μL/mL) were added to&#xD;
      HDL-[3H]cholesteryl ester fractions and simultaneously incubated at 4°C and 37°C for 4h.&#xD;
      Apo-B containing lipoproteins, present in the incubation mixture, were then precipitated; the&#xD;
      CE radioactivity in the supernatant represented the net rate at which CE mass was transferred&#xD;
      and values expressed as percent of [3H] cholesteryl ester transferred/4 hours depended upon&#xD;
      the plasma concentrations of HDL, TG-rich lipoproteins and CETP simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial-dependent vasodilation was assessed by ischemia-induced reactive hyperemia.&#xD;
      Briefly, after 12-hour overnight fasting patients were examined at 8 a.m. in a quiet room at&#xD;
      22ºC by using a ultrasound equipment Vivid i (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI, USA) with a&#xD;
      high-resolution (up to 13 MHz) vascular probe (12l-RS, GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI, USA) in&#xD;
      B-mode. The cardiac cycles were monitored simultaneously by electrocardiography coupled to&#xD;
      the equipment. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was assessed after 5-minutes inflation of a cuff&#xD;
      placed below the transducer, 50 mm Hg above the systolic blood pressure. Two-dimensional&#xD;
      images of the brachial artery were obtained during 5 minutes from the longitudinal axis&#xD;
      approximately 5-10 cm above the antecubital fossa. The maximum expansion of the diameter of&#xD;
      the brachial artery was measured in triplicate at the peak of the T wave of the cardiac cycle&#xD;
      before the interruption of the flow and post deflation.&#xD;
