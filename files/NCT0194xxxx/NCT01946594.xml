  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team aims to conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study to assess the&#xD;
      effect of prophylactic antipyretics on the immune responses and rates of fever after&#xD;
      inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in children 12 through 35 months of age. In this pilot,&#xD;
      40 healthy children, 12 through 35 months of age, including some children at risk of febrile&#xD;
      seizure, will be randomized to receive prophylactic acetaminophen or oral placebo immediately&#xD;
      following and every 4 to 6 hours in the 24 hours after receipt of a dose of IIV. Data derived&#xD;
      from the pilot study will be used to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger scale&#xD;
      study. Feasibility will include assessments of the speed and ease of study recruitment and&#xD;
      adherence to and completion of study assessments. Children will be followed for the&#xD;
      occurrence of fever, fussiness, changes in appetite and sleep patterns, and use of medical&#xD;
      services on the day of and day following vaccination. Antibody to influenza antigens&#xD;
      contained in the 2013-2014 vaccine as measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline and four weeks following vaccination. The proportions of&#xD;
      children experiencing fever, having solicited reactions, using medical services,&#xD;
      demonstrating a serologic response corresponding to seroprotection and seroconversion to each&#xD;
      of the IIV antigens will be determined for groups of children receiving acetaminophen and&#xD;
      placebo. Likewise geometric mean HAI titers (GMT) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals&#xD;
      for each IIV antigen will be calculated for both vaccine groups.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible for inclusion in the study the following enrollment criteria must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The child must be 12 through 35 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The child must only need a single dose of IIV during the current season. (Children&#xD;
             only need 1 dose of vaccine in 2013-14 if they received a total of 2 or more doses of&#xD;
             seasonal vaccine since July 1, 2010. Children who did not receive a total of 2 or more&#xD;
             doses of seasonal vaccine since July 1, 2010 require 2 doses in 2013-14).[19]&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The parent/guardian must be willing and capable of providing written informed consent&#xD;
             for the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The parent/guardian must be available for follow-up and must at minimum have telephone&#xD;
             access.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The parent/guardian must agree to sign a medical release for the child so that study&#xD;
             personnel may obtain medical information about the child's health (if needed).&#xD;

             days (for live vaccines) prior to vaccination in this study or expects to receive a&#xD;
             licensed vaccine during the 28 days following the last vaccination in this study.&#xD;
             Concomitant vaccinations are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Routine immunizations are delayed or will be delayed by not being able to receive a&#xD;
             concomitantly administered vaccine or a needed vaccine in the 28 days following&#xD;
             receipt of the influenza vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Received an experimental/investigational agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood&#xD;
             product, or medication) within 28 days prior to vaccination in this study, or expects&#xD;
             to receive an experimental/investigational agent within the follow-up time period (28&#xD;
             days after the last vaccination in this study).&#xD;
&#xD;

             temperature greater than or equal to 100.0°F (37.8°C) at the time of enrollment. (This&#xD;
             may result in a temporary delay of vaccination).&#xD;

             of and the day following IIV (this exclusion does not apply if the caretaker indicates&#xD;
             he/she might administer antipyretics after vaccination to reduce a fever).&#xD;
