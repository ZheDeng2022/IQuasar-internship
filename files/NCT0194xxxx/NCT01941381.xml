      Due to recent efforts to decrease antibiotic overuse, and reports of high rates of&#xD;
      spontaneous resolution for clinically diagnosed Acute Otitis Media(AOM), most physicians now&#xD;
      wait 48-72 hours before starting antibiotics for common ear infections. The investigators are&#xD;
      interested to see if those patients with documented middle ear effusions, as determined by&#xD;
      tympanometry, have higher rates of eventual antibiotic usage than those with normal&#xD;
      tympanometry results. If there is a significant disparity between those with a positive&#xD;
      tympanogram and those without the investigators may be able to identify a group that will&#xD;
      benefit from antibiotics and a group that would not need treatment.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Acute Otitis Media (AOM) is the most common childhood infection for which&#xD;
      antibiotics are prescribed.{1-2} Several important factors have altered the prescription&#xD;
      practices for AOM in the past decade. North America has seen an epidemic of microbial&#xD;
      resistance, attributable in a large part to the over-prescription of antibiotics.{3-4}&#xD;
      Evidence has shown that AOM is commonly over diagnosed and antibiotics are prescribed&#xD;
      unnecessarily.{5-7} In addition a number of studies comparing antibiotic treatment to&#xD;
      placebo, although proving superiority for antibiotic treatment, had very high rates of&#xD;
      resolution with placebo. A meta analysis of 7 RCT's show a 73% success rate for Amoxicillin&#xD;
      versus 60% for placebo.{8}&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results prompted interest in a watch and wait strategy for the treatment of AOM for&#xD;
      children 6 months to 10 years of age. Three important studies were performed assessing the&#xD;
      outcomes of delaying antibiotics for 48-72H, two in primary care{9-10} and one in a pediatric&#xD;
      emergency department.{11} All three showed no difference in outcomes with 2-4 week follow-up.&#xD;
      There was a significant reduction in antibiotic usage with the watch and wait approach, a&#xD;
      reduction of about 70%. These studies led both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the&#xD;
      Canadian Pediatric Society to recommend adopting a conservative non-antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      strategy for AOM in the first 48-72H.{12} However in early 2011, 2 papers were published that&#xD;
      suggested that antibiotic use in AOM was beneficial.{13, 14} What set both of these two&#xD;
      papers apart from other papers was the definition of acute otitis media: in one study the&#xD;
      children were enrolled by study clinicians who were otoscopists who had successfully&#xD;
      completed an otoscopic validation program, in the second study middle ear fluid had to be&#xD;
      present by means of pneumatic otoscopy. The question then arises, is the treatment of otitis&#xD;
      media really a question that concerns the treatment, or is it a question of diagnosis? The&#xD;
      published correspondence that these two papers generated, suggested that diagnosis of AOM is&#xD;
      indeed a concern. A technique named tympanometry could prove to be useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tympanometry is a well established technique for documentation of middle ear effusion.&#xD;
      Tympanometry measures the compliance of the tympanic membrane over a range of pressures. A&#xD;
      graphic curve is generated which can be compared to normals or examples of pathologic&#xD;
      conditions. Primary care physicians have used this technique successfully among children with&#xD;
      and without a diagnosis of AOM.{15} Two studies involving tympanometry and otitis&#xD;
      media{16-17} have shown tympanograms consistent with clear middle ear effusion(Type B) in&#xD;
      50-60% of patients clinically diagnosed with AOM. This strongly suggests that AOM is being&#xD;
      over diagnosed! Interestingly Spiro et al showed that rates of antibiotic prescription were&#xD;
      not different in physicians who were aware of tympanogram results and those who were blinded.&#xD;
      This indicates a lack of knowledge around the impact on outcome of the initial tympanogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently at the Stollery, (and as suggested by CPS and AMA) well children who are diagnosed&#xD;
      with AOM are given a prescription for antibiotics, but told to wait 48 hours before filling&#xD;
      them, in the expectation that many of these children will have a complete resolution of their&#xD;
      symptoms. They are encouraged to take analgesics to keep them comfortable. However, the&#xD;
      current state of knowledge indicates that antibiotics provide superior symptom control in the&#xD;
      first 24-48H and provide superior resolution rates to placebo in clinically diagnosed AOM.&#xD;
      The delayed antibiotic strategy has similar long term outcomes to immediate antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment. It is not clear if patients with middle ear effusion documented by adjunctive&#xD;
      tests, such as tympanometry represent a distinctly different group than those diagnosed by&#xD;
      observation of the tympanic membrane only. Spiro's study indicates that physicians do not&#xD;
      know and therefore are not changing their practice on the basis of tympanogram results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This then brings us to the investigators' primary research question. Are those children aged&#xD;
      6 months to 16 years who attend the Stollery Emergency Department and are diagnosed with AOM&#xD;
      (and sent home with conservative management) more likely to fill a prescription for&#xD;
      antibiotics over the next 7 days if their tympanogram is type B rather than types A or C?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose an observational study, within a watch and wait strategy, to&#xD;
      determine if patients clinically diagnosed with AOM and having a type B tympanogram have&#xD;
      higher rates of eventual antibiotic usage. Secondary outcome measures would include symptoms&#xD;
      of pain, fever and impaired sleep than those without clear evidence of middle ear effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If those patients with a B type tympanogram have a high rate of eventual antibiotic usage,&#xD;
      delaying their treatment is not significantly reducing our overall antibiotic usage.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators could reduce the pain suffered by these patients in those&#xD;
      first 48-72 hours. The corollary to this may be that those patients with other tympanogram&#xD;
      patterns may have comparatively low need for antibiotics. This study would help to more&#xD;
      accurately identify those patients likely to derive significant benefit from antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment for AOM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT DESIGN AND WORK PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study is a non-interventional analysis of outcome. This is an observational&#xD;
      cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and sampling method: All patients diagnosed with OM will be approached for study&#xD;
      enrolment within the hours which an RA is available. Tympanometry will be conducted on every&#xD;
      participant in both ears. The clinician will not be privy to the result of the tympanogram.&#xD;
      The tympanograms will be assigned a B or A/C shape, upon review by the principle&#xD;
      investigators. In cases of disagreement a third reviewer will review the tympanogram.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed with a phone call in 3 days and again at 8 days. They will be asked&#xD;
      to rate their symptoms (Acute Otitis Media-Severity of Symptom Scale){18}, in addition to&#xD;
      specific scripted interview questions for the study (under development) including a&#xD;
      determination of antibiotic usage for the infection. The investigators will also review the&#xD;
      provincial pharmacy database to confirm if antibiotics prescriptions were filled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training: Research assistants will receive one-on-one training with the principal&#xD;
      investigators on tympanography technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Updates regarding the study will occur at the monthly staff meetings, posters&#xD;
      describing the study will also be placed throughout the ED. Research Assistants will be&#xD;
      visible in the department and will remind staff of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: Are those children aged 6 months to 16 years who attend the Stollery&#xD;
      Emergency Department and are diagnosed with AOM (and sent home with conservative management)&#xD;
      more likely to fill a prescription for antibiotics over the next 7 days if their tympanogram&#xD;
      is type B rather than types A or C? Secondary Outcomes: Does a type B tympanometry curve&#xD;
      predict increases in (1)Reported Pain (2)Analgesic use (3)Fever (4)Sleep Disturbance (5)Oral&#xD;
      intake versus type A/C tympanograms (6) Proportion of patients diagnosed with OM who have&#xD;
      either type A or type A and C tympanograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: A logistic regression will be performed using antibiotic use in 7 days as the&#xD;
      dependent variable. Given 4 independent variables, the investigators need at least 40 (80&#xD;
      would be ideal) subjects who fill the antibiotic prescription. Enrolling 137 patients would&#xD;
      give us an alpha and Beta each of 0.05, and would allow us to do Chi Squared test looking at&#xD;
      a two by two table of Antibiotic (Yes or No) vs Tympanometry Graph (Type B vs other).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Antibiotic use in the 7 days following enrolment will be analyzed by logistic&#xD;
      regression. Independent variables will include age, Tympanogram type A/C, Viral upper&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms for ≥ 5days prior to presentation to the ED, and pain requiring&#xD;
      analgesia in the Emergency or at home within 6H of presentation. Quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      data will be described. Antibiotic drug data will be checked in NetCare to see if there is a&#xD;
      discrepancy between verbal reports and NetCare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility: Data from the investigators' emergency department indicates over 900 children&#xD;
      per year present with AOM, and over the past 6 months of winter (Oct-Mar) there have been&#xD;
      about 540. Based on previous results {9-11} the investigators predict an antibiotic usage&#xD;
      rate of 30%. To collect 40 patients who fill a prescription for antibiotics the investigators&#xD;
      will need 135 patients with otitis. If antibiotic usage rates are higher this number will&#xD;
      decrease. Accounting for about a 15% drop out rate the investigators will need to enroll&#xD;
      about 155 children. Conservatively assuming recruitment of 30% of children with AOM the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate 24 weeks to reach the investigators' sample size.&#xD;
