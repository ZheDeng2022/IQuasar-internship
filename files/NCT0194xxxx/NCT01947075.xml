  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following the decline of malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa, clinicians face febrile patients in&#xD;
      whom an alternative diagnosis has to be made. This situation has led to an overuse of&#xD;
      antibiotics by clinicians. It is crucial to increase knowledge on etiologies and risk factors&#xD;
      of outpatient febrile illness in order to improve their management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This present proposal aims to investigate the etiologies of fever among adult patients&#xD;
      attending an outpatient department in urban Tanzania. It also aims to assess the clinical&#xD;
      significance of nasopharyngeal (NP) respiratory viruses and bacteria documentation in this&#xD;
      setting. Third, it aims to compare the spectrum of infections in this population with that of&#xD;
      children included in the same setting in a previous study. The last objective is to assess&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (DM) as a risk factor for infection and exposure to indoor air pollution&#xD;
      (IAP) as a risk factor for acute respiratory infections (ARI) in adults in Tanzania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that acute respiratory infections are the main cause of adult&#xD;
      febrile illness in a urban low-income setting and that use of quantitative molecular assays&#xD;
      on naso-oropharyngeal samples can improve the diagnosis of pneumonia. The investigators also&#xD;
      think that the spectrum of infections is different between children and adults, mainly due to&#xD;
      a high HIV prevalence in adults. The investigators also hypothesize that experiencing IAP&#xD;
      and/ or DM is a risk factor for infections in adults.&#xD;

        Every consecutive adult with temperature ≥38°C attending the outpatient department of&#xD;
        Mwananyamala Hospital will be screened for inclusion. Additional inclusion criteria are&#xD;
        fever of ≤1 week duration and first consultation for the present problem. Exclusion&#xD;
        criteria are refusal of HIV screening, main complaint is injury or trauma, antibiotic&#xD;
        treatment during the previous week (apart from cotrimoxazole prophylaxis), delivery within&#xD;
        the previous 6 weeks and hospitalization during the last month. Medical history will be&#xD;
        taken (including exposure to IAP) and clinical examination will be done in a standardized&#xD;
        way.&#xD;
