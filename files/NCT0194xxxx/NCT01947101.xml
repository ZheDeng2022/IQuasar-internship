  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC), a specific type of inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease, will be invited to take part in this study. The investigators do not know what&#xD;
      causes UC. However, the microbes (such as bacteria and viruses), which normally live in our&#xD;
      intestines are thought to play an important role in the development of UC. There are many&#xD;
      treatment options for UC such as steroids,and other medications that decrease inflammation.&#xD;
      However, none of these can cure the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to treat pediatric UC in an alternative fashion by changing the microbes in&#xD;
      the gut by giving the participant's stool specimens from healthy adult individuals. There is&#xD;
      some evidence from a few cases of adult UC that this therapy may cure the disease or at least&#xD;
      provide long lasting suppression (remission) of the symptoms. The investigators would like to&#xD;
      test this therapeutic intervention in children with UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to (1) examine the microbiome of stool and colon (2) and to&#xD;
      determine whether healthy-donated stool enemas can treat pediatric ulcerative colitis. (3)&#xD;
      The investigators will also study the effects of the treatment on colonic gene expression.&#xD;

      FMT RECIPIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the patient population treated by the Pediatric&#xD;
      Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition Section at Baylor College of Medicine/Texas&#xD;
      Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Activities prior to starting FMT therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants will be asked to discontinue or taper their current home medications for&#xD;
           ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants will be asked to complete enema training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The participant and family will be counseled in case emergency surgical and/or intensive&#xD;
           care interventions are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Survey Completion to assess clinical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Initiation of FMT Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-colonoscopy and FMT therapy preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           One to two days prior to scheduled colonoscopy the study participant will be asked to&#xD;
           provide a stool sample. They will also undergo a bowel clean-out with Miralax for&#xD;
           colonoscopy preparation. Colonoscopy (endoscopic examination of the large bowel) will be&#xD;
           used to deliver the first donor fecal transplant at the beginning of the therapeutic&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. FMT treatment and Initial colonoscopy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal microbiota transplantation is made possible by utilizing a donor (healthy adult)&#xD;
      providing their stool sample. The donor's stool will be screened and tested for known&#xD;
      disease-causing agents including viruses, bacteria and parasites to prevent spread of disease&#xD;
      to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first day of treatment, the participant will undergo a colonoscopy to deliver the&#xD;
      filtered donor stool directly into their colon. Additionally, biopsies will be taken during&#xD;
      this procedure for routine diagnostic as well as research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Subsequent FMT treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enemas will be given periodically to complete a total of 1-year therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Follow-up endoscopy and samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A similar but more limited procedure (sigmoidoscopy) will be repeated at 14 weeks into the&#xD;
      study period. Biopsies will be taken during this procedure for routine diagnostic as well as&#xD;
      research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FMT DONORS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential healthy adult stool donors (between 18 and 45 years of age) will be recruited by&#xD;
      the research staff. They will be asked to volunteer for the screening and regularly supply&#xD;
      stool samples according to the study protocol.&#xD;
