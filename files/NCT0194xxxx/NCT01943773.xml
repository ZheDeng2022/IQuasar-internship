      Purpose: To compare post-operative functional outcomes in patients undergoing preoperative&#xD;
      functional prehabilitation versus standard of care preoperative management in older adults&#xD;
      undergoing major elective operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Older adults undergoing preoperative functional prehabilitation (nine sessions of&#xD;
      home physical therapy over three weeks) will have improved physical function and reduced&#xD;
      delirium in comparison to usual preoperative care following major abdominal and thoracic&#xD;
      operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (#1) To compare the difference in the timed up-and-go, Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE), the de&#xD;
      Morton Mobility Index, Modified Physical Performance Test (MPPT), and short physical&#xD;
      performance battery scores in the control and intervention groups at the preoperative and&#xD;
      initial assessment timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (#2) To compare the difference in the timed up-and-go, Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE), the de&#xD;
      Morton Mobility Index, Modified Physical Performance Test (MPPT), and short physical&#xD;
      performance battery scores in the control and intervention groups at the 60-days&#xD;
      postoperative and the initial assessment timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (#3)To compare the rates of ICU delirium and need for post-discharge institutionalization in&#xD;
      patients in the control and interventions groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (#4) To compare post-operative complications&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Prehabilitation has been studied in relation outcomes after surgery. One common&#xD;
      area studied is how it affects post-operative outcome for knee replacement patients.&#xD;
      Prehabilitation was found to increase strength and function in older adults. {Swank, 2011.&#xD;
      #1} Prehabilitation increased leg strength and the ability to perform functional tasks in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prehabilitation has also been studied in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
      surgery (CABG). Primary outcome measures were: anxiety and length of hospital stay; secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures were: depression, physical functioning, cardiac misconceptions and cost&#xD;
      utility. Prehabilitation was found to decrease depression and improve physical functioning.&#xD;
      {Furze, 2009. #2}&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prehabilitation was also found in one study to reduce postoperative complications, length of&#xD;
      stay, and declines in functional disability compared to the control group, while improving&#xD;
      quality of life, in patients having cardiac and abdominal surgery. {Carli, 2005. #3}&#xD;
&#xD;
      No research has been done linking prehabilitation to the incidence of delirium. The research&#xD;
      team has extensive experience studying delirium. Decreased cognition and functional ability&#xD;
      has been linked to delirium and poorer outcomes post-operatively. {Robinson, 2009. #4}.&#xD;
      Theoretically, by improving functional ability pre-operatively, post-operative outcomes will&#xD;
      improve and delirium will decrease. This study will examine if this is true.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care for abdominal and non-cardiac thoracic operations does not&#xD;
      involve prehabilitation. (Cardiac operations were excluded due to the increased risk for&#xD;
      heart-related complications during prehabilitation, such as Myocardial Infarction (MI).) The&#xD;
      control group will receive standard of care pre-operative care, with the exception of&#xD;
      baseline functional assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Variable: A timed up-and-go, Mini Mental Status Exam, the de Morton Mobility&#xD;
      Index, Modified Physical Performance Test (MPPT), and a short physical performance battery&#xD;
      will be performed 60 days following the operation. The difference in the timed up-and-go and&#xD;
      the short physical performance battery between 60 days postoperatively and at the initial&#xD;
      assessment will be compared in the control and intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes: The secondary outcome variables will be the rate of need for discharge to&#xD;
      an institutional care facility and ICU delirium. These two variables will be compared in the&#xD;
      control and intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Outcomes: Evaluate post-operative complications. These two variables will be compared&#xD;
      in the control and intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN AND RESEARCH METHODS Baseline Assessment: On study entry, each participant will&#xD;
      have a timed up-and-go, Mini Mental Status Exam, de Morton, Modified Physical Performance&#xD;
      Test (MPPT), and a short physical performance battery performed. Routine demographics will be&#xD;
      performed. Traditional and geriatric preoperative variables will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups: Participants will be randomized to receive standard of care (control) or the&#xD;
      intervention of prehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control Group: The control group will undergo routine pre-operative management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention Group: The intervention will consist of nine 45 minute long physical&#xD;
           therapy sessions. Sessions will occur three times weekly at the patient's home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Intervention Effectiveness: Immediately prior to the operation, all&#xD;
      participants will undergo repeat timed up-and-go, Mini Mental Status Exam, the de Morton&#xD;
      Mobility Index, Modified Physical Performance Test (MPPT), and short physical performance&#xD;
      battery. The difference in scores between the preoperative assessment and the initial&#xD;
      assessment at enrollment will be compared in the control and intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operations: The scheduled operation will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Adverse Outcomes: Postoperative adverse outcomes will be recorded using&#xD;
      standardized definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS PLAN A sample size of 100 people, because we anticipate many will complete the&#xD;
      Up and Go in 10 seconds and faster and will be screen fails. A total of 40 subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized, 20 per group. The outcomes of timed up and go, Short Physical Battery, Modified&#xD;
      Physical Performance Test (MPPT), and de Morton will be compared from baseline to immediately&#xD;
      pre-operatively and immediately post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be compared as continuous variables using a non-parametric T-test. Baseline&#xD;
      demographic clinical data will be compared in the study and control groups using&#xD;
      non-parametric chi square or T-test where appropriate.&#xD;
