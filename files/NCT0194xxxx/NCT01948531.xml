      Aim of the study is to evaluate clinically and by non-invasive instrumental evaluations the&#xD;
      &quot;antiage&quot; activity of Gynomunal® gel after one single application on the face (short term&#xD;
      evaluation) and 4 weeks of repeated use twice daily (long term evaluation) by healthy female&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also aim of this study to evaluate cosmetic acceptability by the volunteers and&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerance both by investigator and volunteers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Controlled clinical trial that foresees the application of the study product for an&#xD;
      uninterrupted period of 4 weeks. 4 visits will be performed: a basal visit (T0), a short term&#xD;
      evaluation 20 minutes after the 1st product application (T20min) and a long term evaluation&#xD;
      after 2 (T2 - intermediate visit) and 4 (T4 - final visit) week-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted on 33 healthy volunteers of female sex, 11 women for each of the&#xD;
      following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  35-44 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  45-54 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  55-65 years The volunteers accept to respect the rules fixed in the list of recruitment&#xD;
           criteria and not to deviate from their normal life habits. Moreover, the month preceding&#xD;
           the inclusion visit and during the entire period of treatment, normal cleansing habits&#xD;
           must be maintained, sun and UV light exposure, avoided. In the case of UV exposure must&#xD;
           be used a sun screen total block cream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each volunteer is precisely informed about the study, a consent form being completed and&#xD;
      signed. At the end of the study the investigator will declare to have informed all the&#xD;
      volunteers participating it, signing and dating the relative form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be started only after Independent Ethical Committee approval. It is understood&#xD;
      that the treatment would be immediately interrupted as soon as the investigator judges it&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each volunteer a Case Record Form is filled and to each one a progressive number is&#xD;
      assigned. Personal data, subject's history, clinical and instrumental evaluations are&#xD;
      registered in basal conditions and at all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 3 hours before the visit the volunteer must not smoke, drink coffee or alcohol. Any&#xD;
      cosmetic product can be used on the skin test area during 2 hours before the visit. All&#xD;
      measurements are performed under standard environmental conditions (Temperature=22+\-2°C;&#xD;
      Relative Humidity&lt;60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each visit the volunteer will get acclimatized under relax conditions for at least&#xD;
      10-15 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each volunteer will report on the personal diary card all information about the date, the&#xD;
      time of study product application and a comment if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, the volunteers must give back the diary card to the Investigator to verify&#xD;
      their compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples are handled by DermIng in accordance with the methods described in the company&#xD;
      operating procedures (SOP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is carried out by DermIng in accordance with the methods described in its own&#xD;
      company operating procedures (SOPs). The information and data on the trial are generated,&#xD;
      recorded, documented and processed in accordance with the methods described in the following&#xD;
      procedure, based on ICH GCP 1996. The trial is covered by an insurance policy provided by&#xD;
      Polichem S.A. to cover any damages related to the study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical plan: the activity of the test product at T20min, T2 and T4 will be expressed in&#xD;
      absolute values versus baseline (T0) for the entire population and for each evaluated group&#xD;
      (35-44 yeas, 45-54 years, 55-65 years). Moreover a comparison between groups will be carried&#xD;
      out at each considered time. Clinical data The statistical analysis of clinical data is&#xD;
      carried out with not parametric test, while the analysis of all instrumental data are carried&#xD;
      out with parametric test.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A picture of crow's feet area is taken thanks to Primos compact portable device (GFMesstechnik); Primos software is able to elaborate 3D representations of skin wrinkles as well as to measure skin principal profilometric parameters in vivo or on skin replicas.&#xD;
As a measuring method Primos compact uses a digital stripe projection based on micro mirrors which allows for fast and highly precise measuring data acquisition (the speed of under 70ms for the measuring data admission provide perfect results of measurement).</description>

    <measure>Plastoelasticity</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Among the various methods studied in order to measure the skin elasticity grade, the torsion one is the most effective, as it is very sensible to the variations of the mechanical properties of the corneum stratum. Skin firmness is measured with the instrument Dermal Torque Meter (Dia-Stron Ltd., UK). This instrument is based on the principle of the torsion given to the skin surface by a probe made of two circles that adhere to the skin through shaped adhesive tapes. The internal circle rotation, while the external circle is still, exerts a constant torsion of the skin (torsion time = 1 second with a torque = 9mN*m). The instrument measures the torsion angle (θ) during the mechanical stimulus (&quot;torque on&quot;) and after it has ceased (&quot;torque off&quot;).&#xD;
Parameters:&#xD;
Ue: immediate extensibility (&quot;torque on&quot; at 0.02 sec.) Uf: maximum extensibility (&quot;torque on&quot; at 0.9 sec.) Uv: viscoelasticity Ur: immediate elastic recovery (&quot;torque off&quot; at 0.02 sec.).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Electrical capacitance of skin (hydration)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hydration is measured by the instrument Corneometer CM825 (Courage - Khazaka, Köln, Germany): a square sensor (49mm2) frontally covered by a special glass, mounted on a spring cursor able to measure electrical capacity. Leaning the sensor on the skin surface, with a constant pressure thanks to the spring cursor it is possible to perform measures. The sensor acts as a capacitor. When a voltage is applied to this capacitor, the quantity of electric charge stored will be dependent on the dielectric properties of the material in contact with the probe. Water has an unusually high dielectric constant and so its presence in the skin is readily detectable by this method. So the measure of the skin capacitance properties is an indirect expression of its hydration level.</description>
