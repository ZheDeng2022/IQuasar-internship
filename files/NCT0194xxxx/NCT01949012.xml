    <textblock>
      Dentists use sedation to help patients accept difficult procedures and to relieve anxiety.&#xD;
      During sedation, the well-being of the patient is monitored by the dental team. When carried&#xD;
      out according to recognised guidelines,intravenous dental sedation is considered to be very&#xD;
      safe. For some patients, dental sedation is a useful alternative to general anaesthetic. It&#xD;
      is cheaper and has the potential to be more accessible. Oximetry(measurement of oxygen&#xD;
      status) is the current gold standard in dental sedation. The main risk to the patient during&#xD;
      sedation is a slowing of breathing due to the effects of the sedative drug. Studies from&#xD;
      other settings where sedation is practiced suggest that an additional monitor with&#xD;
      capnography facilitates early detection of depressed breathing. However, the results of&#xD;
      studies from other medical settings cannot be generalised to dental sedation, because of&#xD;
      different techniques used and the types of patients. The depth of sedation may also be vary.&#xD;
      For dental sedation, patients remain responsive at all times and breathe for themselves.&#xD;
      Capnography gives breath by breath information using a simple device placed close to the nose&#xD;
      and mouth. It has been recommended by several governing medical bodies that each area of&#xD;
      medicine, should develop its own guidelines for sedation. Therefore, there is a need to&#xD;
      research the application of capnography for dental sedation. The proposed study will take&#xD;
      place at a university hospital site. Patients will be randomly divided into two groups. Both&#xD;
      groups will receive sedation in the normal way. The study group will have capnography&#xD;
      monitoring added. The study will look for differences in breathing between the two groups.&#xD;
      Additional information regarding other aspects of monitoring will also be obtained. The&#xD;
      results from the proposed study may help to improve patient safety and change current&#xD;
      practice during sedation for dentistry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Intravenous sedation allows procedures to be performed in dentistry, and other&#xD;
      areas of medicine beyond the operating room. Its application in each area is tailored to the&#xD;
      requirements of the relevant procedure, the setting and the levels of operator training and&#xD;
      expertise. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges emphasises that each speciality must produce&#xD;
      its own form of guidance in the use of sedative techniques. The following definition for&#xD;
      conscious sedation in dentistry is accepted by the General Dental Council and the Dental&#xD;
      Sedation Teachers Group: &quot;A technique in which the use of a drug or drugs produces a state of&#xD;
      depression of the central nervous system enabling treatment to be carried out, but during&#xD;
      which verbal contact with the patient is maintained throughout the period of sedation. The&#xD;
      drugs and techniques used to provide conscious sedation for dental treatment should carry a&#xD;
      margin of safety wide enough to render loss of consciousness unlikely&quot;. The Standing Dental&#xD;
      Advisory Committee Guidance 2003, which remains the standard of guidance in the UK, further&#xD;
      states: &quot;Any technique resulting in the loss of consciousness is defined as general&#xD;
      anaesthesia and in the UKm 'deep sedation' is considered within this category&quot;. To summarise;&#xD;
      dental sedation lies within the range of minimal to moderate sedation on the sedation&#xD;
      continuum i.e. conscious sedation. Deep sedation is to be avoided in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dentists who have completed a recognised postgraduate course can practice conscious sedation&#xD;
      independently. For intravenous sedation, dentists use a &quot;standard&quot; conscious sedation&#xD;
      technique, defined as &quot;intravenous sedation&quot;, using midazolam alone. The drug is titrated to&#xD;
      an end-point; it is rapid in onset and possesses a short duration of action, which means that&#xD;
      midazolam is very useful in the field of dental sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of monitoring for patients is clinical monitoring, which must be&#xD;
      supplemented by pulse oximetry and blood pressure readings. The most important side effect of&#xD;
      midazolam is respiratory depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is generally considered a safe practice, conscious sedation is not entirely&#xD;
      risk-free.Ventilation (breathing) and oxygenation are related but seperate physiological&#xD;
      processes. During the process of sedation, clinicians rely on pulse oximetry as a surrogate&#xD;
      measure of ventilation. Capnography, a staple gold standard in general anaesthesia, is&#xD;
      becoming an increasingly important area of interest for procedural sedation, with studies&#xD;
      from other settings suggesting, capnography to be an effective ventilatory monitor for&#xD;
      sedated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One significant limitation of pulse oximetry is the lag time; this means that the partial&#xD;
      pressure of oxygen may decrease significantly before the pulse oximeter signals the fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reviewing the literature Previous studies on capnography for sedation are difficult to&#xD;
      summarise. A review of the available literature has shown a relative paucity of randomised&#xD;
      trials and no trials in the dental setting. Three trials from other settings are summarised&#xD;
      here. Beitz et al (2012): A total of 760 patients were enrolled. Patients received 2L/min of&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen. The intention-to-treat analysis revealed a significant reduction in the&#xD;
      incidence of oxygen desaturation in the capnography arm in comparison with the conventional&#xD;
      arm (38.9% vs. 53.2%). The study conclusion was that additional capnography monitoring&#xD;
      reduces the incidence of oxygen desaturation and hypoxemia during propofol sedation for&#xD;
      colonoscopy. Deitch et al (2010): A total of 132 patients in an emergency room setting.&#xD;
      Hypoxia was defined as an SpO2 &lt; 93%. The incidence of oxygen desaturation in the capnography&#xD;
      arm in comparison with the conventional arm was 25% vs. 42%. All patients received&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen (3L/minute). Conclusion: The addition of capnography to standard&#xD;
      monitoring reduced the incidence of hypoxia and provided advanced warning for all hypoxic&#xD;
      events. Qadeer et al (2009):This trial showed a significantly reduced rate of hypoxia (46% vs&#xD;
      69%), defined as an oximetry reading &lt; 90% for 15 sec. There was a relatively large cohort of&#xD;
      ASA 3 patients in the study. 147 patients received supplemental oxygen. The study conclusion&#xD;
      was that capnography monitoring of respiratory activity improves patient safety during&#xD;
      procedural sedation for elective endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waugh et al (2010) conducted a meta - analysis, the main finding being that during procedural&#xD;
      sedation , cases of respiratory depression were 17.6 times more likely to be detected if&#xD;
      monitored by capnography than cases not monitored by capnography ( 95% CI, 2.5-122.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from the three randomised trials and the meta-analysis cannot be generalised and&#xD;
      extrapolated to the standard dental sedation technique because of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Different patient populations The reviewed studies contain many elderly patients who are&#xD;
           known to be more sensitive to sedative drugs and more likely to have co - morbidities.&#xD;
           For standard dental sedation the age is less than 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Supplemental Oxygen In standard dental technique patients breath room air. In the&#xD;
           reviewed studies supplemental oxygen was often administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Drugs Different drugs were used to achieve sedation in the reviewed studies e.g.&#xD;
           Propofol and Ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Analgesia Local anaesthetic is employed for analgesia in dentistry. In the reviewed&#xD;
           studies, analgesia was often achieved with the use of intravenous agents such as&#xD;
           opioids. The synergistic effect of drugs used in combination are likely to have resulted&#xD;
           in increased respiratory depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Desaturation (SpO2) For the standard dental sedation technique an SpO2&lt; 95% is regarded&#xD;
           as the threshold for early desaturation.This is a reasonable threshold in this setting&#xD;
           where sedation is administered by a non-anaesthetist outside of the operating room. In&#xD;
           the reviewed studies the thresholds varied. Deitch et al used a threshold &lt; 93% and&#xD;
           Qadeer et al. &lt;90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Depth of sedation Varied between the studies and in some cases was beyond conscious&#xD;
           sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized, controlled study is to determine whether early intervention based&#xD;
      upon data from capnographic monitoring reduces the incidence of arterial oxygen desaturation&#xD;
      during midazolam sedation for dentistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if early intervention based on capnography will influence the incidence of&#xD;
           arterial oxygen desaturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Characterise the ETCO2, respiratory rate and SPO2 at baseline pre sedation, during&#xD;
           sedation and post sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, randomised controlled trial on dental patients receiving&#xD;
      intravenous conscious sedation with midazolam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal: To determine whether use by the dental team of real - time capnography is associated&#xD;
      with a decrease in the incidence of oxygen desaturation (hypoxia) compared with standard&#xD;
      monitoring alone during intravenous sedation with midazolam for dentistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and selection of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attending the oral surgery department and the dental theatre for sedation procedures&#xD;
      at Cork University dentalo school and Hospital and Cork University Hospital will be&#xD;
      prospectively invited to take part. Patients will be randomly assigned to the study group&#xD;
      (standard monitoring and capnography) or control group (standard monitoring and blinded&#xD;
      capnography) . The sedation team will be blinded to the randomisation choice until after&#xD;
      enrolment. A member of staff not directly involved in the study will conduct the&#xD;
      randomisation. There is evidence for utilising intravenous midazolam in the age group 14 to&#xD;
      16years (post pubertal) for dentistry. Including this age cohort ( with parental consent)&#xD;
      will provide additional research data to add to the body of evidence. Patients will have&#xD;
      intravenous sedation with midazolam primarily for the relief of anxiety and to help them to&#xD;
      accept invasive procedures. The operative procedures will range from simple extractions to&#xD;
      minor oral surgery procedures such as the removal of impacted wisdom teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre sedation visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed as to their suitability for sedation at a separate pre sedation&#xD;
      visit Baseline capnography and pulse oximetry data will be collected at this visit. Patients&#xD;
      meeting the inclusion criteria will be given written information about the study. This&#xD;
      information will be written in lay language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment to the study will take place at the beginning of the subsequent treatment visit for&#xD;
      those patients who consent to take part having had time to consider the information provided&#xD;
      about the study at the pre assessment visit. Patients will receive pre sedation instructions.&#xD;
      Standard electronic monitoring (pulse oximetry, pulse rate and blood pressure) will be&#xD;
      available to the clinical staff at all times. Standard dental sedation will be used according&#xD;
      to the institutions policy and protocol. A capnostream 20 monitor ( Oridian medical, Needham,&#xD;
      MA), using a disposable oral - nasal CO2 cannula capable of delivering oxygen, with an oral&#xD;
      sampling port to accommodate mouth breathing will be attached to all patients. The&#xD;
      capnostream 20 monitor displays oximetry and CO2 waveform and calculates ETCO2. The&#xD;
      capnography monitor will be calibrated every day of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous recording of SpO2, Heart rate, ETCO2 and respiratory rate will be stored on a&#xD;
      laptop computer via specialised software for post hoc analysis. In addition, clinical staff&#xD;
      will keep paper records of the patients' age, sex, body mass index, ASA status and medical&#xD;
      history. All patients will be assigned a code to maintain confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study, all clinicians and nursing staff will be trained in the interpretation of&#xD;
      capnography in relation to respiratory depression including waveform interpretation. A&#xD;
      laminated interpretation card will be attached to the monitor as a reminder. The sedation&#xD;
      team will perform conscious sedation according to standard protocol for dental sedation.&#xD;
      Intervention for an adverse event will be based on judgement and clinician expertise with or&#xD;
      without capnography depending on randomisation arm. In the capnography arm,in addition to&#xD;
      standard monitoring, changes in the shape of the capnography waveform, ETCO2 numeric changes&#xD;
      will be considered as triggers to take measures to avoid desaturation. In the control group,&#xD;
      capnography will be blinded by placing an opaque screen over the capnostream 20&#xD;
      capnographydisplay of ETCO2 values, respiratory rate and waveform. Pulse oximetry will&#xD;
      continue to be displayed. Baseline monitoring data will be obtained for at least 2 minutes&#xD;
      prior to the first infusion. Midazolam will be titrated at a rate of one mg per minute to an&#xD;
      end point. Most patients are discharged 60 minutes after the last increment provided they are&#xD;
      fit for discharge. We propose collecting study data until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive written pre and post sedation instructions. the benzodiazepine&#xD;
      antagonist , flumazenil will be available in the sedation suite at all times in addition to&#xD;
      emergency drugs and equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Null hypothesis states: The study group is the same or equal to the control group in&#xD;
      terms of hypoxemia rates i.e arterial oxygen desaturation.&#xD;
