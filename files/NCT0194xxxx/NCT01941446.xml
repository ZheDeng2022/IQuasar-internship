  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin), 3-period, 3-way&#xD;
      crossover thorough QT study, which includes a Screening Period, Treatment Periods (1 through&#xD;
      3), and a Follow-up Visit. Subjects will be confined to the investigational site for 4&#xD;
      nights/3 days during Period 1 and for 3 nights/2 days during Periods 2 and 3. There will be a&#xD;
      minimum of a 14 day washout between treatments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each of the following treatments will be evaluated on Day 1 of each period in a crossover&#xD;
      fashion. The IV eravacycline (TP-434) and IV placebo will be double-blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A: Eravacycline (TP-434) 1.5 mg/kg administered intravenously over 60 minutes&#xD;
           and one placebo oral tablet;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B: Placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) administered intravenously over 60 minutes&#xD;
           and one moxifloxacin 400 mg oral tablet; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment C: Placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) administered intravenously over 60 minutes&#xD;
           and one placebo oral tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to a treatment sequence according to a pre-generated treatment&#xD;
      scheme. Subjects will receive a different treatment during each of the 3 periods.&#xD;
