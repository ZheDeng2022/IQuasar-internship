    <textblock>
      As technologies are advancing quickly in the healthcare setting, new solutions have become&#xD;
      available helping disable people to enhance their ability to communicate. One of these&#xD;
      advances is the introduction of the 'eye gaze system'. Through processing eye movements, this&#xD;
      device allows a person to write, speak, use the Internet and even control systems in the home&#xD;
      or office. In the currently proposed study we aim to evaluate the psychological and&#xD;
      functional effects of using the Tobii™ Eyegaze System by inpatients with tetraplegia who are&#xD;
      unable to use arms and legs and sometimes are not able to talk because of an impaired&#xD;
      respiratory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteering inpatients will be recruited at the National Spinal Injuries Centre. Volunteers&#xD;
      will be instructed and trained to use the Tobii™ Eyegaze System. The number of sessions&#xD;
      required to successfully master the device depends on the learning curve of the patient. The&#xD;
      progress will be documented accordingly. After successful completion of the training and&#xD;
      supervised use, the inpatients will be offered the Tobii™ Eyegaze System for unsupervised&#xD;
      use, 4 hours a week, for the following 2 months. It is hypothesised that using the Tobii™&#xD;
      Eyegaze System by inpatients with tetraplegia results in improved disability perception and&#xD;
      independence scores. For the current feasibility study 12 participants will be recruited and&#xD;
      assessed for 'Appraisal of Disability', 'Mood', 'Assistive Technology perception' and&#xD;
      'eyeskills' to instruct the computer system. Positive study outcomes will encourage future&#xD;
      studies of the role of the Tobii™ Eyegaze System in both a rehabilitation and home&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
