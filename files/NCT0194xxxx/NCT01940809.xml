      This randomized phase I trial studies the side effects and best way to give ipilimumab with&#xD;
      or without dabrafenib, trametinib and/or nivolumab in treating patients with melanoma that&#xD;
      has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      cancer cells to grow and spread. Dabrafenib and trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells&#xD;
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether&#xD;
      ipilimumab works better with or without dabrafenib, trametinib, and/or nivolumab in treating&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ipilimumab (part 1) or ipilimumab plus&#xD;
      nivolumab (part 2) following lead-in of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF)&#xD;
      and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors, either alone or in combination,&#xD;
      in patients with BRAFV600 mutant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the response rate to ipilimumab (part 1) or ipilimumab plus nivolumab (part&#xD;
      2) after BRAF and MEK inhibitors, either alone or in combination, compared to no prior kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of dabrafenib and trametinib combination in the&#xD;
      setting of prior ipilimumab alone or ipilimumab preceded by BRAF and MEK inhibitors, either&#xD;
      alone or in combination (part 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the safety and tolerability of dabrafenib and trametinib combination in the&#xD;
      setting of prior ipilimumab plus nivolumab without prior BRAF/MEK inhibition or ipilimumab&#xD;
      plus nivolumab preceded by BRAF and MEK inhibitors, either alone or in combination (part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the response rate to dabrafenib and trametinib in the setting of prior&#xD;
      ipilimumab alone or ipilimumab preceded by BRAF and MEK inhibitors, either alone or in&#xD;
      combination (part 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the response rate to dabrafenib and trametinib in the setting of prior&#xD;
      ipilimumab plus nivolumab without prior MEK/BRAF inhibition or prior ipilimumab plus&#xD;
      nivolumab preceded by BRAF/MEK inhibitors (part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To obtain peripheral blood and tumor tissue for biomarker analysis. VII. To describe the&#xD;
      immune impact of kinase inhibitor therapy on the immune response associated with ipilimumab&#xD;
      treatment (part 1) or ipilimumab plus nivolumab treatment (part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms for Part 2 (Part 1 closed to&#xD;
      accrual 8/25/2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 1: (Closed to accrual as of 8/25/2015) ARM A1: Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO)&#xD;
      twice daily (BID) and trametinib PO once daily (QD) for 25 days. Patients then receive&#xD;
      ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes. Treatment with ipilimumab repeats every 3&#xD;
      weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B1: Patients receive trametinib PO QD for 25 days. Patients then receive ipilimumab IV&#xD;
      over 90 minutes. Treatment with ipilimumab repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C1: Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID for 25 days. Patients then receive ipilimumab IV&#xD;
      over 90 minutes. Treatment with ipilimumab repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM D1: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A2: Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID and trametinib PO QD for 25 days followed by&#xD;
      nivolumab IV over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes every 3 weeks for 4 doses,&#xD;
      followed by nivolumab monotherapy IV every 2 weeks continuously for up to 42 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B2: Patients receive trametinib PO QD for 25 days followed by nivolumab IV over 60&#xD;
      minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab&#xD;
      monotherapy IV every 2 weeks continuously for up to 42 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C2: Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID for 25 days followed by nivolumab IV over 60&#xD;
      minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab&#xD;
      monotherapy IV every 2 weeks continuously for up to 42 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM D2: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes every&#xD;
      3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab monotherapy IV every 2 weeks continuously for up&#xD;
      to 42 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 12 weeks of treatment with ipilimumab, or ipilimumab and nivolumab followed by&#xD;
      nivolumab monotherapy, all patients may continue to receive dabrafenib PO BID and trametinib&#xD;
      PO QD in the absence of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 14 weeks.&#xD;
