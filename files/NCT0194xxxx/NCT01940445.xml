  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At least thirty (30) subjects, Fitzpatrick-Goldman Skin Type II-V will be enrolled in 2&#xD;
      clinical sites; each clinic will enroll at least 15 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects should present visible wrinkles and/or elastosis requiring treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The SST will improve the appearance of the wrinkles/elastosis as well as general&#xD;
      skin tone by at least 25% as compared to M22 ResurFX 1565nm module alone, for at least 75% of&#xD;
      the subjects.&#xD;
