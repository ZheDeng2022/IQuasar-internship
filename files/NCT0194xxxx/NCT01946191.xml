      This randomized trial tested the hypothesis that there would be an incremental benefit of&#xD;
      personalized coaching and PCP support in an EHR-based intervention designed to help primary&#xD;
      care patients maintain recent intentional weight loss of at least 5%.&#xD;

      MAINTAIN-pc (Maintaining Activity and Nutrition through Technology-Assisted Innovation in&#xD;
      Primary Care) was a randomized trial conducted in coordination with practices affiliated with&#xD;
      the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). Participants were recruited between&#xD;
      October 2013 and February 2015, and follow-up was completed in March 2017. The University of&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board approved the study, and all participants provided&#xD;
      written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomly assigned to EHR tools (tracking group) versus EHR tools plus&#xD;
      coaching (coaching group). The EHR tools included weight, diet, and physical activity&#xD;
      tracking flow sheets; standardized surveys; and reminders. Participants in the coaching group&#xD;
      received 2 years of personalized health coaching through the EHR patient portal. Three study&#xD;
      coaches had backgrounds in nursing, nutrition, and exercise physiology. The other 2 received&#xD;
      EHR training, and all received training on the study protocol. Participants were assigned to&#xD;
      a specific coach, who contacted the participants via the EHR weekly for 1 month, biweekly in&#xD;
      months 2 to 6, monthly in months 7 to 12, and quarterly in months 13 to 24, for a total of 24&#xD;
      scheduled contacts. Coaching group participants received brief questionnaires relevant to&#xD;
      weight management, including a text field where they could discuss questions or barriers. On&#xD;
      the basis of participant responses and self-monitoring data in the EHR flow sheets, coaches&#xD;
      wrote a brief personalized note with advice on questionnaire topics and responses to any&#xD;
      queries or barriers mentioned by the participant. Coaching participants who did not complete&#xD;
      questionnaires or log information into the flow sheet for 2 weeks were considered inactive&#xD;
      and were contacted by telephone or e-mail and invited to reengage at any time. Coaching&#xD;
      participants were able to send secure messages to the coach. Tracking group participants&#xD;
      received questionnaires related to general health promotion (for example, vaccines) each&#xD;
      quarter but received no feedback on questionnaire responses or flow sheet entries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referring PCPs of coaching group participants received regular support, including real-time&#xD;
      progress reports with counseling tips delivered via the EHR, notification of weight change in&#xD;
      increments of at least 10 pounds, and annual progress reports at 12 and 24 months. The&#xD;
      progress reports were developed using feedback from PCPs and consisted of a 1-page summary of&#xD;
      participant weight (current, trajectory, and goal), status in the program (active or&#xD;
      inactive), use of study flow sheets (with data if available), and brief subjective comments&#xD;
      from the coach. Reports were delivered to the PCP via the EHR within 48 hours before&#xD;
      scheduled office visits. An electronic copy was also sent to the participant. Referring PCPs&#xD;
      of tracking group participants received annual progress reports at 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
      Information about the development of the intervention and the coaching protocol has been&#xD;
      published previously&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was initially designed to be a 36-month intervention, with the primary outcome&#xD;
      defined as weight change at 36 months. Delays in EHR build and recruitment resulted in a&#xD;
      decision after enrollment was completed to shorten the intervention to 24 months, with&#xD;
      24-month weight change as the revised primary outcome. In addition, we added an exploratory&#xD;
      30-month weight outcome to assess the duration of effect after the intervention ended. An&#xD;
      updated institutional review board protocol (with revised consent) was approved on 25&#xD;
      September 2015. These changes were made before any data were analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the result section, we are reporting all pre-specified outcomes unintentionally omitted in&#xD;
      the original ClinicalTrials submission.&#xD;

        <description>Physical Component score, Estimate (SE) [95% CI] The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
