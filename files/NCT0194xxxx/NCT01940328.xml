      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the lung Doppler signals in left HF patients with&#xD;
      and without pulmonary congestion (i.e. decompensated left HF patients and compensated left HF&#xD;
      patients respectively), in comparison to a control group of subjects without CHF (non-CHF&#xD;
      controls), in order to determine the diagnostic value of this non-invasive method in CHF. If&#xD;
      this method will prove to be of diagnostic value, it could potentially be used to diagnose&#xD;
      and monitor CHF patients in both inpatient and outpatient settings.&#xD;

      Study Participants A total of 150 patients will be recruited for this study over a span of 18&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into 3 subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acute decompensated left heart failure- Patients are eligible for enrollment if they&#xD;
           presented to the emergency department within the previous few hours with acute pulmonary&#xD;
           congestion or pulmonary edema, diagnosed on the basis of all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Dyspnea at rest or with minimal activity&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Rales on auscultation&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Evidence of pulmonary congestion or edema on chest X-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. BNP level &gt;400 pg/ml This subgroup will be recruited in the emergency medicine&#xD;
                department (EMD) following initial treatment and stabilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compensated left heart failure - Patients with significant stable left HF (NYHA II-III)&#xD;
           who are on optimal medical treatment for CHF and are without clinical or laboratory&#xD;
           evidence of pulmonary congestion (i.e. patients without dyspnea at rest, without rales&#xD;
           on auscultation and with BNP levels &lt; 100 pg/ml). This subgroup will be recruited among&#xD;
           inpatients and/or outpatients at the Rambam campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Non-CHF controls (patients without CHF and without uncontrolled hypertension). This&#xD;
           subgroup will be recruited among inpatients and/or outpatients at the Rambam health care&#xD;
           campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the compensated left HF patients and the non-CHF controls, measurements will be done once&#xD;
      following inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the decompensated left HF patients, several measurements will be conducted, both&#xD;
      following inclusion (at the EMD) and each day during hospitalization (at the internal&#xD;
      medicine department).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements following inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, all eligible&#xD;
      patients will undergo physical examination including weight, vital signs (blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate, respiratory rate, O2 saturation by pulse oximetry) and a full assessment of CHF&#xD;
      status by physical examination (lung auscultation, assessment of leg edema, weight, JVP&#xD;
      etc.). (See figure 2). An ECG recording will be performed and a blood test for BNP will be&#xD;
      drawn for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the assessment of dyspnea, decompensated left HF patients will be asked to indicate their&#xD;
      level of dyspnea on a visual analogue scale (3) and/or a 7-points categorical Likert scale&#xD;
      (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest X-ray: Decompensated patients will undergo chest X ray (CXR) as part of the regular&#xD;
      evaluation in the EMD. The 2 other subgroups will undergo CXR only if a recent CXR (&lt;6&#xD;
      months) is not available, or if clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography: an attempt will be made to perform echocardiography in the EMD for all&#xD;
      decompensated patients who are in sinus rhythm, including a full diastolic assessment.&#xD;
      However, due to the limited availability of the echocardiography service, not all patients&#xD;
      will undergo echo at the EMD and therefore this examination is considered optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent (&lt;6 months) echocardiography is required for the 2 other subgroups. If a recent echo&#xD;
      is not available, a new one will be done as close as possible to inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung Doppler signals will be recorded in sitting position from selected locations over the&#xD;
      right chest wall. If the subject is unable to sit in a chair, the headrest of the patient's&#xD;
      bed will be tilted upwards to about 45 degrees. Regarding the decompensated left HF patients,&#xD;
      the first measurement of LDS will take place as soon as possible after admission to the&#xD;
      emergency medicine department, providing the patient has been adequately treated and&#xD;
      stabilized and is willing and able to sign an informed consent form. The LDS measurement will&#xD;
      be repeated twice more at the EMD at 1 hour intervals. LDS will be recorded only once for the&#xD;
      compensated patients and the non-CHF controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up measurements during hospitalization (decompensated patients only) During their&#xD;
      hospital stay in the internal medicine department, decompensated left HF patients will repeat&#xD;
      part of the former study measurements.&#xD;
