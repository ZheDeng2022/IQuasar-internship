  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of brain metastases (BM) in metastatic breast cancer is increasing, due to the&#xD;
      improvement in the control of systemic disease, and due to an improved detection through&#xD;
      imagery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment management of single BM remains controversial. Indeed, even though it is widely&#xD;
      accepted that local treatment increases the median survival time in patients having a good&#xD;
      prognostic status, the adding of &quot;adjuvant&quot; whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is currently&#xD;
      subject to controversy, due to its potential toxicity. Yet, two randomized trials have&#xD;
      demonstrated a clear increase in intra-cerebral recurrence and in death from neurologic&#xD;
      origin in case of absence of &quot;adjuvant&quot; WBRT, without change in overall survival (but overall&#xD;
      survival was not a primary endpoint in any of these studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from literature on cognitive toxicity (CT) of WBRT on BM are scarce and sometimes&#xD;
      controversial. CT of WBRT affects the subcortical frontal functions. It is postulated that&#xD;
      the alteration of hippocampal neurogenesis (mainly due to inflammation process), situated in&#xD;
      the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, has an essential role in the development of these&#xD;
      brain dysfunctions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that the incidence of BM in the hippocampal region (hippocampus + 5mm&#xD;
      expansion) is low, in the range of 8,6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New irradiation techniques, in particular intensity-modulated radiotherapy associated with&#xD;
      rotational radiotherapy, allow to modulate the dose on an intra-cerebral structure, all the&#xD;
      while distributing an adapted dose to the remaining brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized study, will compare, through a battery of neuropsychological&#xD;
      tests, the cognitive impact of WBRT of 40 Gy in 20 fractions with or without hippocampal&#xD;
      avoidance by intensity modulated radiotherapy, in patients presenting with a single operated&#xD;
      brain metastasis of breast cancer. If the hippocampal avoidance leads to a significant&#xD;
      improvement in cognitive function, this radiotherapy scheme could become the standard&#xD;
      postoperative treatment to be proposed to patients presenting the best prognostic factors.&#xD;
      This would allow to prevent long-term cognitive deficit, while preserving WBRT benefit on&#xD;
      intra-cerebral control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of evaluation criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation criteria to assess cognitive toxicity have been selected on the basis of the&#xD;
      recommendations from C. Meyers and P. Brown, who propose an adapted test battery to evaluate&#xD;
      memory, verbal function, visual and motor coordination, and executive function. The selected&#xD;
      tests have been validated, also in French. They comprise HVLT-R (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test&#xD;
      Revised), COWAT (Controlled Oral Word Association Test), Grooved Pegboard test, TMT A and B&#xD;
      (Trailmaking tests A and B), and MMSE. The calculation of patient numbers was based on the&#xD;
      HVLT-R test, as memory is thought to be the most frequently affected domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tests will be performed before treatment (&quot;baseline&quot; cognitive function), at 4 months and&#xD;
      at 12 months. In case of a missing answer to the evaluation tests, the reason(s) for not&#xD;
      answering will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life : QLQ-C30, QLQ-BN20, ADL, IADL Intra-cerebral Progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      Overall survival.&#xD;
