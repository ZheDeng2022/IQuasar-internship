  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a head injury, many people find that exposure to light causes them increased&#xD;
      discomfort. By measuring how the pupil in the eye constricts to flashes of red and blue&#xD;
      light, this study will investigate whether this phenomenon is due to a change in the eye's&#xD;
      sensitivity to light.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pupils inside the eyes constrict in response to light stimulation. Different classes of&#xD;
      cells within the human retina initiate this response. Recent research suggests that one of&#xD;
      the ganglion cell types involved in this pupil response also plays a role in the photophobia&#xD;
      experienced by migraine sufferers. The main aim of this study is to determine whether this&#xD;
      type of ganglion cell becomes 'hypersensitive' after traumatic brain injury, thereby&#xD;
      contributing to symptoms of increased photosensitivity experienced by many of these&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first session of this study, subjects will be asked questions about their sensitivity&#xD;
      to light and the reaction of their eyes' pupils to flashing red and blue lights will be&#xD;
      measured. The subjects will be given a full eye examination to rule out other causes of&#xD;
      increased photosensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some cases, subjects will be asked to attend a second session roughly two weeks later.&#xD;
      They will be asked to wear a watch that measures their daily activity/sleep rhythms and light&#xD;
      exposure during this inter-session period. During the second session, further testing of the&#xD;
      pupil responses to blue and red flickering light will be performed.&#xD;
