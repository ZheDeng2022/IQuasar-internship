      This is a European multinational, multicenter, non-interventional (observational) and&#xD;
      prospective study. It is carried on to confirm in real life conditions the benefit/risk of&#xD;
      vandetanib (CAPRELSA™) 300 mg, both in RET negative and RET positive patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic, aggressive, sporadic, unresectable, locally advanced/metastatic MTC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicenter, non-interventional (observational) and prospective&#xD;
      study. European countries where vandetanib is on the market will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted to fulfil the specific obligation post-authorisation measure&#xD;
      for the conditional marketing authorisation. It is carried on to confirm in real life&#xD;
      conditions the benefit/risk of vandetanib (CAPRELSA™) 300 mg, both in RET negative and RET&#xD;
      positive patients with symptomatic, aggressive, sporadic, unresectable, locally&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic MTC. The clinical benefit of vandetanib (CAPRELSA™) 300 mg has previously&#xD;
      been established in a clinical trial (Study 58) on the basis of a clinically and&#xD;
      statistically significant advantage in progression free survival (PFS) which was supported by&#xD;
      a high response rate and substantial duration of response.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Signed informed consent 2. Male or female aged 18 years or above 3. Histological&#xD;
        diagnosis of MTC 4. Patients with symptomatic and aggressive sporadic MTC, who have&#xD;
        unresectable, locally advanced/metastatic disease. (The factors considered by the&#xD;
        investigator to determine a patient's disease to be symptomatic and aggressive will be&#xD;
        recorded in the CRF). 5. Measurable disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  assessment confirmed within the 12 weeks previous to start of treatment, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  defined according to RECIST 1.1: at least one lesion, not irradiated, that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured as ≥10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must&#xD;
             have short axis ≥15 mm) with CT or MRI and which is suitable for accurate repeated&#xD;
             measurements. Measurable lesions with calcifications should not be assessed as target&#xD;
             lesions unless no other measurable lesion is available. 6. Known definite RET mutation&#xD;
             status (definition according to section 3.2). The status should be:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  for patients prescribed with vandetanib: positive or negative&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  for patients not prescribed with vandetanib: negative RET mutation status must be&#xD;
             determined from a tumour sample obtained within 18 months prior to enrollment. It is&#xD;
             strongly recommended that a tissue sample obtained within 6 months prior to enrolment&#xD;
             is used. 7. For patients newly prescribed vandetanib 300 mg, the prescription should&#xD;
             be issued according to marketing authorisation and following the vandetanib Summary of&#xD;
             Product Characteristics (SmPC) (Appendix B). The starting dose could be reduced to 200&#xD;
             mg in patients with moderate renal impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Current or planned inclusion/participation in a clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Patients already receiving vandetanib or who have received vandetanib for&#xD;
                       their MTC before the study first visit&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Contraindications according to the vandetanib SmPC (not applicable for&#xD;
                       patients who do not receive vandetanib): (a) Patients with a QT interval&#xD;
                       corrected for heart rate (QTc) interval over 480 msec: (i) Congenital long&#xD;
                       QT syndrome (ii) Concomitant use of vandetanib with the following medicinal&#xD;
                       products known to also prolong the QT interval and / or induce Torsades de&#xD;
                       pointes: Arsenic, cisapride, erythromycin intravenous (IV), toremifene,&#xD;
                       mizolastine, moxifloxacin, Class I A and III antiarrhythmics (b) Currently&#xD;
                       pregnant or breast feeding (c) Hypersensitivity to the active substance or&#xD;
                       to any of the excipients (d) Severe renal impairment: creatinine clearance &lt;&#xD;
                       30 ml/minute calculated by Cockcroft-Gault formula. (See Appendix D). (e)&#xD;
                       Serum bilirubin greater than 1.5 x the upper limit of reference range (ULRR)&#xD;
