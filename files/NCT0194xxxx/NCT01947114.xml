      Purpose: In this study we wanted to compare bolus propofol and ketamine as an adjuvant to&#xD;
      remifentanil-based total intravenous anesthesia for pediatric rigid bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: Forty children under 12 years of age scheduled for rigid bronchoscopy&#xD;
      were included. After midazolam premedication, remifentanil infusion 1 µg/kg/min was started&#xD;
      and patients were randomly allocated to receive either propofol (Group P) or ketamine (Group&#xD;
      K) and mivacurium for muscle relaxation. Anesthesia was maintained with remifentanil infusion&#xD;
      1 µg/kg/min and bolus doses of propofol or ketamine. After rigid bronchoscopy remifentanil&#xD;
      0.05 µg/kg/min was maintained until extubation. Hemodynamic parameters, emergence&#xD;
      characteristics and adverse events were evaluated.&#xD;

      After approval by Institutional Ethics Committee and obtaining informed consent of parents,&#xD;
      40 consecutive children under 12 years who were scheduled to have RB for diagnostic&#xD;
      (suspected foreign body aspiration, bronchoalveolar lavage) and/or therapeutic purposes&#xD;
      (removal of foreign bodies and/or mucus plugs) were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting time before induction of anesthesia was at least 6 hours for solid food and 4 hours&#xD;
      for clear liquids. Before admission to the preoperative holding area, a local anesthetic&#xD;
      cream was applied to the insertion site and IV catheterization was performed. Midazolam (0.05&#xD;
      mg/kg) was given intravenously just before admission to the operating room. Pulse oximetry&#xD;
      (SpO2), ECG and non-invasive blood pressure were monitored. Before induction all children&#xD;
      were pre-oxygenated and a crystalloid infusion 10 mg/kg/h was started. Children were randomly&#xD;
      allocated to one of two groups according to sealed envelopes. After a second dose of IV&#xD;
      midazolam 0.05 mg/kg, remifentanil infusion 1 µg/kg/min was started. During the 1st minute of&#xD;
      remifentanil infusion, propofol 2-4 mg/kg, including lidocaine 1 mg/mL for injection pain&#xD;
      (Group P) or ketamine 2-3 mg/kg (Group K) was administered. When adequate mask ventilation&#xD;
      was ensured, mivacurium 0.15 mg/kg was administered for muscle relaxation and RB was begun at&#xD;
      the 4-5th minute of remifentanil infusion. Depth of anesthesia was assessed clinically by&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, blood pressure), movement, coughing, bucking, lacrimation&#xD;
      and sweating. Additional doses of propofol (0.5-1 mg/kg) or ketamine (0.25-0.5 mg/kg), with&#xD;
      or without mivacurium (0.025-0.05 mg/kg, according to the course of bronchoscopy) were given&#xD;
      when inadequate depth of anesthesia was considered. Remifentanil infusion 1 µg/kg/min was&#xD;
      maintained throughout the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were manually ventilated with a 'T' piece connected to the side arm of the rigid&#xD;
      bronchoscope. The fresh gas flow was adjusted to 6-10 L/min. In case of major air leakage,&#xD;
      oxygen flush valve was used for adequate filling of the reservoir bag while airway pressure&#xD;
      limit was adjusted to 20-30 cmH2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After bronchoscopy, endotracheal intubation was performed, manually controlled or assisted&#xD;
      ventilation with 4-8 cmH2O PEEP and 50% oxygen in air was performed. Tracheal and oral&#xD;
      secretions were suctioned as needed and the patients were turned to the lateral decubitus&#xD;
      position for recovery. After being placed in the recovery position, no further stimulation&#xD;
      was allowed except gentle suctioning of oral secretions and for a smooth extubation&#xD;
      remifentanil infusion was decreased to 0.05 µg/kg/min and continued until just before&#xD;
      extubation. When patients began to demonstrate emergence from anesthesia by displaying a&#xD;
      regular respiratory pattern, facial grimacing or purposeful movement, trachea was extubated.&#xD;
      In cases of breath-holding and arterial oxygen desaturation, assisted or controlled mask&#xD;
      ventilation was performed. Pure oxygen was administered via the mask in order to maintain&#xD;
      SpO2 above 94%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive blood pressure was measured before induction as a baseline value, after induction&#xD;
      (just before laryngoscopy) and in 3 minutes of interval during rigid bronchoscopy.&#xD;
      Hypotension was defined as a systolic blood pressure lower than 60 mmHg for children under 2&#xD;
      years and 70 mmHg for children 2-12 years old. Hypotension was treated with an increase in IV&#xD;
      crystalloid infusion and two consecutive measures of hypotension treated with ephedrine and a&#xD;
      decrease in remifentanil infusion. Bradycardia was defined as a heart rate slower than 80&#xD;
      beats/min for infants and 60 beats/min for older children (11) and treated with atropine 0.01&#xD;
      mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SpO2 values below 90% were defined as hypoxemia. The severity of hypoxemia was graded as mild&#xD;
      (SpO2: 80-89%), moderate (SpO2: 70-79%) or severe (SpO2&lt;70%). Coughing or respiratory effort&#xD;
      (diaphragm movement) and limb movement during laryngoscopy and rigid bronchoscopy was graded&#xD;
      as mild (minor movement that does not effect surgical comfort), moderate (effect surgical&#xD;
      comfort) or severe (the bronchoscope has to be removed or any complication) by the&#xD;
      endoscopist. Postoperative severe restlessness and disorientation with purposeless activity&#xD;
      were defined as emergence agitation. All adverse events were recorded by an independent&#xD;
      observer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study was performed with the technique used for the Group P. Power analysis showed&#xD;
      that a minimum sample size of 40 patients (20 in each group) was required to detect a 20%&#xD;
      change in arterial pressures at a power level of 90% with p&lt;0.05. Categorical variables and&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U Test and repeated-measures Anova&#xD;
      respectively. Comparison of the incidence of the outcomes between the two groups was analyzed&#xD;
      by a two-tailed Fisher's exact test. Statistical significance was defined as p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
