  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this double blind study is to determine whether topical 15% AS101 gel is&#xD;
      effective and safe as compared to vehicle in the treatment of external genital warts in&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Females with external genital warts who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated in a blinded manner in 1:1 ratio to one of the 2 following study arms: (1) AS101&#xD;
      15% gel or (2) Vehicle. The patients will apply the study drug at home once daily (overnight)&#xD;
      until complete clearance of external genital warts or for up to 14 weeks (98 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During therapy all patients will return to the clinic every 2 weeks plus/minus 3 days of the&#xD;
      treatment visit for clinical assessments of the treated area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 6 of treatment the investigator will evaluate the treated area for all patients. If&#xD;
      the investigator determines that there is no change in the disease spread area or lesion&#xD;
      number compared to Day 1, study therapy is to be discontinued prior to 14 weeks (98 days) of&#xD;
      treatment and the patient will be considered as not cleared. Last observation carried forward&#xD;
      (LOCF) method will be used to analyze such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who at week 6 were evaluated by the investigator to have a change in the disease&#xD;
      spread area or lesion number compared to Day 1, will continue treatment until complete&#xD;
      clearance of warts or up to a maximum of 14 weeks (98 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were evaluated during any of the treatment visits with complete clearance will&#xD;
      stop to apply the study therapy, continue to be followed once per 4 weeks for 84 days (12&#xD;
      weeks) for safety and recurrence evaluation. Patients who completed treatment with partial&#xD;
      clearance or patients who discontinued for reasons of other than complete clearance will be&#xD;
      followed 28 days after discontinuation for disease progression and reference to other therapy&#xD;
      if was recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should significant irritation or any other skin adverse reaction occur during the treatment&#xD;
      period, study therapy may be held for up to 7 consecutive days on up to two separate&#xD;
      occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unblinding: Patients will be revealed as to the nature of their treatment only after all&#xD;
      patients have completed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of pregnancy or related serious adverse event the nature of the treatment will be&#xD;
      revealed to the patient prior to end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigator determines that there is a disease progression in total lesion number or&#xD;
      infected wart area size of the Day 1 treated area, study therapy is to be discontinued prior&#xD;
      to 98 days of treatment.&#xD;
