  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of aerobic exercise training during and&#xD;
      after chemotherapy for women who have recently been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be instructed to self-report the session information to ExOnc staff at&#xD;
      or before their next scheduled visit. If the participant's next scheduled visit is greater&#xD;
      than 72 hours following an unsupervised session, ExOnc staff may reach out to the participant&#xD;
      to retrieve the session information. Unsupervised session details will be source documented&#xD;
      by ExOnc staff.&#xD;

    <description>The ultimate goal is for participants to complete approximately 3 exercise sessions week of non-linear aerobic training an intensity of at 55% to 100% of the individually determined exercise capacity VO2peak), concurrent with chemotherapy. VO2peak will be determined by the CPET performed at baseline. The weekly exercise will be achieved via 3 individual aerobic training sessions ranging from approximately 20-45 min/session. All sessions are required to be supervised unless otherwise specified by EP discretion.</description>

    <description>The ultimate goal is for participants to complete approximately 3 exercise sessions week of non-linear aerobic training at an intensity 55% to 100% of the individually determined exercise capacity (VO2peak), after the completion of chemotherapy. VO2peak will be determined by the CPET performed at midpoint, or pre-surgery for neoadjuvant patients. For patients receiving adjuvant therapy, (except those who have additional surgery after chemotherapy), the aerobic training intervention must begin within 2 weeks of the patient's midpoint CPET. For patients receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy and have additional surgery after chemotherapy, the aerobic training intervention will begin within approximately 6 weeks of surgery, per the discretion of the treating physician. The weekly exercise will be achieved via 3 individual aerobic training sessions ranging from approximately 20-45 min/session. All sessions are required to be supervised unless otherwise specified by EP discretion.</description>

For patients receiving adjuvant therapy (except those who have additional surgery after chemotherapy), VO2peak will be determined by the CPETs performed at baseline and midpoint.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients will receive a home-based, general physical activity program. Specifically, all patients assigned to general physical activity will receive an initial, consultation with a staff exercise physiologist outlining a structured home-based aerobic walking program with a goal up to 150 minutes per week outside of their normal daily activity. Patients can be provided with a fitness tracker (e.g. FitBit) to evaluate exercise duration and intensity. Patients may also be provided with an exercise log to record type, duration, and average heart rate during sessions. The exercise log is provided as a guidance tool and may be, although is not required to be, returned to study staff. Staff exercise physiologists will contact patients to check progress, and answer questions.</description>

    <description>Patients that elect supervised home based training platform or plan to complete unsupervised training sessions will receive a study kit which includes a heart rate monitor, blood pressure cuff, treadmill and tablet to complete aerobic training requirements. The study kit will be given to the patient upon completion of their baseline testing. The treadmill will be shipped to the patient's home and coordinated by the Ex Onc group. The treadmills are MSK owned equipment that will be deployed to the patient's homes via the vendor TechnoGym. A member of Ex Onc will provide an orientation session for the patient to set up all study kit items. If there is a delay in the patient receiving the treadmill , or any other unforeseen circumstance, patients may be assigned a temporary unsupervised training program until the treadmill is delivered.</description>
