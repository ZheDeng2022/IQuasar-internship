  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We need human blood to understand the immune response to infection and to test promising new&#xD;
      vaccines against infectious diseases in the laboratory. One test is called the Serum&#xD;
      Bactericidal Assay (or SBA), which is measure of how effective antibodies are at killing&#xD;
      certain bacteria and can be an important measure of how effective a new vaccine may be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples would be used in the laboratory analysis of clinical trials of vaccines used in&#xD;
      adults and children, and some samples in pre-clinical (animal) experiments testing new&#xD;
      vaccines before they enter human-stage testing. Most people have some form of protection&#xD;
      against most bacteria already, so not everyone is a suitable blood donor for this laboratory&#xD;
      test. We therefore start by taking a small blood sample and test this one before asking for&#xD;
      more blood if we found yours suitable for the work we do.&#xD;
