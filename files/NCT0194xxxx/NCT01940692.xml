      Through a randomized controlled trial, we will compare the intravenous administration of&#xD;
      tranexamic acid with the intra-articular application after a total hip arthroplasty through&#xD;
      direct anterior approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RCT, prospective study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Academic-monocentric study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical outcome measurements The postoperative blood loss will be the primary outcome.&#xD;
           Secondary outcomes are&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The rate of perioperative and postoperative blood transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The number of blood units transfused&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Perioperative given intravenous isotonic fluid&#xD;

      Study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical application of tranexamic acid compared to the intravenous administration in total&#xD;
      hip arthroplasty with the direct anterior approach A prospective, randomized, clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers: B. Jacobs and Dr. S. Ghijselings Supervisors: Dr. R. Driesen, Dr. M. Beran, Dr.&#xD;
      R. Heylen Co√∂rdinerend supervisor: Prof dr. K. Corten&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of total hip arthroplasty (THA) is increasing and the accompanied blood loss&#xD;
      cannot be overlooked. In 2007, 17,347 patients underwent THA in Belgium and that number grows&#xD;
      every year by an average of 2.9%. The average amount of blood loss associated with THA was&#xD;
      ranging from 1000 to 2000mL. Therefore the substantial perioperative blood loss frequently&#xD;
      necessitates blood transfusion. Although complications have decreased, morbidity and high&#xD;
      costs due to blood transfusion still exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid blood transfusion after THA, tranexamic acid (TXA) can be administered. TXA, a&#xD;
      synthetic amino acid that blocks the lysine binding sites on plasminogen in a competitive&#xD;
      way, is an antifibrinolytic agent. TXA can be administered intravenously or intra-articular.&#xD;
      The ideal method of providing TXA remains topic of debate. Several studies have proven that&#xD;
      intravenous application reduces blood loss and the need for blood transfusion in patients&#xD;
      undergoing THA . In contrast, after intravenous administration only a small percentage of the&#xD;
      drug reaches the target location, the rest distributes across the whole body. Hence the risk&#xD;
      of possible side effects after intravenous administration, like thromboembolic events and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal complaints, theoretically is greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local application of TXA could get around these possible systemic side effects. The benefit&#xD;
      of topical application of TXA has been proven for dental surgery, cardiac surgery, spine&#xD;
      surgery and total knee arthroplasty. In a case-control study, Van Elst et al (20) recently&#xD;
      proved that local application of TXA after THA reduces total bleeding by 100 to 380 mL in&#xD;
      comparison to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null - Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will compare the efficacy of intra-articular application of TXA to the&#xD;
      intravenous administration in terms of postoperative blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that there is no significant difference in postoperative blood loss between&#xD;
      intra-articular and intravenous administration of TXA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      What:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Power analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RCT, prospective study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monocentric study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical outcome measurements Each patient will give written consent for inclusion in&#xD;
           the study. This prospective, single-centered, randomized clinical trial is designed to&#xD;
           enroll a total of 120 patients who meet the inclusion criteria, with approximate 60&#xD;
           patients in each group. Patients are allocated to a) intravenous application of TXA or&#xD;
           b) intra-articular administration of TXA, with use of a computer-generated randomization&#xD;
           table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adults (patients over the age of eighteen years) who were scheduled for a primary&#xD;
      unilateral total hip arthroplasty due to osteoarthritis at Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg, Genk,&#xD;
      Belgium are eligible for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient is excluded from the study if he or she has a history of coagulopathy, allergy to&#xD;
      tranexamic acid, preoperative anemia, fibrinolytic disorders, history of arterial or venous&#xD;
      thromboembolic disease, disturbances of color vision, pregnancy, breastfeeding, major&#xD;
      comorbidities and participation in another clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a blood sample, preoperative hemoglobin level will be measured. This hemoglobin level is&#xD;
      used to calculate postoperative blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal anesthesia will be given to all patients and standard monitoring will be used during&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two orthopedic surgeons (K.C. and R.D.) participated in this study. Both surgeons use the&#xD;
      same surgical technique, the direct anterior approach (DAA). The type of prosthesis used will&#xD;
      be based on the surgeon's preference and patient age, activity level and demands. All&#xD;
      implants are cementless and a surgical drain is placed to collect the postoperative blood&#xD;
      loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whenever intraoperative surgical, medical, or anesthetic complications occur, TXA will not be&#xD;
      administered and the patient will be excluded from the study. Prophylaxis antibiotic, 2g of&#xD;
      cephalosporin, will be intravenously administered right before the intervention and this is&#xD;
      repeated three times within 24 hours over a constant time interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tranexamic acid procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure the double-blinding upset of this study, the 60 patients from the control group&#xD;
      receive a solution of 1.5g TXA in 100ml 0.9%NaCl, administered intravenously before closure&#xD;
      of the incision. A dose of 3g TXA is applied intra-articular to the other group of 60&#xD;
      patients. The intra-articular injection is applied after THA, when the wound already has been&#xD;
      closed. Two hours after wound closing, the surgical drain will be opened. The two hour wait&#xD;
      after wound closing is proven most successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative applied prophylaxis and early mobilization will be used to prevent deep-vein&#xD;
      thrombosis (DVT). The administered prophylaxis include daily low molecular weight heparin&#xD;
      until six weeks after surgery. While in the hospital, patients will be examined daily for any&#xD;
      clinical symptoms of DVT. Patients also receive compressive stockings to wear after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative hemoglobin levels are measured at the first and the fourth day postoperative.&#xD;
      All patients remained in the hospital for a minimum of 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the postoperative blood loss. The difference between total blood loss&#xD;
      and intraoperative blood loss is used to predict the postoperative blood loss for each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The rate of perioperative and postoperative blood transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The number of blood units transfused&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Perioperative given intravenous isotonic fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criterion for the transfusion of blood products is a hemoglobin level of &lt;8.0 g/dL if the&#xD;
      patient developed intolerable symptoms of anemia or any comorbidities that may have been&#xD;
      related to anemia and was not attributable to another cause or ongoing blood loss was&#xD;
      occurring. If transfusion is necessary, the amount of units of packed red blood cells is&#xD;
      estimated according to the hemoglobin level or the severity of symptoms with the intention to&#xD;
      increase the hemoglobin level to 8.0 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive a detailed brochure with information concerning the study procedure&#xD;
      and a written informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can decline the offer for participation in the study. In that case these patients&#xD;
      shall get treatment as proposed. Patients that accept to participate are randomized to either&#xD;
      the group of intravenous administration or intra-articular administration of tranexamic acid.&#xD;
      These patients will receive a number and will be randomly assigned to either the intravenous&#xD;
      or intra-articular group by computer.&#xD;
