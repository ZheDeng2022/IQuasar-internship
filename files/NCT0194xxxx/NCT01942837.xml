  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a drug called enzalutamide in metastatatic castration&#xD;
      resistant prostate cancer.Enzalutamide is already FDA approved for metastatic castration&#xD;
      resistant prostate cancer after treatment with chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      analyze features of tumor specimens sampled prior to therapy and at disease progression to&#xD;
      determine why patients respond or stop responding to treatment with Enzalutamide. Prior&#xD;
      chemotherapy is not a requirement of this trial. Enzalutamide is a drug designed to block the&#xD;
      effects of male hormones in the body that may be helping prostate cancer to grow. It has&#xD;
      already been approved by the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) for patients with&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer who have received prior chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, this study will analyze features of tumor specimens sampled prior to therapy&#xD;
      and at disease progression to determine why patients respond or stop responding to treatment&#xD;
      with enzalutamide.&#xD;

      After the screening procedures confirm that the patient is able to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will have the first of two required prostate biopsies prior to starting&#xD;
           study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be given a prescription for study drug and a study drug-dosing diary&#xD;
           for each treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days (4 weeks), during which&#xD;
           time the patient will be taking the study drug once daily. The diary will also include&#xD;
           special instructions for taking the study drug. The study drug (enzalutatmide) should be&#xD;
           taken orally (by mouth) at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle (+/- 4 days), the following procedures will be performed in clinic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests (2-3 tablespoons).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be asked about medications they are currently taking, including&#xD;
           over-the counter medications, herbal remedies, vitamins, and supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be asked about any disease-related symptoms they are experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will receive a new supply and the medication diary will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 12 weeks (+/-1 week) the following procedures will be performed in clinic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests. A small sample of the patient's blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be&#xD;
           collected. This blood will be collected for specialized laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A (CT) scan of the patient's chest and a CT or MRI scan of abdomen, and pelvis and a&#xD;
           bone scan will be performed every 12 weeks (+/- 1 week) while the patient is on active&#xD;
           treatment. If your baseline CT of the patient's chest does not show disease, the&#xD;
           investigator may not asked for this to be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Visit in clinic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests (2-3 tablespoons)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be asked about any disease-related symptoms If the patient completed at&#xD;
           least 4 cycles of enzalutamide, the patient will undergo a second of two required&#xD;
           biopsies.&#xD;
