      The purpose of this study is to compare a closed-loop intravenous anesthetic using Bispectral&#xD;
      Index as a feedback loop and a controller based on reinforcement learning to titrate dose and&#xD;
      intravenous anesthetic that is manually controlled or a standard volatile anesthetic agent&#xD;
      titrated by the anesthesiologist to determine improvement in the following parameters as&#xD;
      compared to controls: time to discharge from the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, post-operative&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting, pain scores and sedation scores.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recent efforts have focused on the development of new software systems that are able to&#xD;
      directly titrate anesthesia based on activity of the brain (EEG) as a feedback mechanism .&#xD;
      Brain activity is used to measure the effect of anesthetic medications (anesthetic &quot;depth&quot;),&#xD;
      which can vary from person to person despite being given the same amount of medication. There&#xD;
      is a potential for new systems to considerably improve anesthetic control by using methods&#xD;
      that are able to adapt to the constant input of brain activity. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to compare a closed -loop intravenous anesthetic (TIVA) using BIS (Bispectral Index) as a&#xD;
      feedback loop and a controller based on reinforcement learning to titrate dose and TIVA that&#xD;
      is manually controlled or a standard volatile anesthetic agent titrated by the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propofol is the most frequently applied hypnotic-anesthetic IV drug during anesthesia. In&#xD;
      &quot;open-loop&quot; controlled propofol administration during anesthesia, initial dosing guidelines&#xD;
      are based on the typical subject, without taking into account the large inter-individual&#xD;
      variability. To manage this variability, most clinicians will start by giving a standard&#xD;
      dose, observes the therapeutic effect and will adapt the dose regimen. Although, &quot;open-loop&quot;&#xD;
      drug administration is clinically &quot;standard-of-care&quot;, the efficiency of this decision process&#xD;
      highly depends on the expertise of the clinician, is very time consuming and might result in&#xD;
      a suboptimal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be using patient with acute cholecystitis scheduled for laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy surgery and the inclusion/exclusion criteria is described in the appropriate&#xD;
      sections. Potential subjects will be identified prior to their surgery based on meeting the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. The subject will be approached in the inpatient unit or&#xD;
      pre-operative holding area, a private area where curtains can be drawn to maintain privacy.&#xD;
      This is a place where patients are routinely examined and consented prior to surgery.. The&#xD;
      subject will be informed that participation or a lack of participation in the study does not&#xD;
      influence their treatment in any way. The subject will be informed that if they give consent&#xD;
      for participation in the study that they may withdraw consent at any time before performance&#xD;
      of the study. This withdrawal of consent may be given to the investigator in oral or written&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator will explain the study to the potential subject verbally, providing all&#xD;
      pertinent information (purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, alternatives to participation,&#xD;
      etc.), and allow the potential subject ample opportunity to ask questions. Following this&#xD;
      verbal explanation, the potential subject will be provided with a written consent form and&#xD;
      given at least one hour to consider whether or not to participate in the research. After&#xD;
      allowing the potential subject time to read the consent form, an Investigator listed on the&#xD;
      consent form will meet with the potential subject and answer any additional questions she/he&#xD;
      may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will have been pre randomized to a study arm (Permuted block randomisation via&#xD;
      computer generated numbers) and will not be informed which study arm. The three study arms&#xD;
      are RL-TIVA (experimental), Manual TIVA, and INH-Sevo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premedication and Induction: Premedication with up to 0.05mg/kg IV midazolam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to arrival in the operating room, a peripheral intravenous line will be inserted in a&#xD;
      large forearm vein in all patients and 500 ml of saline will be infused. This is required to&#xD;
      administer drugs and fluids during anesthesia and is routinely done in all patients. On&#xD;
      arrival in the operating room, vital signs (heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure, blood&#xD;
      oxygen saturation and end-tidal CO2) will be measured in all patients (standard of care&#xD;
      during anesthesia). The RL-TIVA group will also have a non-traumatic, commercially available&#xD;
      unilateral BIS electrode applied at the patient's forehead. This EEG sensor will be connected&#xD;
      to the BIS (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) monitor to calculate the BIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a standard IV induction using:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1mg/kg 1% lidocaine up to maximum of 100mg 100mcg fentanyl 2mg/kg propofol up to maximum of&#xD;
      200mg 0.6mg/kg rocuronium&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly allocated to standard volatile based anesthesia or BIS-guided&#xD;
      intravenous anesthesia administration. The protocol for each of the study arms is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -RL-TIVA: Propofol, ketamine and sufentanil (PKS) administration will be done via a three way&#xD;
      stop cock connected directly to the IV catheter to minimize dead space volume. PKS solution&#xD;
      will contain total of 50ml. Propofol 10mg/ml, Ketamine 1mg/ml (will be omitted in subsequent&#xD;
      preparations after first 50ml), Sufentanil 0.25 mcg-ml. Drug will be administered using a&#xD;
      Harvard 33 syringe pump (The Harvard 33 Syringe pump has been used in human trials in prior&#xD;
      study at Stanford that is pending publication). This pump will be connected via a RS 232&#xD;
      interface to the study computer running RL (reinforcement learning) control software. This&#xD;
      software platform collects real time vital signs and BIS values and steer the target&#xD;
      controlled infusion pumps and the closed-loop controllers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline vital signs, including BIS will be recorded for 2 minutes. During induction until 5&#xD;
      minutes after intubation, NIBP will be measured every minute. Thereafter, NIBP will be&#xD;
      measured at least every 3 minutes until the end of the case. The start of the baseline&#xD;
      measures will be considered as the &quot;START CASE&quot; moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV anesthetic administration will start using the closed-loop system by setting the BIS&#xD;
      target at 45.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When required, optimization of the patients' positioning, disinfection and draping will&#xD;
      ensue. When ready, surgery will start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery, anesthesia will be maintained by propofol-ketamine-sufentanil via closed-loop&#xD;
      at a BIS target of 45.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Manual TIVA: Manually titrated IV anesthetics are routinely done in the operating room&#xD;
           as an alternative to inhalational anesthetics. Propofol, ketamine and sufentanil (PKS)&#xD;
           administration will be done via a three way stop cock connected directly to the IV&#xD;
           catheter to minimize dead space volume. PKS solution will contain total of 50ml.&#xD;
           Propofol 10mg/ml, Ketamine 1mg/ml (will be omitted in subsequent preparations after&#xD;
           first 50ml), Sufentanil 0.25 mcg-ml. Drug will be administered using an Alaris infusion&#xD;
           pump titrated by the anesthesiologist based on blood pressure and heart-rate as is&#xD;
           traditionally done and is standard of care with intravenous anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  INH-Sevo: After the patient is intubated Sevoflurane will be started and titrated to&#xD;
           between 0.8 and 1.5 MAC by the anesthesiologist. At end of surgery, as defined by&#xD;
           placement of surgical dressing, volatile anesthetic will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wake up protocol will be the same for all three arms. Normocapnia will be maintained during&#xD;
      recovery by mechanical ventilation till spontaneous breathing is resumed. No decrease in the&#xD;
      Minute Ventilation is allowed during recovery. Moment of return of spontaneous breathing will&#xD;
      be recorded. Once spontaneous breathing is returned, patients will be asked by their name to&#xD;
      open their mouth. A positive response will be recorded and the trachea will be extubated.&#xD;
      Thereafter, patients will be transferred to the PACU. The parameters listed in the&#xD;
      appropriate section will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: Subject data will be kept in 3 specific locations. A hard copy print out&#xD;
      will be maintained in a folder that will contain the eligibility criteria, consent form, and&#xD;
      source document. This will be stored in a locked file cabinet with limited access to the PI&#xD;
      and Co-Investigators. The electronic data will be stored on an encrypted flash drive kept in&#xD;
      the locked file cabinet and will be backed up on a secure encrypted Network folder that only&#xD;
      the PI and Co-Investigators will have authorization to access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: A power analysis of the previously reported Stanford human volunteer&#xD;
      study data was performed in order to estimate appropriate sample sizes. To estimate&#xD;
      &quot;worst-case&quot; conditions, the measured parameter demonstrating greatest variation, MDPE, was&#xD;
      selected. Assuming comparison with a two-sample, two-tailed t-test and a p-value of 0.05, a&#xD;
      single-group sample size of 25 produced statistical power values of ~1.0. Given this size, we&#xD;
      can detect a 10% difference in MDPE under standard deviations of up to 7 and still maintain&#xD;
      power values &gt; 0.85; thus, we selected n=25 for each of the three study groups, yielding a&#xD;
      total sample size of 75. We acknowledge that this sample size might prove to be over-powered;&#xD;
      however, intraoperative study is known to be challenging. For example, all of the measured&#xD;
      variables should not be expected to demonstrate normal distributions (a critical assumption&#xD;
      in the above power analysis), and we anticipate limited occurrence of confounding influences,&#xD;
      such as protocol deviations and interruptions in data collection. Given the vagaries of&#xD;
      intraoperative study, the chosen sample size of 75 patients seems reasonable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics Categorical data:, sex, age, weight, height, induction times, times to&#xD;
      accurate control (time to reach target, overshoot in BIS), % of time for accurate control and&#xD;
      hemodynamic stability, recovery times, nausea, vomiting, sedation score, pain score, and drug&#xD;
      concentrations. Closed-loop control performance data (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables: BIS, heart rate, blood pressure, saturation, EtCO2 Univariate analysis,&#xD;
      Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test will be used will be used to compare numerical data&#xD;
      and performance parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi-squared will be used to analyse qualitative data. RMANOVA will be used to analyze the&#xD;
      continuous data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: An anesthesiologist or resident will be present for the entire duration of the&#xD;
      anesthetic as is standard of care. If at any time there is hardware or software failure, the&#xD;
      infusion can be disconnected and conventional volatile anesthetic can be rapidly instituted.&#xD;
      LIMITS OF THE CLOSED-LOOP (safety) : In the closed-loop control software, safety limits have&#xD;
      been installed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for Analysis and Interpretation of the Safety Data: The monitoring entity will be&#xD;
      Benjamin Wallisch, MD. He will oversee the research participant's safety, monitor for&#xD;
      unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others, and assure that such events&#xD;
      are reported to the IRB. Integrity and appropriate handling (confidentiality) of the&#xD;
      following data will be monitored: Demographic and morphometrics data, vital signs, bispectral&#xD;
      (BIS) index values, infusion pump flow rate, and recording of occurrence and severity of drug&#xD;
      side effects. Monitoring will occur after every study patient is enrolled. Should unexpected&#xD;
      adverse events occur. All effort will be made to identify the source causing the event.&#xD;
      Source identification may mandate the temporary halting of the study as well as protocol&#xD;
      adjustments (e.g. reduction of drug doses). Serious adverse events will be reported by&#xD;
      Benjamin Wallisch, MD within 2 business days. Serious adverse events will be brought to the&#xD;
      attention of the IRB within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deviations to the study protocol or adverse events will be addressed by the IRB protocol. A&#xD;
      log will be kept of Adverse events and Protocol Deviation kept on the encrypted flash drive&#xD;
      and backed up on the encrypted network drive. The reporting of events will be as above&#xD;
      stated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An annual progress report will be submitted to the IRB for review.&#xD;
