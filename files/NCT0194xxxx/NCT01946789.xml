    <description>Safety and effectiveness of ALT-803 on the peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) and absolute lymphocyte (ALC) counts. Defined by the increase in the total number of peripheral lymphocytes during the first cycle. The safety endpoint is the MTD of ALT-803, defined as the dose level below that at which ≥2 of 6 patients experience a DLT. The efficacy endpoint is the OBD, defined as that which produces an ALC ≥25,000/µL and/or a total WBC ≥35,000/µL among 2/3 of patients. For safety, we have also defined an &quot;exceeding OBD&quot; as the occurrence of ALC ≥35,000/µL and/or WBC ≥50,000/µL.</description>
