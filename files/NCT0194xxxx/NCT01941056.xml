    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of vaccine therapy in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers with or without previous exposure to cytomegalovirus. Vaccines made from a&#xD;
      gene-modified virus may help the body build an immune response and may help prevent&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus infection.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish a biological optimal dose of the cytomegalovirus (CMV)-modified vaccinia&#xD;
      Ankara (MVA) Triplex vaccine (multi-CMV epitope modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if the vaccine is safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers at these&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To provide preliminary evidence of CMV-MVA Triplex vaccine driven expansion of&#xD;
      CMV-specific immune responses that would support further evaluation of this vaccine in&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To confer CMV-specific immunity to CMV-negative volunteers and to determine the duration&#xD;
      of immune enhancement of CMV-specific cell mediated immunity (CMI) function up to 12 months&#xD;
      following immunization of healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive multi-CMV epitope modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine intramuscularly (IM)&#xD;
      followed by a booster injection 28 days later in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 12 months.&#xD;

             actual vaccination; alternatively, there could be a delay due to availability of the&#xD;
             vaccine; therefore, prior to registration for vaccination, the following secondary&#xD;
             eligibility criteria must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If not tested in past 4 months, serum chemistries and blood counts are within normal&#xD;
             limits; hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen negative and hepatitis C virus (HCV)&#xD;
             seronegative; HIV-1 antibody negative&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing age must have a urine pregnancy test performed within 48 hours&#xD;
             of each vaccine administration with a negative result&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory values prior to booster injection may include grade 1 laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities, but any grade &gt;= grade 2 will exclude the subject from a booster&#xD;
             injection&#xD;

             study would pose a danger to him/herself or about which the P.I., in evaluating the&#xD;
             subject for eligibility, determines that this exclusion is appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects are excluded who have a history of cancer other than basal cell skin cancer,&#xD;
             or any condition, psychiatric or otherwise, that would preclude informed consent,&#xD;
             consistent follow-up or compliance with any aspect of the study (e.g., untreated&#xD;
             schizophrenia or other significant cognitive impairment, etc. as determined by the PI.&#xD;

                  intraventricular conduction disturbance with QRS &gt; 120 ms, atrioventricular block&#xD;
                  [AV] block of any degree, and corrected QT [QTc] prolongation &gt; 450 msec for men&#xD;
                  and &gt; 460 msec for women)&#xD;

             dose of vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have had a live vaccine =&lt; 30 days prior to administration of study&#xD;
             vaccine or subjects who are =&lt; 2 weeks within administration of inactivated vaccines&#xD;
