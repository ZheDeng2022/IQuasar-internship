  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our routine practice for patients undergoing mastectomy is to include paravertebral&#xD;
      peripheral nerve blockade for postoperative analgesia. This study investigates whether the&#xD;
      addition of another nerve block targeting the pectoral nerves will improve that analgesia.&#xD;

      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients will be randomized into 2 groups. Both groups will receive paravertebral blocks&#xD;
      with 4 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine at each of six levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Active group with 10 cc of 0.375% ropivacaine (16) pectoral nerve block Group S:&#xD;
      Placebo group with 10 cc of normal saline for pectoral nerve block&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injectate contents for the lateral pectoral nerve block will be blinded to all personnel&#xD;
      involved in performing the block, all personnel involved in the general anesthesia and all&#xD;
      personnel involved in assessing the patient for pain in the postoperative recovery period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study patients will be consented for a paravertebral block and a lateral pectoral nerve&#xD;
      block as per institutional standards. Pre-block procedure will follow the standard operating&#xD;
      procedures of the institution including time out, intravenous access, oxygen supplementation,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter and automated noninvasive blood pressure monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral block will be performed as usual, as described by Moller (17). Patients will be&#xD;
      in a sitting position with a staff member standing in front of the patient to ensure safety.&#xD;
      The surgical site will be marked both in the front and on the back of the patient with dual&#xD;
      confirmation from the consent and the patient. Mild sedation will be given using midazolam 2&#xD;
      mg and fentanyl 100 µg. The superior aspects of the spinous processes of thoracic levels&#xD;
      C7-T5 will be identified with palpation. The needle entry site will be marked at 2.5 cm&#xD;
      lateral to each spinous process ipsilateral to the operative breast. Using a 22-gauge, Tuohy&#xD;
      needle (B Braun Medical Inc, Bethlehem, PA, USA) attached via extension tubing to a syringe,&#xD;
      the needle will be advanced anteriorly in the parasagittal plane (perpendicular to the back&#xD;
      in all directions) until it contacts the transverse process. The needle will then be&#xD;
      withdrawn to the subcutaneous tissue and angled to walk off the caudal edge of the transverse&#xD;
      process. From the caudal edge, it will then be advanced anteriorly approximately 1 cm. (17)&#xD;
      After negative aspiration of the syringe, 4 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine will be injected at each&#xD;
      of the six levels. These injections correspond to the T1-T6 spinal root levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lateral pectoral nerve block is performed as described by Blanco (15). A linear&#xD;
      ultrasound probe (L28 sonosite, Seattle, WA, USA) will be placed in a sagittal paramedian&#xD;
      fashion inferior to the lateral third of the ipsilateral clavicle medial to the coracoid.&#xD;
      Once the pectoralis major muscle and axillary artery is identified, the thoraco-acromial&#xD;
      artery is identified between the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscle and confirmed&#xD;
      with color Doppler. The lateral pectoral nerve is consistently located adjacent to the&#xD;
      artery. (15) Ten mL of study injectate (16) will be delivered using an in-plane technique via&#xD;
      a 80 mm echogenic (Pajunk, Germany) needle adjacent to the artery and into the inter-pectoral&#xD;
      plane. Care is taken to avoid intramuscular and intravascular injection. The contents of the&#xD;
      injectate will be blinded to any personnel involved in performing the block, general&#xD;
      anesthesia, or post operative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will proceed with general anesthesia. Induction will be with propofol and&#xD;
      maintenance with desflurane. Airway management will be with an LMA without use of muscle&#xD;
      relaxant as per standard practice. Fentanyl will be used intraoperatively to treat pain.&#xD;
      Hydromorphone will be used to treat pain in the post- operative setting. No NSAID or&#xD;
      acetaminophen will be given in any route. For prevention of post operative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, all patients will be given a 1.5mg scopolamine patch, 8 mg of dexamethasone at the&#xD;
      beginning of surgery,(18) and 4 mg of ondansetron at closing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any supplemental local anesthetic infiltration by surgeons will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard post anesthetic care unit assessment (PACU) of numerical rating pain scale score&#xD;
      will be performed as per standard protocol. Hydromorphone will be used to treat pain in the&#xD;
      post-operative setting. If pain control is inadequate, other analgesics may be prescribed at&#xD;
      the discretion of anesthesia providers involved in the case as per standard practice.&#xD;
      Additional anti-emetics may be prescribed and used whenever necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection includes total preoperative, intraoperative fentanyl and total post-&#xD;
      operative hydromorphone. Data collection concludes when the patient has met PACU discharge&#xD;
      criteria or 2 hours after arousal, whichever is sooner. Time of PACU admission and when the&#xD;
      patient has met PACU discharge criteria is recorded. Any supplementary local anesthetics or&#xD;
      analgesia will also be noted. Prior to PACU discharge, a blinded assessor will assess the&#xD;
      patient for any reduced sensation to cold in the distribution of the radial, ulnar, median&#xD;
      nerves in the hand and musculocutaneous nerve in the arm as well as the motor integrity of&#xD;
      the 4 said nerves. Patient grip strength will be measured on the surgical and contralateral&#xD;
      sides with a grip dynamometer. Three iterations of measurements will be taken prior to the&#xD;
      nerve block procedure and again when the patient is ready for discharge from PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction will be assessed at PACU discharge with a standard question, &quot;Thinking&#xD;
      about your nerve blocks, how satisfied were you with them: where 1 is not at all, 4 is in the&#xD;
      middle, and 7 is completely satisfied?&quot; scored on a 7-point Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any complications will be noted, with follow up and management as per the institution&#xD;
      standard operating procedure. Known risks of regional anesthesia include small risks of&#xD;
      infection, swelling and bleeding, and extremely rare risks of nerve damage, collapsed lung,&#xD;
      seizure, and death. Unanticipated adverse events will also be reported to the PI for&#xD;
      evaluation and possible reporting to the HRRC, according to HRRC policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demonstrating that non-blocked patients' analgesic requirements differ from the hypothesized&#xD;
      mean for blocked patients at α=0.05 and 80% power will require a total sample size of 16&#xD;
      (8/group). This estimate is based on observational data for non-blocked patients from our own&#xD;
      practice, and our estimate of the minimum clinically-significant difference in analgesic&#xD;
      requirements to be expected in blocked patients. We currently estimate that enrollment of 20&#xD;
      participants should be sufficient to accumulate 16 who complete the protocol , and will apply&#xD;
      to HRRC for an amendment to enroll more should that be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of most outcomes (opioid consumption, pain score, time to discharge)&#xD;
      will be carried out with Wilcoxon tests or t-tests, as appropriate. The remaining outcomes&#xD;
      (PONV incidence, incidence of weakness or modified sensation in ipsilateral upper limb) will&#xD;
      be analyzed with proportion tests.&#xD;
