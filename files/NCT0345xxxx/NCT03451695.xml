  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) after caesarean section (CS) is reported&#xD;
      to be as high as 18%, reflecting it to be a significant clinical problem. Studies related to&#xD;
      prevention of progression of acute post-CS pain to its chronicity are sparse. Current&#xD;
      guidelines on post-CS analgesia recommend the use of intrathecal (IT) opioids to spinal&#xD;
      anaesthesia for improved post-CS pain relief. Despite its frequent use, studies related to&#xD;
      the IT morphine use and its association with post-CS chronic pain are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent prospective observation study revealed a significant reduction in persistent pain&#xD;
      after CS when IT morphine was used as an adjuvant to spinal anaesthesia. However, there is no&#xD;
      any randomized controlled trial (RCT) that has explored this association to date. We&#xD;
      hypothesized that spinal morphine would reduce the incidence of persistent pain after CS.&#xD;

      This prospective, randomised, double-blind trial will take place at B.P Koirala Institute of&#xD;
      Health Sciences, a University hospital situated in Nepal. Approval for the study has been&#xD;
      obtained from the institution ethical committee. After the trial is registered, recruitment&#xD;
      of the patient will be initiated. Consent for the participation in the study will be obtained&#xD;
      during pre-anaesthetic assessment visits in the evening before surgery. During this visit,&#xD;
      preoperative anxiety level (hospital anxiety and depression scale), pain catastrophizing&#xD;
      (assessed with pain catastrophizing scale), preoperative pain sensitivity (assessed with pain&#xD;
      pressure threshold and tolerance) will be recorded. The investigator will also educate the&#xD;
      patients regarding the use of NRS scores for postoperative pain and satisfaction ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two groups (morphine and&#xD;
      placebo groups). Randomization will be done in variable block sizes (4/6/8) by an internet&#xD;
      based random-number generator list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphine group will receive intrathecal 11 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine (2.2 mL 0.5%), 10μg&#xD;
      of fentanyl (0.2 ml) and 100 μg of preservative free morphine (0.1 ml). Placebo group will&#xD;
      receive 11 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine (2.2 mL 0.5%), 10μg of fentanyl (0.2 ml) and normal&#xD;
      saline (0.1ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, pain, opioid consumption, sedation, nausea or vomiting, pruritus, and&#xD;
      respiratory depression in the postanesthesia care unit (time 0 hours) and at 2, 6, 12, 24,&#xD;
      and 48 hours will be evaluated. The area of hyperalgesia around the surgical incision will be&#xD;
      assessed at 48 hrs postoperatively using a von Frey filament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction from postoperative analgesia will be assessed using a 5-point scale (1 =&#xD;
      very unsatisfied, 2 = unsatisfied, 3 = fair, 4 = satisfied and 5 = very satisfied). At 8 wks&#xD;
      patients will be assessed for post-natal depression using Edinburgh postnatal depression&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted by telephone by one of the blinded investigator at 3, 6 months&#xD;
      after the surgery. The short form brief pain inventory will be used to determine post-CS&#xD;
      chronic pain&#xD;
