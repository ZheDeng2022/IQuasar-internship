      The focus of this study is to examine the feasibility of integrating Vinyasa yoga into a&#xD;
      Standard Behavioral Weight Loss Intervention, to examine whether engagement differs between&#xD;
      Vinyasa yoga and a restorative form of Hatha yoga within a Standard Behavioral Weight Loss&#xD;
      Intervention, and to use this information to inform an expanded study to directly test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of these interventions on weight loss in adults. Thus, study will pursing the&#xD;
      following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vinyasa yoga will be integrated into the Standard Behavioral Weight Loss Intervention.&#xD;
           This will require refinement of the Vinyasa yoga intervention to assure that this is&#xD;
           appropriate for adults with obesity and to develop the necessary Vinyasa yoga&#xD;
           intervention materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The feasibility of randomizing and retaining participants within the context of a&#xD;
           Standard Behavioral Weight Loss Intervention that also includes either a restorative&#xD;
           Hatha style of yoga or Vinyasa style of yoga will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fidelity and compliance to the yoga components of the intervention will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the aims listed above potential participants will be recruited through a variety&#xD;
      of advertisement methods. Those individuals responding to these advertisements will have the&#xD;
      study explained to them and informed consent will be obtained. These participants will&#xD;
      complete a series of screening assessments that will be used to determine eligibility (height&#xD;
      and weight to determine body mass index, resting blood pressure, heart rate,&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness). For participants deemed to be eligible and randomized to&#xD;
      participate in this study, these measures will also be used as their baseline data from&#xD;
      analysis. Additional data collection will be collected at the baseline assessment visit, with&#xD;
      assessments repeated following the 6 month intervention. Assessments will include the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height and Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting Blood Pressure and Heart Rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiorespiratory Fitness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric Measures (girth of waist and hips)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietary Intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional Questionnaires to assess demographics, physical activity barriers, eating&#xD;
           behaviors, sedentary behavior, physical activity self-efficacy, mindfulness,&#xD;
           psychological flexibility and self-regulation, affect, perceived stress, anxiety, sleep,&#xD;
           depressive symptoms, and treatment satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be completed at both baseline and following the 6-month intervention.&#xD;
      Moreover, following the intervention, participants will engage in group-based qualitative&#xD;
      interviews. These qualitative interviews will focus on better understanding strengths,&#xD;
      weaknesses, and barriers to engagement in the intervention that was used in this study. This&#xD;
      information will be used to refine our approach prior to pursuing additional studies in this&#xD;
      areas of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves a 6 month behavioral weight loss intervention (SBWI) with participants&#xD;
      randomized to either Hatha Yoga or Vinyasa Yoga as the form of physical activity. All&#xD;
      randomized participant will received the components of the SBWI along with either Hatha Yoga&#xD;
      or Vinyasa Yoga based on their randomized intervention assignment. Participants will attend&#xD;
      weekly group meetings for all weeks of the study. Group meetings will last approximately&#xD;
      30-45 minutes in duration and will be led by trained behavioral interventionists with&#xD;
      previous experience facilitating behavioral weight loss intervention meetings. These meetings&#xD;
      will focus on strategies to promote behavior change and weight management. Strategies to&#xD;
      promote behavior change will included the Social Cognitive Theory, Problem Solving Theory,&#xD;
      and Relapse Prevention. Participants will be weighed weekly prior to group meetings to track&#xD;
      changes in weight throughout the study and assist interventionists with weight counseling.&#xD;
      Participants who do not attend the weekly group meeting will be contacted via telephone call&#xD;
      to reschedule for an individual weigh-in and make-up session with an interventionist prior to&#xD;
      the next group meeting. If an individual make-up session cannot be scheduled, an&#xD;
      interventionist will provide a brief counseling session by telephone and the written&#xD;
      materials will be mailed to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary recommendations within the intervention will be based on the participants' baseline&#xD;
      body weight. These calorie goals are based on intake recommendations that have been&#xD;
      successful in other weight loss programs, and fat intake goals are consistent with the USDA&#xD;
      Dietary Guidelines. Participants weighing less than 200 pounds will be prescribed a 1200&#xD;
      kcal/day diet, participants weighing between 200 to less than 250 will be prescribed 1500&#xD;
      kcal/day, and participants weighing 250 or more will be prescribed 1800 kcal/day. To promote&#xD;
      adoption and adherence to these recommendations, participants will be provided&#xD;
      self-monitoring paper diaries, meal plans, and sample recipes. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to self-monitor daily and will be instructed to turn in self-monitoring food&#xD;
      diaries to their interventionist prior to group intervention meetings. Printed intervention&#xD;
      lessons will also include information related to behavior strategies for achieving the&#xD;
      recommended calorie and fat intake goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity Components of the Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hatha Yoga Group: The specific description of physical activity for those randomized to&#xD;
      receive Hatha Yoga will focus on a restorative style of Hatha yoga. This will involve a&#xD;
      systematic progression to allow for participants to acclimate to the poses and this style of&#xD;
      yoga practice. Total duration will begin at 100 minutes per week and will gradually progress&#xD;
      in 4-week intervals until achieving the prescribed dose of 300 min/wk (5 days per week for 60&#xD;
      minutes per day). Participants will be instructed to spread this dose of activity equally&#xD;
      across 5 days each week, with each session starting at 20 minutes and progressing to 50&#xD;
      minutes. The initial 1-2 weeks will focus on the participants understanding the asanas (or&#xD;
      poses) and gaining kinesthetic awareness of their body while moving through the movement&#xD;
      sequences. Study participants will be provided with a yoga mat to use throughout the study,&#xD;
      and they will be permitted to keep this yoga mat at the conclusion of their participation in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While attending the SBWI group session the participants will also engage in a supervised yoga&#xD;
      session with a trained yoga instructor. To facilitate the additional 4 days of unsupervised&#xD;
      yoga, yoga videos that we develop that mimic the asanas (poses) and flow patterns that are&#xD;
      taught in the supervised yoga sessions will be provided, and these videos will be led by the&#xD;
      same individual who is instructing the supervised yoga sessions. To facilitate the use of&#xD;
      these yoga videos by participants, access will be provided by loading them on to a tablet&#xD;
      (iPad, Surface, etc.) that will be provided to the participant or through other electronic&#xD;
      formats (YouTube Channel, streaming through study website, etc.). The sequence of videos will&#xD;
      be scheduled to be accessible to the participant on predetermined dates that coincide with&#xD;
      the progression of the yoga activities in the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vinyasa Yoga Group: The specific description of physical activity for those randomized to&#xD;
      receive Vinyasa Yoga will focus on a more vigorous form of yoga. This will involve a&#xD;
      systematic progression to allow for participants to acclimate to the poses and this style of&#xD;
      yoga practice. Total duration will begin at 100 minutes per week and will gradually progress&#xD;
      in 4-week intervals until achieving the prescribed dose of 300 min/wk (5 days per week for 60&#xD;
      minutes per day). Participants will be instructed to spread this dose of activity equally&#xD;
      across 5 days each week, with each session starting at 20 minutes and progressing to 50&#xD;
      minutes. The initial 1-2 weeks will focus on the participants understanding the asanas (or&#xD;
      poses) and gaining kinesthetic awareness of their body while moving through the movement&#xD;
      sequences. Study participants will be provided with a yoga mat to use throughout the study,&#xD;
      and they will be permitted to keep this yoga mat at the conclusion of their participation in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While attending the SBWI group session the participants will also engage in a supervised yoga&#xD;
      session with a trained yoga instructor. To facilitate the additional 4 days of unsupervised&#xD;
      yoga, yoga videos that we develop that mimic the asanas (poses) and flow patterns that are&#xD;
      taught in the supervised yoga sessions will be provided, and these videos will be led by the&#xD;

      be scheduled to be accessible to the participant on predetermined dates that coincide with&#xD;
      the progression of the yoga activities in the intervention.&#xD;
