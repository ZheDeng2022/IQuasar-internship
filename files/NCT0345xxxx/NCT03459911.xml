  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total 66 normal healthy adult subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      administered either the Test or the Reference Product with 200 mL of water in each period as&#xD;
      per the randomization schedule. Subjects will fast for at least 10 hours prior to&#xD;
      administration of the study drugs and for four (4) hours after administration of the study&#xD;
      drugs during each study period. Standardized meals will be provided in each study period.&#xD;
      Water will not be accessible to the subjects 1 hour to administration of the study drugs and&#xD;
      1 hour after administration of the study drugs in each period. A total of 29 blood samples&#xD;
      will be withdrawn for pharmacokinetic profiling during each study period. The plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of losartan and its carboxylic acid metabolite will be measured by a validated&#xD;
      LC-MS/MS analytical method. ANOVA will be performed on log transformed pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and 90% confidence interval will be constructed for the&#xD;
      ratio of geometric least square mean of the Test and Reference products, obtained from the&#xD;
      log-transformed data. Bioequivalence will be concluded if the ratio estimate as well as its&#xD;
      90% confidence interval, both falls within the acceptable range of 80.00% to 125.00% for&#xD;
      Cmax, AUC0-t.&#xD;
