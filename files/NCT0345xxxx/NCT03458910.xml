  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research suggests that heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback aimed at increasing&#xD;
      HRV can reduce anxiety and stress. However, some mental quiescence practices that reduce HRV&#xD;
      during the practice sessions also lead to positive emotional outcomes. Thus, it is not&#xD;
      obvious that the benefits of HRV-biofeedback accrue due to increasing HRV during the session.&#xD;
      An alternative possibility is that the benefits arise from engaging prefrontal control over&#xD;
      heart rate. In this study, the investigators will test two possible mechanisms of the effects&#xD;
      of HRV on emotional health by comparing two groups. In one group, participants will be asked&#xD;
      to engage in daily training to decrease HRV using the HRV biofeedback device. In the other&#xD;
      group, participants will be asked to engage in daily training to increase HRV using the HRV&#xD;
      biofeedback device. This will allow analyses to pit two possible mechanisms against each&#xD;
      other:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mechanism 1: engaging prefrontal control over heart rate is the critical factor that&#xD;
           allows HRV biofeedback to help improve well-being. In this case, well-being should&#xD;
           increase over time in both groups, as both training should engage prefrontal cortex to&#xD;
           implement self-directed control over heart rate. Strengthening prefrontal control&#xD;
           mechanisms may help improve emotion regulation in everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mechanism 2: increased HRV during the training sessions leads to greater functional&#xD;
           connectivity among brain regions associated with emotion regulation during the high HRV&#xD;
           state. In this case, improved well-being would be specifically associated with having&#xD;
           time each day during which there were very high HRV states, and so improved well-being&#xD;
           should be seen only in the group in which participants get biofeedback to increase HRV.&#xD;
