  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is a life support treatment for patients with acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure. The IMV can generate adverse effects that may cause alterations in other&#xD;
      organs besides the lung, creating an important problem during ICU stay, hospital stay and&#xD;
      years after discharge. These consequences on morbidity and mortality have significant&#xD;
      economic and social weight. In the United States the IMV represents 2.7 episodes per 1000&#xD;
      habitants, with an estimated cost of $27,000 million, representing 12% of all hospital&#xD;
      expenses. The overall mortality in patients with IMV is 30-35%, increasing with age.&#xD;
      Therefore, patients receiving IMV are a high-risk population and with higher costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A poor interaction between patient and ventilator during IMV can develop asynchronies. The&#xD;
      asynchronies may present in 25% of patients. The majority of studies in ICU patients are&#xD;
      limited to a evaluation of short periods of time. Asynchronies identification needs the&#xD;
      application of respiratory physiology knowledge and the interpretation of respiratory signals&#xD;
      from the ventilator waves. This allows identifying in an easy way different situations of&#xD;
      &quot;fight&quot;, but it also difficult the identification of situation where asynchronies are less&#xD;
      obvious, doing that them remain underdiagnosed. Moreover, asynchronies can be only evaluated&#xD;
      during a brief period of time, and it's difficult to know their incidence during all the IMV&#xD;
      period and to make adjustments to improve them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our centre, it has been developed a continuous monitoring system during IMV which&#xD;
      integrates, in real-time, all the information derived from digital monitors and ventilators.&#xD;
      It allows a continuous and automatic detection of different events (through an intelligent&#xD;
      alarm system) and quantification of asynchronies. It was demonstrated that asynchronies are&#xD;
      frequent, that it can be present from the beginning of IMV, that it increase in severe&#xD;
      patients under deep sedation and it can increase ICU and hospital mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators can study different factors that can influence over asynchronies&#xD;
      development or can improve them.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The aim of this study is to analyze the real incidence of asynchronies of patients undergoing&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and to analyze what factors may have an association with their&#xD;
      appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This factors includes factors related with the pulmonary mechanics of each patient and other&#xD;
      factors such as the treatment administered, especially drugs with sedative and analgesic&#xD;
      effect will be taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This can help to implement strategies for the improvement of asynchronies.&#xD;
