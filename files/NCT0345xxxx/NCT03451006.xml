      This study will test whether chronic metformin administration will improve longevity of the&#xD;
      cell, improves its machinery by reducing aging-related biochemical parameters and thereby&#xD;
      improving physical performance, as measured by short physical performance battery test.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the United States and disproportionately&#xD;
      affects older adults, underscoring the need to examine determinants of survivorship.&#xD;
      Recognizing this gap, current guidelines lay emphasis to assess frailty, a key construct&#xD;
      prevalent in elderly and known to impact their prognosis.Older persons are commonly frail,&#xD;
      manifest hyperglycemia and their health span is truncated by illnesses during which&#xD;
      physiological declines together with accumulation of additional deficits results in&#xD;
      multimorbidity and functional dependence. High incidence of functional decline and stress&#xD;
      hyperglycemia in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) makes pharmacologic&#xD;
      manipulation, an attractive strategy to improve frailty and reduce adverse cardiovascular&#xD;
      outcomes. Metformin exerts its effect on health span as a calorie restriction-mimetic through&#xD;
      inhibition of mitochondrial complex 1 and activation of activated protein kinase (AMP).This&#xD;
      drug is safe and has been shown to prolong life in mammals. Metformin by reducing effects of&#xD;
      cellular senescence and improving glycemic control may improve the functioning of older&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In CAD, cellular senescence and inflammation affect organ dysfunction through interference&#xD;
      with tissue homeostasis and regeneration. The deleterious effect of senescence includes&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Normal biological function&#xD;
      through alteration in cellular homeostasis and restoration of glycemic control may be&#xD;
      achieved by metformin. The phenotypic manifestations of these changes are incompletely&#xD;
      characterized as it is yet unknown whether cell-intrinsic regenerative mechanisms can be&#xD;
      translated into clinical improvement in physical performance and whether it's chronic&#xD;
      administration is safe in older adults. These major gaps in knowledge hinder utilization of&#xD;
      metformin as an agent to promote cellular regeneration and to reduce the impact of cellular&#xD;
      senescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeting frail individuals with high levels of inflammation and SASP factors would&#xD;
      necessitate identification of predictors of improvement with metformin in tissue inflammation&#xD;
      and function. A clinomics approach implementing simultaneous assessment of clinical impact&#xD;
      coupled with serological profiling would provide enhanced understanding of the local and&#xD;
      systemic impact mediated by metformin. Through correlation of molecular profiles with&#xD;
      phenotypic expression changes, as proposed herein, investigators will enhance understanding&#xD;
      of the regenerative impact of metformin and the basis for clinical improvement in the setting&#xD;
      of senescence.&#xD;

    <description>Frailty will be measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). The short physical performance battery (SPPB) is a group of measures that combines the results of the gait speed, chair stand and balance tests. It has been used as a predictive tool for possible disability and can aid in the monitoring of function in older people. The scores range from 0 (worst performance) to 12 (best performance). Frailty is defined as a score of &lt;9.</description>
