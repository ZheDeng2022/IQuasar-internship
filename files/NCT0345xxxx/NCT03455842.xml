      The study is Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate&#xD;
      efficacy and safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 2 dosing regimens (qw and q2w,&#xD;
      s/c) of monoclonal antibody to IL6R (BCD-089) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      and inadequate response to methotrexate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IL-6 is a new potential therapeutic target which plays important role in pathogenesis of&#xD;
      several autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis. BCD-089 is a novel fully human&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor developed by JCS BIOCAD (Russia) which&#xD;
      is successfully passed phase I clinical study. Fixed dose of 162 mg was chosen for evaluation&#xD;
      in phase II clinical trial. Comparisons in terms of efficacy, safety, PK/PD will be made for&#xD;
      every week and every other week dosing for 54 weeks. W0-W12, planed as blinded, &quot;main&quot; period&#xD;
      of the study, consists of three arms (n=35, each) - 2 study arms and placebo arm and served&#xD;
      to test the hypothesis of superiority of BCD-089 to placebo. W12-W54, planned as &quot;open&quot;&#xD;
      period of the study and served to evaluate long-therm safety and efficacy of BCD-089 in&#xD;
      patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
