  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Daprodustat administration has the potential, by virtue of increasing hypoxia-inducible&#xD;
      factor (HIF) levels, to increase oral iron absorption and incorporation into hemoglobin&#xD;
      (Hgb). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the effect of daprodustat to rhEPO&#xD;
      (i.e., epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa) on non-heme oral iron absorption using stable&#xD;
      isotopic iron (57Fe and 58Fe) by measuring incorporation of iron in erythrocytes. This study&#xD;
      will be a randomized, repeat dose, open label, two period cross-over study in adult, male and&#xD;
      female participants with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease who are not on&#xD;
      dialysis currently treated with stable doses less than or equal to (&lt;=) 50 percent (%) change&#xD;
      in 4-weekly dose) for at least 8 weeks prior to and including the screening period, of rhEPO&#xD;
      (i.e., epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa). Sufficient participants will be enrolled such that&#xD;
      at least 12 participants comprise the Evaluable Population. The study will compare the&#xD;
      fractional iron absorption between treatment arms (daprodustat and rhEPO [i.e., epoetin alfa&#xD;
      or darbepoetin alfa]) and will evaluate the difference is equal/not equal to zero.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be randomly assigned to remain on their current therapy (either epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa) in Treatment Period 1. For assessment of incorporation of iron into erythrocytes, participants will be administered ferrous sulfate containing a stable isotope of iron (57Fe) orally in a randomized fashion following 2 weeks of administration of randomized study treatment. At Day 29 participants will be crossed over to receive Daprodustat in Treatment Period 2. At 2 weeks following initiation of dosing in Treatment Period 2, participants will again be administered ferrous sulfate containing the stable iron isotope (58Fe) orally. Participants will be advised to maintain use of oral iron supplementation (except ferric citrate) and acid-reducing agents (example: Histamine [H2] receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, antacids) at a consistent dosage and frequency.</description>
