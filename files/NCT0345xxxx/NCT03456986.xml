      The proposed SBIR Phase I study tests the feasibility of PATH neurotraining for improving&#xD;
      cognitive skills in older adults and, potentially, forestalling or protecting against&#xD;
      cognitive decline and dementia. The feasibility of PATH neurotraining will be evaluated by&#xD;
      comparing it with another cognitive training program, Brain HQ's Target Tracker, and&#xD;
      ascertaining the relative advantage(s) of PATH neurotraining for enhancing cognition in older&#xD;
      adults between 55 and 75 years of age whose cognition is either in the age-normative range or&#xD;
      in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) range of standardized psychometric measures. MEG/MRI&#xD;
      source imaging will be used on 12 of the PATH group participants to determine whether the&#xD;
      behavioral results are verified by improvements in the dorsal, attention, and executive&#xD;
      control networks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to show that neurotraining in the center of the motion working&#xD;
      range (PATH) that improves the contrast sensitivity for direction discrimination (dorsal&#xD;
      stream activity significantly improves cognitive skills in older adults more than in those&#xD;
      who do training to improve orientation discrimination: ventral stream activity (sham&#xD;
      training). Brain training will be administered for 20 minutes three times a week for 12&#xD;
      weeks: Arm 1) PATH neurotraining and Arm 2) Sham training. The investigators predict that&#xD;
      older adults who do PATH neurotraining will improve their visual and cognitive skills,&#xD;
      improving attention, multitasking, processing speed, reading fluency, and working memory,&#xD;
      significantly more than those doing sham training. This prediction will be evaluated by&#xD;
      measuring whether older adults improve on standardized tests of cognitive skills following&#xD;
      PATH neurotraining more than older adults doing orientation discrimination training to&#xD;
      improve processing speed and attention. MEG brain imaging will be used to show that PATH&#xD;
      training improves the dorsal, attention, and executive control networks, as found previously,&#xD;
      more than does sham training. The investigators predict these improvements will be found in&#xD;
      both healthy adults and those with MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of rapid, effective brain training will be evaluated by using behavioral&#xD;
      methods to remediate age-related cognitive decline, and to treat the cognitive impairment&#xD;
      and/or behavioral symptoms associated with MCI, as well as to slow and/or reverse the course&#xD;
      of cognitive decline or to prevent it entirely. PATH neurotraining provides a computer-based&#xD;
      product to remediate the visual and cognitive difficulties of older adults rapidly and&#xD;
      effectively. The innovative PATH neurotraining improves the center of the motion working&#xD;
      range, whereas the sham training improves the center of the orientation discrimination&#xD;
      working range. The two brain training groups will be balanced, in terms of healthy older&#xD;
      adults and those with MCI. A subject will be considered to have MCI if the WAIS Working&#xD;
      Memory Index score is less than 50 percent, and the MOCA has a score of 19-25. These groups&#xD;
      will also be balanced in terms of age and reading speed, a sensitive measure of processing&#xD;
      speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of the older adults will complete the PATH neurotraining for 12 weeks and half will&#xD;
      complete sham training for 12 weeks. An additional 12 weeks will be needed to train staff,&#xD;
      recruit subjects, and complete the standardized tests and MEG imaging. The choice of which&#xD;
      adults will do each type of brain training will be randomized, to be determined by study&#xD;
      statistician Prof. John Shelley-Tremblay. After initial standardized testing, 12 adults doing&#xD;
      PATH training will be selected for pre-post MEG brain imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precise measurements using pre- and post- standardized tests of cognitive skills will be used&#xD;
      to validate the improved visual and cognitive (attention, processing speed, and memory)&#xD;
      performance reported previously in older adults. Standardized tests and MEG imaging on a&#xD;
      subset will be administered by staff before and after cognitive training to evaluate&#xD;
      improvements in cognitive skills following treatment (PATH neurotraining) and control (sham&#xD;
      training) interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating improvements in cognitive skills of older adults will be grouped by subject type:&#xD;
      whether the adult is healthy or has MCI to determine which intervention improves cognitive&#xD;
      skills the most. The investigators predict that PATH neurotraining will significantly improve&#xD;
      (at p â‰¤ 0.05) reading speed, working memory and attention (cognitive flexibility) in older&#xD;
      adults more than after training on sham training. This will be evaluated by both: 1)&#xD;
      measuring whether older adults improve on the standardized tests listed above following brain&#xD;
      training, and 2) MEG brain source imaging to validate that dorsal stream, attention, and&#xD;
      executive control networks improve in function significantly following PATH neurotraining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to study 40 older adults between the ages of 55 to 75, 20 in each group.&#xD;
      Older adults will be recruited by posting brochures, getting referrals from Dr. James Brewer&#xD;
      and Dr. Michael Lobatz, both who work with older adults having Alzheimer's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training Procedures. Brain training exercises will be implemented in a high fidelity manner,&#xD;
      using a detailed written protocol that all Research Assistants (RAs) are trained to follow&#xD;
      meticulously, new PATH training movies and new motivational strategies. Staff will be hired&#xD;
      at UCSD following interviews with Cognitive Science undergraduates who answered an&#xD;
      advertisement on Handshake, the UCSD portal advertising for internships for UCSD students.&#xD;
      Hiring RAs for this project and a Senior RA (SRA) to monitor study will be done by the PI at&#xD;
      UCSD. Eleven RAs will be hired to administer standardized tests and both types of brain&#xD;
      training to older adults at Perception Dynamics Institute (PDI) having a clinic ideal for&#xD;
      collecting data in quiet surroundings with easy access for older adults. New training videos&#xD;
      aimed at older adults will be developed by Leslie Peters at Desert Bay Productions in&#xD;
      Encinitas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RAs will ensure each older adult is on task, completing the PATH neurotraining&#xD;
      (pathtoreading.com) designed to activate the dorsal brain pathways and Sham training designed&#xD;
      to activate the ventral brain pathways, and is progressing through each program in a timely&#xD;
      manner by examining their data. The PI, having extensive experience conducting controlled&#xD;
      validation studies, will be in charge of training all staff, running daily operations which&#xD;
      requires supervising standardized testing and administering the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures To Evaluate Effectiveness of Training to Improve Visual and Cognitive Skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral Measure: Standardized testing of cognitive skills will be conducted at PDI by UCSD&#xD;
      undergraduate Cognitive Science students trained by the PI, as done previously. All&#xD;
      participants will undergo a review of their medical history and everyday activities impacted&#xD;
      as they aged using a 9-item questionnaire described in Human Subjects. Since these are timed&#xD;
      tests with test items not able to be memorized for future testing, practice effects are&#xD;
      minimized. Cognitive assessments, which take about one hour to administer, will be evaluated&#xD;
      before and after training by standardized tests for adults to measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Attention using Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Color-Word Interference&#xD;
           test (10 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reading Speed using Computer-Based Reading Rate task (reading 6 words of text on screen)&#xD;
           from interesting story at increasing speeds to measure 2 reading rate thresholds using a&#xD;
           double-staircase procedure, after being trained by watching ReadingRate movie. (5&#xD;
           minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Processing Speed Index (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-4 Coding and Symbol&#xD;
           Search subtests) and Working Memory Index (WAIS-4 Digit Span and Letter-Number&#xD;
           Sequencing subtests), (10 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Visual Working Memory (VWM) using Test of Information Processing Skills, having two&#xD;
           distractor tasks, a counting task and repeating a short sentence, having to animal names&#xD;
           at end of test (10 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarker Measure: MEG Imaging will be used to provide a Biomarker to show that only&#xD;
      improving dorsal stream function improves cognitive skills in older adults. To establish the&#xD;
      feasibility of PATH neurotraining to improve cognitive function in older adults, Prof.&#xD;
      Ming-Xiong Huang will record voxel-wise MEG source magnitude images, from 12 older adults to&#xD;
      determine the cortical areas improving in function following PATH neurotraining and following&#xD;
      sham training. MEG brain imaging, using the Fast-VESTAL procedure (Huang et al. 2016, 2017,&#xD;
      2018), showed that this movement-discrimination training improved time-locked activity in the&#xD;
      dorsal stream, attention, and executive control networks. MEG images covering the whole&#xD;
      brain, for each frequency band, following the Fast-VESTAL procedure, to measure time-locked&#xD;
      signals during a working memory N-back task will be used to evaluate improvements in brain&#xD;
      function. The N-back task is one of the most frequently used WM paradigms (Gevins and&#xD;
      Cutillo, 1993) to investigate the neural basis of WM processes. Two MEG exams will be&#xD;
      performed for each participant, one before and another after the PATH or sham training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-back Working Memory Task. Participants will undergo MEG recordings while performing an&#xD;
      N-back WM task. The task entails on-line monitoring, updating, and manipulation of remembered&#xD;
      information. During the task, the participant is required to monitor a series of letters&#xD;
      (both upper and lower case) presented for 500 ms in the middle of the screen. A fixation&#xD;
      cross is presented during the 3000 ms interstimulus interval. The participant is instructed&#xD;
      to respond only when a letter is presented that matches (i.e. target) the one presented n&#xD;
      trials previously, while not to responding to the unmatched stimuli (non-target). Two load&#xD;
      conditions will be used (1-back and 2-back), which place increasing demands on WM processes.&#xD;
      About 50 trials per load condition will be collected for each participant. Performance will&#xD;
      be recorded using an MEG-compatible response pad, in which index finger blocks-and-unblocks a&#xD;
      laser-beam. The outputs of the response pad including reaction times will be recorded in the&#xD;
      MEG file. The percent correct responses to target and non-target stimuli will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different from the conventional MEG approach in which sensor waveforms are averaged with&#xD;
      respect to the onset of the stimuli, the sensor covariance matrices for individual trials&#xD;
      will be calculated. Then a total sensor-waveform covariance matrix of the target condition&#xD;
      will be calculated by averaging across the covariance matrices from individual trials for the&#xD;
      target stimuli. Then the covariance matrices across trials will be averaged. Using the total&#xD;
      covariance matrix, voxel-wise MEG source magnitude images that cover the whole brain will be&#xD;
      obtained for each subject, and each frequency band, following the Fast-VESTAL procedure, see&#xD;
      Method in (Huang et al., 2014) and Appendix in (Huang et al., 2016), measuring time-locked&#xD;
      signals during a working memory N-back task to evaluate improvements in brain function. An&#xD;
      Objective Pre-whitening Method will be applied to remove correlated environmental noise and&#xD;
      objectively select the dominant eigen-modes of sensor-waveform covariance matrix (Huang et&#xD;
      al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another goal is to study the neuronal correlates of potential cognitive dysfunctions observed&#xD;
      using behavioral measures in older adults. Voxel-wise correlation analyses will also be&#xD;
      performed to examine the association of N-back source images and neuropsychological scores.&#xD;
      All subjects will be combined together for the correlation analyses. In each frequency band,&#xD;
      the MEG source images in the MNI-152 space (following the spatial smoothing and logarithm&#xD;
      transformation) will be formed into three 4D data sets: Dimensions 1-3 represent the x-, y-,&#xD;
      and z-coordinates, and the fourth dimension represents all subjects. A total of eight data&#xD;
      sets will be created for 1- and 2-back conditions, and for four frequency bands. Next, along&#xD;
      the fourth dimension, voxel-wise repeated measure correlation analyses (Bakdash and Marusich,&#xD;
      2017) will be performed between MEG source images and each of the neuropsychological scores.&#xD;
      For each frequency band, the 1- and 2-back conditions will be treated as repeated measures in&#xD;
      such analyses. In this study, we will only examine the neuropsychological scores that show&#xD;
      statistical group differences. The repeated measure correlation analyses creates r-value&#xD;
      correlation maps, and cluster analysis that will be used to control for family-wise errors at&#xD;
      a corrected p&lt;0.01 level for the r-value maps, similar to the correction procedure for the&#xD;
      F-value maps.&#xD;
