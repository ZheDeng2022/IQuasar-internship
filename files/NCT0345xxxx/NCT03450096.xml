    <textblock>
      Randomised controlled prospective trial with 2 groups (active group with Lumbar plexus block&#xD;
      (LPB)-catheter vs control group). In a randomized controlled trial, the investigators will&#xD;
      investigate under controlled circumstances the effect of a LPB-catheter placed with&#xD;
      ultrasound guided &quot;Shamrock&quot;-technique to improve postoperative pain treatment after&#xD;
      unilateral open hip and femoral surgery in paediatric patients. The investigators will&#xD;
      investigate the effect on opioid consumption and the reduction of opioid related side effects&#xD;
      during the first 24 postoperative hours&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paediatric patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery can experience severe pain in the&#xD;
      postoperative period. When pain interferes with mobilization and joint movement, the&#xD;
      rehabilitation phase is prolonged and painful. Approximately 13% of the children undergoing&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgery report symptoms of chronic pain. Therefore, optimal pain treatment should&#xD;
      be provided during and after the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous opioids or continuous epidural blocks are commonly used for postoperative pain&#xD;
      treatment after open hip and femoral surgery. However, side effects like nausea and vomiting,&#xD;
      urinary retention, or pruritus are often related to these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar plexus blocks (LPB) are a safe and effective alternative for postoperative treatment&#xD;
      after hip and femoral surgery. Single injection LPB techniques have shown to provide good&#xD;
      pain relief during the early postoperative period in children. Paediatric patients might also&#xD;
      benefit from a catheter technique giving a prolonged postoperative analgesia. LPB provide&#xD;
      simultaneous sensory blocks of the femoral nerve and the obturator nerve. Both nerves are&#xD;
      primarily responsible for the innervation to the femoral shaft, hip joint and the pelvic&#xD;
      bones. In contrast to epidural anesthesia techniques, LPB has only unilateral effect.&#xD;
      Patients therefore achieve higher mobilization levels, resulting in early rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several ultrasound-guided lumbar plexus block techniques have been described in the past. The&#xD;
      Shamrock technique is a new LPB-technique that has shown to improve visualization of the&#xD;
      lumbar plexus, surrounding anatomy, and injection needle. The improved visualization can&#xD;
      facilitate block performance and improve safety. A catheter technique will be used for LPB to&#xD;
      provide prolonged postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized controlled trial, the investigators will investigate under controlled&#xD;
      circumstances the effect of a LPB-catheter placed with ultrasound guided &quot;Shamrock&quot;-technique&#xD;
      to improve postoperative pain treatment after unilateral open hip and femoral surgery in&#xD;
      paediatric patients. The investigators will investigate the effect on opioid consumption and&#xD;
      the reduction of opioid related side effects during the first 24 postoperative hours.&#xD;
