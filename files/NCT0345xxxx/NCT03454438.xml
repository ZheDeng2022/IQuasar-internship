      The aim of this cluster randomized controlled trial is to improve the number of effectively&#xD;
      referred patients with IRD to the rheumatology outpatient clinic with either use of validated&#xD;
      referral pro formas or triage of IRD by specialists in a primary care setting compared to&#xD;
      usual care. In addition, the investigators want to provide tools for the general practitioner&#xD;
      to recognise IRD and improve early referral of patients with IRD, and a cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to evaluate the decreasing effect on health-care cost.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Currently, only 22% of all patients referred to the rheumatologist by primary care&#xD;
      are diagnosed with an inflammatory rheumatic disease (IRD). Previous research has shown that&#xD;
      structured referral sheets and community-based specialist service improve appropriateness of&#xD;
      referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of this study is to improve the number of effectively referred patients&#xD;
      with IRD to the rheumatology outpatient clinic with either use of validated referral pro&#xD;
      formas or triage of IRD by specialists in a primary care setting compared to usual care. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators want to provide tools for the general practitioner to recognise&#xD;
      IRD and improve early referral of patients with IRD, and a cost-effectiveness analysis will&#xD;
      be performed to evaluate the decreasing effect on health-care cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Cluster randomized trial with randomization of general practitioner clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Primary care patients of 18 years or older who are suspected of an IRD and&#xD;
      considered by a GP for referral to a rheumatologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: One group of GPs will use a standardized referral strategy for IRD, another&#xD;
      group will consist of triage by a rheumatologist in the local primary care clinic, the third&#xD;
      group is usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Percentage of patients diagnosed with an IRD by a&#xD;
      rheumatologists after 12 months. In addition, cost effectiveness, quality of life, work&#xD;
      participation and health care costs at baseline and after 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: There is no additional risk to participating patients. Patients might benefit&#xD;
      from early referral since the referral pro formas point out important aspects of IRD that are&#xD;
      frequently overlooked. Patients will be requested to fill in three online questionnaires&#xD;
      related to quality of life, work participation and socio-economic costs. There are no&#xD;
      additional visits, physical examinations or other tests.&#xD;
