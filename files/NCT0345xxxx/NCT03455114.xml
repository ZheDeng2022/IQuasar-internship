  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AssiAnchor 2 is a fixation ophthalmic device. The device is manufactured by Hanita Lenses&#xD;
      from PMMA material which is being used for the production of Intra-ocular lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device is intended for patients requiring capsule centration to clip the anterior lens&#xD;
      capsule between the arms of the device and secure it to the scleral wall.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intended Use:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AssiAnchor is a device which is intended to be implanted permanently in the posterior&#xD;
      chamber of the eye for fixation of subluxated capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the safety and performance of the new AssiAnchor.&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by evaluating the rate of adverse events and adverse device effects&#xD;
      occurred throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women diagnosed with subluxated capsular bag that require lens removal surgery or in&#xD;
      malpositioned pseudophakia that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and provide written&#xD;
      informed consent will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 10 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) center will participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Subject participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of active enrolment is anticipated to last approximately 12 months. The objectives&#xD;
      of this study will be achieved when the final study subject has completed 3 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Safety Endpoint :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ease of implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stability of device within the eye&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Performance Endpoints -:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IOL stability, centration and tilt, visual acuity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single study group. This is a single arm design; there is no control device in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject requires capsule centration. Subject is between 18 and 100 years of age Subject&#xD;
      understands the study requirements and the treatment procedures and provides written Informed&#xD;
      Consent before any study-specific tests or procedures are performed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject is diagnosed with active anterior segment intraocular inflammation Subject is&#xD;
      obligated to previous participation in another study with any investigational drug or device&#xD;
      within the past 30 days Subject is pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits &amp; Procedures Pre-operative visit: 0-1 month prior the implantation procedure. The&#xD;
      visit will include subject's qualification assessment for inclusion/exclusion criteria as&#xD;
      described above. Informed consent must be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete anamnesis will be taken including subject's medical complaints, medical history,&#xD;
      medication use and ophthalmic examinations, family history and any detail relevant to the&#xD;
      cause of lens malposition Surgical procedure: Procedure will be performed under anesthesia&#xD;
      (at physician discretion) and the modified AssiAnchor will be implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: All subjects will have regularly follow-up visits up to 3 months&#xD;
      post-implantation. All postoperative visits will include a complete ophthalmic examinations,&#xD;
      medications used and recording of adverse events.&#xD;

    <description>The novel device, the capsular &quot;Anchor&quot;, was designed to secure the capsular bag to the scleral wall. The device is a one-piece, one-plane intraocular implant . It works like a paper clip; holding the anterior capsule between a central rod, placed in front of the capsule, and the two lateral arms, inserted through the eye surgery and placed behind the capsule.</description>
