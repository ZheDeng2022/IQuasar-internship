    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, nonrandomized, single-arm study using CSI Orbital Atherectomy System&#xD;
      in patients with PAD (total occlusions or significant stenosis). Patients will be enrolled if&#xD;
      they have claudication and/or critical limb ischemia, and identifiable PAD disease with&#xD;
      moderate to severe calcification on Computer Tomography Angiogram (PCA) or peripheral&#xD;
      angiogram requiring percutaneous peripheral intervention (PPI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orbital atherectomy (OA) is one of the most commonly used modalities for the treatment of&#xD;
      obstructive femoral-popliteal PAD, especially in patients with large and calcified&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaques, either as stand alone or with subsequent drug-coated balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty or stent implantation. These atherectomy procedures were primarily guided by&#xD;
      peripheral angiography which has significant resolution limitations in regards to the plaque&#xD;
      morphology and characteristics such as extent of calcification, and how deep the cuts are&#xD;
      made in the vessel wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has recently emerged as a novel imaging modality. OCT&#xD;
      imaging has been used both in coronary as well as in peripheral circulation extensively with&#xD;
      no significant device related adverse effects. Previous research has shown the feasibility&#xD;
      and safety of OCT use for peripheral artery imaging and its use in plaque characterization.&#xD;
      The hypothesis for this study is that; use of diamond back atherectomy device will lead to&#xD;
      effective removal of plaque in moderate to heavily calcified arteries without damaging deep&#xD;
      into the adventitia or EEL or the adjacent healthy vessel wall and thus will lead to a&#xD;
      favorable vascular response during follow up.&#xD;

    <description>Following peripheral angiography, patients with significant SFA or below the knee artery disease (≥ 50%) or total occlusions (100%) will have a baseline OCT imaging of the target vessel and the lesion be treated with proper size CSI burr. Repeat OCT imaging will be performed after CSI. Drug eluting balloon angioplasty may be performed in discretion of the operator. If DEB is used, a final OCT imaging will be performed to assess lesion expansion and possible dissections. Balloon sizing will be based on 1:1 vessel ratio with the length covering from minimally diseased distal segment to minimally diseased proximal segment. We will try to avoid use of stents.</description>
