      This study is a phase Ib, single arm, open label clinical trial that will enroll patients&#xD;
      with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCBL) at moderate or high risk for poor&#xD;
      outcome, defined as an NCCN-IPI score of 2 or higher. Each patient's disease will be&#xD;
      biologically characterized at baseline. Enrolled patients will receive chemoimmunotherapy&#xD;
      with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP),&#xD;
      administered every 21 days for 6 cycles, which is the standard of care. In addition, all&#xD;
      patients will receive the study drug, roflumilast, at the standard dose of 500 μg by mouth&#xD;
      once daily, throughout the 18-week treatment period.&#xD;

    <description>All patients will receive R-CHOP therapy at standard doses according to the standard preparation and infusion procedures of each investigational site, which is to be repeated every 21 days for a total of 6 cycles. All patients will receive a fixed oral dose of one 500 microgram (μg) tablet per day with or without food for all 21 days of each cycle, which will amount to a total of 126 doses of roflumilast.</description>
