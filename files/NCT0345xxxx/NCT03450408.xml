  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will compare, in a randomized clinical trial, two methods of placement&#xD;
      (placement with a gloved hand vs. placement with a sterile speculum) of a Foley bulb&#xD;
      transcervical dilator. The primary outcome is rate of infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The target population for this study is women who present for scheduled induction of labor.&#xD;
      If there is a decision by the obstetric team to place a transcervical Foley dilator for&#xD;
      cervical ripen-ning, the obstetric team will notify the research team so that the patient may&#xD;
      be screened for the study. If the patient consents to participation, written informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained by person-to-person contact. The PI, study coordinator, or a collaborator&#xD;
      will be responsible for the in-formed consent. After informed consent is obtained, the&#xD;
      patient will be randomized to the study group (digital placement) or the control group&#xD;
      (placement with a sterile speculum).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will undergo induction of labor by placement via sterile speculum of a&#xD;
      22-French transcervical Foley catheter. The cervix is visualized with a sterile vaginal&#xD;
      speculum and cleaned with iodine or chlorhexidine. A Foley catheter is introduced into the&#xD;
      cervix and the bal-loon is filled with 60 ml of sterile 0.9% NaCl. The Foley catheter will be&#xD;
      left in place for at least 12 hours, and no longer than 24 hours. After placement standard&#xD;
      intrapartum management of the patient will ensue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group will undergo induction of labor by digital blind placement of a 22-French&#xD;
      trans-cervical Foley catheter. A Foley catheter is introduced into the cervix using digits&#xD;
      and hands wearing sterile gloves and the balloon is filled with 60 ml of sterile 0.9% NaCl.&#xD;
      The Foley catheter will be left in place for at least 12 hours, and no longer than 24 hours.&#xD;
      After placement standard intrapartum management of the patient will ensue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If cervix remains unfavorable after extraction of the dilators (&lt; 3cm and at most 60%&#xD;
      effaced), a second Foley catheter will be used in this case for a maximum of 12 hrs. No&#xD;
      crossover will be allowed. In other words, a second Foley bulb will be placed in the same&#xD;
      manner as the first assignment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In any attempts, if the Foley bulb is not able to be placed in either insertion technique , a&#xD;
      prostaglandin agent for cervical ripening may be used and insertion of the mechanical dilator&#xD;
      can be re-attempted at a later time, as is the standard of care at our institution. No cross&#xD;
      over will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an unblinded randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No significant adverse effects are expected with the use of transcervical Foley catheters for&#xD;
      mechanical dilation. The most significant risks are vaginal bleeding due to cervical trauma&#xD;
      and incidental rupture of membranes, as well as pain or discomfort with placement. The&#xD;
      patient will undergo inpatient induction of labor, so any adverse reaction would be promptly&#xD;
      detected and addressed.&#xD;
