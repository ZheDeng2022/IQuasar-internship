  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer type in males and the second in&#xD;
      females, accounting for about 693,900 deaths worldwide per year. Although the annual CRC&#xD;
      mortality rate is still very high, it demonstrated a decline by 47% among men and 44% among&#xD;
      women from 1990 to 2015. This decreasing trend may be attributed to improved screening, early&#xD;
      detection as well as combined CRC treatment. In fact, the mortality rate is expected to&#xD;
      reduce further by long-term use of chemopreventive agents that can prevent the development of&#xD;
      neoplasms in the large bowel. Several decades of research both in clinic and laboratory has&#xD;
      identified aspirin as an effective synthetic CRC chemoprevention drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is commonly accepted that aspirin exerts its chemopreventive effects by inhibiting&#xD;
      catalytic enzymes cyclooxygenase (COX) -1 and COX-2 involved in prostaglandin synthesis. But&#xD;
      the mechanism of its chemopreventive effect on CRC is not clearly understood. Other than CRC,&#xD;
      aspirin also showed its potential inhibitory effects on some other types of solid cancer,&#xD;
      such as pancreatic, lung, breast and prostate cancers. However, its effects on&#xD;
      extragastrointestinal cancer types are still elusive due to lack of reliable supporting&#xD;
      evidence from randomized clinical trials. Based on current knowledge, it is unclear why&#xD;
      aspirin appears to inhibit CRC more than other cancers. This might be associated with the&#xD;
      unique microenvironment comprising trillions of microbes in which CRC resides.&#xD;

      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer type in males and the second in&#xD;
      females, accounting for about 693,900 deaths worldwide per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is commonly accepted that aspirin exerts its chemopreventive effects by inhibiting&#xD;
      catalytic enzymes cyclooxygenase (COX) -1 and COX-2 involved in prostaglandin synthesis.This&#xD;
      hypothetic mechanism is supported by clinical data from two large cohorts that found that the&#xD;
      regular use of aspirin reduced the risk of CRC with high expression of COX-2 but not with low&#xD;
      or no expression of COX-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on current knowledge, it is unclear why aspirin appears to inhibit CRC more than other&#xD;
      cancers. This might be associated with the unique microenvironment comprising trillions of&#xD;
      microbes in which CRC resides. Therefore, the investigator hypothesizes that there is a link&#xD;
      between the chemopreventive mechanism of aspirin, gut microbiota as well as the metabolome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the past decade, evidence has accumulated that microbiota in the host is highly&#xD;
      sensitive to the gut microenvironment since its composition and activity can be rapidly and&#xD;
      reproducibly changed by diet or nutrients. As such, an acidic drug like aspirin may be able&#xD;
      to alter the gut microbiota composition. It is thus conceivable that the CRC preventive&#xD;
      action of aspirin may be through the alteration of host gut microbes.&#xD;
