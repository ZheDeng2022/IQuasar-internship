  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the implantation is related with endometrial receptivity, the patient specific plasma&#xD;
      progesterone concentration influences this pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this hypothesis, the study establishes a correlation between the serum progesterone&#xD;
      measured on the day of the endometrial biopsy and the endometrial receptivity with the ERA&#xD;
      test.&#xD;

      In patients who have had problems of assisted reproduction it is essential to establish the&#xD;
      factors that contribute to the success of a cycle: correcting these factors means increasing&#xD;
      the possibility of the cycle culminating in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with embryonic implantation failures, a prevalence of non-receptive endometrium&#xD;
      has been described after performing the ERA test of around 20%. On the other hand, a study&#xD;
      that shows embryonic generation values below a certain threshold (25th percentile), presents&#xD;
      a rate of evolutionary clinical gestation and lower embryo implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is logical to think that progesterone levels are lower than the state of endometrial&#xD;
      receptivity, since the hormone is responsible for the endothelial changes that prepare the&#xD;
      uterus for implantation. It is ERA. The result of this study is the result of the evaluation&#xD;
      of the lifetime of the endometrial biopsy is related to the result of the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If desired, the determination of the probability of the day of the transfer is predictive of&#xD;
      the pregnancy rate through the impact that the hormone has on the endometrial receptivity.&#xD;
      This would allow to decide in the same cycle, if the patient should be in a transfer to&#xD;
      another dimension, or should it defer to another cycle where obtain the optimal values of&#xD;
      progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, there are no publications in the literature that have related the concentration of&#xD;
      progesterone with endometrial receptivity through ERA. This is the first prospective study&#xD;
      that analyzes this relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ERA test has been chosen for the evaluation of endometrial receptivity, which is a tool&#xD;
      that has been widely used and used in the usual clinical practice of our clinic.&#xD;
