    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open label study. The primary aim of this project is to develop a&#xD;
      controlled human malaria infection transmission model (&quot;CHMI-trans&quot;) or &quot;challenge model&quot; to&#xD;
      evaluate the capacity of vaccines, biologics (monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs), and drugs to&#xD;
      block malaria parasite transmission by assessing infectiousness of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)&#xD;
      gametocyte carriers for Anopheles mosquitoes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 24 volunteers, in two cohorts (n=12), will be randomly assigned to two groups per&#xD;
      cohort (n=6). Cohort A will be subjected to a standard controlled human malaria infection&#xD;
      (CHMI) delivered by five Pf-infected mosquitoes (groups 1 and 2). Cohort B will be subjected&#xD;
      to a standard blood stage challenge with ~2,800 Pf-infected erythrocytes by intravenous&#xD;
      injection (groups 3 and 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment is subsequently initiated to induce gametocytemia (treatment 1, T1) and to clear&#xD;
      pathogenic asexual parasites whilst leaving gametocytes unaffected (treatment 2 and 3, T2 and&#xD;
      T3). At the end of the study, treatment of all parasite stages is provided following national&#xD;
      treatment guidelines (end treatment, ET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once malaria infections are detected by 18S qPCR positive (sporozoite challenge) or on day 8&#xD;
      (blood stage challenge), all volunteers will be treated with a single oral subcurative&#xD;
      low-dose of piperaquine (LD-PIP, 480 mg, T1). Using blood samples taken twice daily, the&#xD;
      initial clearance of parasitemia will be carefully monitored. After T1, volunteers will&#xD;
      receive a second treatment (T2, LD-PIP2, 480mg) if a recrudescence of asexual parasitemia&#xD;
      occurs before day 21 post challenge infection. On day 21 or when a recrudescence occurs after&#xD;
      T2, volunteers in group 1 and 3 (LD-PIP/LD-PIP2/PIP) will be curatively treated with&#xD;
      piperaquine (960mg) and group 2 and 4 (LD-PIP/LD-PIP2/SP) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine&#xD;
      (1000mg/50mg). These treatment regimens cure asexual parasitemia while leaving immature and&#xD;
      mature gametocytes unaffected. To ensure the radical clearance of all parasite stages, all&#xD;
      volunteers will receive a final treatment (ET) according to national guidelines with&#xD;
      atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone®) on day 36. Daily blood samples will allow detailed&#xD;
      quantification of gametocytes, gametocyte sex ratio and ex vivo assessments of gametocyte&#xD;
      fitness. Additionally, blood samples will be obtained for Direct Membrane Feeding Assay&#xD;
      (DMFA) and volunteers will be subjected to Direct Skin Feeding Assays (DFA). These assays&#xD;
      will provide evidence on the infectivity of volunteers.&#xD;

All volunteers will be treated with a single oral subcurative low-dose of piperaquine (LD-PIP, 480 mg, T1). Volunteers will receive a second treatment (T2, LD-PIP2, 480mg) if a recrudescence of asexual parasitemia occurs before day 21 post challenge infection.

All volunteers will be treated with a single oral subcurative low-dose of piperaquine (LD-PIP, 480 mg, T1). Volunteers will receive a second treatment (T2, LD-PIP2, 480mg) if a recrudescence of asexual parasitemia occurs before day 21 post challenge infection. Volunteers in group 3 (LD-PIP/LD-PIP2/PIP) will be curatively treated with piperaquine (960mg)&#xD;
Piperaquine (low dose): subcurative regimen (480 mg)&#xD;
Piperaquine (high dose): Curative regimen (960mg)&#xD;
Atovaquone Proguanil: Curative regimen (1000/400 mg, for 3 days)&#xD;
Blood stage malaria challenge infection, P. falciparum 3D7: P. falciparum 3D7-infected human erythrocytes administered intravenously for the purpose controlled human malaria infection.</description>
