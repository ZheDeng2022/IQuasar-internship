  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that team work impacts patients safety. This is particularly the case in&#xD;
      surgical theatres where individuals from different backgrounds (surgeon, anaesthetists,&#xD;
      nurses, ..etc) work together to achieve a common goal which is looking after the patient. The&#xD;
      robotic theatre set up is different due to the physical separation of the surgeon from the&#xD;
      patient and the rest of the team. This may represent a communication challenge. The Study&#xD;
      investigators aim to study theatre staff experiences and practices of communication and&#xD;
      teamwork in this special setup, investigating any challenges participants may be facing and&#xD;
      possible ways of adapting to them. Staff opinions and suggestions for improvement will be&#xD;
      explored for utmost surgical performance and patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve two parts:1) individual staff interviews and 2) teamwork observations&#xD;
      during real life surgery. The two parts should complement each other giving an overall&#xD;
      picture of the teamwork in the robotic theatre setup.&#xD;

    <description>Experiences and practices in Robotic theatres will be studied via semi-structured interviews with staff as well as team observations during real time robotic surgery. As the study is a qualitative one, data collection will continue till we reach saturation of theoretical categories. We expect 20 interviews and 10 observations to suffice.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Non-Robotic procedures</arm_group_label>
    <description>Staff involved in robotic surgery will have almost definitely worked in non-robotic theatres ie major abdominal and laparoscopic. Staff interviews will explore differences in experiences and practices between these different theatre setups.&#xD;
In addition, we aim to observe further 5 non-robotic procedures to evaluate staff teamwork and communication within the more regular theatre setup.</description>
