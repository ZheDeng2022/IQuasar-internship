  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy for the treatment of several cancer entities steadily increased during the last&#xD;
      years. The data from the finalized and ongoing studies show the tremendous impact of immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibition (ICI) also for advanced metastatic patients. Especially the ICI with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and nivolumab have an increasing number of first line treatment approvals.&#xD;
      However, in particular metastatic patients which receive ICI therapy are often irradiated for&#xD;
      immediate palliation of several metastases. Preclinical work revealed that radiotherapy (RT)&#xD;
      is capable to modulate the tumor phenotype, its microenvironment in a way that systemic&#xD;
      anti-tumor immune responses are induced. However, radiation has also immune suppressive&#xD;
      properties as e.g. the expression of immune checkpoint molecules is increased following&#xD;
      radiotherapy. So the ICI therapy in combination with the RT has the potential to overcome the&#xD;
      immunotolerance of the tumor and the metastases. More and more reports therefore describe a&#xD;
      so-called systemic immune-modulating effect of radiotherapy (former and still often named as&#xD;
      abscopal effect). However the timely application of ICI and RT is often randomly and depends&#xD;
      on the clinical need for the palliative RT. The aim of this trial is therefore to standardize&#xD;
      the chronology of RT in combination with ICI, to evaluate the effects of radio-immunotherapy&#xD;
      with a stratified and comparable patient cohort. The ST-ICI study is a prospective and&#xD;
      observational study not influencing the standard therapeutic scheme and will provide hints&#xD;
      how the radio-immune therapy drives systemic anti tumor responses.&#xD;
