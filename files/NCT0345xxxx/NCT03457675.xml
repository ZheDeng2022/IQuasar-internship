  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is for participants that have been diagnosed with intractable Obsessive&#xD;
      -compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is a persistent and oftentimes disabling disorder marked by&#xD;
      unwanted and distressing thoughts (obsessions) and irresistible repetitive behaviors. OCD&#xD;
      affects 2-3% of the US population, and is responsible for substantial functional impairment&#xD;
      and increased risk of early death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only established first-line treatments for OCD are cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      with exposure/response prevention and certain medications. About 30-40% of patients fail to&#xD;
      respond and few experience complete symptom resolution. Up to 25% of patients have difficulty&#xD;
      tolerating CBT and the risk of relapse after therapies remains large. For the most severe&#xD;
      cases, neurosurgery (surgery in the brain), has long been the option of last resort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators want develop an adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation (aDBS) system&#xD;
      to use in subjects with intractable (hard to control) OCD. Deep brain stimulation remains&#xD;
      investigational for OCD patients and is not considered standard therapy. DBS involves the&#xD;
      surgical implantation of leads and electrodes into specific areas of the brain, which are&#xD;
      thought to influence the disease. A pack implanted in the chest, called the neurotransmitter,&#xD;
      keeps the electrical current coursing to the brain through a wire that connects the&#xD;
      neurotransmitter and electrodes. It is believed deep brain stimulation may restore balance to&#xD;
      dysfunctional brain circuitry implicated in OCD. The goal of this study is to enhance current&#xD;
      approaches to DBS targeting in the brain and to use a novel approach to find a better and&#xD;
      more reliable system for OCD treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ia is to gather data to eventually develop a prototype adaptive DBS system for&#xD;
      intractable OCD that uses signals from the brain to automatically adjust the DBS stimulation&#xD;
      factors. The overall goal is to improve symptom management and reduce stimulation-induced&#xD;
      behavioral side effects.&#xD;

      RECRUITMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be referred to our program by their treating clinicians, who will&#xD;
      be made aware of our study through direct clinician-clinician letters and emails. Subjects&#xD;
      may also learn of the study through consumer advocacy groups such as the International OCD&#xD;
      Foundation (IOCDF), local non-profit organizations and local support group meetings and&#xD;
      through the normals avenues that they share information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENROLLMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject is considered enrolled upon signing informed consent, deemed eligible to be&#xD;
      screened by the investigator. Decision-making capacity, which includes understanding,&#xD;
      appreciation, reasoning and ability to express a choice, will be assessed as part of the&#xD;
      informed consent process. The informed consent process will include discussions with the&#xD;
      patient's family and referring clinician. Medical records will be carefully reviewed to&#xD;
      determine adequacy of past treatments including CBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria and willing to participate in the&#xD;
      study as demonstrated by signing the informed consent will be enrolled in the study and&#xD;
      undergo screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the participant signs the required documents, he/she will undergo two baseline&#xD;
      evaluations spaced over an approximate 1 month period. Diagnostic and screening ratings are&#xD;
      completed, followed by complete medical, neurological and neurosurgical evaluations. The&#xD;
      raters will be trained and certified in the use of the clinician-administered scales of the&#xD;
      study. The purpose of the screening evaluations is to demonstrate that subject is in a stable&#xD;
      clinical situation including a stable medical regimen, and are severely symptomatic. If this&#xD;
      is the case, and they continue to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, the participant will&#xD;
      proceed to treatment (surgery to implant the DBS system. Final selection of candidates will&#xD;
      be made by consensus of the multi-disciplinary investigator team (&quot;Project Advisory&#xD;
      Committee&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects treated in Phase 1a will undergo a single stage DBS surgery, in which bilateral deep&#xD;
      brain leads will be implanted under conscious sedation, followed by implantation of a single&#xD;
      Implantable NeuroStimulator (INS), Activa PC+S, under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A head CT will be performed on the morning of surgery for stereotactic planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Employing local anesthetic (with or without sedation as clinically indicated), a&#xD;
           stereotactic headframe (Leksell Model G, Elekta Instruments, Atlanta, GA, USA) will be&#xD;
           attached to the subject's skull on the morning of surgery in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A 3D volumetric image (O-Arm 2, Medtronic Inc,, Boulder, CO, USA) will be performed for&#xD;
           purposes of defining the volumetric stereotactic headspace.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The images will be uploaded onto a Computer Workstation (Stealth S7, Medtronic, Inc.,&#xD;
           Boulder, CO, USA) equipped with stereotactic planning software (Cranial 3.0) for the&#xD;
           purpose of planning the surgery. The preoperative 3T MRI obtained prior to the surgical&#xD;
           date, will be fused with the CT scan in the surgical planning station. The initial&#xD;
           target point within the ventral striatum will be chosen based on the subject's specific&#xD;
           anatomy. The surgical trajectory to this point will also be planned in order to avoid&#xD;
           prominent vessels, the sulci, and the ventricles. The computer will generate the X, Y&#xD;
           and Z coordinates to set on the frame as well as the coronal and sagittal angles of&#xD;
           approach required to establish the desired trajectory and target point. This initial&#xD;
           target point will be modified by the subject's specific anatomy as determined by the&#xD;
           preoperative 3T MRI. The final target coordinates will be determined during this&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. While the surgeon is planning the procedure, the subject will be positioned supine on&#xD;
           the operating table. A Foley catheter will be inserted. Antibiotics will be administered&#xD;
           intravenously and vital signs will be monitored. The stereotactic head frame will be&#xD;
           fixed to the operating table for subject safety, with the head elevated for subject&#xD;
           comfort. A sterile prep and drape will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The target coordinates will be set on the stereotactic frame bringing the target point&#xD;
           to the center of the operating arc. Additional local anesthetic will be given at the&#xD;
           point of incision. Following incision, a 14 mm burr hole will be made employing a&#xD;
           self-stopping perforator. The burr hole cap provided with the DBS lead will be secured&#xD;
           to the skull with two screws. The dura will be coagulated and incised. The pial surface&#xD;
           will be gently coagulated and a small incision will be made to allow easy entry of the&#xD;
           electrode guides, which will be inserted to the brain according to standard stereotactic&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A microelectrode (MER) probe will be inserted through the cannula and advanced in sub mm&#xD;
           steps until the target is reached. Intraoperative image guidance will be obtained to&#xD;
           ensure the MER probe is not mechanically deviated from target. If a deviation is&#xD;
           identified, the stereotactic headframe will be adjusted accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Once the above adjustments have been made, the DBS quadripolar electrode (model 3387;&#xD;
           Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) will be inserted through the guide tube to the&#xD;
           target point. Reticles will be attached to the frame and intraoperative imaging will be&#xD;
           employed to confirm that the lead tip is positioned at the target and assess for the&#xD;
           presence of intracerebral hemorrhage. Sedation will be withdrawn. An extension cable&#xD;
           will be connected to the lead sterilely and the other end will be passed off the field&#xD;
           to be connected to an external pulse generator so that test stimulation may be&#xD;
           performed. Test stimulation will be performed via each contact to 1) assess for&#xD;
           stimulation-induced side effects and 2) monitor for acute changes in behavior using a&#xD;
           Likert-type scale to assess anxiety, arousal, and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Intra-operative X-ray imaging may be performed as needed (up to 4 times per side) to&#xD;
           ensure proper target has been reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. A post-implantation 3D volumetric scan will be performed to confirm the electrode&#xD;
           position.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Intra operative MER and behavioral testing of Stimulation with AFAR video recording will&#xD;
           be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Steps 5-9 above will be performed to insert the second electrode on the other side of&#xD;
           the brain to complete implantation of both electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. If there are no untenable side effects, the leads will be secured to the skull with the&#xD;
           burr hole caps. The free end of the leads will be left in the sub-galeal space and the&#xD;
           incisions will be closed in anatomical layers.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. The headframe will be removed and general anesthesia will be induced. The Activa PC+S&#xD;
           pulse generator will then be implanted and connected to the brain lead via extension&#xD;
           cables.&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. A post-operative CT scan will be performed prior to discharge -to ensure that an&#xD;
           intracerebral hemorrhage has not occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. The subject will be taken to the Recovery Room or the Neurosurgery ICU for&#xD;
           post-operative monitoring (See below) and will be discharged from the hospital after at&#xD;
           least one night of observation and when clinically stable. A Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)&#xD;
           may be run on the subject to confirm they are clinically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. The subject will return to the neurosurgery clinic (Visit 4) for post-operative&#xD;
           evaluation according to normal clinical practice (approx 1 week after surgery). The&#xD;
           wounds will be inspected and the subject's neurological status will be assessed. Sutures&#xD;
           will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will return to clinic about 2 weeks post-surgery for their post-surgical&#xD;
      psychiatric symptom baseline and recording visit (Visit 5). Programming of the DBS device&#xD;
      will occur at Visit 6, 1 week later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will return to clinic every 2 weeks for the first 2 months following the system&#xD;
      activation. Each visit will last about 3-4 hours and will include clinician administered&#xD;
      assessments, self-rated assessments, recordings and tasks to be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-surgical 1.5 rs-fMRI scans will also be performed according to Medtronic standard&#xD;
      post-implant MRI guidelines for deep brain stimulation systems to ensure safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to keep their current medications constant for the first 6 months&#xD;
      post-surgery. However, clinical circumstances which mandate changes will be allowed and&#xD;
      notated should this occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provocation Tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Provocation OC task (Provoc) and the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) will be used to&#xD;
      start OC-related distress and distress unrelated to OCD (e.g., performance anxiety),&#xD;
      respectively. Three sessions will be videotaped with Automated Facial Affect Recognition&#xD;
      (AFAR) system concurrent to recording of local field potentials (LFPs) from VS and scalp&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBT Augmentation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting at Month 7, subjects will receive a two-month (15 session) cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy (CBT) course where exposure and response prevention (ERP) for OCD will be delivered.&#xD;
      Subjects already receiving stable CBT will be allowed to continue it during the study.&#xD;
      Instead, we have developed standardized instructions to encourage exposure and resist&#xD;
      compulsions (ERP) during this portion of the trial. Participants will be encouraged at study&#xD;
      visits to actively confront OC triggers while refraining from ritual engagement. Subjects,&#xD;
      especially those who are still habitually avoiding, will be given the opportunity to derive&#xD;
      maximal clinical benefit by receiving a two-month &quot;refresher&quot; course of CBT prior to entering&#xD;
      the double-blind discontinuation phase at 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double Blinded Discontinuation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the one-month blinded discontinuation period is to confirm clinical benefit.&#xD;
      At the end of month 8, subjects will enter a one-month delayed onset withdrawal period in&#xD;
      which the subject and Independent Evaluators are blinded to timing of discontinuation. The&#xD;
      decision whether to reinstate active DBS at the end of the discontinuation will be based on&#xD;
      clinical considerations in discussion with the subject and significant others. The benefits&#xD;
      and discomforts will be carefully weighed in arriving at a long-term plan. Escape criteria&#xD;
      will include withdrawing consent or significant clinical deterioration warranting unblinding&#xD;
      or reinstatement of treatment. Following exit from the discontinuation period, treatment will&#xD;
      recommence as clinically indicated, including stimulation resumption or continued observation&#xD;
      with the device off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monthly Programming/Classification/Evaluation Visits until End of Study (EOS):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Months 10-18 (Visits 20-28) - Following exit from the discontinuation phase based on clinical&#xD;
      indication, treatment will recommence as clinically indicated around Month 10, including&#xD;
      stimulation resumption or continued observation with device off. Refining state&#xD;
      classifications and testing machine learning will continue, if stimulation is reinstated.&#xD;
      Subjects that participated in the discontinuation phase will be considered off-treatment once&#xD;
      Month 18 visit (Visit 298) has occurred.These visits will take place monthly for 9 months.&#xD;
      Each visit will last approximately 3-4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 18 months of the study, the device will remain implanted in those subjects who are&#xD;
      doing well clinically. For subjects who are not responsive, it will be explanted, if the&#xD;
      surgical risks of explantation are deemed acceptable by the treatment team. The follow-up&#xD;
      management will be arranged on a case-by-case basis, depending on geographic location and&#xD;
      desires of the subject, and DBS therapy management by our team will be guaranteed for at&#xD;
      least two years if subjects continue to receive DBS therapy and do not arrange alternative&#xD;
      management during that period. Attempts will be made to collect all device-related adverse&#xD;
      events in all willing participants at 6-month intervals after they exit the currently&#xD;
      proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject participation is anticipated to continue for a minimum of 18 months.&#xD;
