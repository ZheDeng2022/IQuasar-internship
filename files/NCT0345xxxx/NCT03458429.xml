      1. Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           To determine the safety and tolerability of 12 once monthly transfusions of GMFFP&#xD;
           (Granulocyte - Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) Mobilized Fresh Frozen Plasma harvested&#xD;
           from young, healthy donors), given to older, frail individuals who are at risk due to&#xD;
           unhealthy aging and who will then have a subsequent 12-month follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy in older, frail individuals of 12 once monthly transfusions of&#xD;
      GMFFP (Granulocyte - Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) Mobilized Fresh Frozen Plasma&#xD;
      harvested from young, healthy donors), and a subsequent 12-month follow-up period, to improve&#xD;
      the Immune Risk Profile, (&quot;IRP&quot;), cognitive function (MME), quality of life (OPQOL-35),&#xD;
      Frailty Index (&quot;FI&quot;), associated with unhealthy aging in the treated subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There have been recent reports in medical literature about the discovery that young mice's&#xD;
      blood plasma when infused into aged mice caused regeneration of organs such as liver, and&#xD;
      brain. There are certain factors present in the young blood which have been shown to improve&#xD;
      the function of the organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, transferring of young blood plasma to treat the effect of aging has already been&#xD;
      attempted by a few doctors. In addition, fresh frozen blood plasma is currently used to treat&#xD;
      patients who have disorders of blood clotting and immune disorders and is regarded as the&#xD;
      standard of care by the medical community and as a safe treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past 25 years, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) concentrates have replaced bone&#xD;
      marrow as the source for autologous stem cell transplants. Each year approximately 20,000&#xD;
      healthy individuals receive a protein call Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) in&#xD;
      order to stimulate and release stem cells from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood and&#xD;
      these stem cells are collected and reinfused into patients who have blood cancers and other&#xD;
      immune disorders. Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) has been approved by the FDA&#xD;
      for mobilization of the stem cells and collection of an individual's own stem cells. In a&#xD;
      standard peripheral blood stem cell transplant the stem cells as well as the plasma are&#xD;
      collected from the donor and is reinfused into the patient for treatment. There are recent&#xD;
      reports in the medical literature that mobilized stem cells secrete certain factors into the&#xD;
      plasma of the blood and that these factors may be important for the regenerative capabilities&#xD;
      of stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transfusion of the plasma which contains these factors, secreted by the stem cells, which&#xD;
      come from young individuals and are free of stem cells, may be an effective treatment for&#xD;
      frailty and immune dysfunction in older individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the treatment is considered experimental (investigational) because we are&#xD;
      evaluating the safety and effectiveness of healthy donor plasma which contains the factors&#xD;
      secreted by stem cells for the treatment of frailty and immune dysfunction. The plan of this&#xD;
      study is to enroll about 30 subjects for treatment and follow up evaluation over a time&#xD;
      period of two years (24 months).&#xD;
