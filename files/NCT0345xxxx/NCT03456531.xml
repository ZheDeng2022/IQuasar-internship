      Adhesive capsulitis (also known as frozen shoulder) is a painful and disabling disorder of&#xD;
      unclear cause in which the shoulder capsule, the connective tissue surrounding the&#xD;
      glenohumeral joint of the shoulder, becomes inflamed and stiff, greatly restricting motion&#xD;
      and causing chronic pain. Pain is usually constant, worse at night, and with cold weather.&#xD;
      Certain movements or bumps can provoke episodes of tremendous pain and cramping. The&#xD;
      condition is thought to be caused by injury or trauma to the area and may have an autoimmune&#xD;
      component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frozen shoulder patients usually present in the sixth decade of life, and onset before the&#xD;
      age of 40 is very uncommon. The peak age is 56, and the condition occurs slightly more often&#xD;
      in women than men In 6-17% of patients, the other shoulder becomes affected, usually within&#xD;
      five years, and after the first has resolved .The non-dominant shoulder is slightly more&#xD;
      likely to be affected. Few attempts have been made to calculate the cumulative lifetime risk&#xD;
      of frozen shoulder. In the Scandinavian population at risk, it has been estimated at a&#xD;
      minimum of 2% per year. Recurrence is highly unusual.Frozen shoulder can be a primary or&#xD;
      idiopathic problem or it may be associated with another systemic illness. By far the most&#xD;
      common association of a secondary frozen shoulder is diabetes mellitus. The incidence of&#xD;
      frozen shoulder in diabetes patients is reported to be 10%-36%. The incidence in type 1 and&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes is similar.Unfortunately, frozen shoulder in diabetes is often more severe&#xD;
      and is more resistant to treatment . The natural history of the diabetic painful stiff&#xD;
      shoulder and found a restriction in the range of motion in 35 (65%) of 54 shoulders at a mean&#xD;
      follow-up of 29 months . There is an association with Dupuytren's disease in the hand,&#xD;
      proposing that the contracting shoulder tissue itself represents a form of fibromatosis .&#xD;
      Much more rarely, secondary frozen shoulder may be associated with conditions such as&#xD;
      hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism and hypoadrenalism. Additional associations include&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease, cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, and stroke although the pathological&#xD;
      condition here may be different from idiopathic frozen shoulder. Clearly, in the case of&#xD;
      stroke, shoulder stiffness may be simply the result of muscle spasticity in the shoulder&#xD;
      region.Frozen shoulder has also been reported subsequent to non-shoulder surgical procedures,&#xD;
      such as cardiac surgery cardiac catheterisation through the brachial artery neurosurgery and&#xD;
      radical neck dissection .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stages of frozen shoulder are 3 stages Freezing In the &quot;freezing&quot; stage, the patient&#xD;
      slowly has more and more pain. As the pain worsens, the shoulder loses range of motion.&#xD;
      Freezing typically lasts from 6 weeks to 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frozen Painful symptoms may actually improve during this stage, but the stiffness remains.&#xD;
      During the 4 to 6 months of the &quot;frozen&quot; stage, daily activities may be very difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thawing Shoulder motion slowly improves during the &quot;thawing&quot; stage. Complete return to normal&#xD;
      or close to normal strength and motion typically takes from 6 months to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Movement of the shoulder is severely restricted, with progressive loss of both active and&#xD;
      passive range of motion The condition is sometimes caused by injury, leading to lack of use&#xD;
      due to pain, but also often arises spontaneously with no obvious preceding trigger factor&#xD;
      (idiopathic frozen shoulder). Rheumatic disease progression and recent shoulder surgery can&#xD;
      also cause a pattern of pain and limitation similar to frozen shoulder. Intermittent periods&#xD;
      of use may cause inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One sign of a frozen shoulder is that the joint becomes so tight and stiff that it is nearly&#xD;
      impossible to carry out simple movements, such as raising the arm. The movement that is most&#xD;
      severely inhibited is external rotation of the shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In frozen shoulder, there is a lack of synovial fluid, which normally helps the shoulder&#xD;
      joint, a ball and socket joint, move by lubricating the gap between the humerus(upper arm&#xD;
      bone) and the socket in the shoulder blade. The shoulder capsule thickens, swells, and&#xD;
      tightens due to bands of scar tissue (adhesions) that have formed inside the capsule. As a&#xD;
      result, there is less room in the joint for the humerus, making movement of the shoulder&#xD;
      stiff and painful. This restricted space between the capsule and ball of the humerus&#xD;
      distinguishes adhesive capsulitis from a less complicated, painful, stiff shoulder .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frozen shoulder generally gets better over time, although it may take up to 3 years.The focus&#xD;
      of treatment is to control pain and restore motion and strength through physical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonsurgical Treatment More than 90% of patients improve with relatively simple treatments to&#xD;
      control pain and restore motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines. Drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen reduce pain and&#xD;
      swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steroid injections. Cortisone is a powerful anti-inflammatory medicine that is injected&#xD;
      directly into shoulder joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical therapy. Specific exercises will help restore motion. These may be under the&#xD;
      supervision of a physical therapist or via a home program. Therapy includes stretching or&#xD;
      range of motion exercises for the shoulder. Sometimes heat is used to help loosen the&#xD;
      shoulder up before the stretching exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Treatment If symptoms are not relieved by therapy and anti-inflammatory medicines,&#xD;
      surgery may be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of surgery for frozen shoulder is to stretch and release the stiffened joint&#xD;
      capsule. The most common methods include manipulation under anesthesia and shoulder&#xD;
      arthroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manipulation under anesthesia. During this procedure shoulder will be forced to move which&#xD;
      causes the capsule and scar tissue to stretch or tear. This releases the tightening and&#xD;
      increases range of motion Shoulder arthroscopy. In this procedure, the surgeon will cut&#xD;
      through tight portions of the joint capsule. This is done using pencil-sized instruments&#xD;
      inserted through small incisions around the shoulder In many cases, manipulation and&#xD;
      arthroscopy are used in combination to obtain maximum results. Most patients have very good&#xD;
      outcomes with these procedures.&#xD;
