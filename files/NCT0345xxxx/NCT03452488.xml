    <textblock>
      SARA-INT is a phase 2 interventional study performed in Europe and USA aimed to evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical benefits, safety and tolerability of the investigational drug BIO101 administered&#xD;
      orally for a six-month (26 weeks) duration to older patients, community dwelling men and&#xD;
      women aged ≥65 years, suffering from age-related sarcopenia (including sarcopenic obesity),&#xD;
      and at risk of mobility disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial will collect and analyse data on physical&#xD;
      performance and body composition and will specifically focus on the change of one functional&#xD;
      measurement, the gait speed measured during the 400MW test plus the change of a highly&#xD;
      standardised patient reported outcome (PRO), the physical function domain PF-10 at the SF-36&#xD;
      auto-evaluation questionnaire, in order to estimate the efficacy of BIO101 administered over&#xD;
      26 weeks, in preventing mobility disability in the target population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      SARA-INT is a three- arm interventional, phase 2, randomized, double blind placebo controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial. It will be conducted in the EU (Belgium, France and Italy) and in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      334 community dwelling older adults (men or women≥65 years) reporting loss of physical&#xD;
      function and considered at risk of mobility disability, will be selected to perform SPPB&#xD;
      (Short Physical Performance Battery)1 tests. Those with SPPB scores ≤ 8 will be selected to&#xD;
      perform body composition analysis with DEXA Scan. (DEXA Scans performed no more than 8 weeks&#xD;
      before the date of randomization will be acceptable and in that case should not be repeated&#xD;
      up to the end of the study visit). Participants with ALM/BMI &lt; 0.789 in men and &lt; 0.512 in&#xD;
      women, or ALM &lt;19.75kg in men and &lt;15.02kg in women corresponding to the operational&#xD;
      definition of sarcopenia according to the criteria of FNIH, will be definitively included and&#xD;
      randomized if other inclusion/exclusion criteria are also satisfied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching objective of SARA-INT clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of BIO101 26-week oral administration on the prevention of mobility disability in at-risk,&#xD;
      community dwelling older adults (≥65 years) reporting loss of physical function over the&#xD;
      previous year, and in particular:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To estimate treatment effect improvement on physical function after six-month treatment&#xD;
           versus placebo in the target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate treatment effect on decrease of risk of mobility disability after six-month&#xD;
           treatment versus placebo in the target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of SARA-INT is to evaluate the effects of two daily doses of BIO101&#xD;
      versus placebo on mobility function as measured by the gait speed during the 400MW test&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first key secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of BIO101 on physical function&#xD;
      from the patient's perspective using an adapted patient reported outcome (PRO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second key objective is to assess on a simplified function test, i.e. raising from a&#xD;
      chair, a minimal clinically significant benefit on mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARA-INT other secondary objectives are: To assess changes in body composition and&#xD;
      specifically on appendicular lean body mass, which is an expression of sarcopenia; To&#xD;
      estimate the change of 400MW test as a dichotomous variable, for possible use in further&#xD;
      studies; To estimate the effect on muscular strength; To assess the overall change on SPPB as&#xD;
      cumulative expression of a physically frail status; To estimate the effect on a sarcopenia&#xD;
      specific PRO, in view of future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARA-INT exploratory objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare plasma and/or urinary levels of putative biomarkers of sarcopenia and of drug&#xD;
           activity, and calculate their correlation with physical function changes over the study&#xD;
           duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare change from baseline of the estimated cumulative daily activity as&#xD;
           continuously recorded via a connected wearable actimeter device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A selection of physical activity indexes (by actimetry) will be described and a correlation&#xD;
      with primary and key secondary outcome will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plan is divided in a) screening and randomization phase; and b) treatment and&#xD;
      evaluation phase and c) post-treatment follow-up. The recruitment is estimated to last 24&#xD;
      months. The investigational phase will comprise three main visits, the inclusion visit, the&#xD;
      3-month evaluation and the 6-month final evaluation visit, plus an intermediate visit after&#xD;
      1-month focused on safety assessment. Telephone interviews will be conducted at 5 months and&#xD;
      6 weeks after the end of treatment.&#xD;
