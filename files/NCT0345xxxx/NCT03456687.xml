    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate how the brain and motor behavior changes&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) over time in response to Exenatide. In previous clinical trials, PD&#xD;
      patients have experienced symptomatic improvement on Exenatide and literature suggests it may&#xD;
      help slow the progression of Parkinson's. Both will be evaluated in this study.&#xD;

      Participants will receive baseline testing to confirm a diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease and&#xD;
      to determine eligibility in the research study. All of the participants in this study will&#xD;
      receive the study drug (Exenatide). The study drug will be provided at the end of the first&#xD;
      visit, and participants will be administered the drug once per week for the duration of the&#xD;
      study (1 year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the research study the following test may occur: (1) questionnaires about quality of&#xD;
      life and depression; (2) tests to measure strength and motor function; (3) tests to measure&#xD;
      cognition; (4) orientation session to learn a precision gripping task; (5) functional MRI&#xD;
      scan of the brain; (6) structural MRI scan of the brain.&#xD;
