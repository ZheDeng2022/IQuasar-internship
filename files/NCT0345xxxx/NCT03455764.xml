  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of targeted therapies as a possible treatment&#xD;
      for advanced melanoma that was found to have a BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K genetic mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MCS110&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dabrafenib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trametinib&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an&#xD;
      investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the&#xD;
      investigational intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the&#xD;
      intervention is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved MSC110 as a treatment for&#xD;
      any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved dabrafenib and trametinib as treatment options for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dabrafenib and trametinib attack different proteins that promote the growth of cancerous&#xD;
      cells. These two treatments work in cancers with a mutation in the BRAF gene which alters a&#xD;
      protein signaling pathway in cancer cells. The BRAF mutation status will be confirmed during&#xD;
      this trial by review or procedure in order to make sure this clinical trial is right for the&#xD;
      participant. Dabrafenib is a BRAF inhibitor that works by preventing altered BRAF proteins&#xD;
      from stimulating the growth of the melanoma cancer cells. Trametinib works by blocking a&#xD;
      protein related to BRAF called MEK that has been known to stimulate cells that also promote&#xD;
      melanoma growth. In order to participate in the study, the participant disease needs to be&#xD;
      tested positive for a mutation (a permanent change in the DNA sequence of a gene) of the BRAF&#xD;
      gene that belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the&#xD;
      potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. Once the BRAF gene is mutated, the&#xD;
      normal functioning of the BRAF protein may be changed. It is normal for patients with a BRAF&#xD;
      mutation to receive these types of inhibitor therapies at some point in their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCS110 is a colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) inhibitor. It is a human monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      which binds CSF-1. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein made in the laboratory that can&#xD;
      locate and bind to substances in the body, including tumor cells. MCS110 is being developed&#xD;
      as a treatment for patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are adding MCS110 to the treatment with dabrafenib&#xD;
      and trametinib at the time when the participant's disease is growing despite these&#xD;
      medications. The hope is that MCS110 will enhance how the cancer will respond to dabrafenib&#xD;
      and trametinib and overcome any resistance to these medications that has developed. In&#xD;
      previous laboratory studies performed by treating melanoma cancer cells with a CSF-1R (CSF-1&#xD;
      Receptor which interacts with the CSF-1 protien) inhibitor and a BRAF inhibitor, it was found&#xD;
      that the CSF-1R inhibitor was successful in increasing efficacy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For enrollment to the phase I portion: participants must have a histologically&#xD;
             confirmed melanoma with a BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutation (identified via NextGen&#xD;
             sequencing using the DFCI/BWH OncoPanel or any CLIA-certified method) that is&#xD;
             metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative measures do not exist or&#xD;
             are no longer effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For enrollment to the phase II portion: participants must have a histologically&#xD;
             confirmed melanoma with a BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutation (identified via NextGen&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants enrolling to the phase I portion of the trial must have evaluable or&#xD;
             measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants enrolling to the phase II portion of the trial must have measurable&#xD;
             disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least&#xD;
             one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis&#xD;
             for nodal lesions) as ≥ 10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam.&#xD;
             See Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years. As no dosing or adverse event data are currently available in&#xD;
             participants &lt; 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study but will be&#xD;
             eligible for future pediatric trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0 - 2 (see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 K/uL&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  PT-INR ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN (for participants on anticoagulation therapy, ≤&#xD;
                  1.5 × their baseline value)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  aPTT ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN (for participants on anticoagulation therapy, ≤&#xD;
                  1.5 × their baseline value)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a QTc of ≤ 470 msec for females and ≤ 450 for males on the&#xD;
             screening EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of MCS110, trametinib and dabrafenib on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
             unknown. For this reason and because anti-cancer agents are known to be teratogenic,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and for 4 months after the last dose of MCS110.&#xD;
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after&#xD;
             completion of MCS110 administration. Highly Effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on&#xD;
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                  subject&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement&#xD;
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of&#xD;
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for&#xD;
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. In case of use&#xD;
                  of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a&#xD;
                  minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Double-barrier contraception: condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                  cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent&#xD;
                  (foam/gel/cream/suppository).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have archival tumor tissue available. Participants without archival&#xD;
             tissue may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All prior anti-cancer treatment-related toxicities (except alopecia and laboratory&#xD;
             values as listed on Table 1) must be ≤ Grade 1 according to the Common Terminology&#xD;
             Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAE version 4.0; NCI, 2009) at the time of&#xD;
             randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biologic therapy, major surgery,&#xD;
             or another investigational agent within 3 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin&#xD;
             C) prior to entering the study. Previous BRAF/MEK inhibitor use is allowed with no&#xD;
             washout period for the phase I and II portions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have not recovered to ≤ CTCAE grade 1 or baseline from toxicity as a&#xD;
             result of previous cancer treatment prior to entering the study (with the exception of&#xD;
             alopecia and peripheral neuropathy which can be ≤ grade 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For enrollment to the phase II portion: participants who have not received prior BRAF&#xD;
             or MEK inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known untreated brain metastases should be excluded from this&#xD;
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events. Participants with a history of brain metastases that have&#xD;
             been treated, are no longer taking corticosteroids, and have been stable on imaging&#xD;
             for ≥ 4 weeks following the last date of treatment are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to MCS110, dabrafenib, or trametinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because MCS110, dabrafenib and trametinib&#xD;
             are anti-cancer agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Pregnancy status will be verified at various points in the trial and a serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test will be required. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with MCS110, dabrafenib&#xD;
             or trametinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             MCS110, dabrafenib or trametinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a known history of HIV are ineligible because of the potential for&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with MCS110, dabrafenib, and trametinib with&#xD;
             antiretroviral agents. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal&#xD;
             infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a personal or family history of long QT syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of a second primary malignancy. Exceptions include:&#xD;
             patients with a history of malignancies that were treated curatively and have not&#xD;
             recurred within 3 years prior to study entry; resected basal and squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinomas of the skin, and completely resected carcinoma in situ of any type.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with impairment of GI function or GI disease that may significantly alter&#xD;
             the absorption of dabrafenib and trametinib in the opinion of the treating&#xD;
             investigator (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,&#xD;
             malabsorption syndrome, small bowel resection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are unable to swallow or retain oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants that require co-administration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors, as&#xD;
             these medications may alter dabrafenib and trametinib concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who require treatment with medications that are strong or moderate CYP3A&#xD;
             inducers, as these medications may alter the concentration of trametinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with evidence of retinal pathology on ophthalmologic examination that is&#xD;
             considered a risk factor for neurosensory retinal detachment/central serous&#xD;
             chorioretinopathy (CSCR), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), or neovascular macular&#xD;
             degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion or&#xD;
             retinal pigment epithelial detachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants taking corticosteroids (≥ 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent). Exceptions&#xD;
             may be discussed with the Overall PI on a case by case basis.&#xD;
