      This is a phase 1, single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multiple&#xD;
      ascending-dose study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of oral TP-271 in healthy&#xD;
      adult subjects. Male or female subjects aged 18 to 50 years who fulfill the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 5 cohorts of 8 subjects each (up to a total of 40 subjects) will be enrolled. Subjects&#xD;
      in each cohort will be randomized 6:2 to receive multiple oral doses of TP 271 or placebo.&#xD;
      Every effort will be made to dose all subjects in a cohort on the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doses of study drug will be administered orally either once daily in the morning or twice&#xD;
      daily in the morning and evening from Days 1 to 7. In all subjects, the morning dose will be&#xD;
      administered following an overnight fast (minimum 8 hours) of food and all beverages, except&#xD;
      for water. For subjects in Cohorts D and E only, the evening dose will be administered&#xD;
      following a minimum 3-hour fast of food and all beverages, except for water. Fasting in all&#xD;
      cohorts will continue for at least 2 hours following each study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Screening Period (within 28 days prior to the subject receiving study drug), each&#xD;
      subject will be assessed for eligibility. Each subject must sign and date an ICF prior to&#xD;
      undergoing any study-related procedures.&#xD;
