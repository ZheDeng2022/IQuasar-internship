  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long term objective is to develop a gel to be used as a male contraceptive.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, phase IIb, open label, single arm, multicenter study. The study&#xD;
      protocol consists of a screening phase lasting 4 to 8 weeks, a suppression phase estimated up&#xD;
      to 20 weeks, a 52-week maintenance/efficacy phase, and a 24-week (estimated) recovery phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve approximately 420 couples recruited throughout the CCTN that meet&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. The nine sites propose to enroll up to 420 couples (about 30 to 60&#xD;
      couples per site) with a goal of obtaining 200 couples completing the contraceptive efficacy&#xD;
      phase of the study. The study has four phases (screening phase, suppression phase, efficacy&#xD;
      phase and recovery phase) with monthly visits to provide the male participants with the&#xD;
      NES-8/T-62 gel, to encourage adherence, to monitor for possible side effects, and to quantify&#xD;
      semen parameters. The female will be contacted monthly and come in for a visit every three&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

The amount of gel to be applied daily will be approximately 5 mL in volume (2.5 mL to each shoulder and upper arm per day). This daily gel volume will contain approximately 62 mg of T that will deliver 6 mg T to the body per day and will also contain 8 mg of NES that will deliver about 0.8 mg NES to the body per day (NES 8 mg/day + T 62 mg/day (NES-8/T-62) gel).</description>

    <description>The combined gel is a transdermal treatment that will be applied daily for 52 weeks to a male subject's arms and shoulders. The formulation will be a hydro alcoholic gel containing about 1.43% T (14.3 mg T/g gel). About 9 to 14% of the steroid (T or NES) in the gel applied is available to the body. The amount of gel to be applied each application will be approximately 5 mL in volume. The gel application volume will contain 62 mg of T that will deliver approximately 6 mg T to the body per day. This gel volume will also contain 8 mg of NES that will deliver about 0.8 mg of NES to the body per day (NES 8 mg/d + T 62 mg/d (NES8/T62) gel).</description>
