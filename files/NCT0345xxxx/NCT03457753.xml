  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability, with emphasis&#xD;
      on the oral cavity, of ROSF (containing riluzole 50mg) in subjects with amyotrophic lateral&#xD;
      sclerosis (ALS) administered twice daily for 12 weeks. Secondary objectives include (1) to&#xD;
      record the subject's assessment of any difficulty taking riluzole administered as ROSF and&#xD;
      any difficulty taking riluzole in the tablet formulation and (2) to record the relative&#xD;
      preference, if any, of subjects and caretakers, for riluzole administered as ROSF vs. the&#xD;
      riluzole tablet.&#xD;

      The total study participant time is expected to be approximately 14 weeks from time of&#xD;
      screening to completion of study. Subjects will be instructed on the use of ROSF and receive&#xD;
      the first dose of ROSF under supervision of the investigator during Visit 1.Subjects will&#xD;
      then continue on ROSF 50mg twice daily for 12 weeks.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Subjects having a diagnosis of probable or definite ALS in accordance with the&#xD;
             Revisited El-Escorial Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must have no known allergy to riluzole or inactive ingredients* in ROSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects or subject's legally authorized representative must be willing and able to&#xD;
             complete informed consent/assent and HIPAA authorization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability to comprehend and be informed of the nature of the study, as assessed by the&#xD;
             Primary or Sub-Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects prescribed to take riluzole at or before the time of first dose. (The study&#xD;
             is open to subjects currently taking riluzole at screening, subjects who are not&#xD;
             currently taking riluzole at screening but who have taken riluzole in the past, and&#xD;
             subjects to be newly started on riluzole (given as ROSF in the course of this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Availability to volunteer for the entire study duration and willing to adhere to all&#xD;
             protocol requirements.&#xD;

             within 5 half-lives of the investigational drug -whichever is the longer period.&#xD;
             However, subjects who have previously completed other Aquestive sponsored ROSF&#xD;
             clinical studies within the last 30 days prior to enrollment may be eligible for&#xD;
             consideration for entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with known history or presence of moderate or severe renal impairment as&#xD;
             defined by a calculated creatinine clearance of ≤50 mL/minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects currently taking riluzole with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels greater&#xD;
             than 5 times upper limit of normal or with evidence of clinical jaundice. (Riluzole&#xD;
             should be discontinued in these patients.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects who will be receiving riluzole for the first time who exhibit baseline&#xD;
             elevations of several liver function tests (especially elevated bilirubin). (These&#xD;
             findings at baseline should preclude the use of riluzole including ROSF.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Use of potentially hepatotoxic drugs: (e.g., allopurinol, methyldopa, sulfasalazine).&#xD;

             inducers (e.g. rifampin and barbiturates) in the previous 30 days before first drug&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Employee or immediate relative of an employee of the investigator, MonoSol Rx LLC, any&#xD;
             of its affiliates or partners, or inVentiv Health.&#xD;
&#xD;

             increased risk or preclude the subject's full compliance with or completion of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
