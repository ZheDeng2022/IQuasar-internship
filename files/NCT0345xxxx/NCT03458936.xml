  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RAD study is a longitudinal study to prospectively characterize the biological mechanisms&#xD;
      of resilience in adolescents and young adults at risk for developing depression. The study&#xD;
      will capture biomarkers from the domains of socio-demographic and clinical data, cognitive&#xD;
      and psychological assessments, fluid-based biomarkers, neuroimaging and EEG. Such biomarkers&#xD;
      will compose a human biosignature of resilience and identify risk factors for depression,&#xD;
      contributing to effective treatment selection or may represent moderators of response or&#xD;
      non-response to treatments in subjects with depression. A cohort of 1,500 participants, age&#xD;
      10-24 will be recruited over a 5 year period. Participants will be followed for 10 years&#xD;
      following an initial baseline visit. Study visits are conducted 4 times per year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this initiative is to implement a prospective study that will allow&#xD;
      the investigators to identify and validate biosignatures of resilience. Specifically, the&#xD;
      research will identify protective factors (socio-demographic, lifestyle, clinical and&#xD;
      behavioral assessments, fluid-based biomarkers, genomics, neuroimaging, EEG and cell-based&#xD;
      assays) that reduce risk of developing mood and anxiety disorders in adolescents and young&#xD;
      adults at risk for these illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence and severity of symptoms will be assessed over 10 years using questionnaires for&#xD;
      symptom changes, social factors, and overall quality of life. Other outcomes generated from&#xD;
      this study will include rate of change in quantitative measures of brain function, of&#xD;
      depression relevant brain regions correlated with systems-levels behavior and other&#xD;
      functional neuro-circuitry MRI measures. Rate of change of specified biochemical biomarkers&#xD;
      will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integration of these measures will provide an unmatched understanding into the mechanisms of&#xD;
      resilience and protection against depression and anxiety disorders, and holds tremendous&#xD;
      promise for identifying targets for prevention strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 Examine baseline biosignatures and independent factors (demographic, social,&#xD;
      environmental, genetic, EEG, and fMRI) associated with resilience in at-risk adolescents and&#xD;
      young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 Examine changes in the biomarker factors annually for 10 years to determine for&#xD;
      plasticity of these biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 Examine the interaction between psychiatric symptoms and changes in the biopsychosocial&#xD;
      signature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this, the investigators determined that the most promising variables to evaluate&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comprehensive clinical phenotype;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Magnetic resonance imaging using MRI measures of cortical structure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess cortical white matter tract integrity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using multiple tasks to assess brain&#xD;
           activation patterns to both emotional conflict and reward-dependent learning tasks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cortical and subcortical brain&#xD;
           activation patterns, using advanced EEG processing techniques;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Cortical evoked EEG potentials;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Behavioral neuropsychological tasks to include reaction time, and motor processing&#xD;
           speed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. DNA, mRNA, and plasma, urine and saliva protein and metabolomics samples, collected at&#xD;
           baseline and throughout the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Socio-economic, demographic and life habits parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned analyses include: Assessment of individual moderators/mediators: The first set of&#xD;
      analyses will test an a priori list of individual variables for status as moderators and&#xD;
      mediators. Depression symptom change from baseline will be measured using the Inventory of&#xD;
      Depressive Symptomatology-Clinician (IDS-C). Tolerability will be measured using the&#xD;
      Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Rating (FIBSER) and the Treatment Emergent&#xD;
      Symptom Scale (TESS). Other measures (i.e., treatment response, remission) may also be used&#xD;
      and correlated variables collected in the study.&#xD;
