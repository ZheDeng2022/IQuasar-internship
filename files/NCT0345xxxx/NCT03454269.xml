  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is characterized not only by motor symptoms but also by psycho-behavioral&#xD;
      symptoms including Visual Hallucinations (VH) and illusions (I), that are generally&#xD;
      associated with a severe functional impairment and a bad prognosis for patients. Visual&#xD;
      Hallucinations are defined by a visual perception without any real objet to perceive, whereas&#xD;
      illusions are defined by a wrong perceptions of an object that is really present. In most of&#xD;
      studies investigating the pathophysiology of VH in PD, no difference is made between VH and&#xD;
      I, however different mechanisms could lead to the emergence of these two phenomenon, with&#xD;
      different prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator hypothesize that illusions could be related to a visual impairment, maybe at the&#xD;
      retinal level, known to be impaired in PD, whereas Visual hallucinations would be due to a&#xD;
      more widespread impairment affecting higher levels visuo-perceptive and cognitive functions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by tremor, rigidity and&#xD;
      akinesia, but patients can also present various non-motor symptoms in the course of their&#xD;
      illness, including visual hallucinations, delusions or illusions. Visual Hallucinations are&#xD;
      false perceptions (no external stimulus is present; generally caused by internal&#xD;
      stimulations), whereas illusions are defined by a wrong perception (an external stimulus is&#xD;
      always present). Delusions are false believes .The occurrence of hallucinations in PD is of&#xD;
      major importance as it has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and could lead to nursing home placement and to increased mortality. It is&#xD;
      generally believed that delusions/illusions also imply a bad prognosis with time . However&#xD;
      recent data suggest that delusions/illusion are not associated with such a poor outcome&#xD;
      regarding cognitive functions and mortality compared to hallucinations suggesting different&#xD;
      pathological mechanisms and anatomical substrates . Also, a recent study analyzing the&#xD;
      neuropsychological correlates of minor hallucinations in PD did not find executive&#xD;
      dysfunction to contribute to the onset of minor psychotic phenomena, but was specifically&#xD;
      implicated in the progression to well-structured VH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus illusions and minorVH may have a different pathogenesis and a different prognosis&#xD;
      compared to complex VH, however studies exploring the structural and functional changes&#xD;
      associated with hallucinations in PD have mainly included patients with well-structured VH&#xD;
      and moderate to severe cognitive impairment , making it difficult to define early&#xD;
      abnormalities associated with minor hallucinations or illusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several hypotheses are proposed regarding the emergence of hallucinations in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It has been first suggested that hallucinations in PD could be mainly the result of a&#xD;
           chronic exposition to dopaminergic therapy . However, the description of hallucination&#xD;
           in untreated PD patients goes against that solely explication . Besides, no strong link&#xD;
           has been identified between the occurrence of VH and the dosage and duration of&#xD;
           dopaminergic treatment . This suggests that Dopaminergic treatment would not directly&#xD;
           cause VH but could be a precipiting factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep-wake cycle disturbances have also been reported as risk factors for the occurrence&#xD;
           of VH in PD , and particularly the presence of REM Sleep behavior disorders (RBD) . The&#xD;
           emergence of VH in PD patients coinciding with daytime episodes of REM sleep may be&#xD;
           dream imagery occurring during wake , however this hypothesis is still debated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other risk factors have been associated with VH in PD such as the disease duration,&#xD;
           motor symptom severity and mostly cognitive impairment. Indeed, VH occur mainly in PD&#xD;
           patients with cognitive decline , but also VH are predictive of dementia . In fact,&#xD;
           cognitive impairment in PD patients, and particularly visuoperceptive impairment, would&#xD;
           lead to an impaired processing of visual information. Indeed, impaired frontal and&#xD;
           parietal cortical activation have been reported in PD patients with VH while being&#xD;
           presented visual stimulations, suggesting a diminished answer to external perceptions in&#xD;
           posterior cortical areas associated with an increased frontal abnormal activity leading&#xD;
           to the emergence of sensorial visual experiences . This shifting visual circuitry from&#xD;
           posterior to anterior regions associated with attention process impairment may play a&#xD;
           role in the pathophysiology of VH in PD. Thus, the occurrence of Visual Hallucinations&#xD;
           in PD Patients appears to be due to a desinhibition of the &quot;top-down&quot; visual stream&#xD;
           leading to the emergence of internal mental imagery stocked in memory, and interpreted&#xD;
           like visual perceptions coming from the external environment .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Yet, some evidences also points out to an impaired &quot;bottom-up&quot; processing that could&#xD;
           lead to the emergence of VH in PD. Indeed, a dopaminergic denervation and alpha&#xD;
           synuclein aggregation have been demonstrated in the retina of PD Patients , even at&#xD;
           early stages of the disease . However the functional consequences of such a denervation&#xD;
           are still poorly understood , even if impaired contrast discrimination and color vision&#xD;
           impairment are widely described in PD . One study has reported an association between&#xD;
           retinal impairment, measured with OCT, and VH in PD .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the emergence of VH and illusions in PD could be due to an inbalance between a&#xD;
      hypoactivated &quot;bottom-up&quot; (due to retino-striato-occipital hypoactivation) and a deshinibited&#xD;
      &quot;top-down&quot; (mainly frontal) visual stream. However in all these studies, Hallucinations and&#xD;
      illusions were not specifically discriminated and investigated in spite of the fact that they&#xD;
      could be subtended by different pathophysiological mechanisms and might imply different&#xD;
      prognosis for the evolution of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator hypothesize that illusions, which represent the failure to successfully&#xD;
      integrate stimuli that have been physically presented, could be more related to &quot;bottom up&quot;&#xD;
      impairment, unlike Hallucinations, which occur where there is perception in the absence of&#xD;
      any stimulus and could be more related to a &quot;top down&quot; impairment. Thus, PD patients with&#xD;
      illusions (PD-I) might present greater retinal degeneration measured by OCT compared to PD&#xD;
      patients with Visual hallucinations (PD-VH) and PD patients without Hallucinations or&#xD;
      illusion (PD-nVHI), suggesting a sensorial deprivation underlying these disturbed visual&#xD;
      perceptions of reality. Visual Hallucinations that are more elaborated would require a more&#xD;
      widespread cognitive disorder, with increased cognitive and visuoperceptive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE In this study investigator aim to compare PD patients with visual hallucinations&#xD;
      (PD-VH), with illusions (PD-I), without Visual hallucinations or illusions (PD-nVHI)&#xD;
      regarding retinal degeneration in OCT and cognitive functions (visuoperceptive and&#xD;
      attentional functions) in order to determine whether PD-I might show greater retinal&#xD;
      degeneration compared to PD-VH, and lesser cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN OF STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator will include 30 PD-VH+, 30 PD-I+, 30 PD-VH-I- among the patients consulting at&#xD;
      our center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first visit (Baseline, inclusion visit, 2 hours), each subject will perform a&#xD;
      clinical and neurological examination with : • Diagnosis of PD according to UKPDBB criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The presence of Visual Hallucinations or Illusions will be characterized according to the&#xD;
      Psychosensory Hallucination Scale. Illusions will be defined by answering &quot;Yes&quot; to at least&#xD;
      one of the &quot;elementary items&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second visit (Day 15, one day), each patient will have a neurological,&#xD;
      neuropsychological and ophthalmological examination with an evaluation of&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the severity of the disease (Hoehn and Yahr score, Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored&#xD;
           Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Evaluation of visuo-perceptive&#xD;
           functions and attention)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the excessive diurnal Somnolence and sleep attacks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the visual acuity, intraocular pressure, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), contrast&#xD;
           and colour evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circumstances of emergence and distress caused by Hallucinations/illusions was also evaluated&#xD;
      by measurement of heart rate variability, electrodermal recording, spy glasses and&#xD;
      self-evaluation of Stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, each subject will have a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquisition.&#xD;
