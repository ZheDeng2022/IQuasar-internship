  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study utilizes a Hybrid Type 1 multi-arm parallel group randomized control design to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of an evidence-based treatment (CETA) delivered either in-person or&#xD;
      via telephone, compared with a treatment as usual (TAU) control group, on improving&#xD;
      adolescent and young adult (AYA) mental and behavioral health outcomes. The study will also&#xD;
      gather information on counselor treatment knowledge, fidelity and competency following a&#xD;
      technology-delivered training. Lastly, the cost associated with these strategies will be&#xD;
      explored to inform future scale-up of training and services. This study will be conducted in&#xD;
      Lusaka, Zambia and participants will be enrolled at four different levels: prospective CETA&#xD;
      trainers, prospective CETA counselors, AYA clients, and research/organizational staff. AYA&#xD;
      clients are the primary participant type.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate implementation and service delivery&#xD;
      strategies that can reduce the science-to-practice gap of evidence-based treatments (EBT) for&#xD;
      mental health. Although evidence suggests that mental health treatments are acceptable and&#xD;
      efficacious in low-and-middle income countries (LMIC) for the treatment of common mental&#xD;
      disorders, there remains a gap in our understanding of how to bring these interventions to&#xD;
      scale. Significant challenges include the high cost of in-person training, sustaining&#xD;
      counselors in EBT, and limited client access to effective care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test whether delivery of telephone CETA (T-CETA) can produce&#xD;
      non-inferior, or similar, results to the standard in-person CETA for reducing mental and&#xD;
      behavioral health problems among AYA and whether CETA and T-CETA are superior to treatment as&#xD;
      usual (TAU) in reducing these problems. The study design is a randomized, non-inferiority&#xD;
      trial. CETA trainers (up to n=6) will be identified from an existing cadre of Zambian&#xD;
      trainers-in-training (TTT), who will facilitate technology-delivered trainings for&#xD;
      prospective counselors (up to n = 50) from several partner organizations in Zambia.&#xD;
      Counselors who participate in the training will be trained in both in-person CETA and T-CETA.&#xD;
      Once trained, counselors will provide treatment to AYA clients randomized to the CETA or&#xD;
      T-CETA condition. Following completion of the study, TAU control participants will be offered&#xD;
      CETA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transdiagnostic treatment being scaled up, CETA, was effective in several previous&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials in LMIC settings with lay providers, including in Zambia. CETA&#xD;
      provides the basis for feasible scale-up through the use a single therapy to treat multiple&#xD;
      common mental disorders with varying severities, an approach that is more cost-effective than&#xD;
      implementing multiple single-disorder focused psychotherapy treatments in LMIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes will be AYA client mental health and behavioral health outcomes. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include trainer and counselor CETA competency and knowledge, and qualitative&#xD;
      interviews of the acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and scale-up potential of&#xD;
      technology-based CETA training and treatment delivery. The cost-effectiveness of the&#xD;
      technology training strategy and the two treatment delivery methods will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will specifically strengthen the capacity of: 1) study staff to conduct mental&#xD;
      health clinical science research, 2) counselor and trainers in CETA training, supervision and&#xD;
      delivery, and 3) policy and decision makers to interpret and appropriately utilize the&#xD;
      scientific evidence to improve mental health policies and programs. This proposal leverages&#xD;
      previous studies and strong collaborations in Zambia with the Ministry of Health and numerous&#xD;
      local organizations. Results from this trial will produce effectiveness and costing data on&#xD;
      treatment delivery strategies that could inform the scale-up potential of diverse EBT in LMIC&#xD;
      across and beyond mental health. This research study ultimately addresses both the treatment&#xD;
      and implementation gaps in lower-resource settings globally.&#xD;

    <description>The Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) is a transdiagnostic, multi-problem intervention designed to address adult and youth trauma, depression, anxiety, safety, and substance use. It is comprised of a small set of common elements found to be efficacious and prevalent across a range of EBTs to treat common mental health problems. CETA was designed to be flexible in the elements utilized, their order, and their dose (number of sessions) to allow counselors to address heterogeneity, comorbidity, and symptom fluctuations in and across clients. Treatment typically consists of 6 to 12 weekly, approximately 60-minute sessions delivered by lay workers.</description>

    <description>For adaptation of the CETA manual for telephone delivery, the Applied Mental Health Research (AMHR) Group at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) reviewed evidence-based telehealth strategies and recommendations, telehealth ethical and legal guidelines, and clinical recommendations from telehealth providers. In addition, local TTTs in multiple contexts reviewed telehealth modifications and provided input that was incorporated into the final T-CETA manual used in this study. No changes were made to the structure, duration, and dose of CETA sessions, treatment components, or measurement-based clinical decision-making processes. Telehealth modifications, additions, and strategies were incorporated throughout the manual in delineated &quot;telehealth boxes.&quot; This way, the original manual was maintained outside of the telehealth boxes, allowing for clear identification and training of telehealth modifications for both new and existing CETA counselors.</description>

    <description>The control condition is defined as 'treatment as usual'. In Zambia, there are no formal services or standard of care treatments for mental and behavioral health problems among AYA. There are, however, organizations (such as non-governmental organizations) operating in Lusaka that provide intermittent services for these types of problems. Some AYA receive informal counseling from parish priests or other leaders in their communities. In this study we are therefore defining these types of informal services as 'treatment-as-usual.' We will closely track the type, number, and degree of these kinds of services that all participants receive and access. Following the conclusion of the study, we will offer the CETA intervention to control participants if it has been found to be safe and effective</description>
