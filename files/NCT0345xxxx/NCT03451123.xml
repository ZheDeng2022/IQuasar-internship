  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the percentage of patients whose surgical plan would change with FET-PET/MRI&#xD;
           compared to MRI alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the percentage of patients who have residual tumor after surgery detected with&#xD;
           FET-PET/MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Perform preliminary correlations between the pre- and post-surgical metabolic tumor&#xD;
      volumes measured with FET-PET/MRI to progression free survival.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient must have a known or suspected primary brain tumor with a non-enhancing&#xD;
             component with planned standard of care surgical resection. Patients with newly&#xD;
             diagnosed or recurrent brain tumors are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Tumors with non-enhancing regions will be defined as T2/FLAIR hyperintensity extending&#xD;
             at least 0.5 cm beyond areas of enhancement as assessed by MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient must be 18 years of age or younger at the time of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient must have measurable disease defined as tumor measurable in two perpendicular&#xD;
             dimensions on MRI greater than 1 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient must have a life expectancy greater than 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient must be able to undergo FET-PET/MRI without sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Females with childbearing potential must have a negative urine Î²-hCG test on the day&#xD;
             of procedure or a serum hCG test within 48 hours prior to the administration FET.&#xD;
             Females who have not reached menarche will not require pregnancy testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient must not be receiving an investigational or standard of care anti-cancer drug&#xD;
             within 6 months prior to the FET-PET/MRI study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient must not have received radiation therapy within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient must not have a contraindication to contrast-enhanced MRI (e.g. renal&#xD;
             insufficiency, incompatible implant).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient must not be pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient must not have been treated for another cancer within 5 years with the&#xD;
             exception of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must not have a history of brain metastases.&#xD;
