      study, chronic phase Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia patients with failure or intolerance to&#xD;
      previous TKIs therapy including Imatinib will be recruited. In this phase 3 study, 173&#xD;
      subjects are expected to be enrolled in a single arm with the administration of Radotinib&#xD;
      400mg twice daily, which includes 10% of dropout rate.&#xD;
