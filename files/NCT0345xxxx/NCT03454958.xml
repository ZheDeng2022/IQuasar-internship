  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Understanding critical periods during which people are at risk to gain weight or display&#xD;
      unhealthy changes in energy balance related behaviour, i.e. eating, physical activity and&#xD;
      sedentary behaviour, can facilitate the development of weight gain prevention programs.&#xD;
      Although the transition to parenthood is associated with pregnancy-related weight gain and&#xD;
      retention in women, evidence on the effect of having a first child on men's body weight is&#xD;
      lacking. It is also unclear whether pregnancy-related weight gain and retention cohere with&#xD;
      unfavourable changes in body composition and energy balance related behaviour in both women&#xD;
      and men transitioning to parenthood. Using a mixed-methods design, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      provide insight into this critical life phase. An observational follow-up study will be used&#xD;
      to investigate changes in body weight, body composition and energy balance related behaviour&#xD;
      among couples from pre-conception to one year postpartum, and to identify those most at risk&#xD;
      for excessive weight gain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first objective of this research is to investigate both maternal and paternal changes in&#xD;
      body weight, body composition and energy balance related behaviour during and after pregnancy&#xD;
      in Flemish couples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective is to investigate socio-demographic and behavioural predictors of&#xD;
      changes in both maternal and paternal body weight and body composition, in order to identify&#xD;
      those most at risk for postpartum weight gain and retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Couples transitioning into parenthood (age â‰¥ 18 years, any BMI and socio-economic status)&#xD;
      will be recruited during the first trimester of pregnancy by gynaecologists from the partner&#xD;
      obstetrics units at five Flemish hospitals. All couples expecting their first child will be&#xD;
      asked to participate in the study. Participants below 18 years of age, not speaking the Dutch&#xD;
      language or suffering from a pathological condition that may influence energy balance related&#xD;
      behaviour (e.g. diabetes, preeclampsia etc.) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a longitudinal design, participating couples (women and men) will be measured four&#xD;
      times over the course of approximately one year and nine months. Baseline measurements (T0)&#xD;
      will take place during the first trimester of pregnancy (at 12 weeks of pregnancy), with&#xD;
      follow-up measurements at respectively six weeks (T1), and six (T2) and twelve months (T3)&#xD;
      postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline (T0), both retrospective and prospective measurements will be conducted in both&#xD;
      pregnant women and men expecting their first child. Retrospectively, a self-report&#xD;
      questionnaire will be used to assess body weight, height and energy balance related&#xD;
      behaviour, incl. eating (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) which will be adapted for&#xD;
      pregnant women), physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ -&#xD;
      Dutch version) and sedentary behaviour. The self-report questionnaire will also include&#xD;
      questions about sleeping habits, smoking, and socio-demographics. Prospectively, body weight&#xD;
      (SECA digital weighing scale), height (SECA stadiometer), body composition (TANITA&#xD;
      Bioelectrical Impedance Analyzer &amp; skin fold thickness measurements at the biceps, triceps,&#xD;
      subscapular and suprailiac sites) and waist circumference (Cescorf measuring tape) will be&#xD;
      objectively measured. Women's gestational weight will be monitored by the gynaecologists as&#xD;
      all pregnant women are being weighed during consultation. The same self-report questionnaire&#xD;
      (see supra) will be used prospectively, including extra questions about breastfeeding and&#xD;
      parental leave. In addition, dietary intake will be assessed by a 3-day food diary, whereas&#xD;
      tri-axial accelerometers (Actigraph) will be used to measure energy expenditure (by rate of&#xD;
      physical activity and sedentary behaviour) objectively over a one-week period. At followup&#xD;
      moments (T1-3), the same aforementioned prospective measurements will be carried out.&#xD;
