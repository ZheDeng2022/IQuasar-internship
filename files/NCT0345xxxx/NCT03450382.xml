  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the difference between participants interested in a lifestyle change when enrolled&#xD;
      in Hans Kai or not when comparing behaviour change, social support, self health efficacy and&#xD;
      mental health. Hans Kai is a community based, peer led program that is low cost and self&#xD;
      sustaining, which places participants through a 9 week health school to learn skills related&#xD;
      to improving health such as nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress management etc. Once&#xD;
      completed, participants form a Hans Kai group and continue meeting independently of health&#xD;
      care providers&#xD;

      Research Question Does Hans Kai have a greater influence on healthy behavior change, mental&#xD;
      health status, social connectedness, and self-health efficacy outcomes compared to community&#xD;
      healthcare clients with access to health education programming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis - Hans Kai members will experience higher mental health improvement scores&#xD;
      compared to control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hans Kai members will experience greater social connectedness compared to control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hans Kai members will experience greater self-health efficacy compared to control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hans Kai members will adopt more behavior changes compared to control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis - There is no significant difference between Hans Kai members and control&#xD;
      group in terms of mental health improvement scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no significant difference between Hans Kai members and control group in terms of&#xD;
      social connectedness scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no significant difference between Hans Kai members and control group in terms of&#xD;
      self-health efficacy scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no significant difference between Hans Kai members and control group in terms of&#xD;
      adopted behavior change numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to meet the demand for health programming in and reduce the prevalence of chronic&#xD;
      disease NorWest developed the HANS KAI Project. Hans Kai is a self-sustaining, participant&#xD;
      led health program for individuals wanting to maintain or improve their health. Hans Kai&#xD;
      groups consist of 8-40 people per group in communities or workplaces. Hans Kai empowers&#xD;
      individuals to take control of their own health and provides a unique opportunity for&#xD;
      participants to have an active role in improving or maintaining their own health and&#xD;
      well-being and that of their community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HANS Kai Focuses on a number of factors relating to health including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy eating, physical activity, managing sleep and stress, mental health, physical health&#xD;
      indicators, leadership and social supports. The program is participant led which enables&#xD;
      members to have an active role in their health and the health of their families and&#xD;
      communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently NorWest has trained 37 people in 5 provinces across Canada to deliver HANS KAI in&#xD;
      their community and demand is growing. NorWest has developed a Teen and Family HANS KAI to&#xD;
      address health across the ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HANS KAI's initial research phase assessed roughly 60 participants over 2 years to determine&#xD;
      the impact of Hans Kai on strategic health indictors and influences. Our research and&#xD;
      evaluation showed statistically significant improvements in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental Health (prior to HANS Kai 33% had Flourishing Mental Health at 12 months 69% had&#xD;
      Flourishing Mental Health) Physical Activity Knowledge of Health Connection to Resources&#xD;
      Increased Social Connections, and Upward trends in nutrition. As the program continued to&#xD;
      evolve, community members and participants were involved in every phase, giving community&#xD;
      feedback on important health related topics they wanted discussed and to be given more&#xD;
      information on. This lead the researchers toward the second phase of research which now&#xD;
      focuses heavily on behavior change. Putting into practice the information that participants&#xD;
      learn was the highest feedback received, and this echoes trends in health promotion&#xD;
      interventions, as preventative healthcare and integrated service becomes the pinnacle to&#xD;
      healthy communities. Empowering people and building their resilience is dependent on needs&#xD;
      and perceived value of different lifestyle influences. For instance, an economically&#xD;
      disadvantaged family may struggle on a low income, but may find value in the Hans Kai&#xD;
      nutrition classes on how to feed their family healthy options and recipes on a fixed budget.&#xD;
      Addressing a change from eating take-out to home cooking helps to move this family towards&#xD;
      better health and become economically stronger through education and application. Building on&#xD;
      this scenario, Hans Kai also serves to bolster social engagement, drawing out isolated&#xD;
      individuals to engage in their communities, increasing their mental health and well-being.&#xD;
      The researchers strive to prove that this support carries over into the overall lifestyle,&#xD;
      increasing the likelihood and motivation to improve physical activity levels with other group&#xD;
      members interested in the same. This increase in self-efficacy promotes community and family&#xD;
      leadership, as others see positive life choices, they are likely to join in, seeing family&#xD;
      walks become routine and volunteering in community engagement on the rise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers are wanting to prove that community led health programs lead to health&#xD;
      behaviour changes in healthy lifestyle choices with social support and self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing our first phase of research, the researchers were able to determine&#xD;
      challenges and how to improve them as research heads into the second phase. Creating group&#xD;
      champions to help collect interval research data and modifying our research to determine a&#xD;
      power difference between a control and Hans Kai member was of the utmost importance. The&#xD;
      research objectives will be looking to discover the differences between non Hans Kai&#xD;
      community members and Hans Kai members in the areas of: self-efficacy, behavior change,&#xD;
      physical activity, nutrition, mental health and community connectedness. Data comparisons&#xD;
      from initial baselines without the Hans Kai intervention, followed by a 9 week survey after&#xD;
      Hans Kai participants have completed the health school, followed by a 6 month and one year&#xD;
      survey will be assessed. The purpose in completing these objectives is to determine whether&#xD;
      the Hans Kai model produces better results in each of the mentioned areas for participants&#xD;
      interested in a lifestyle change compared to those participants not introduced to the Hans&#xD;
      Kai concept of education. If successful, the Hans Kai model will be further studied and&#xD;
      promoted to more community health clinics as a low cost method to produce positive healthy&#xD;
      behaviours to communities.&#xD;
