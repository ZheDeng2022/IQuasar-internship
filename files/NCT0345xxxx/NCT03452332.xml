  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well stereotactic body radiation therapy works in combination&#xD;
      with tremelimumab and durvalumab in treating participants with cervical, vaginal, or vulvar&#xD;
      cancers that have come back (recurrent) or spread to other areas of the body (metastatic).&#xD;
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that sends x-rays&#xD;
      directly to the tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause less damage to&#xD;
      normal tissue. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as tremelimumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Durvalumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy, tremelimumab, and&#xD;
      durvalumab may work better in treating participants with cervical, vaginal, or vulvar&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety, and tolerability of combined immune checkpoint blockade with 3&#xD;
      fractions of stereotactic body radiation therapy (stereotactic ablative radiotherapy [SABR])&#xD;
      of up to two metastatic lesions in patients with recurrent and or metastatic cervical,&#xD;
      vaginal, or vulvar cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate clinical response rates and assess toxicities of treatment to durvalumab&#xD;
      combined with tremelimumab with 3 fractions of SABR of at least one and up to two metastatic&#xD;
      lesions in patients with recurrent/metastatic cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate progression-free survival, overall survival, and time to next treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate potential biomarkers of immune response to combined immune-checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibition with SABR and correlate this with clinical response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate potential biomarkers of immune response including cervical and rectal&#xD;
      microbial diversity, cervical immune cell infiltration and peripheral immune cell activation&#xD;
      as correlates of clinical response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour followed by durvalumab IV&#xD;
      over 1 hour on day 1 of each cycle. Participants also undergo SABR over 30-45 minutes on days&#xD;
      8, 10, and 12 of cycle 1. Treatment with tremelimumab repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4&#xD;
      cycles, and treatment with durvalumab repeats every 4 weeks for up to 8 cycles in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, at 2, 3, 4, 6,&#xD;
      8, 10, and 12 months, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 4.03</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months after last dose of durvalumab</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed based on dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and based on adverse events (AEs) throughout the entire treatment period. In the overall assessment of adverse events, AEs will be tabulated by body system, type and grade, overall and by disease cohort. The number and percentage of patients experiencing at least one grade 3 or higher AE will also be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response to treatment by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 and immune-related response criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured in both treated and untreated lesions with computed tomography (CT) imaging or other appropriate imaging modalities. Immune-related response is reported as number and percent of patients with two-sided 80% confidence intervals (CI). Because each patient will have multiple lesions, a generalized linear mixed model will be used, if possible, to calculate overall response, as well as response by index or non-index lesion. The depth and duration of response will be depicted using waterfall and swimmer plots.</description>

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of therapy up to first documented disease progression or death from any cause, assessed up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To summarize progression free survival we will use Kaplan Meier analysis, reporting the median with confidence interval.</description>
