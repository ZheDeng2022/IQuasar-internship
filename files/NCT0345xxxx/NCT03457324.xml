  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial, in order&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese Medicine JCM-16021 for diarrhea-predominant&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome. All patients will be evaluated for study eligibility at Visits 1&#xD;
      (baseline) and 2 (2 weeks). On visit 2, patients who meet the criteria will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive 8-week treatment of either JCM-16021 Granules or JCM-16021 placebo&#xD;
      Granules. The investigators, research assistants and participants are not aware of the&#xD;
      treatment assignments throughout the study. Treatment codes will only be broken after the&#xD;
      completion of study. The assessments at Visit 3 (4-week post treatment) and at visit 4 (end&#xD;
      of 8-week treatment) are used to measure treatment response (i.e. changes from baseline).&#xD;
      Assessment at visit 5 (end of 8-week follow up) is to determine any sustained response to&#xD;
      treatment. All the visits will be carried out in HKBU and CUHK clinics.&#xD;

      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is calculated on the basis of primary efficacy variables. From our previous&#xD;
      study, the global assessment of improvement (GAI) were 52% in herbal medicine group and 32%&#xD;
      in western medicine group, respectively. According to the references (Corazziari E, Bytzer P,&#xD;
      Delvaux M, et al. Clinical trial guidelines for pharmacological treatment of irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome. Alimentary pharmacology &amp; therapeutics 2003; 18 (6): 569-580), the investigational&#xD;
      drug is more effective than placebo (the overall improvement rate of symptoms is 15%), using&#xD;
      StudySize2.0 software to calculate the sample size, assuming the improvement in the treatment&#xD;
      group is 52%. In order to detect a difference with a two-side p value &lt;0.05 and 80%&#xD;
      statistical power, we will need to recruit 166 patients per arm. Further assuming a 15%&#xD;
      dropout rate, we conclude that a total of 392 patients (196 per arm) will be recruited to&#xD;
      ensure statistically significant results.For the number of cases distribution between&#xD;
      centers, according to the references (Lai D,Chang KC, Rahbar MH, Moye LA. Optimal Allocation&#xD;
      of Sample Sizes to Multicenter Clinical Trials. Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics 2013;&#xD;
      23 (4): 818-828) , from the following equation, we will consider the center about the patient&#xD;
      flow, traffic, treatment,costs and other possible factors, we will use the formula below to&#xD;
      estimate the number of cases that will be recruited in each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research medical record and Electronic Database:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients should be observed and assessed based on clinical trial protocol and the&#xD;
      investigators need to document in the medical record accurately and clearly. Research medical&#xD;
      record is the source document which cannot be altered. Any correction should not change the&#xD;
      original record and can only be added in a way of narration with reasons. The doctor&#xD;
      participated in the clinical trial needs to sign and date the record. An electronic database&#xD;
      will be created. Each study site will input their own data and be responsible for its&#xD;
      accuracy. A chief statistician will be responsible for data cleaning and data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All parameters and study elements will be analyzed. The statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed using SAS 9.1 and SPSS software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis sets:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full analysis set (FAS): The analysis will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      (ITT) principle which means to eliminate the participants with a minimum and reasonable&#xD;
      method. ITT population refers to all participants who go through randomization, enter&#xD;
      double-blind treatment period, and receive IMP at least one time. Missing values of efficacy&#xD;
      will be imputed by the last-observation-carried forward (LOCF) method. Per-protocol set (PP):&#xD;
      PP population refers to all participants who complete relative observation according to&#xD;
      protocol requirement and are confirmed to meet following conditions: ① compliance between 80%&#xD;
      and 120%; ② not taking probihited medications during the process of trial; ③ meeting&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and not fitting any exclusion items; ④ completing all planned visits and&#xD;
      necessary items of CRF. Missing values of this set will still be processed as missing data&#xD;
      and not be imputed. Safety analysis set: Population for safety analysis refers to all&#xD;
      participants who enter the trial, receive medication at least one time and have suitable&#xD;
      follow-up data for safety analysis. All safety data including AEs and laboratory results from&#xD;
      participants will be assessed.16.3 Statistical analysis technique Baseline data (gender, age,&#xD;
      race, weight, height, vital signs, course of IBS, history of smoking and alcohol) will be&#xD;
      descriptively summarized. Differences of measurement data between the groups will be assessed&#xD;
      with the use of t-test for normally distributed continuous variables and Wilcoxon signed rank&#xD;
      test for non-normally distributed. Differences of enumeration data between the groups will be&#xD;
      assessed with the use of chi-square test or CMH test when considering multicenter character.&#xD;
      Measurement data of different groups in each visit will be reported as mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD). Intra-group comparisons between baseline and each visit will be conducted by&#xD;
      using paired t-test (or Wilcoxon signed rank test). Comparisons between groups will be&#xD;
      conducted by using an analysis of variance (ANOVA), with other confounding factors like&#xD;
      multicenter character conducting the covariate analysis. Statistical analysis for the data&#xD;
      which do not meet above conditions (e.g. non-normal) will be conducted with the use of&#xD;
      non-parametric test. Enumeration data of different groups in each visit will be reported as&#xD;
      frequency (proportion). Comparisons between groups will be assessed with the use of X2 test&#xD;
      (CMH test) or non-parametric test. Dropout analysis: Dropout analysis will be conducted with&#xD;
      the use of chi-square test. If the data do not conform to chi-square test (data include 0, or&#xD;
      theoretical frequency is below 1), Fisher's exact test will be used. Compliance analysis:&#xD;
      Compliance analysis will be conducted with the use of chi-square test. If the data do not&#xD;
      conform to chi-square test (data include 0, or theoretical frequency is below 1), Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will conduct superiority analysis firstly. Other difference test will be conduct&#xD;
      by two-sided test. The statistical significance will be defined as two-sided P-value of ≤0.05&#xD;
      without any special explanation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy analysis will be conducted with the use of PP analysis and ITT analysis in the&#xD;
      meantime. Comparisons of measurement data will be conducted by using analysis of covariance&#xD;
      (ANCOVA), with treatment group and trial center as a factor in the model and baseline as the&#xD;
      covariate. Comparisons of measurement data will be conducted by using chi-square test or CMH&#xD;
      chi-square test when considering multicenter character. Meanwhile, superiority analysis&#xD;
      between experimental group and control group will be conducted based on primary efficacy&#xD;
      variables. Superiority test depends on interval method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extent of exposure: Descriptive statistics will be conducted according to the exposure dose&#xD;
      and time of medication in different groups. AEs analysis: Comparisons of incidence rate of&#xD;
      AEs between groups will be conducted with the use of X2 test. And investigators need to list&#xD;
      and describe the AEs happened in this trial. If the data do not conform to X2 test (data&#xD;
      include 0, or theoretical frequency is below 5), Fisher's exact test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRFs are filled in by investigators and study coordinators, other assessment forms by every&#xD;
      participant (including dropout cases). Data processing will be conducted in accordance with&#xD;
      the following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Verification of CRFs: Study coordinators need to verify CRFs before inputting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data verification needs to be conducted successively in the following two steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Verify the consistency and logicality of data: Review contents of data range and&#xD;
                logicality are determined by the range of each indexes and the interrelation.&#xD;
                Corresponding software will also be written to correct the incorrect data.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Compare database and CRFs by manual testing. Selectively counter check 10% CRFs&#xD;
                with participants' medical notes to know the quality of inputting and analyze and&#xD;
                handle the existing problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data inspection and closure of database: After verifying the validity of established&#xD;
           database and statistical protocol, principal investigators, will lock the data. The&#xD;
           locked data are not allowed to change. Confirmed problems found after locking will be&#xD;
           handled in the process of statistical analysis. All mistakes and modification should be&#xD;
           recorded and kept properly.&#xD;
