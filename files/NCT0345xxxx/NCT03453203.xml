  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic migraine (CM) is defined as a headache that occurs more than 15 days per month, which&#xD;
      has the features of migraine headache on at least 8 days per month.1 The cause of CM is not&#xD;
      well understood. Many patients with CM appear to have associated musculoskeletal neck pain.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to treat cervicalgia in patients with migraine and to look for&#xD;
      improvement in migraine frequency and intensity. Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) can&#xD;
      diagnose and treat common musculoskeletal dysfunction. This may break facilitation within the&#xD;
      nervous system and reduce musculoskeletal pain which subsequently will reduce headache&#xD;
      frequency. This will be a randomized controlled trail comparing patients with CM treated with&#xD;
      OMT vs no treatment. The investigators will look at the frequency of migraine days before and&#xD;
      after the treatment period to determine migraine frequency and improvement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data will be analyzed by reviewing the amount of headache days during the treatment period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be distributed randomly into either the treatment arm or control arm. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized as they are recruited for the study (i.e. subject 1 treatment, subject 2&#xD;
      control, subject 3 treatment, etc.) The participants will be distributed by a research&#xD;
      assistant who will allocate the patients randomly to one of the two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both arms will be diagnosed using tenderpoints (Tenderpoints are small tense edematous areas&#xD;
      of tenderness about the size of a fingertip. They are typically located near bony attachments&#xD;
      of tendons, ligaments, or in the belly of some muscles).Tenderpoints will be documented and&#xD;
      stored in a secure flash drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment arm will be treated with an Osteopathic manipulative treatment called counterstrain&#xD;
      technique. Osteopathic manipulative treatment is a hands on palpation of the tissues to&#xD;
      diagnose and treat neuromusculoskeletal dysfunction. Counterstrain is a passive manipulative&#xD;
      technique which the tissue being treated is positioned at a point of balance, or ease, AWAY&#xD;
      from the restrictive barrier (The most thought of form of manipulative technique is high&#xD;
      velocity low amplitude which is typically performed by chiropractors in spinal manipulation&#xD;
      which goes TOWARD the restrictive barrier and actually pass through the restrictive barrier).&#xD;
      Once a tenderpoint is found in the muscles the area of treatment is placed in a (three&#xD;
      dimensional) position that will eliminate the sensation (tenderness).The treatment position&#xD;
      is held for 90 seconds or until a release is felt (release is usually a decrease in the tone&#xD;
      or muscle tension).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control arm the tenderpoint will Be palpated for 90 seconds with no counterstrain&#xD;
      treatment applied. (Risk are possible soreness at palpation site though not likely, there is&#xD;
      no benefit) Both treatment and control groups will remain on their current migraine&#xD;
      medication regiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will follow-up with Dr. Deborah Reed, MD, FAHS who is a board certified neurologist and&#xD;
      headache specialist. This investigator will be blinded to weather the patient received&#xD;
      counterstrain manipulation or no treatment. The investigator will document the number of&#xD;
      headache days between follow-up periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first treatment follow-up will occur as follows: Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6,&#xD;
      Week 10. This is picked somewhat arbitrarily as typical treatment follow-ups will vary from&#xD;
      patient to patient depending on the severity of the musculoskeletal dysfunction (somatic&#xD;
      dysfunction).&#xD;
