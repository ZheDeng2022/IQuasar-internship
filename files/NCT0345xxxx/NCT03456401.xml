  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a third TKI after two previous lines of therapy&#xD;
      with TKIs, in terms of median progression free survival (mPFS), in patients affected by&#xD;
      metastatic renal cancer cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving the sequence Sunitinib- Axitinib, will receive Sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving the sequence Pazopanib-Sorafenib, will receive Sunitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib dosage 400mg orally, twice a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sunitinib dosage 50 mg 4 weeks on followed by 2 weeks a rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapy will be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced RCC presents poor prognosis, because his pathogenesis is not clearly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene is mutated in the majority of sporadic and&#xD;
      familial clear cell renal cancer. The mechanism by which VHL mutation leads to RCC&#xD;
      development and progression is postulate to be in part thought production of the protein VEGF&#xD;
      (Vascular Endothelial Grow Factor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VEGF over-expression may be pertinent in RCC via multiple mechanism in addition to&#xD;
      angiogenesis, including effects on dendritic cells and inhibition of apoptosis through&#xD;
      preservation of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VEGF expression could represented an independent prognostic factors for survival possibly&#xD;
      linking expression of this protein with clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sunitinib and pazopanib are the standard therapy as first line in mRCC. At sunitinib failure&#xD;
      a second line with axitinib or everolimus or sorafenib should be considered to improve the&#xD;
      clinical outcome of the disease. Up to now there is not a clear evidence of superiority in&#xD;
      favour of an agent versus the others available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At pazopanib failure no evidences are available to support physicians in the decision making&#xD;
      in the everyday clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover no data are available in third line with a TKi after two previous lines of therapy&#xD;
      with TKIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed to evaluate prospectively the efficacy of two different sequences of&#xD;
      TKis in third line:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first (group A) to evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib after two previous lines of TKIs&#xD;
      with sunitinib followed by axitinib&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second (group B) to evaluate the efficacy of sunitinib after two previous lines of TKIs&#xD;
      with pazopanib followed by sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      400 mg bid is the standard approved dose for sorafenib in the treatment of mRCC while 50 mg&#xD;
      for 4 consecutive weeks every six weeks is the standard dose for sunitinb&#xD;
