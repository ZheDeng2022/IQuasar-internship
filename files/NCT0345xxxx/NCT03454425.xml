      ExAblate Subthalomotomy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease motor features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this prospective, randomized, double-blind (to subjects, examining&#xD;
      neurologists and external video-based examination by Movement Disorders neurologist), two-arm&#xD;
      study (ExAblate treated arm Vs ExAblate Sham treated control arm) is to confirm the efficacy&#xD;
      of ExAblate Model 4000 Type 1 System for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) motor&#xD;

             disorder neurologist at the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Predominant motor features/disability from one side of the body (i.e asymmetry index &gt;&#xD;
             1.5) as determined by a movement disorders neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Motor clinical features non-optimally controlled by an adequate medical treatment&#xD;
             prescription. An adequate medication prescription is defined as a therapeutic dose of&#xD;
