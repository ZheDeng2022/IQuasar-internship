      Benralizumab will be used in a placebo controlled randomized study to treat severe chronic&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has a prevalence of more than 10% in the United States and&#xD;
      Europe and is associated with several co-morbidities including asthma, acute infection, and&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea. There are principally two forms of CRS namely with and without nasal&#xD;
      polyps. CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in particular can be a severe and debilitating disease&#xD;
      resulting in significant morbidity, complete anosmia, headaches, missed work, and&#xD;
      hospitalizations. Not uncommonly, patients require chronic oral corticosteroids, multiple&#xD;
      courses of antibiotics, and repeated surgical polypectomies to control participants' disease.&#xD;
      Total health care expenditure for CRS (which includes both with and without polyps) is more&#xD;
      than $60 billion annually in the United States accounting for as much as 5% of the total US&#xD;
      health care budget. Annual direct and indirect costs to treat CRS in Europe is estimated to&#xD;
      be similar to this amount but data is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For CRSwNP patients suffering with severe and recurrent nasal polyps there are few treatment&#xD;
      options. High dose topical nasal steroids and repeated surgical procedures do not halt&#xD;
      progression in many patients. Allergen immunotherapy is often non-curative in this&#xD;
      population. Similarly, due to the fact that CRSwNP is not exclusively an Immunoglobulin E&#xD;
      (IgE) driven process, omalizumab was shown to have mixed benefit in this population.&#xD;
      Likewise, omalizumab resulted in no reduction in polyp size among patients with Aspirin&#xD;
      Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More typically chronic nasal polyp disease is an eosinophil mediated process. Patients with&#xD;
      demonstrated elevations in serum and mucosal eosinophils tend to have more severe disease and&#xD;
      higher nasal polyp recurrence rates. Clinical researchers have begun to recognize this&#xD;
      connection. A recent Phase II study in Europe showed a reduction in polyp burden using&#xD;
      mepolizumab anti-Interleukin (IL) 5 monoclonal antibody. Benralizumab which targets IL-5&#xD;
      receptor signaling has been shown to have powerful apoptotic effects on eosinophils and may&#xD;
      likely prove to be even more efficacious. Because of its unique mechanism of action,&#xD;
      benralizumab may have a profound impact on reducing mucosal eosinophils resulting in great&#xD;
      benefit to patients suffering with severe nasal polyps refractory to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benralizumab has been shown to be efficacious treating severe asthmatics with eosinophilia.&#xD;
      The unique mechanism of action of benralizumab targets the IL-5 receptor leading to&#xD;
      degradation of signaling and apoptosis. This direct effect on eosinophils leads to reduction&#xD;
      of proinflammatory processes in the asthmatic airways among those with elevated eosinophil&#xD;
      counts. While many subjects with allergic asthma do indeed have concomitant local and&#xD;
      systemic elevations in eosinophils, the primary driver of inflammation in allergic asthmatics&#xD;
      is IgE and IL-4. Allergen immunotherapy and anti-IgE therapy (omalizumab) has long been known&#xD;
      to be effective in these atopic individuals. However, a significant portion of non-asthmatics&#xD;
      respond poorly to these IgE targeted therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a similar manner, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a disease often&#xD;
      associated with atopy and propagated by IgE/IL-4 mediated inflammation. However, more than&#xD;
      50% of patients with CRSwNP have no evidence of allergen sensitivity. Nasal and sinus&#xD;
      inflammation in these non-atopic individuals is often characterized by IL-5 upregulation,&#xD;
      eosinophilia, leukotrienes, and more severe polyps. These individuals tend to have more&#xD;
      aggressive disease requiring frequent surgeries, high dose intranasal budesonide irrigation,&#xD;
      and oral steroids yet the polyps more often than not are persistent and may return post&#xD;
      surgery. In a subset of patients, concomitant aspirin sensitivity can be managed with aspirin&#xD;
      desensitization, however this approach is not always effective and can also be cumbersome. A&#xD;
      more universal and potentially more efficient approach to treating severe polyps is to target&#xD;
      eosinophils directly using a monoclonal antibody. Previous reports have shown some benefit&#xD;
      targeting IL-5 ligand itself with mepolizumab but the potential benefit of directly&#xD;
      eliminating eosinophils by shutting down cellular signaling with benralizumab would be&#xD;
      expected to have a more dramatic effect and needs to be investigated.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Nasal Polyp Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5 and Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>Change in endoscopic nasal polyp score after 6 months of treatment. Nasal Polyp Score (NPS): the change in mean score from Screen visit (Week 5) bilateral endoscopic nasal polyp score as compared to score at end of treatment (Week 25). Higher scores indicate increase in number of polyps and/or polyp size. The score is the sum of the right and left nostril scores, as evaluated by nasal endoscopy.&#xD;
NPS score key: 0 = No visible polyps; 1 = Small amount of polypoid disease confined within the middle meatus; 2 = Multiple polyps occupying the middle meatus; 3 = Polyps extending beyond the middle meatus; 4 = Polyps completely obstructing the nasal cavity.&#xD;
Reported data is a difference in the NPS between Week 25 and Week 5.</description>

    <measure>Change in Nasal Polyp Size as Assessed by the Lund Mackay Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5 and Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the sinus was performed at screening (Week 5) and then again at the end of treatment (Week 25). Sinus CT images were obtained to determine the Lund Mackay Score (LMS), a widely used method for radiologic staging of nasal polyposis. The mean change in the LMS was determined by comparing the scores from Week 5 to Week 25. Each sinus group is graded between 0 and 2 (0: no abnormality; 1: partial opacification; 2: total opacification). The ostiomeatal complex is scored as &quot;0&quot; not obstructed) or &quot;2&quot; (obstructed). Overall score range of 0-24. Higher scores indicate progression of nasal polyposis disease.&#xD;
Reported data is a difference in the LMS between Week 25 and Week 5.</description>

    <measure>Change in Symptom Severity Score as Assessed by the Sino-nasal Outcome Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment Week 0 and Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>The Sino-nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) is a condition-specific health-related quality of life assessment that captures patient-reported physical problems, functional limitations, and emotional consequences of sinonasal conditions for the 2 weeks prior to completing the test. Participants completed the SNOT-22 at treatment Week 0 and at Treatment Week 20. Patients rated their symptom severity and symptom impact over the previous 2 weeks using a 6-point scale (0- No Problem to 5- Problem as bad as it can be). The total score is the sum of individual item scores and has a range from 0 to 110. Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. Outcome measure data shows change in SNOT-22 scores between treatment Week 20 and Week 0.</description>

    <measure>Change in The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5 and Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) is a quantitative test of olfactory function that uses microencapsulated odorants that are released by scratching standardized odor-impregnated test booklets. Four booklets with 10 questions in each booklet on odor identification. Patients were asked to identify the odor by scratching the test area then selecting their answer using multiple-choice format that lists 4 different possible answers for each question. The mean change in the UPSIT was determined by comparing the score from Week 5 to the score in Week 25. The test is a forced-choice test meaning the patient is required to mark one of the four answers even if a smell is not perceived. Scores are based on number of correctly identified odors (score range 0 to 40). Higher scores indicate subject's ability to correctly identify odors.&#xD;
Reported data is a difference in the UPSIT score between Week 25 and Week 5.</description>

        <title>Change in Nasal Polyp Score</title>
        <description>Change in endoscopic nasal polyp score after 6 months of treatment. Nasal Polyp Score (NPS): the change in mean score from Screen visit (Week 5) bilateral endoscopic nasal polyp score as compared to score at end of treatment (Week 25). Higher scores indicate increase in number of polyps and/or polyp size. The score is the sum of the right and left nostril scores, as evaluated by nasal endoscopy.&#xD;
NPS score key: 0 = No visible polyps; 1 = Small amount of polypoid disease confined within the middle meatus; 2 = Multiple polyps occupying the middle meatus; 3 = Polyps extending beyond the middle meatus; 4 = Polyps completely obstructing the nasal cavity.&#xD;
Reported data is a difference in the NPS between Week 25 and Week 5.</description>

        <title>Change in Nasal Polyp Size as Assessed by the Lund Mackay Score</title>
        <description>Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the sinus was performed at screening (Week 5) and then again at the end of treatment (Week 25). Sinus CT images were obtained to determine the Lund Mackay Score (LMS), a widely used method for radiologic staging of nasal polyposis. The mean change in the LMS was determined by comparing the scores from Week 5 to Week 25. Each sinus group is graded between 0 and 2 (0: no abnormality; 1: partial opacification; 2: total opacification). The ostiomeatal complex is scored as &quot;0&quot; not obstructed) or &quot;2&quot; (obstructed). Overall score range of 0-24. Higher scores indicate progression of nasal polyposis disease.&#xD;

        <title>Change in Symptom Severity Score as Assessed by the Sino-nasal Outcome Test</title>
        <description>The Sino-nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) is a condition-specific health-related quality of life assessment that captures patient-reported physical problems, functional limitations, and emotional consequences of sinonasal conditions for the 2 weeks prior to completing the test. Participants completed the SNOT-22 at treatment Week 0 and at Treatment Week 20. Patients rated their symptom severity and symptom impact over the previous 2 weeks using a 6-point scale (0- No Problem to 5- Problem as bad as it can be). The total score is the sum of individual item scores and has a range from 0 to 110. Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. Outcome measure data shows change in SNOT-22 scores between treatment Week 20 and Week 0.</description>

        <title>Change in The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test Score</title>
        <description>The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) is a quantitative test of olfactory function that uses microencapsulated odorants that are released by scratching standardized odor-impregnated test booklets. Four booklets with 10 questions in each booklet on odor identification. Patients were asked to identify the odor by scratching the test area then selecting their answer using multiple-choice format that lists 4 different possible answers for each question. The mean change in the UPSIT was determined by comparing the score from Week 5 to the score in Week 25. The test is a forced-choice test meaning the patient is required to mark one of the four answers even if a smell is not perceived. Scores are based on number of correctly identified odors (score range 0 to 40). Higher scores indicate subject's ability to correctly identify odors.&#xD;
Reported data is a difference in the UPSIT score between Week 25 and Week 5.</description>

          <title>Change in The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test Score</title>
          <description>The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) is a quantitative test of olfactory function that uses microencapsulated odorants that are released by scratching standardized odor-impregnated test booklets. Four booklets with 10 questions in each booklet on odor identification. Patients were asked to identify the odor by scratching the test area then selecting their answer using multiple-choice format that lists 4 different possible answers for each question. The mean change in the UPSIT was determined by comparing the score from Week 5 to the score in Week 25. The test is a forced-choice test meaning the patient is required to mark one of the four answers even if a smell is not perceived. Scores are based on number of correctly identified odors (score range 0 to 40). Higher scores indicate subject's ability to correctly identify odors.&#xD;
Reported data is a difference in the UPSIT score between Week 25 and Week 5.</description>
