    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this R34 application is to adapt and feasibility test an evidence-based&#xD;
      HIV prevention education for high-risk, underserved rural women in Appalachia. This study has&#xD;
      potential to make a significant contribution to science by advancing knowledge on the use of&#xD;
      social media to increase access to prevention interventions to reduce high-risk substance use&#xD;
      and related health disparities among rural women during a time of emerging and significant&#xD;
      public health risk in Appalachia. Successfully accomplishing study aims will respond to a&#xD;
      critical and unmet need to increase access to prevention interventions using social media, as&#xD;
      well as advance knowledge about the high-risk drug use behaviors among vulnerable&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;

      The overall aim of this R34 application is to adapt and feasibility test an evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention for HIV prevention for a high-risk group of rural women in Appalachia. This&#xD;
      study has potential to make a significant contribution to science by advancing knowledge on&#xD;
      the use of social media to increase access to prevention interventions to reduce high-risk&#xD;
      substance use and related health disparities among rural women during a time of emerging and&#xD;
      significant public health risk in Appalachia. Successfully accomplishing study aims will&#xD;
      respond to a critical and unmet need to increase the reach and scope of prevention&#xD;
      interventions using social media, as well as advance knowledge about the high-risk drug use&#xD;
      behaviors of this underserved group. Considering the need for prevention interventions among&#xD;
      this high-risk group and the popularity of Facebook, the purpose of this R34 proposal is to&#xD;
      adapt an evidence-based HIV prevention intervention for social media delivery and to&#xD;
      feasibility test through a randomized control trial with 60 high-risk rural women drug users.&#xD;
      The following aims guide the proposed study: (1) Adapt the NIDA Standard for HIV prevention&#xD;
      for delivery via Facebook; and (2) Examine the feasibility of the adapted intervention with&#xD;
      high-risk rural women through a randomized control pilot. The proposed use of Facebook in&#xD;
      this study is promising because it is a stable, widely used, cost-efficient platform that&#xD;
      could be leveraged to increase access to critically needed HIV prevention education. This&#xD;
      study presents an exciting opportunity to examine the use of Facebook as a technique to&#xD;
      expand the reach of evidence-based preventions interventions for high-risk drug users who are&#xD;
      not likely to engage in formal treatment. Findings from this study will inform development of&#xD;
      the larger R01 which would allow examination of the effectiveness and sustainability of this&#xD;
      HIV prevention intervention in understudied, high risk populations.&#xD;
