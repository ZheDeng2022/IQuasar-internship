    <textblock>
      In this pilot project, 35 lung transplant candidates will be recruited to participate in a&#xD;
      three month individualized home-based program focused on exercise and nutrition optimization.&#xD;
      This pilot is designed to assess the feasibility of treating frailty before lung&#xD;
      transplantation. Participants will complete a 1 day in-person assessment and training session&#xD;
      that will include baseline frailty assessment, determination of exercise capacity, and a&#xD;
      determination of nutritional status. Based on American Thoracic Society Guidelines and a diet&#xD;
      evaluation by a registered dietician, information gathered during the assessment will be used&#xD;
      to develop a tailored prescription for exercise and nutrition to be continued at home.&#xD;
      Participants will also be taught self-management skills specific to control of dyspnea,&#xD;
      fatigue, motivation, and support. Participants will receive training in protocol&#xD;
      implementation at home by a coordinator trained in principles of behavior change, adult&#xD;
      learning theory, and dyspnea control techniques. Subjects will be provided tablet computers&#xD;
      with an app called Aidcube preloaded and taught how to interface with the app. Aidcube is a&#xD;
      commercially available exercise platform designed for patients with lung and heart diseases.&#xD;
      It was designed with the input of physicians, physical therapists, respiratory therapists,&#xD;
      nutritionists who specialize in patients with lung and heart disease and adheres to&#xD;
      professional society guidelines for exercise and rehabilitation in patients with lung&#xD;
      disease. Subjects will then adhere to a individually tailored home exercise and nutrition&#xD;
      program based on their exercise capacity. Aidcube allows clinicians (or in this case the PI&#xD;
      and co-PI) the ability to design a customized program of exercises and diet plan through the&#xD;
      &quot;provider interface&quot;. The subjects interacts with the &quot;patient interface&quot; to complete their&#xD;
      exercise program during the 8 week study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This goal of this pilot project is to determine the feasibility of implementing a home-based&#xD;
      exercise and nutrition program with patients with advanced lung disease awaiting lung&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on Aidcube can be found at https://www.aidcube.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching aim of this pilot study is preparatory investigation to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of performing a home-based intervention to treat frailty in lung transplant&#xD;
      candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish a sampling time frame and recruitment techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess willingness to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess adherence and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify logistical problems in the in-person and at-home components of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the resources needed for a full-scale study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide funding bodies evidence that research team is competent and knowledgeable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide funding bodies that the study is feasible&#xD;

      Lung transplantation aims to extend survival, reduce disability, and improve health-related&#xD;
      quality of life for persons suffering from advanced lung diseases. Despite rigorous candidacy&#xD;
      screening practices, improvements in surgical and medical management, and iterative&#xD;
      advancements in organ allocation policies, nearly 20% of adults awaiting lung transplantation&#xD;
      die or are removed from the waiting list due to disease progression prior to receiving a&#xD;
      suitable donor offer1. After lung transplantation, nearly the same proportion of patients&#xD;
      dies within the first post-operative year2. Notably, serious morbidity after transplantation&#xD;
      is increasing, with resultant disability and associated decrements in health-related quality&#xD;
      of life3,4. Although known risk factors for death are already incorporated into lung&#xD;
      allocation in the United States (Lung Allocation Score [LAS]), persistently high mortality&#xD;
      and increasing morbidity underscore the need to identify novel risk factors for poor outcomes&#xD;
      in order to maximize the individual and societal benefit of lung transplantation5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frailty- measured by simple, non-invasive clinic based instruments- is an independent risk&#xD;
      factor for disability, perioperative complications, and mortality in older medical6-9 and&#xD;
      surgical populations10-13. Conceptualized first in the field of geriatrics, frailty is&#xD;
      defined as a generalized vulnerability to stressors resulting from an accumulation of&#xD;
      physiologic deficits across multiple interrelated systems14. These deficits, in turn, deplete&#xD;
      the body's physiologic reserves, resulting in a &quot;state-of-risk&quot; for disproportionate declines&#xD;
      in health status following exposure to an additional stressor such as major surgery. Drawing&#xD;
      from the geriatrics experience, frailty has become recognized more recently as a risk factor&#xD;
      for poor outcomes in solid organ transplantation. Specifically, frailty has been found to be&#xD;
      associated with delayed graft function and mortality in kidney transplant recipients and&#xD;
      waitlist mortality in liver transplant candidates15-17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of geriatric derived measures is particularly important in contemporary lung&#xD;
      transplantation. Indeed, older patients are the fastest growing group of lung transplant&#xD;
      candidates in the U.S18. Compared to 8% in 2004, patients aged 65 now account for 30% of&#xD;
      annual new recipients, outnumbering those aged 50; those aged 60 account for over half of all&#xD;
      new transplants19. This rapid trend has outpaced the evidence base, risk stratification&#xD;
      tools, and society guidelines needed to identify which older candidates will do well after&#xD;
      lung transplantation. Absent better information, transplant programs have resorted to either&#xD;
      ad hoc and admittedly arbitrary chronological age cutoffs or &quot;eyeball tests&quot; of fitness for&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently identified frailty as prevalent in lung transplant candidates and&#xD;
      independently associated with delisting or death on the waitlist18. Very recently, studies in&#xD;
      other populations suggest frailty may be reversible through targeted exercise and nutrition&#xD;
      programs. While pulmonary rehabilitation programs may achieve similar goals, a substantial&#xD;
      proportion of patients cannot access these programs due to geography or insurance&#xD;
      limitations. The investigator's overarching hypothesis is that treating frailty with a&#xD;
      home-based intervention before transplant may 1) reduce the risk of death or delisting for&#xD;
      becoming too debilitated before transplant and 2) may reduce complications, disability, and&#xD;
      possibly mortality after lung transplantation. This proposal seeks to generate critical pilot&#xD;
      data needed to inform a larger intervention to treat frailty in lung transplant candidates.&#xD;
