      On the basis of new evidence on the relationship between achieved office blood pressure (BP)&#xD;
      measurements (OBPM) and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      documented in the SPRINT trial, the recent 2017 guidelines of the American College of&#xD;
      Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have established lower values of&#xD;
      130/80 mmHg for clinic systolic BP (SBP)/diastolic BP (DBP) as new diagnostic thresholds for&#xD;
      hypertension and therapeutic targets for treatment of all individuals aged ≥18 years&#xD;
      regardless of age, sex, or concomitant complications including presence of diabetes, chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease (CKD), or history of past CVD event. According to these guidelines, the new&#xD;
      proposed ambulatory BP measurment (ABPM) thresholds for diagnosis of hypertension in adults&#xD;
      are 130/80 and 110/65 mmHg for the awake and asleep SBP/DBP means, respectively. However, the&#xD;
      ACC/AHA guidelines do not provide any scientific evidence documenting neither the equivalence&#xD;
      between these ABPM thresholds and the 130/80 mmHg cut-off values for OBPM nor the potential&#xD;
      improved CVD event-free survival time of the proposed more intensive control of ambulatory&#xD;
      BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results derived from observational prospective studies consistently document that therapeutic&#xD;
      BP targets in hypertensive individuals, i.e., persons at increased CVD risk, should be&#xD;
      established in terms of proper control of asleep BP. To date, no prospective randomized study&#xD;
      has ever before evaluated which should be the adequate therapeutic ABPM target for most&#xD;
      effective reduction of CVD risk. Accordingly, the Tratamiento de Hipertensión Arterial&#xD;
      Durante el Sueño study (THADEUS, i.e., Treatment of Hypertension During Sleep) has been&#xD;
      designed to prospectively evaluate if &quot;intensive control&quot; of asleep SBP mean proposed by the&#xD;
      new ACC/AHA guidelines (&lt;110 mmHg) in more effective than the so far its &quot;conventional&#xD;
      control&quot; (&lt;120 mmHg) to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality in hypertensive individuals.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE OF THE STUDY.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1. Clinic and ambulatory blood pressure for the diagnosis of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of hypertension and all clinical decisions regarding its treatment today are&#xD;
      still mainly based only on a limited number of daytime office blood pressure (BP)&#xD;
      measurements (OBPM) obtained in the clinic, occasionally supplemented by wake-time&#xD;
      self-assessments at home and work. Those casual time-unspecified OBPM disregard the mostly&#xD;
      predictable circadian variation in BP. Various circadian rhythms may also significantly&#xD;
      affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, both beneficial and adverse effects, of&#xD;
      hypertension medications, as extensively documented. Most important, numerous outcome trials&#xD;
      and published meta-analyses substantiate the correlation between BP level and risk of target&#xD;
      organ injury damage and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events is much stronger for parameters&#xD;
      derived from around-the-clock ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) than it is for values derived&#xD;
      from traditional daytime OBPM. ABPM is a diagnostic tool with the added advantage that allows&#xD;
      thorough description and quantification of all aspects of the 24h BP variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of this substantial and indisputable evidence, several international guidelines&#xD;
      now propose ambulatory measurements as a requirement to confirm the office diagnosis of&#xD;
      hypertension in adults. On the contrary, other guidelines, despite recognizing greater&#xD;
      prognostic value of ABPM than OBPM, still recommended the use of the later for diagnosis of&#xD;
      hypertension for &quot;historical reasons&quot; unjustified on the light of current available&#xD;
      scientific evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. Asleep BP mean as an independent prognostic marker of CVD risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific features of the ABPM-determined 24h BP pattern have been explored as biomarkers or&#xD;
      mediators of target tissue injury and triggers of and risk factors for CVD events -- angina&#xD;
      pectoris, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, sudden cardiac death, pulmonary embolism --&#xD;
      and cerebrovascular events -- ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Numerous studies consistently&#xD;
      substantiate a strong association between the abnormal physiologic feature of blunted&#xD;
      sleep-time relative BP decline (non-dipper/riser BP pattern) and increased incidence of fatal&#xD;
      and non-fatal CVD events, not only in hypertensive persons, but also in normotensive&#xD;
      individuals.27 Furthermore, various independent prospective studies demonstrate CVD events&#xD;
      are better predicted by the asleep than awake or 24h BP means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, such prospective ABPM studies demonstrate elevated sleep-time BP constitutes a&#xD;
      significant CVD risk factor, independent of the daytime OBPM or ambulatory awake and 24h BP&#xD;
      means. Nonetheless, all previous investigations addressing the merit of ABPM for predicting&#xD;
      CVD risk, except the Monitorización Ambulatoria para Predicción de Eventos Cardiovasculares&#xD;
      study (MAPEC, i.e., Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring for Prediction of Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Events) discussed below relied upon only a single, low-reproducible study-inclusion baseline&#xD;
      24h ABPM assessment per participant. Lack of systematic and multiple ABPM evaluations of&#xD;
      participants over time in all previously reported long-term follow-up studies, except MAPEC,&#xD;
      precluded the opportunity to explore the potential reduction in CVD risk associated with&#xD;
      modification of prognostic parameters by hypertension therapy and/or lifestyle changes, i.e.,&#xD;
      either increase of sleep-time relative BP decline towards the more normal dipper pattern or,&#xD;
      more specifically, reduction of asleep BP mean. Incorporation of periodic (at least annual)&#xD;
      ABPM studies of participants during follow-up, as in the MAPEC study, clearly establishes&#xD;
      that: (i) features of the 24h BP pattern change over time; and (ii) therapeutic reduction of&#xD;
      the asleep BP mean and increase of the sleep-time relative BP decline towards normal dipping&#xD;
      lessen not only CVD risk but also progression towards new-onset type 2 diabetes and chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease (CKD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential reduction in CVD risk through modification of prognostic ABPM parameters by a&#xD;
      time-specified hypertension-treatment strategy has so far been investigated only in the MAPEC&#xD;
      study. Cox regression survival analysis of each potential prognostic BP parameter analyzed&#xD;
      individually indicates the hazard ratio (HR) of total CVD events is greater with&#xD;
      progressively higher sleep-time SBP mean and lower sleep-time relative SBP decline, i.e.,&#xD;
      more non-dipper/riser BP patterning. Moreover, joint analysis of the multiple BP parameters&#xD;
      potentially capable of contributing to CVD risk finds OBPM does not independently predict CVD&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality when the outcomes model is adjusted by the asleep BP mean (HR=1.44,&#xD;
      95%CI [1.30-1.60], P&lt;0.001, per SD elevation in asleep SBP mean; HR=1.09 [0.97-1.23],&#xD;
      P=0.123, per SD elevation in clinic SBP). The best Cox regression fully adjusted model&#xD;
      includes only the asleep SBP mean (HR=1.43, 95%CI [1.29-1.58], P&lt;0.001) and sleep-time&#xD;
      relative SBP decline (HR=0.88 [0.78-0.98], P=0.023).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3. Asleep BP mean as a therapeutic target for CVD risk reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the MAPEC study, in which participants were repeatedly assessed by periodic 48h&#xD;
      ABPM, also permitted prospective evaluation of the impact of changes in OBPM and ABPM during&#xD;
      follow-up on CVD risk. Progressive treatment-induced lowering of the awake, asleep, and 48h&#xD;
      BP means, but not daytime OBPM, when each variable is analyzed individually, reveals&#xD;
      association with significant CVD risk reduction. Most importantly, Cox survival analysis with&#xD;
      joint inclusion of asleep and awake BP means as potential predictors indicates progressive&#xD;
      attenuation of asleep SBP mean is significantly associated with diminished CVD risk (adjusted&#xD;
      HR=0.67 [0.55-0.81], P&lt;0.001, per SD decrease in asleep SBP mean), while progressive lowering&#xD;
      of awake SBP mean is not (adjusted HR=1.00 [0.86-1.18], P=0.958, per SD decrease in awake SBP&#xD;
      mean during follow-up). Overall, the best fully adjusted time-dependent Cox regression model&#xD;
      includes only the progressive attenuation of the asleep SBP mean (HR=0.76, 95%CI [0.68-0.85],&#xD;
      P&lt;0.001, per SD decrease in asleep SBP mean) and increase in the sleep-time relative SBP&#xD;
      decline (HR=1.19 [1.01-1.39], P=0.038, per SD decrease in sleep-time relative SBP decline&#xD;
      during follow-up). Thus, a diminished asleep, but not awake, BP mean is a highly significant&#xD;
      independent prognostic marker of reduced CVD morbidity and mortality risk and, therefore,&#xD;
      constitutes a novel therapeutic target for increased event-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus far, apart from MAPEC, the only prospective study in which participants are evaluated&#xD;
      periodically by ABPM is the Hygia Project, a research network primarily designed to extend&#xD;
      the use of ABPM in primary care as a requirement for the diagnosis of hypertension,&#xD;
      evaluation of response to treatment, and individualized assessment of CVD and other risks.&#xD;
      Presently, the Hygia Project is composed of 40 clinical sites (primary care centers)&#xD;
      involving 292 investigators properly trained to ABPM and all study procedures. The study was&#xD;
      designed to evaluate in the routine primary care clinical setting, among other objectives,&#xD;
      the prognostic value of multiple ABPM-derived parameters (mainly asleep BP mean and&#xD;
      sleep-time relative BP decline) with OBPM for the prediction of CVD morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      new-onset diabetes, and new-onset CKD. The investigators so far prospectively evaluated&#xD;
      18,078 individuals (9,769 men/8,309 women; 59.1±14.3 [mean±SD] years of age) with baseline&#xD;
      ambulatory BP ranging from normotension to hypertension. At inclusion and at scheduled visits&#xD;
      (mainly annually) during follow-up, ambulatory BP was evaluated for 48 consecutive hours.&#xD;
      During the current 5.1-year median patient follow-up, 2,311 individuals had CVD events,&#xD;
      including 1,209 experiencing the primary outcome (composite of CVD death, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, coronary revascularization, heart failure, and stroke). The asleep SBP mean was&#xD;
      the most significant prognostic marker of the primary outcome (HR=1.29 [95%CI 1.22-1.35] per&#xD;
      SD elevation, P&lt;0.001), independent of clinic (1.03 [0.97-1.09], P=0.315) and awake SBP (1.02&#xD;
      [0.94-1.10], P=0.682). Most important, the progressive treatment-induced attenuation of&#xD;
      asleep SBP was the most significant prognostic marker of event-free survival (0.75 [95%CI&#xD;
      0.69-0.82] per SD decrease, P&lt;0.001), independent of changes in office (1.07 [0.97-1.17],&#xD;
      P=0.176) or awake SBP mean (0.96 [0.85-1.08], P=0.473) during follow-up. Only the decrease in&#xD;
      asleep SBP mean and increase in sleep-time relative SBP decline towards the more normal&#xD;
      dipper BP pattern remained jointly and significantly associated with reduced CVD risk. There&#xD;
      was a highly significant decrease in risk of CVD outcome with progressively lower achieved&#xD;
      asleep SBP mean; in particular, CVD event-rate was significantly lower in participants with&#xD;
      achieved asleep SBP mean &lt;105 mmHg at their final evaluation than those with achieves asleep&#xD;
      SBP mean between 105 and 120 mmHg (3.35 vs. 7.27 events per 1,000 patients/year,&#xD;
      respectively, P&lt;0.001; 54% CVD risk reduction in the lower achieved asleep SBP mean of these&#xD;
      two groups of hypertensive patients with &quot;controlled&quot; asleep SBP mean). According to this&#xD;
      prospective evaluation, the asleep SBP mean, but not the daytime OBPM or the awake ambulatory&#xD;
      BP mean, is the most significant and independent prognostic marker of CVD outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of new evidence on the relationship between achieved OBPM and the risk of CVD&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality documented in the SPRINT trial, the recent 2017 guidelines of the&#xD;
      American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have&#xD;
      established lower values of 130/80 mmHg for clinic SBP/DBP as new diagnostic thresholds for&#xD;
      hypertension and therapeutic targets for treatment of all individuals aged ≥18 years&#xD;
      regardless of age, sex, or concomitant complications including presence of diabetes, CKD, or&#xD;
      history of past CVD event. According to these guidelines, the new proposed ABPM thresholds&#xD;
      for diagnosis of hypertension in adults are 130/80 and 110/65 mmHg for the awake and asleep&#xD;
      SBP/DBP means, respectively. However, the ACC/AHA guidelines do not provide any scientific&#xD;
      evidence documenting neither the equivalence between these ABPM thresholds and the 130/80&#xD;
      mmHg cut-off values for OBPM nor the potential improved CVD event-free survival time of the&#xD;
      proposed more intensive control of ambulatory BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the results described above, including the main findings of the MAPEC and Hygia trials&#xD;
      pertaining to the greater prognostic value of ABPM than OBPM, are derived from observational&#xD;
      prospective studies consistently documenting that therapeutic BP targets in hypertensive&#xD;
      individuals, i.e., persons at increased CVD risk, should be established in terms of proper&#xD;
      control of asleep BP. To date, no prospective randomized study has ever before evaluated&#xD;
      which should be the adequate therapeutic ABPM target for most effective reduction of CVD&#xD;
      risk. Accordingly, the Tratamiento de Hipertensión Arterial Durante el Sueño study (THADEUS,&#xD;
      i.e., Treatment of Hypertension During Sleep) has been designed to prospectively evaluate if&#xD;
      the &quot;intensive control&quot; of asleep SBP mean proposed by the new ACC/AHA guidelines (&lt;110 mmHg)&#xD;
      in more effective than the so far &quot;conventional control&quot; (&lt;120 mmHg) to reduce CVD morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality in hypertensive individuals.&#xD;
