  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining Apical patency during root canal treatment is a widely followed methodology in&#xD;
      modern endodontic treatment protocols. It involves passing of a small #08 or #10 K file&#xD;
      through the apical foramen during root canal shaping without widening it. it is done to keep&#xD;
      the foramen and apical thirds of root canal free of debris. proponents of the procedure claim&#xD;
      it to improve irrigation; provide better tactile feedback; reduce the chances of procedural&#xD;
      errors; reduce transportation and reduce pain following root canal procedures. however, there&#xD;
      is no clinical trial which specifically evaluates the effect of apical patency on outcome of&#xD;
      root canal procedure. hence this study was designed to evaluate the effect of apical patency&#xD;
      on outcome of root canal treatment.&#xD;

      AIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the role of maintaining Apical Patency on success of primary Non-Surgical Root&#xD;
           Canal Treatment (NSRCT) in Non-Vital teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the incidence of post-operative complications such as pain, flare-up etc&#xD;
           with and without maintaining apical patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects were recruited from the pool of patients referred for the initial non-surgical&#xD;
      root canal treatment to the post graduate department Of Conservative Dentistry &amp; Endodontics&#xD;
      at PGIDS, Rohtak (Haryana). Patients requiring Root Canal Treatment following the diagnosis&#xD;
      pulpal necrosis in mature mandibular first molar were selected for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were randomly allocated to one of the two study groups (patency or non-patency). It&#xD;
      was ensured that neither the patient, nor the primary investigator was aware of the treatment&#xD;
      protocol before completing the consent process. After administration of local anesthesia,&#xD;
      rubber dam isolation of the involved tooth was done. Caries excavation was done and access&#xD;
      cavity prepared using carbide burs in high speed handpiece with copious irrigation.&#xD;
      Debridement of the pulp chamber was done and all canal orifices identified. Working length&#xD;
      was obtained with the help of electronic apex locator (Root ZX) and confirmed&#xD;
      radiographically. ProTaper S1 and Sx were used to flare coronal thirds and WL was reconfirmed&#xD;
      with apex locator. Hand files No. 10, 15 and 20 were used till working length (WL) to prepare&#xD;
      a smooth reproducible glide path. ProTaper S1 and S2 were used till WL, followed by the use&#xD;
      of ProTaper finishing files (F1/F2/F3) to prepare the canal to desired size as determined by&#xD;
      the operator. Copious irrigation with 3% Sodium Hypochlorite was carried out throughout the&#xD;
      procedure with the use of 27-gauge side vented needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patency group, a #10 K- file was passed 1mm beyond the WL between each instrument change,&#xD;
      while in non-patency group it was carried till the WL. In patency group, a final radiograph&#xD;
      was taken after completion of preparation, with a #10 file placed 1mm beyond the WL to&#xD;
      confirm patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enlargement, the canals were irrigated with 5ml 17% EDTA for 1 min followed by&#xD;
      irrigation with 5ml 3% NaOCl. Canals were dried with absorbent paper points and filled with a&#xD;
      paste made by mixing Calcium hydroxide powder with 2% Chlorhexidine liquid; and the access&#xD;
      cavity restored with intermediate restorative material (IRM). The patient was recalled after&#xD;
      1 week. At the next appointment, the paste was removed with H- files and copious irrigation&#xD;
      with 3% NaOCl. Canals were examined under operating microscpe. A final rinse of 5ml 17% EDTA&#xD;
      and 5ml 3% NaOCl was done and canals dried with paper points. Canals were obturated with the&#xD;
      GuttaPercha and Zinc Oxide- Eugenol based sealer. After obturation, the cavity was restored&#xD;
      with Silver Amalgam/Composite/Full coverage crown. Immediate post-operative radiograph was&#xD;
      then taken using preset exposure parameters with Rinn paralleling device; and processed&#xD;
      manually. Follow up clinical and radiographic examination was carried out every 3 months,&#xD;
      till a 12 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Gathering Details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative and intraoperative data were obtained from patient records. Diagnostic and&#xD;
      treatment information was meticulously recorded on a custom designed endodontic treatment&#xD;
      form by the operator. Diagnostic and treatment details for each patient were extracted from&#xD;
      the records by the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of treatment outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment outcome was judged on the basis of clinical and radiographic findings recorded at&#xD;
      the follow up visit and comparison of the radiographs obtained at post obturation and the&#xD;
      follow-up visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic success:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in Periapical Index (PAI) scores (Orstaviket al) observed at 12-months was noted.&#xD;
      Scoring of each tooth was done according to the following five point scale (PAI):&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAI Score Description of radiographic findings&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Normal periapical structures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Small changes in bone structure&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Changes in bone structure with some mineral loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Periodontitis with well-defined radiolucent area&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Severe periodontitis with exacerbating features&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three experienced observers with no knowledge of the treatment protocol independently&#xD;
      examined immediate post obturation and follow-up radiographs, mounted side by side, under&#xD;
      controlled conditions. The treatment was considered successful only when both clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic criteria were met. In multirooted teeth, the worst outcome by root decided the&#xD;
      overall outcome for the tooth. In the event of disagreement, the three observers met to&#xD;
      discuss their findings and came to an agreement. In the absence of unanimity, the majority&#xD;
      decision was taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Success:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absence of pain and tenderness to palpation/ percussion, absence of sinus or any associated&#xD;
      soft tissue swelling, tooth mobility of grade-I or less, and no deterioration in periodontal&#xD;
      probing depth as compared with baseline measurements comprised the criteria for clinical&#xD;
      success.&#xD;
