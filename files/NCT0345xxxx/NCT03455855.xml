    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, single-arm study to&#xD;
      demonstrate the acceptable safety and performance of the JETSTREAM™ Atherectomy System&#xD;
      (Jetstream) used during percutaneous peripheral vascular intervention in patients with&#xD;
      occlusive atherosclerotic lesions in the native SFA and/or PPA. It is intended that all&#xD;
      patients with qualifying lesions would be considered for enrollment and treated with the&#xD;
      Jetstream System.&#xD;

      study objectives: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of JETSTREAM™ Atherectomy System&#xD;
      (Jetstream) for treating symptomatic Chinese patients with occlusive atherosclerotic lesions&#xD;
      in native superficial femoral artery (SFA) and/ or proximal popliteal arteries (PPA)during&#xD;
      percutaneous peripheral vascular intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planed Indications for use: The Jetstream System is intended for use in atherectomy of the&#xD;
      peripheral vasculature and to break apart and remove atherosclerotic disease, debris, and&#xD;
      thrombus from the SFA and/or PPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Safety Endpoint: Major Adverse Event (MAE), defined as all-cause death, target limb&#xD;
      unplanned major amputation and/or target lesion revascularization (TLR), within 30 days post&#xD;
      index procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Effectiveness Endpoint: Acute reduction of percent diameter stenosis (%DS) post&#xD;
      atherectomy but prior to any adjunctive therapy, when compared to its baseline diameter&#xD;
      stenosis (absolute mean percentage).&#xD;
