  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to evaluate the safe admission avoidance and the overall economic impact&#xD;
      associated with management of worsening HF using the drug-device combination product, the&#xD;
      Furoscix Infusor, outside the hospital setting in patients initially presenting to the&#xD;
      emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug, Furoscix (furosemide injection 8 mg/ml), is a furosemide solution buffered to&#xD;
      a neutral pH containing 80 mg/10 mL for subcutaneous administration over 5 hours via the&#xD;
      Furoscix Infusor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate differences in healthcare resource utilization and direct medical costs for&#xD;
           patients treated with the Furoscix Infusor outside the hospital versus patients&#xD;
           receiving intravenous furosemide for ≤ 72 hours in the hospital setting for 30 days&#xD;
           post-discharge from the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the safety of Furoscix administered outside the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate and describe quality of life and patient satisfaction for patients who&#xD;
           receive the Furoscix Infusor outside the hospital setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This adaptive clinical trial will include a prospective treatment arm (i.e., Furoscix&#xD;
      administered via the Furoscix Infusor) administered outside the hospital that will be&#xD;
      compared to a propensity-matched historical control arm of patients admitted to the hospital&#xD;
      for ≤ 72 hours (i.e., Treatment As Usual (TAU)) that will be derived from administrative&#xD;
      claims data. Eligible patients for the Furoscix arm will be patients with HF and fluid&#xD;
      overload who initially present to the emergency department (ED) and who are expected to&#xD;
      require parenteral diuresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it is determined by the investigator that the patient requires parenteral diuresis or&#xD;
      continued diuresis outside of the ED care setting and meets all study eligibility criteria,&#xD;
      he/she may be consented and enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment comprises a preprogrammed bi-phasic 5-hour drug administration. Subjects will&#xD;
      be instructed on the use of the Furoscix Infusor by the investigator and/or study staff in&#xD;
      accordance with the instructions for use. The initial dose of the study product may be&#xD;
      administered in the ED or at home. Additional doses will be provided to the subject for&#xD;
      self-administration or administration by a caregiver in the home setting as directed by the&#xD;
      investigator or study staff. The total duration in days and total number of doses of the&#xD;
      initial therapy will be determined by the investigator based on an estimated volume of&#xD;
      diuresis desired to transition patient back to their oral diuretic maintenance therapy.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive scheduled at-home telephone calls from a HF nurse on Days 1 and 7 and&#xD;
      one call between Days 14-21. Planned in-clinic visits will be conducted between Day 2-4 and&#xD;
      then Day 30. Unscheduled at-home telephone calls by a HF nurse and unscheduled in-clinic&#xD;
      visits may be performed if felt clinically indicated by the study team or the clinical&#xD;
      provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period will be up to 30 days after enrollment. All outcomes will be assessed up to&#xD;
      30 days after the initial discharge from the emergency department.&#xD;
