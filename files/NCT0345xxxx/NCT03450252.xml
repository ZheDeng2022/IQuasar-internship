  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to assess the acute effects of a pacemaker on reducing&#xD;
      abnormally high intracavity pressures in the hearts of patients with mid-cavity obstructive&#xD;
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). During a 12-month period of double-blinded follow-up,&#xD;
      descriptive data will be collected on patients symptomatic and physical performance during&#xD;
      dichotomous pacemaker settings for 6-months each (active and back-up). The statistical&#xD;
      information collected will be used to design a much larger research trial of patient benefit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited heart disease, affecting 1 in&#xD;
      500 of the general population. It is characterised by abnormal thickening of the heart&#xD;
      muscle. The various patterns of thickening of the muscle in the main pumping chamber, or left&#xD;
      ventricle (LV), can result in obstruction to blood flow within the heart, raising the&#xD;
      pressures in the heart and placing extra strain on the heart muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The obstruction can cause patients to suffer from symptoms such as shortness of breath and&#xD;
      chest pain, along with poor exercise tolerance, and dizzy spells. In very symptomatic&#xD;
      patients with the commonest type of obstruction, invasive procedures performed either via an&#xD;
      open-heart or keyhole operation can reduce the increased basal septal muscle mass at the&#xD;
      point of obstruction. However, in around 1 in 10 HCM patients, the obstruction is deep within&#xD;
      the LV where a ring of thick muscle blocks blood flow when it contracts. These patients&#xD;
      provide a challenge for doctors, as this type of obstruction is much less suitable for open&#xD;
      heart or keyhole operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative is to use a cardiac pacemaker to alter the timing of the contraction in the&#xD;
      ring of thick muscle such that different parts of the ring contract at different times and&#xD;
      thereby reduce obstruction to blood flow. The investigators' early experience with this new&#xD;
      treatment shows that carefully placing the pacemaker wires can reduce the obstruction and&#xD;
      improve patient symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key questions of this research include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How much can optimal ventricular pacing reduce the obstruction by?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How important is choosing which part of the heart the pacemaker activates first?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does reducing obstruction in this way make patients better in the short and long term?&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Taking part in this study will involve recording the information at a pre-implant visit, a visit for cardiac pacemaker implantation and follow-up visits four and eight months later.&#xD;
At the pre-implant visit, participants will undergo assessment of symptoms, physical performance and blood test for a protein, Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP).&#xD;
During the pacemaker implantation, the investigators will record the pressures within the heart using a catheter during both active pacing and back-up pacing settings.&#xD;
The day after the pacemaker implant participants will undergo double-blind randomisation into either the treatment or non-treatment arm (active or back-up pacing respectively). At four months, cross-over takes place with assessment as above, before device reprogramming into either the treatment or non-treatment arm depending on which was completed first.&#xD;
At the end of the second four month period, participants will undergo repeat assessment as above. That will conclude the study.</intervention_model_description>
