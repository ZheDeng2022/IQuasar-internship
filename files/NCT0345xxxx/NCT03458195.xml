  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory process in intestinal segments leads to tissue&#xD;
      damage. More than two thirds of CD patients need intestinal resection. Symptomatic clinical&#xD;
      recurrence occurs in 60% by 10 years. The principal factors affecting postoperative&#xD;
      recurrence are active smoking, penetrating disease, perianal lesions history, prior&#xD;
      intestinal resection, small bowel resection extent, and prophylaxis treatment absence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ileocolonoscopy within one year of surgery can predict clinical recurrence risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different therapies are proposed after surgery, to prevent post-operative recurrence :&#xD;
      Thiopurines, 6-mercaptopurine (positive for clinical and endoscopic postoperative recurrence&#xD;
      prevention), Anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy (anti-TNF), the most effective therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intestinal microbiota acts as a central factor in the CD pathogenesis, and fecal stream role&#xD;
      is clearly shown. Various changes in luminal flora with a possible link to local inflammation&#xD;
      was also demonstrated. Bacteria associated with postoperative recurrence could be more&#xD;
      pathogenic as adherent invasive E coli (AIEC), which could be a pathogen in CD through&#xD;
      several mechanisms including increased mucosal colonization, adherence, replication and&#xD;
      induction of TNF secretion. Alternatively, postoperative CD recurrence could be linked to a&#xD;
      protective commensal species lack, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microscopic inflammation occurs as early as 8 days after anastomosis in the neoterminal ileum&#xD;
      mucosa. IL6, IL10 and TGFb levels, measured in neoterminal ileum early after surgery are&#xD;
      associated with different rates of postoperative recurrence. It suggests cytokines&#xD;
      implication in postoperative recurrence. T cells are major players in the intestinal immune&#xD;
      response. The presence at time of surgery and persistence of disease inducing T cell clonal&#xD;
      expansions could play an important role in post-operative recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to define a classification of ileal Crohn's Disease based on data&#xD;
      integration on a large cohort of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's Disease is a major health issue with a complex etiology and despite available medical&#xD;
      treatment, patients endure poor quality of life. The disease 's characterization on a&#xD;
      molecular level will allow for a better management of patients treatment. To do so, the&#xD;
      strategy is to integrate precise prospective clinical records with extensive biological data&#xD;
      in a large cohort of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the clinical centers, participating to the study, include patients, with a tight&#xD;
      collaboration between Gastroenterology and Surgery departments. Demographics and clinical&#xD;
      parameters are collected in an eCRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of patients is performed, before a scheduled ileocecal resection or ileal&#xD;
      resection, and after eligibility criteria checking, and consent form signature. During&#xD;
      surgery, several samples are collected : blood samples, mucosal biopsies, and surgical&#xD;
      specimens. As usual practice, post-operative treatment will be prescribed at investigator's&#xD;
      discretion, with help of a pre-established algorithm. Then, an endoscopic exam is scheduled,&#xD;
      at least 6 months after surgery, or at least 6 months after intestine continuity restoration,&#xD;
      in case of temporary stoma. Several samples are also collected during this exam (blood, ileal&#xD;
      and colon biopsies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time as these 2 visits, clinical data regarding medical history, CD history,&#xD;
      surgical history, treatments history, post-operative treatment if prescribed, treatments&#xD;
      history between surgery and colonoscopy 6 months later, endoscopic score. Clinical data are&#xD;
      also collected 18 months after surgery during a scheduled visit organized as usual practice,&#xD;
      for long-term study : Clinical relapse, surgical recurrence, change in the therapy,&#xD;
      hospitalizations and complications A patient has achieved the study after the endoscopic&#xD;
      exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies will be performed along the cohort setting-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcriptomic analyses of mucosal tissues:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of a molecular signature predictive of post-operative recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Molecular classification of ileal Crohn's Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of the mucosa-associated microbiota&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of association of AIEC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of anti-TNF efficacy in post-operative recurrence prevention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of new biologics in the treatment of post-operative recurrence All the biologic&#xD;
           samples are stored on sites at -80°C, or at room temperature depending on the samples :&#xD;
           Samples collected in Formol tubes, are sent immediatly, at room temperature, to the&#xD;
           central pathology department in Beaujon Hospital, Paris. All the other samples, stored&#xD;
           at -80°C, are sent to a central department, the Bio-Bank of Pasteur Hospital, Nice&#xD;
           (every 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples analyses are performed by dedicated research centers: DNA, and RNA extraction for&#xD;
      transcriptome analysis, Micobiota analysis, Lipids analysis, AIEC analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histological analyzes: Analyzis of the structure and inflammatory status of intestinal tissue&#xD;
      of patients of the cohort, particularly at the ileal limit of the surgical specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular Biology: Whole genome expression analyses are performed using microarray and&#xD;
      followed by Gene Ontology and clustering analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherent Invasive E.Coli (AIEC): The search for AIEC bacteria is carried out by culturing and&#xD;
      investigating the characteristics of adhesion, invasion in Int-407 cells, and survival within&#xD;
      THP-1 macrophages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiota: Bacterial composition of the ileal mucosa associated microbiota is analyzed at&#xD;
      time of surgery using 16S (MiSeq, Illumina) sequencing. The obtained sequences are analyzed&#xD;
      using the Qiime pipeline to assess composition, alpha and beta diversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenotype of mucosal and peripheral immune cells: Immune cells are extracted from blood and&#xD;
      fresh mucosal tissues. The phenotype of these cells is analyzed by cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T cell repertoire: T cell receptor analysis on DNA extracted from biopsies is performed by&#xD;
      next generation sequencing (Adaptive Biotechnology Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA). It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the persistence of these clonal expansions could be linked to the presence&#xD;
      of specific microbial antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Integration: The aim is to predict post-operative recurrence at M6. Integration of all&#xD;
      datasets will explore the ability to predict post-operative recurrence. This will also allow&#xD;
      to establish a molecular classification of CD, similar to what is already available in the&#xD;
      oncology field. It will also be tried to find regulatory genes of the intestinal mucosa&#xD;
      (&quot;hubs&quot;), using causal models (Bayesian networks) and co-expression networks (WCGNA). These&#xD;
      findings could help drive potential innovative therapy for the treatment of CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparative analysis of the mucosa-associated transcriptome and microbiome will be&#xD;
      performed. This could allow to elucidate the relations between bacteria and the intestinal&#xD;
      mucosa, and to uncover pathways implicated in the bacteria-mucosa dialog. The correlations&#xD;
      between certain groups of bacteria and the activation of a number of genes will be looked at.&#xD;
      And genes known to play a role in the interaction between the microbiome and the mucosa will&#xD;
      be specifically studied (MUC, DEF, REG, NOD2, …).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, once the patient genotypes will be available, an analysis of the genome together with&#xD;
      the transcriptome and the relationship between genotype, transcriptome, and microbiome will&#xD;
      be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This analysis should help to robustly identify major pathways involved in intestinal&#xD;
      inflammation, study the role played by genetics, and the impact on the gut microbiome. And&#xD;
      finally to correlate these results with carefully curated clinical data: relapse/remission,&#xD;
      post-operative recurrence, efficacy of post-operative therapies (anti TNF agents,&#xD;
      ustekinumab).&#xD;
