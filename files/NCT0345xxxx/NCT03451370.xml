  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Oxaliplatin-based doublets plus bevacizumab are standard first-line therapy options for&#xD;
           patients (pts) with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Slight adjustments in&#xD;
           chemo-dosage are commonly applied in routinely practice to elderly pts, but those&#xD;
           modified schedules have never been standardized&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The addition of oxaliplatin versus no oxaliplatin to treatment with 5-fluorouracil in&#xD;
           older and frail untreated pts with mCRC resulted in a non-statistically significant&#xD;
           trend toward improvement in Progression Free Survival (PFS) and a lack of benefit in&#xD;
           Overall Survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In elderly pts deemed unfit for an upfront combined chemotherapy a fluoropyrimide-based&#xD;
           monotherapy plus bevacizumab is considered a reasonable first-line treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical definition of elderly (over 70 years old) pts with CRC that may deserve a more&#xD;
           or less intensive combination therapy is still debated. The cut-off of 75 years old&#xD;
           combined with ECOG PS assessment is a reasonable approach for clearly defining&#xD;
           candidates to different approaches&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Several geriatric screening tools have been used to identify pts with a geriatric&#xD;
           profile potentially predicting for overall survival and risk of toxicity. The G8&#xD;
           screening tool has been already validated in pts with cancer showing the strongest&#xD;
           prognostic value for OS; the CRASH score is able to stratify pts according an estimated&#xD;
           risk of treatment-related toxicities&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of these considerations, we designed the present observational study of&#xD;
      first-line therapy with bevacizumab in combination with capecitabine and oxaliplatin in&#xD;
      previously untreated elderly pts affected by unresectable mCRC in order to evaluate its&#xD;
      efficacy in real world practice (as measured by progression free survival)&#xD;
