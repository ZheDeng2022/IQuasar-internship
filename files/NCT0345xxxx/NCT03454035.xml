      This phase I study is designed to establish the safety, maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the ERK inhibitor ulixertinib (BVD-523) when combined&#xD;
      with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to a maximum of 30 adult patients will be enrolled in the 5 possible dose escalation&#xD;
      cohorts. These patients will have histologically confirmed advanced solid tumor disease&#xD;
      refractory to standard of care therapy, or for which there is no accepted standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, 15 adult patients will be treated at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) in the&#xD;
      expansion cohort involving metastatic pancreatic cancer patients who have received at least&#xD;
      one line of therapy in the metastatic setting.&#xD;
