  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most people with moderate or severe TBI have difficulty returning to their usual social roles&#xD;
      and activities. The OBIA has developed a program where peers (other individuals living with&#xD;
      TBI) coach or mentor those with more recent brain injury. The objective of this project is to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility of measuring the impact of the OBIA Peer Program on social&#xD;
      participation and mood compared to a control group who have not received peer support yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will involve three phases. It will begin with a qualitative component&#xD;
      (stakeholder interviews), then a pilot RCT, and end with more interviews to explore the&#xD;
      success of the study intervention. A qualitative descriptive approach will be used at these&#xD;
      first and last phases of the study. In Phase 1, interviews will be conducted with&#xD;
      approximately 15 participants including individuals with moderate to severe TBI, caregivers,&#xD;
      Mentors, OBIA staff members, and health researchers. The proposed Phase 2 will be a clinical&#xD;
      trial, conducted with 60 participants. These participants will be randomized to one of three&#xD;
      groups: a twice a week Program (n=20), a once a week Program (n=20), or the wait list control&#xD;
      group (n=20). For Phase 3, a sub group of approximately 25 participants from Phase 2 who&#xD;
      participated in the OBIA Peer Support Program will be asked to participate in a one-on-one,&#xD;
      telephone/Skype interview. A sub-group of Mentors will also be asked to participate in a&#xD;
      one-on-one, telephone/Skype interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project will address the highest priority areas of &quot;strategies to enhance&#xD;
      social participation and community life (personal relationships)&quot; and &quot;psychological&#xD;
      strategies to improve mood, depression, and irritability&quot;, as identified in the ONF's Request&#xD;
      for Proposals on &quot;Addressing Evidence Gaps in Moderate to Severe TBI Rehabilitation&quot;. The&#xD;
      study will provide important results to inform a RCT (of appropriate size) on the impact of&#xD;
      peer support on the social participation and mood of individuals with moderate to severe TBI.&#xD;
      This study will then provide the best evidence to support the recommendation on &quot;a&#xD;
      peer-supported relationship model of intervention&quot;, and inform future versions of the&#xD;
      INESSS-ONF Guideline.&#xD;

      Phase 1 - Understanding the Enablers, Barriers of Implementing the Trial Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objective: To understand the perceived enablers and barriers of implementing the&#xD;
      peer support trial protocol, including the perceived enablers and barriers to participant&#xD;
      recruitment, retention, adherence, and data collection, of implementing the selected outcomes&#xD;
      measures, and of participating in the trial, from the perspective of stakeholders (knowledge&#xD;
      users) including individuals with moderate to severe TBI, caregivers, OBIA Peer Support&#xD;
      Program Mentors, OBIA staff members who are a part of the Peer Support Program, health&#xD;
      services and knowledge translation (KT) researchers with expertise in TBI, and methodologists&#xD;
      with expertise in clinical trials; Hypothesis: A better understanding of the perceived&#xD;
      enablers and barriers of implementing the peer support trial protocol will enhance the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention and feasibility of the trial in Phase 2 and results will be&#xD;
      used to refine the research protocol for the RCT, if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and recruitment: A purposive sampling of each of the different stakeholder&#xD;
      groups will be used. The OBIA Peer Support Program Database will be used to recruit the&#xD;
      Partners (including caregivers) and Mentors. On-line searches and/or the contacts of the&#xD;
      Principal Investigators will be used to recruit the OBIA staff members and the&#xD;
      researchers/methodologists. We will aim to recruit a total of 15 key informants for Phase 1.&#xD;
      Individuals who are interested in participating in the study will contact the Research&#xD;
      Coordinator via telephone or email to gain further information about the study. The&#xD;
      eligibility criteria of all participants will be confirmed by the Research Coordinator. This&#xD;
      process will be followed for all phases of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: participants will take part in a one-on-one, semi-structured telephone/Skype&#xD;
      interview lasting approximately 45-60 minutes. All interviews will be digitally recorded and&#xD;
      transcribed verbatim for data analysis. During transcription, any identifying information&#xD;
      will be removed and the participant will be assigned a coded identifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: analysis will be conducted using inductive thematic analysis as described by&#xD;
      Braun and Clark (2006). The analysis will assess the perceived enablers and barriers to&#xD;
      participant recruitment, retention, adherence, and data collection, of implementing the&#xD;
      selected outcomes measures, and of participating in the OBIA Peer Support Program and the&#xD;
      trial itself. To facilitate the organization and analysis of the qualitative data, the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator's/Research Coordinator's reflective notes from the interviews, as well&#xD;
      as the transcripts, will be entered into NVivo v.11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 - Evaluating the Feasibility of the Trial Protocol, Conducting a (Pilot) Randomized&#xD;
      Controlled Feasibility Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objective: a) To evaluate the feasibility of participant recruitment and retention,&#xD;
      data collection, as well as participant adherence to the OBIA Peer Support Program; b) To&#xD;
      estimate effect sizes of the immediate impact of the twice/week versus once/week OBIA Peer&#xD;
      Support Program compared to a wait list control group on social participation (primary&#xD;
      outcome), mood, HRQoL, and self-efficacy (secondary outcomes); Hypotheses: a) It is expected&#xD;
      that adequate (i.e., ≥75%) recruitment, retention and adherence to the OBIA Peer Support&#xD;
      Program will be achieved; b) It is expected that the six-month OBIA Peer Support Program&#xD;
      delivered twice weekly will lead to greater mean improvement, on measures of social&#xD;
      participation, mood (i.e., depressive symptoms), HRQoL, and self-efficacy, than the same&#xD;
      program delivered once weekly or a wait list control intervention (i.e., a dose response&#xD;
      effect will be observed); c) It will be possible to estimate the magnitude of effect to allow&#xD;
      the sample size calculation for a definitive trial; Significance: The results of the&#xD;
      currently proposed research will support a future definitive RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and recruitment: eligible Partner participants will include community-based&#xD;
      (i.e., no longer participating in a comprehensive rehabilitation program) individuals who&#xD;
      have a moderate to severe TBI. Partners will be recruited via an online advertisement posted&#xD;
      on the OBIA website as well as the websites of the 14 participating brain injury&#xD;
      associations. Mentor participants may also be recruited from the OBIA Peer Support Program&#xD;
      Database. We will aim to recruit a total of 60 Partners (i.e., n=20 participants per group)&#xD;
      and 20-40 Mentors (those paired with partners in the intervention arm) for Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and Control Groups: Participants in the intervention groups will take part in&#xD;
      the OBIA Peer Support Group, receiving either twice a week (i.e., two 20-40 minute calls) or&#xD;
      once a week (i.e., one 20-40 minute call) support. In keeping with an average duration of&#xD;
      support, and for the purposes of the currently proposed study, the intervention duration will&#xD;
      be 6 months. Participants in the control group will be assigned to a wait list. They will&#xD;
      receive the OBIA Peer Support Program after the intervention group (i.e., after 6 months).&#xD;
      This assignment does not represent a significant variation in the usual intake procedure, as&#xD;
      the OBIA Peer Support Program already maintains a wait list (personal communication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size, Randomization, and Blinding: since this is a feasibility study, a formal sample&#xD;
      size calculation will not be performed. The recruitment of 20 participants in each arm of the&#xD;
      trial is judged to be feasible and will produce a robust and useful amount of data. Partner&#xD;
      participants who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and have provided informed consent&#xD;
      to take part in the trial will be randomized to either the intervention (twice/week or&#xD;
      once/week Program) or the wait list control groups. Mentors will be assigned to those&#xD;
      randomized into the intervention arms by the OBIA Peer Support Program using their usual&#xD;
      methods. A web-based randomization service with secure password protected login using random&#xD;
      variable block-size will be used. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding of the&#xD;
      Partners and Mentors will not be possible. However, the processes of outcome assessment and&#xD;
      data analysis will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: baseline data including demographic and descriptive information (e.g., age,&#xD;
      sex, severity of injury, marital status), as well as the following outcomes measures&#xD;
      described below, will be captured prior to randomization: social participation using the&#xD;
      Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ); mood (i.e., depressive symptoms) using the&#xD;
      nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9); health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using&#xD;
      the Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12); self-efficacy using the TBI Self-efficacy&#xD;
      Questionnaire. Follow-up assessments for the outcome measures will occur at 6 weeks, 3&#xD;
      months, and 6 months. Participants will have the option to complete their baseline&#xD;
      demographic and descriptive information and outcome measures as well as their follow-up&#xD;
      assessments themselves (i.e., paper-based and mailed back to the research team), by&#xD;
      telephone, or on-line via Survey Monkey®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Quantitative Component: baseline characteristics (e.g., age, sex, severity of&#xD;
      injury, marital status, etc.) will be described and any differences between the three groups&#xD;
      will be compared using means/medians and frequencies and proportions. As this is a&#xD;
      feasibility study, and the ability to collect data is being tested, no data imputation will&#xD;
      be performed to account for missing data. The feasibility of recruitment will be based on&#xD;
      whether 60 participants (i.e., 20 participants in each arm of the trial) can be enrolled in&#xD;
      the trial during the 6-month recruitment period. The number of individuals who provide&#xD;
      informed consent per month will also be calculated. The feasibility of retention will be&#xD;
      assessed by calculating the proportion of participants with complete data on each outcome&#xD;
      measure at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. To evaluate participant adherence, the proportion&#xD;
      of twice-weekly and weekly sessions attended by the participants will be calculated. The&#xD;
      proportion of participants who withdraw from the intervention at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6&#xD;
      months will be calculated along with the reason(s) for withdrawing. The feasibility threshold&#xD;
      will be set at &gt;75% for recruitment, retention, and adherence (to the intervention). To&#xD;
      evaluate changes between groups, the analysis plan will focus on mean change scores and&#xD;
      confidence intervals (i.e., mixed-design analysis of variance model) for the outcome measures&#xD;
      described above. Effect sizes will be calculated via Cohen d to reflect the impact of the&#xD;
      OBIA Peer Support Program on social participation, mood, HRQoL, and self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UPDATE TO PHASE 2 AFTER COMPLETING PHASE 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of the phase 1 study and prior to implementing the phase 2 pilot RCT,&#xD;
      the following procedures were changed/finalized for the RCT: 1) the study will only include&#xD;
      the once/week intervention arm and a wait-list control (participant recruitment expectations&#xD;
      adjusted accordingly to 40 partners (20 per arm) and 20 mentors (to be matched with those in&#xD;
      the intervention arm); 2) the trial length has been reduced from 6 months to 4 months, and&#xD;
      data collection points now include baseline, 2 months, and 4 months; 3) The Short Form-20&#xD;
      Health Survey (SF-20) will replace the SF-12 outcome measures; and, 4) data collection will&#xD;
      be done by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 - Exploring the Impact and Acceptability of the OBIA Peer Support Program and the&#xD;
      Trial Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objective: To explore the impact and acceptability of the OBIA Peer Support Program&#xD;
      and the trial itself from the perspective of Partners and Mentors; Hypothesis: It is expected&#xD;
      that the OBIA Peer Support Program will be acceptable to both the Partners and Mentors and&#xD;
      that an increased understanding of the OBIA Peer Support Program and the trial itself will be&#xD;
      achieved; Significance: The results of Phase 3 will lead to an understanding of the &quot;active&#xD;
      ingredients&quot; or mechanisms that are associated with improved outcomes and the impact of&#xD;
      &quot;dosage&quot; of interactions. Furthermore, the results of Phase 3 will refine and improve future&#xD;
      iterations of the OBIA Peer Support Program and the implementation of the definitive RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and recruitment: Purposive sampling will be used to recruit intervention group&#xD;
      Partner participants in Phase 3 (e.g. to ensure participants with a range of severity of&#xD;
      TBI), and all prticipating Mentors will be approached about participating in the interviews.&#xD;
      Recruitment of participants will cease once data saturation has been achieved, which is the&#xD;
      point when successive interviews become repetitive and no new responses or themes emerge. We&#xD;
      will aim to recruit a total of 25 Partners and Mentors for Phase 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: participants will take part in a one-on-one, semi-structured telephone/Skype&#xD;
      interview lasting approximately 45-60 minutes about their experience with the RCT. All&#xD;
      interviews will be digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim for data analysis. During&#xD;
      transcription, any identifying information will be removed and the participant will be&#xD;
      assigned a coded identifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan: analysis will be conducted using inductive thematic analysis as described by&#xD;
      Braun and Clark (2006) and will assess participants' experiences with the intervention and&#xD;
      the trial protocol itself (i.e., the impact and acceptability of the program&#xD;
      itself/intervention and the trial protocol itself). To facilitate the organization and&#xD;
      analysis of the qualitative data, the Principal Investigator's/Research Coordinator's&#xD;
      reflective notes from the interviews, as well as the transcripts, will be entered into NVivo&#xD;
      v.11.&#xD;
