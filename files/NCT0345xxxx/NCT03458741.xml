  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nine healthy, moderately fit male volunteers participated in the study. The subjects gave&#xD;
      written informed consent after having been informed of any possible risk and discomfort&#xD;
      associated with the study. The study was approved by the regional ethics committee in Denmark&#xD;
      (Journal number: H-4-2013-071) and performed in accordance with the Declarations of Helsinki&#xD;
      II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects underwent 3 clinical investigations (day 1, day 2 and day 5) during a 5 day&#xD;
      glycogen supercompensation regime. The subjects were asked to refrain from physical activity&#xD;
      and to eat a controlled diet containing 60% carbohydrates (CHO) for 4 days prior to the&#xD;
      initial experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival at the laboratory on day 1, the subjects performed one-legged knee extensor&#xD;
      exercise for 1 hour at 80% of PWL interspersed by 5 min bouts at 90% of PWL. This was&#xD;
      followed by interval exercise until exhaustion containing 4 min bouts starting at 100% PWL&#xD;
      followed by 1 min at 50% of PWL. Upon cessation of exercise the subjects showered and rested&#xD;
      in the supine position for 4 hours. Then a 120 min hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp was&#xD;
      initiated by a bolus insulin injection (9.0 mU/kg, Actrapid, Novo Nordisk, Denmark) followed&#xD;
      by continuous insulin infusion (1.42 mU/kg/min insulin) reaching a level of plasma insulin&#xD;
      around 100 µU/mL (n=9). At least 2 hours before the insulin clamp, catheters were placed in&#xD;
      both femoral, one antecubital and one dorsal hand vein. A heat pad was placed around the&#xD;
      lower part of the arm and hand in order to &quot;arterialize&quot; blood drawn from the hand vein.&#xD;
      Substrate uptake/release across the legs was calculated by multiplying the arterial-venous&#xD;
      (AV) difference in blood substrate concentration by femoral arterial blood flow (measured by&#xD;
      ultrasound, Philips DICOM). Blood glucose levels were maintained at the euglycemic predefined&#xD;
      target by continuously adjusting the glucose infusion rate (GIR) (20% glucose solution;&#xD;
      Fresenius Kabi, Sweden). Concurrent measures of substrate AV differences and blood flow were&#xD;
      performed every 20 min. Muscle biopsies from m. vastus lateralis were obtained under local&#xD;
      anaesthesia (3-5 ml of Xylocaine, 20 mg/ml.) in the basal- and insulin-stimulated state (120&#xD;
      min) by use of needle biopsy technique. Muscle specimen were frozen within 20 sec in liquid&#xD;
      nitrogen and stored at -80°C for further analysis. A new incision was made for every biopsy&#xD;
      and spaced 4-5 cm apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This insulin clamp procedure in combination with basal and insulin stimulated muscle biopsies&#xD;
      was repeated in the rested state (without prior exercise) on day 2 and day 5. The subjects&#xD;
      arrived in the morning in the overnight fasted state at day 1, day 2 and day 5. During the 5&#xD;
      day supercompensation regime the subjects were provided a predefined isocaloric diet&#xD;
      containing 80% carbohydrates, 10% fat and 10% proteins. All food items were handle out to the&#xD;
      subjects and compliance of the diet regime was ensured by survey.&#xD;

    <description>The subjects arrived in the morning in the overnight fasted state at day 1, day 2 and day 5. Upon arrival in the morning the subjects were given a meal corresponding to 5% of their daily energy intake (~600-800 kJ). During the 5 day supercompensation regime the subjects were provided a predefined isocaloric diet containing 80% carbohydrates, 10% fat and 10% proteins. All food items were handle out to the subjects and compliance of the diet regime was ensured by survey.</description>
