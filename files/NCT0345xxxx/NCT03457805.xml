  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study assessing efficacy and safety in patients with advanced prostate&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PAE has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of prostatic bleeding and lower&#xD;
      urinary tract symptoms arising from bladder outlet obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced (defined as locally advanced, metastatic or both in this study) PCA is frequently&#xD;
      associated with both of these conditions. The currently most frequently performed palliative&#xD;
      surgical treatment is TURP. Though performed endoscopically, TURP is associated with&#xD;
      significant side effects in this setting. PAE has been shown to have a superior side-effect&#xD;
      profile in the treatment of bladder outlet obstruction compared to TURP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, there is growing evidence that patients with advanced PCA might benefit from&#xD;
      cytoreductive therapy (e.g. radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy).&#xD;
      However, recent methods of cytoreductive treatment of PCA hold the risk of being highly&#xD;
      invasive and are associated with severe side effects. PAE might represent a minimally&#xD;
      invasive alternative in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, efficacy and safety of PAE in patients with advanced prostate cancer is assessed&#xD;
      in this pilot-study.&#xD;
