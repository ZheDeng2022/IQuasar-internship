  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Traditional office blood pressure (BP) measurement is often inaccurate and is&#xD;
      inferior to out-of-office measurements, such as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM),&#xD;
      in predicting cardiovascular outcomes. A relatively new BP measurement method, called&#xD;
      Automatic Office Blood Pressure measurement (AOBP), may provide similar BP readings to ABPM&#xD;
      (latest clinical gold standard for BP measurements) and can easily be conducted in clinics.&#xD;
      AOBP machines measure BP repeatedly 3-5 times with 1-min intervals and automatically provide&#xD;
      the mean BP value. While AOBP was used in landmark trials (e.g. SPRINT trial) and was shown&#xD;
      to eliminate white-coat effect, AOBP is rarely used in Hong Kong partly because there is no&#xD;
      data concerning the accuracy of AOBP in Chinese. Almost all previous AOBP research used BpTRU&#xD;
      (AOBP model), but BpTRU manufacturer was shut down permanently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To assess if WatchBP Office (another AOBP model) has superior diagnostic accuracy than&#xD;
      traditional office BP measurements, when compared to ABPM readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: 150 Chinese adult patients with a diagnosis of essential hypertension will be&#xD;
      recruited consecutively from a Government-funded primary care clinic. All patients will have&#xD;
      their BP measured by a 48-hour ABPM, a WatchBP office, and two traditional office blood&#xD;
      pressure measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABPM will be considered the gold standard; sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative&#xD;
      predictive values of AOBP and traditional BP to diagnose elevated BP level, masked&#xD;
      hypertension and white-coat hypertension will be calculated and compared&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implication: if WatchBP provides closer BP readings to ABPM, this can lead to its&#xD;
      implementation in routine clinical practice&#xD;

    <description>mean difference of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) between AOBP machines (WatchBP Office, BpTRU)/office BP and daytime ABPM will be compared by the two-tailed t-test; A Bland-Altman type plot will be shown for both comparisons.

    <description>BP measurement: The nurse or assistant will leave the room after confirmed validity and the WatchBP will automatically measure BP for the participant at 1-minute intervals for 3 more readings; previous research showed that accurate BP readings could be obtained using 1-minute intervals. This is also the measuring method suggested by the manufacturer. The machine will automatically calculate the mean BP using the 3 readings. The mean BP value will be used for analysis. The diagnostic cutoff for diagnosing HT will be ≥135/85 for AOBP</description>

&#xD;
          -  diagnosis of essential hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (i) severe hypertension as defined by clinical systolic BP ≥180 mmHg and/or diastolic&#xD;
             BP ≥110 mmHg (because they may need emergency treatment and it is unethical to delay&#xD;
             such treatment due to the proposed project), (ii) inability to provide consent, (iii)&#xD;
             pregnancy, (iv) night-time occupations (we need to compare AOBP and clinic BP readings&#xD;
             to daytime ABPM average when the patient should be awake), (v) are occupational&#xD;
             drivers (because potential dangers in driving could occur when patients are asked to&#xD;
             remain still), (vi) receiving anti-coagulants (to prevent bruises when using ABPM),&#xD;
             (vii) with known atrial fibrillation (as ABPMs and AOBP use have not been validated in&#xD;
             this group)&#xD;
