      This study is a phase I, open-label, non-randomized study to evaluate safety of BC2059&#xD;
      administered intravenously to subjects with proven primary or recurrent desmoid tumor that is&#xD;
      unresectable and symptomatic or progressive. This study will utilize single patient cohorts&#xD;
      for the first two dose levels in order to minimize sub-optimal drug exposures, followed by a&#xD;
      conventional 3+3 dose escalation phase to achieve MTD or RP2D determined by pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      or biologically relevant activity. Once MTD or RP2D is determined, that dose level cohort&#xD;
      will expand to 14 patients enrolled to collect additional safety PK and PD data. If at least&#xD;
      1 patient has clinical benefit, the dose expansion phase will be expanded by a further 11&#xD;
      patients (25 total in at RP2D). The total duration of study for each subject will be&#xD;
      dependent upon the safety, tolerability and efficacy of BC2059&#xD;

          8. Age: 18 and over (no pre-pubertal patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. ECOG Performance status: 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men who are sexually active with WOCBP&#xD;
             must agree to use one highly effective method of contraception, including hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives (e.g. combined oral contraceptives, patch, vaginal ring, injectables,&#xD;
             and implants); intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); vasectomy or&#xD;
             tubal ligation; and one effective method of contraception, including male condom,&#xD;
             female condom, cervical cap, diaphragm or contraceptive sponge or abstain from sex for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation and for 4 months following completion of BC2059&#xD;
             administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or&#xD;
             her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately. See section 8.7.3 for more information.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Contraception includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before&#xD;
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on&#xD;
                  the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                  patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral (estrogen and progesterone), injected or implanted combined hormonal&#xD;
                  methods of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or&#xD;
                  intrauterine system (IUS) or other forms of hormonal contraception that have&#xD;
                  comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or&#xD;
                  transdermal hormone contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and&#xD;
                  for 4 months after stopping study treatment and should not father a child in this&#xD;
                  period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to&#xD;
                  prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
             In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill&#xD;
             for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks ago. In&#xD;
             the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child&#xD;
             bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Hematopoietic:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute granulocyte count ≥ 1,500/mm3&#xD;

               -  Hemoglobin at least 10.0 g/dL (transfusion allowed, subjects that require&#xD;
                  transfusion or growth factor need to demonstrate stable hemoglobin for at least 7&#xD;
                  consecutive days of hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Hepatic:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times institutional upper limit of normal, in the&#xD;
                  absence of documented Gilbert's syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Renal: Creatinine clearance ≥75 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Pulmonary:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) greater than 75%&#xD;
                  predicted by single breath test&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Capillary oxygen saturation (O2 sat) &gt; 95% by pulse oximetry&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have not recovered to grade 1 from adverse events related to prior&#xD;
             therapy excluding those considered not clinically significant (ex. Lymphopenia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to BC2059 or other agents used in study&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with metabolic bone disease (ex. Hyperparathyroidism, Paget's disease, or&#xD;
             osteomalacia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or cardiac repolarization&#xD;
             abnormality or QTc &gt; 480 msec&#xD;

             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study. The effects of BC2059&#xD;
             on the developing human fetus have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects. There is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with BC2059.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with BC2059&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with abnormal serum chemistry values other than the specific limits detailed&#xD;
             above, that in the opinion of the Investigator is considered to be clinically&#xD;
             significant, should be discussed with the Medical Monitor before being enrolled in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Lack of peripheral venous or central venous access or any condition that would&#xD;
             interfere with drug administration or collection of study samples&#xD;
