  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, open-label study to assess the efficacy and safety of AVR-RD-01 in&#xD;
      approximately 8 to 12 male subjects 16 years of age or older (18 years of age or older in the&#xD;
      US) and postpubertal with a confirmed diagnosis of classic Fabry disease based on deficient&#xD;
      AGA enzyme activity who have not previously received treatment with enzyme replacement&#xD;
      therapy (ERT) and/or chaperone therapy within 3 years of the time of Screening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The duration of each subject's participation in this study will be approximately 64 weeks (or&#xD;
      1 year, 12 weeks), comprised of a five study periods (Screening, Baseline, Pre-transplant,&#xD;
      Transplant, and Post-transplant Follow-up). During the Screening Period (approximately 8&#xD;
      weeks), written informed consent (and assent, if applicable) will be obtained and the subject&#xD;
      will complete other Screening procedures to confirm study eligibility. Once study eligibility&#xD;
      is confirmed, subjects will enter the Baseline Period (up to 3 days) during which time&#xD;
      assessments will be performed to establish a pre-transplant baseline. Once baseline&#xD;
      assessments are complete, the subject will enter the Pre-transplant Period (approximately 6&#xD;
      weeks) during which time mobilization, apheresis, AVR-RD-01 drug product preparation and&#xD;
      testing for release, and conditioning regimen administration to achieve myeloablation will&#xD;
      take place. Following completion of the Pre-transplant Period, the subject will enter the&#xD;
      Transplant Period (1 day) during which time AVR-RD-01 infusion will take place. After&#xD;
      AVR-RD-01 infusion, the subject will enter the Post-transplant Follow-up Period&#xD;
      (approximately 48 weeks), during which time periodic safety and efficacy assessments will be&#xD;
      performed to assess measures of engraftment, clinical response, and safety post-transplant.&#xD;
      Post-transplant follow-up will occur at the following time points: Week 1 (Days 1 through 7),&#xD;
      Week 2 (Days 10 and 14), Week 4 (Day 28), Week 8 (Day 56), Week 12 (Day 84), Week 24 (Day&#xD;
      168), Week 36 (Day 216), and Week 48 (Day 336).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study completion, consenting subjects will continue periodic safety and efficacy&#xD;
      assessments for approximately 14 years (for a total of 15 years post-transplant follow-up) in&#xD;
      a long-term follow-up study to AVRO-RD-01-201.&#xD;
