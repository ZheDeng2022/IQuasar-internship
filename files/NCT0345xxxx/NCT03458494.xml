  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutrients and chemicals in food are able to regulate expression of genetic elements.&#xD;
      Gene-nutrient interaction in response specific diets can increase an individual's risk,&#xD;
      shifting the individual from health toward the development of chronic disease. The&#xD;
      Transcription Factor 7 Like 2 (TCF7L2) gene may either put individuals at risk for or protect&#xD;
      from Type 2 diabetes mellitus in the presence of certain foods. The main purpose of this&#xD;
      four-week study is to examine diet-induced gene-nutrient interaction, with a focus on&#xD;
      glucose, insulin, inflammation (CRP) and the plasma metabolome in individuals who have either&#xD;
      the CC or the TT form of the rs7903146 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (C/T) within the&#xD;
      TCF7L2 gene. The (2) one-week study diets, one Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) based and the&#xD;
      other low-fat based will be separated by a (1) week return to a regular habitual diet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and its growing&#xD;
      prevalence represents a major public health concern. T2D results from a combination of&#xD;
      genetics and the exposure to external factors (i.e., diet, exercise, and stress). Multiple&#xD;
      T2D-related genes have been identified, but they explain only ~10% of the estimated T2D&#xD;
      heritability. Therefore, it has been proposed that interactions between genetic and&#xD;
      environmental factors contribute to the missing heritability. The identification of these&#xD;
      gene-environment interactions could provide a breakthrough in the prevention of T2D and its&#xD;
      complications through the implementation of novel nutrigenomics approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rs7903146 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (C/T) within the TCF7L2 gene is the most&#xD;
      replicated T2D-associated SNP. However, the mechanism associating TCF7L2 with T2D remains&#xD;
      unknown. Moreover, there is little knowledge of how diet modulates this association. A better&#xD;
      understanding is crucial for improving existing, or designing new interventions for T2D&#xD;
      prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current knowledge supports the notion that subjects homozygous for the deleterious allele&#xD;
      (TT) have a higher risk of T2D than subjects homozygous for the common allele (CC).&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is a gene-diet interaction between this SNP and Mediterranean diet&#xD;
      (MedDiet) on fasting glucose and lipids. Thus, a higher MedDiet adherence neutralizes the&#xD;
      effects of the deleterious TT genotype. Moreover, after ~5 years, TT subjects consuming a&#xD;
      low-fat diet have higher incidence of stroke than CC subjects, whereas this association is&#xD;
      annulled in TT subjects consuming a MedDiet. the objective of this study is to validate these&#xD;
      findings under practical conditions similar to those encountered in clinical practice and to&#xD;
      identify biological mechanisms involved in such interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, a four-week study will be conducted to examine diet-induced gene-nutrient&#xD;
      interaction, with a focus on glucose, insulin, and inflammation (CRP) in individuals who have&#xD;
      either the CC or the TT form of the rs7903146 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (C/T)&#xD;
      within the TCF7L2 gene. The (2) one-week study diets, one Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) based&#xD;
      and the other low-fat based will be separated by a (1) week return to a regular habitual&#xD;
      diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate whether the TCF7L2-by-diet interaction in relation to T2D and&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors can be validated in the context of a more&#xD;
           realistic scenario of personalized dietary advice based on genetic information&#xD;
           (nutrigenomics).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for these gene-by-diet interactions&#xD;
           using deep phenotyping (i.e., metabolomics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that genetics can offer precise information about which healthy diet&#xD;
      (low-fat or Mediterranean) can deliver real benefits on an individual basis.&#xD;
