    <textblock>
      Objectives The primary objective is to demonstrate that in patients undergoing major urologic&#xD;
      surgery, Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) opioid consumption in the first 24 hours after&#xD;
      surgery will be significantly less in patients who have had a single shot rectus sheath block&#xD;
      pre-operatively in addition to a post-operative rectus sheath continuous block via surgically&#xD;
      placed catheter versus those who only have post-operative rectus sheath continuous block.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be opioid requirement intra-operatively, Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)&#xD;
      pain scores including maximum pain score in Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) and score at 24&#xD;
      and 48 hours, incidence and severity of nausea, number of vomiting episodes, sedation score,&#xD;
      time to first bowel movement, time to first mobilization and duration of hospital stay.&#xD;

      Purpose: To improve analgesia and reduce opioid consumption in patients undergoing major&#xD;
      urologic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients receiving pre-operative single shot rectus sheath blockade in addition&#xD;
      to continuous rectus sheath catheters will use less PCA opioid in the first 24 hours&#xD;
      post-operatively compared to patients receiving continuous rectus sheath blockade for major&#xD;
      urologic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensorimotor innervation of the anterior abdominal wall is supplied by the ventral rami&#xD;
      of the thoracolumbar spinal (T7-L1) segmental nerves. The thoracolumbar nerves course along&#xD;
      the anterolateral wall within the transversus abdominis plane (TAP), and continue&#xD;
      anteromedially, before entering the lateral aspect of the posterior rectus sheath. The nerves&#xD;
      provide both muscular and cutaneous branches to innervate the muscle fibers and overlying&#xD;
      skin with innervation from both left and right nerves supplying the midline. Regional&#xD;
      anesthesia techniques for the anterior abdominal wall include both TAP and rectus sheath&#xD;
      blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TAP block has been investigated extensively and shown to reduce opioid analgesia&#xD;
      requirements post-operatively. The main difference between TAP block and rectus sheath block&#xD;
      is that the rectus sheath block targets the nerves at a more anterior location. Bilateral&#xD;
      rectus sheath nerve blocks are required to provide cover for midline incision and the&#xD;
      investigators have previously described rectus sheath block with nerve catheter insertion&#xD;
      under ultrasound guidance for midline laparotomy. A recent retrospective review from Dutton&#xD;
      et al on the use of rectus sheath catheters for major urologic surgery reported that they&#xD;
      offer an effective and safe method of peri-operative analgesia in patients undergoing major&#xD;
      open urological pelvic surgery. Tudor et al demonstrated that rectus sheath catheters provide&#xD;
      analgesia equivalent to that provided by epidurals following laparotomy for colorectal&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the University of Alberta Hospital, patients having major urologic surgery e.g. cystectomy&#xD;
      have surgically placed rectus sheath catheters sited at the end of the procedure as a&#xD;
      standard of analgesia care. This is combined with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) opioid&#xD;
      as part of a multimodal approach to post-operative pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One disadvantage of surgically placed TAP and rectus sheath catheters is that they are&#xD;
      inserted at the end of surgery. Therefore, the patient does not benefit from them&#xD;
      intra-operatively and other methods of analgesia including opiates are required to reduce the&#xD;
      sympathetic response to surgical stimulation and to prevent excessive immediate and early&#xD;
      post-operative pain. The surgically placed rectus sheath catheters are sited during wound&#xD;
      closure and then bolused with local anesthetic just prior to emergence so often the block is&#xD;
      not fully established in the early post-operative period resulting in further opiate&#xD;
      analgesia requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate that in patients undergoing major urologic surgery&#xD;
      PCA opioid consumption in the first 24 hours after surgery will be significantly less in&#xD;
      patients who have had an ultrasound-guided single shot rectus sheath block pre-operatively in&#xD;
      addition to a post-operative rectus sheath continuous block via surgically placed catheter&#xD;
      versus those who only have post-operative rectus sheath continuous block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be opiate requirement intra-operatively, Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)&#xD;
      pain scores including pain score in PACU and score at 24 and 48 hours, incidence and severity&#xD;
      of nausea, number of vomiting episodes, sedation scores, time to first bowel movement, time&#xD;
      to first mobilization and duration of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods: A randomized, double-blinded controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be invited to participate in the study by the&#xD;
      clinical care team or research assistant in the Preadmission Clinic. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained by the research assistant. Next, all eligible participants will be randomized to the&#xD;
      treatment group i.e. pre-operative single shot bilateral rectus sheath blocks +&#xD;
      post-operative catheters or the control group i.e. post-operative catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be conducted through stratified-blocked randomization with varying blocks&#xD;
      of 4 to 6 according to a schedule not known to the investigators using a computerized&#xD;
      algorithm. The patient, intra-operative anesthetist, the surgeon and the assessor will be&#xD;
      blinded to the randomization assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment group will have pre-operative single shot bilateral rectus blocks with 20 ml of&#xD;
      a ropivacaine / bupivacaine mixture per side. The control group will have a pre-operative&#xD;
      sham subcutaneous injection of 1ml saline per side. Both groups will have bilateral rectus&#xD;
      sheath catheters placed surgically at the end of the procedure. Under direct visualization,&#xD;
      the surgeon will insert a standard nerve block catheter between the rectus abdominis muscle&#xD;
      and the posterior rectus sheath lateral to the incision on both sides. The catheter will be&#xD;
      fixed to skin via a specialized taping system. An infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine will be&#xD;
      administered through the rectus sheath catheter (1ml / hour continuous infusion with 15 ml&#xD;
      /hour bolus every 4 hours). All patients will receive an IV morphine or dilaudid PCA and&#xD;
      adjunctive post-operative medication. Intra-operative morphine / dilaudid administered&#xD;
      intra-operatively will be recorded as well as total morphine / dilaudid used in the first 24&#xD;
      hours. Anesthesia technique will be standardized for short-acting opioid use i.e. fentanyl.&#xD;
      Peri-operative multimodal analgesia adjuncts will include ketamine 0.2mg/kg and dexamethasone&#xD;
      6mg. All patients will be pre-medicated with acetaminophen 1g and gabapentin 300mg&#xD;
      pre-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcomes will be collected by the study team from the patient chart and&#xD;
      accompanying records and through patient interview. Continuous variables will be analyzed&#xD;
      using t-tests and categorical variables will be analyzed using chi-squared test.&#xD;
