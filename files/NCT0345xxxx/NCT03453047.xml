    <textblock>
      Several neurological problems which include both central nervous system and peripheral&#xD;
      nervous system can occur as a result of acute liver failure or severe chronic liver failure.&#xD;
      The main reason of cerebral damage in liver failure is cellular metabolic changes, long term&#xD;
      neuro-inflammation status, activation of brain microglia, accumulation of manganese and&#xD;
      ammonia besides acute and severe hyperammoniemia that triggers systemic inflammation.&#xD;
      Examples of neurological complications of serious hepatocellular failure are hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy, diffuse brain edema, Wilson disease, hepatic myelopathy, acquired&#xD;
      hepatocerebral degeneration; Parkinsonism induced cirrhosis and osmatic demyelinization.&#xD;
      Attentive neurological evaluation is of high importance in order to define seriousness level&#xD;
      and distribution of neurologic disorders besides current treatable anomalies and potentially&#xD;
      prescribe postoperative prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S100β is released by astrocytes in brain damage. S100β increases in the beginning of brain&#xD;
      damage so it can be used to diagnose early stage brain damage. Neuron specific enolase (NSE)&#xD;
      acts as intracytoplasmic enzyme and increases serum levels in neuron damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate neurological damage and analyze its effect on prognosis&#xD;
      by considering S100β and NSE levels in liver transplantation.&#xD;

      Neurologic disorders that affect the liver transplantation candidates when they are on the&#xD;
      waitlist not only significantly affect preoperative morbidity and even mortality but also&#xD;
      present important predictive factors for post-op neurologic manifestations. Attentive&#xD;
      neurological evaluation before transplantation plays a significant role in defining&#xD;
      seriousness level and distribution of neurologic disorders besides current treatable&#xD;
      anomalies and potentially prescribe postoperative prognosis. Preferred specific indexes of&#xD;
      neurological evaluation before transplantation can vary according to centers but correct&#xD;
      diagnosis and definitive diagnosis of some syndromes can be difficult despite using current&#xD;
      biochemical, neurophysiologic, neuropsychological and neuroimaging diagnosis tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver transplant receivers constitute the group with the most frequent central nervous system&#xD;
      complication (incidence: 10%-85%) amongst the organ transplantation patients. They are focal&#xD;
      or diffuse neurologic deficits creating a significant obstacle for short and long term&#xD;
      recovery. Neurologic deficits which can develop are cerebral edema, increase of intracranial&#xD;
      pressure, metabolic encephalopathy, cerebrovascular complications, osmotic demyelination&#xD;
      syndrome and opportunistic infections. Moreover, several preoperative neurologic disorders&#xD;
      (such as dysarthria akinetic mutism, confusion and seizures) can get worse due to neurotoxic&#xD;
      side effect of the medicines which are used for preventing graft rejection (calcineurin&#xD;
      inhibitors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurologic findings and pathophysiology of end stage liver failure cannot be understood&#xD;
      completely. Multiple factors such as long term brain &quot;neuroinflammation&quot;, brain microglia,&#xD;
      activation of inflammatory cells, accumulation of manganese and ammonia, changing blood-brain&#xD;
      barrier permeability, changed nerve conduction and inflammation of peripheric nerve system&#xD;
      inflammation are held responsible from brain damage. Other negative direct or indirect&#xD;
      neurologic effects are chronical malnutrition, gastrointestinal bleeding, cerebral&#xD;
      hypoperfusion and renal dysfunction. The most commonly accepted neurological complications of&#xD;
      serious hepatocellular insufficiency are complex syndromes of hepatic encephalopathy (HE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      S100β is 10.4 kDa (kilodalton) protein. Synthesized with end feet processes of astrocytes in&#xD;
      the brain S100β belongs to low molecular weight EF-hand type acidic calcium binding protein&#xD;
      superfamily. This protein is metabolized in the kidneys and removed with urine. It is shown&#xD;
      that S100β does not show differences due to ethnical groups or genders and is not affected by&#xD;
      circadian rhythm. Although S100β is also found in other tissues, it is in higher&#xD;
      concentrations in the brain so it can be used as an early indicator for brain damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Astrocytes are the keys to homeostasis regulation in central nervous system (CNS) and release&#xD;
      S100β after brain damage. Some studies conducted that, increased S100β levels as an early&#xD;
      indicator for intracerebral changes within patients with acute or chronical liver failure and&#xD;
      before cerebral edema is developed in HE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, it is also asserted that S100β increase in serum concentration can foresee HE.&#xD;
      Additionally, there are limited evidences to prove S100β levels and existence of HE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NSE is an CNS protein which exists in neurons and neuroendocrine tissues. NSE plays a role in&#xD;
      glycolytic route in neurons as intracytoplasmic enzyme increasing serum level in case of&#xD;
      neuron damage. Whilst S100β is the marker of astroglia dysfunction, NSE is the marker of&#xD;
      neuronal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is analyzing S100β serum concentrations and correlate neurologic damage&#xD;
      of liver transplantation patients besides evaluating its effect on prognosis.&#xD;
