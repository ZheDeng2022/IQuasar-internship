      Prospective cross-sectional study at the outpatient clinic (OPC) of the Bagamoyo District&#xD;
      Hospital (BDH) in Tanzania. Assessment of basic epidemiological data (Point prevalence and&#xD;
      risk factors) on CKD with simple clinical, laboratory tests and the patients history. After&#xD;
      informed consent blood samples are taken for complete blood count, serum creatinine, HbA1c,&#xD;
      HIV-Screening, and urine samples for dipstick, urine sediment, and albumin-creatinine ratio.&#xD;
      Further, office blood pressure, weight and height are taken. Further, patients history are&#xD;
      asked by a questionnaire (i.e.history of infectious and cardiovascular diseases and basic&#xD;
      demographic data: i.e. sex, age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CKD is defined as the presence of either impaired kidney function and/or albuminuria based on&#xD;
      a one-time measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome of the study are prevalence rates of CKD and the impact of non-communicable&#xD;
      and communicable disorders on CKD.&#xD;

      Study population and Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single centre cross-sectional study at the outpatient clinic (OPC) of the Bagamoyo District&#xD;
      Hospital (BDH) in Tanzania. The BDH is located in Bagamoyo township on the coast of the&#xD;
      Indian Ocean and provides care for a semi-rural population. After informed consent, all&#xD;
      patients ≥ 18 years, irrespective of the reason of consultation, are included. Pregnant women&#xD;
      and patients who are not able or willing to provide an informed signed consent are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data are collected in a case report form, translated from English to Swahili. In all&#xD;
      participants body weight and height, blood pressure, heart rate and temperature are recorded.&#xD;
      After informed consent, a blood sample is taken for complete blood count and serum&#xD;
      creatinine. Complete blood count is performed by a Sysmex Xs 800i analyser. Serum creatinine&#xD;
      is measured using Creatinine Jaffe Gen2 reagent on a Cobas Integra 400 plus analyser. HbA1c&#xD;
      is measured from capillary blood by using a bed-side DCA 2000+ Analyzer (Siemens Healthcare&#xD;
      Diagnostics). After informed consent, HIV-screening is done with an immunochromatographic&#xD;
      test for antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2 (test kits: Uni-Gold TM HIV, Trinity Biotech, Ireland;&#xD;
      Determine® HIV-1/2, Inverness Medical Japan, Japan; SD BIOLINE HIV-1/2 3.0, SD Standard&#xD;
      Diagnostics, Korea).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants are instructed to void a clean-urine specimen. Urine samples are prepared&#xD;
      for microscopic analysis. Albumin-to- creatinine ratio (ACR) is measured using a DCA 2000+&#xD;
      analyser (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). CKD is defined as the presence of either impaired&#xD;
      kidney function and/or albuminuria based on a one-time measurement. When one-time&#xD;
      measurements are used, prevalence of reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria&#xD;
      might be overestimated due to physiological variation and temporarily elevated values after&#xD;
      physical activity and during acute illness or dehydration. Nevertheless, one-time&#xD;
      measurements have been used for screening and epidemiologic purposes, as longitudinal&#xD;
      documentation is not usually available in epidemiological studies. Kidney function is&#xD;
      assessed by eGFR using the CKD-EPI formula. CKD is defined as an eGFR of &lt;60 ml/min/1.73m2&#xD;
      and/or an ACR of ≥30mg/g (≥3 mg/mmol) and categorized according to Kidney Disease: Improving&#xD;
      Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stages. Office BP is assessed by a single measurement using a manual&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer in a sitting position after 5 minutes at rest. Systolic and diastolic BP is&#xD;
      classified as normal (&lt;120/&lt;80 mmHg), pre-hypertensive (120-139/80-89 mmHg), hypertensive&#xD;
      stage 1 (140-159/90-99 mmHg) or hypertensive stage 2 (≥160/≥100 mmHg) in analogy to the&#xD;
      cut-off values of the JNC 7 report. Anaemia is defined as Hb &lt;13.0 g/dl in male and &lt;12.0&#xD;
      g/dl in female patients. Diabetes mellitus is defined as a history of diabetes, the use of&#xD;
      antidiabetic medication or a HbA1c of ≥ 6.5%.&#xD;
