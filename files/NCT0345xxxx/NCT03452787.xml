  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is driven by genetic and environmental factors. Among the latter, diet is a most&#xD;
      important one. The investigators refer to these combinations of genetic and dietary factors&#xD;
      as 'gene-diet interactions.' Higher consumption of saturated fats (found mostly in foods of&#xD;
      animal origin) has been associated with higher weight in people who were homozygotes for the&#xD;
      minor allele at a genetic variant known as APOA2 -265 T&gt;C (rs5082). In the current study, the&#xD;
      investigators will seek to gain an understanding of the biological mechanisms driving this&#xD;
      interaction. The investigators will select participants in three cohorts according to this&#xD;
      genetic factor and conduct a series of molecular analyses (epigenetics, transcriptomics, and&#xD;
      metabolomics). The analyses will identify epigenetic marks that are associated with saturated&#xD;
      fat intake exclusively in subjects who carry this genetic factor. Moreover, the investigators&#xD;
      will examine the association between epigenetic status and genotype at APOA2 and mRNA&#xD;
      expression of the gene, and concentrations of metabolites in the blood. This study will&#xD;
      increase the understanding of how genetics and diet act together to promote weight gain, and&#xD;
      may eventually have implications for dietary recommendations that make use of genetic&#xD;
      information.&#xD;

      Background: Apolipoprotein A-II (APOA2) is a significant constituent of high-density&#xD;
      lipoproteins (HDL) with an undefined biological role. A putative functional variant, -265 T&gt;C&#xD;
      (rs5082) within the APOA2 promoter, has been shown consistently to interact with saturated&#xD;
      fat (SFA) intake to influence the risk of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This study will implement an integrative approach to characterize the molecular&#xD;
      basis of this interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The investigators will conduct an epigenome-wide scan on 80 participants carrying&#xD;
      either the rs5082 less common genotype (CC) or the most common genotype (TT) and consuming&#xD;
      either a low (&lt;22 g/d) or high (≥22 g/d) SFA diet, matched for age, sex, BMI, and diabetes&#xD;
      status in the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study (BPRHS). The investigators then will validate&#xD;
      the findings in selected participants in the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet&#xD;
      Network (GOLDN) (n=379) and the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) (n=243). Transcription and&#xD;
      metabolomics analyses will be conducted to determine the relationship between epigenetic&#xD;
      status, APOA2 mRNA expression, and blood metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources. The Boston Puerto Rican Health Study (BPRHS), the Genetics of Lipid Lowering&#xD;
      Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN), and the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Study selection: In&#xD;
      BPRHS, 40 participants with CC genotype at APOA2 -265T&gt;C (rs5082) will be selected, with 20&#xD;
      reporting a low SFA intake (&lt;22 g/d) and 20 indicating a high SFA intake (≥22 g/d). By&#xD;
      matching age, sex, SFA intake, type 2 diabetes status, and BMI for the 40 participants with&#xD;
      CC genotype, the second set of 40 participants with TT genotype of APOA2 -265T&gt;C will be&#xD;
      selected from the same population. In GOLDN, 107 participants with CC genotype and 272 with&#xD;
      TT genotype for APOA2 -265T&gt;C, who were not taking medication for hypertension, dyslipidemia,&#xD;
      or diabetes, will be selected to validate the findings from BPRHS. In FHS, the investigators&#xD;
      will include 73 unrelated participants with CC genotype and 170 with TT genotype at APOA2&#xD;
      -265T&gt;C, who did not take medication for hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes.&#xD;
      Participants of each genotype will be further divided into two subgroups based on SFA intake:&#xD;
      low, &lt;22 grams/day, high, ≥22 grams/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Extraction. Genome-wide DNA methylation of isolated DNA samples in BPRHS and GOLDN was&#xD;
      quantified using Illumina Infinium® human methylation 450K arrays (Illumina, San Diego, CA,&#xD;
      USA). The methylation signal at each methylation site will be estimated as a β score, the&#xD;
      proportion of total methylation-specific signal, and the detection P-value as the probability&#xD;
      that total intensity for a given probe falls within the background signal intensity after&#xD;
      normalization and quantity control check. FHS methylome data from dbGaP,&#xD;
      accession#:phg000492.v2, where methylation statuses of 2,741 participants were measured in&#xD;
      samples taken from participants attending their exam 8 visit between 2005 and 2008, using&#xD;
      Illumina Infinium® human methylation 450K array. Methylation signals will be processed and&#xD;
      normalized as for BPRHS and GOLDN. The investigators will obtain FHS transcriptome data from&#xD;
      dbGaP under accession phe00002.v6. Metabolic profiling of plasma samples from those 80&#xD;
      participants of BPRHS for whom the methylome analysis will be performed by Metabolon, Inc.&#xD;
      (Durham, NC, USA) Outcomes: Body mass index will be the only outcome. Data Synthesis. (1)&#xD;
      Epigenome-wide analysis of APOA2 genotype, by high and low SFA intake, will be conducted in&#xD;
      80 matched case/control participants of BPRHS, replicated in selected participants of GOLDN,&#xD;
      and FHS using linear mixed models. (2) A meta-analysis of the results from the three&#xD;
      populations will be conducted using the meta R package.The comparison of allelic effect&#xD;
      (beta) of APOA2 -265T&gt;C from the meta-analysis between low and high SFA intake will be&#xD;
      conducted with SAS 9.4 using a t-test. (3) Associations between epigenetic variants and APOA2&#xD;
      genotypes with APOA2 mRNA expression will be tested in FHS. (4) Metabolome analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted in the same 80 matched case/control participants of BPRHS, and metabolites will be&#xD;
      correlated with epigenetic variants at APOA2 locus. (5) Enriched metabolic pathways will be&#xD;
      examined in relation to identified epigenetic variants at APOA2 region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: The results will be disseminated through interactive&#xD;
      presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in&#xD;
      high impact factor journals. Target audiences will include the public health and scientific&#xD;
      communities with interest in nutrition, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Feedback will be incorporated and used to improve the public health message and key areas for&#xD;
      future research will be defined. Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers will network among&#xD;
      opinion leaders to increase awareness and participate directly as committee members in the&#xD;
      development of future guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary findings: In BPRHS, the investigators identified methylation site cg04436964 as&#xD;
      exhibiting significant differences between CC and TT participants consuming a high SFA diet,&#xD;
      but not among those consuming low SFA. Similar results were observed in GOLDN and FHS.&#xD;
      Additionally, in FHS, cg04436964 methylation was negatively correlated with APOA2 expression&#xD;
      in participants consuming a high SFA diet. Furthermore, when consuming a high SFA diet, CC&#xD;
      carriers had lower APOA2 expression compared to those with the TT genotype, but expression&#xD;
      levels were similar when consuming a low SFA diet. Lastly, the metabolomic analysis&#xD;
      identified four pathways as overrepresented by metabolite differences between CC and TT&#xD;
      genotypes with high SFA intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The investigators will apply multi-omics approaches to investigate the&#xD;
      mechanistic foundations of the APOA2 -265T&gt;C genotype by SFA interaction linked to the&#xD;
      disruptive condition of obesity. the investigators may uncover plausible dysregulation of&#xD;
      several metabolic pathways. This study will illustrate the effectiveness of multiple omics&#xD;
      approaches to well-established gene-diet interactions, and contribute new evidence to ongoing&#xD;
      explorations of the impact of saturated fat on human health.&#xD;
