  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AZD9291 Early Access Program (EAP) was available in Taiwan during October 2015 to September&#xD;
      2016, a time period before the approval of AZD9291, to supply the unlicensed AZD9291 for the&#xD;
      NSCLC patients who received at least one prior EGFR TKI therapy. At the end of September&#xD;
      2016, more than 450 patients have been under AZD9291 treatment through the EAP. This&#xD;
      observational study aims to evaluate the clinical benefit of AZD9291 treatment for these&#xD;
      patients who were in the EAP&#xD;
