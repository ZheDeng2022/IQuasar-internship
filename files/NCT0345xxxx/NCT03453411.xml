      The main objective of this project is to evaluate the effects sought and the effects felt by&#xD;
      children when EMONO is used in pediatric dental care. The Investigators will try to&#xD;
      characterize the children who have submitted a request to extend contact with EMONO. The&#xD;
      maintenance of a framework for the safe use of this drug whose place in dental care is&#xD;
      fundamental and the benefit ratio is very favorable is essential.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some narcotic drugs and psychotropic drugs associated with a risk of misuse or identified&#xD;
      dependence and are, moreover, the object of a reinforced surveillance. This is the case of&#xD;
      EMONO (Equimolar Oxygen and Nitrogen Protoxide Mix), which is part of the ANSM (French&#xD;
      National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety) list of drugs with enhanced&#xD;
      surveillance. EMONO is a gas composed equally of oxygen and nitrous oxide (also called&#xD;
      laughing gas). He has had a marketing authorization in France since 2001. Until 2009, it was&#xD;
      reserved for hospital use. Since 2009, a modification of its MA has enabled the release of&#xD;
      the hospital reserve, EMONO can now be used in city medicine and dental surgery. The ANSM has&#xD;
      made its provision outside health facilities conditional on the implementation of a common&#xD;
      national RMP, accompanied by a national monitoring of pharmacovigilance and addictovigilance.&#xD;
      The latter is under the responsibility of CEIP-A of Nantes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of EMONO in pediatric dental care is a particular mode of use in a pediatric&#xD;
      population in which the administration of EMONO is often the first administration of a&#xD;
      psychoactive substance known for its positive effects (euphoria). Health professionals daily&#xD;
      observe children, who after care under EMONO, have a strong appetite for EMONO and claim for&#xD;
      any intervention. It would be necessary to understand why, and to estimate the number of&#xD;
      children involved. Do children feel positive effects during these actions, which could lead&#xD;
      to a wish to prolong the contact with the gas, in search of an effect other than therapeutic?&#xD;
      The main objective of this project is to evaluate the effects sought and the effects felt by&#xD;
      children when EMONO is used in pediatric dental care. The investigators will try to&#xD;
      characterize the children who have submitted a request to extend contact with EMONO. The&#xD;
      maintenance of a framework for the safe use of this drug whose place in dental care is&#xD;
      fundamental and the benefit ratio is very favorable is essential.&#xD;

        For this study we have therefore chosen to include all patients under 15 years of age seen&#xD;
        for care under EMONO in the different participating DSCs. The use of EMONO in dental care&#xD;
        is indicated for minor patients who are not cooperating in the dental care (doing not allow&#xD;
        the realisation in the chair of care according to the acquired data of science) or who have&#xD;
        a handicap limiting their cooperation. It applies during diagnostic or therapeutic&#xD;
        consultations. The investigators will not include patients under 3 years of age as EMONO is&#xD;
        much less effective below this age. All dental surgeons of the participating DSCs will be&#xD;
        responsible for selecting patients who meet the inclusion criteria, offering selected&#xD;
        patients and their parents to participate and include them in the study.&#xD;
