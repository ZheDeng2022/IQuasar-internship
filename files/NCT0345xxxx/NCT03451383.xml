      The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of systemic therapy on cognition in older&#xD;
      breast cancer patients, explore which domains are most affected, measure associations between&#xD;
      cognitive decline and QOL, and describe how APOE and COMT polymorphisms, inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers and physical activity moderate cognitive outcomes. This study is being done&#xD;
      nationally, with recruiting sites at Georgetown University, Montgomery General Hospital,&#xD;
      Virginia Cancer Specialists, Washington Hospital Center, Reston Breast Care Specialists,&#xD;
      Memorial Sloan-Kettering, Moffitt Cancer Center, City of Hope National Medical Center,&#xD;
      Hackensack University Medical Center, Indiana University and University of California, Los&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is the leading cause of death in the US and breast cancer is the second most common&#xD;
      cancer among women in our country. Older women (women 60 and older) presently account for&#xD;
      nearly half of all new cases of breast cancer. With the &quot;graying of America&quot; and advances in&#xD;
      treatment for breast cancer, the absolute number of older women undergoing breast cancer&#xD;
      treatment and surviving their disease will almost double by the year 2030. Systemic hormonal&#xD;
      and non-hormonal chemotherapy is credited with improvements in survival, and rates of use of&#xD;
      these modalities have increased substantially over the past two decades. Preliminary work has&#xD;
      found that older women are interested in chemotherapy even for small returns in survival&#xD;
      extension. However, cognitive impairment has been demonstrated in most studies of breast&#xD;
      cancer systemic treatments, but virtually all of this research has been conducted in younger&#xD;
      populations. Since aging itself is associated with cognitive declines, it seems very likely&#xD;
      that older women are particularly vulnerable to the adverse cognitive effects of systemic&#xD;
      therapy; our preliminary work strongly suggests that this is the case, but this has never&#xD;
      been empirically tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first large-scale, prospective, controlled investigation to evaluate&#xD;
      cognitive changes in older cancer patients and it will provide the basis for the next&#xD;
      generation of mechanistic, treatment and intervention studies. These will be important since&#xD;
      data from younger patients cannot be directly translated into the older population.&#xD;
      Investigators will use the vulnerability model of cancer survivorship to prospectively&#xD;
      describe the magnitude of systemic therapy effects on cognition in older (age &gt;60 years)&#xD;
      breast cancer patients over a 60 month period, test associations between cognition and&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL) and evaluate whether APOE and COMT polymorphisms, inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers and physical activity moderate cognitive outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve these objectives, investigators have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of&#xD;
      oncologists, geriatricians, neurologists, neuro- and cognitive psychologists, behavioral&#xD;
      scientists and consumers from Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC), Memorial&#xD;
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), Moffitt Cancer Center, City of Hope National Medical&#xD;
      Center (COH), Hackensack University Medical Center (HUMC), Indiana University (IU), Boston&#xD;
      University (BU), University of California (UCLA), University of South Florida (USF) and their&#xD;
      satellites, will work together to prospectively enroll 425 newly diagnosed older breast&#xD;
      cancer cases from LCCC, MSKCC, Moffitt, COH, HUMC, IU and tertiary referral centers with high&#xD;
      volumes. An equal number of non-cancer friend controls will be recruited. Friend controls&#xD;
      were chosen since they will be similar to patients in most ways except for exposure to cancer&#xD;
      and its treatments and they should be motivated to participate. If friends are not available,&#xD;
      controls matched to cases on age, education, race, and area (DC/NY/FL/CA/NJ/IU) will be&#xD;
      recruited from the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will administer baseline neuropsychological testing prior to any systemic&#xD;
      treatment (or at enrollment for controls), survey women about subjective cognitive function,&#xD;
      psychosocial factors, QOL and activities of daily living (IADLS). Investigators will abstract&#xD;
      clinical data from medical records. Investigators will obtain blood or saliva to test for&#xD;
      APOE and COMT polymorphisms at enrollment; these results will not be provided to participants&#xD;
      since this is considered a research test). Subjects have the option to provide blood for&#xD;
      biomarker research and for biobanking. Subjects also have the option of participating in&#xD;
      physical activity monitoring for one week. Subjects will also have the option to participate&#xD;
      in neuroimaging. Investigators conduct follow-up interviews and repeat the neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing and optional neuroimaging 12 months after baseline assessment; this time point&#xD;
      corresponds to 3-6 months post-treatment among women who receive chemotherapy. Our primary&#xD;
      cognitive outcome will be change in summary score on tests in the Attention, Working Memory,&#xD;
      and Psychomotor Speed Domain. In secondary analyses, investigators examine changes in scores&#xD;
      on 4 additional domains to assess broader cognitive function and examine questions of&#xD;
      differential impact: Language; Executive Functioning; Learning and Memory; Visual-spatial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from this study will guide future interventions to better select older women for whom&#xD;
      the benefits of systemic therapy outweigh the harms and to develop approaches to mitigate&#xD;
      negative consequences of systemic treatment when it is indicated, improving the quality of&#xD;
      care for the growing population of older breast cancer patients.&#xD;
