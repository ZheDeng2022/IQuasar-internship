  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy and safety of cancer patients in patients with gastrointestinal cancer&#xD;
      (Palliative care) in patients with gastrointestinal tumor (chemotherapy) were prospectively,&#xD;
      randomized blind, multicenter clinical trials. They were randomly divided into 2 groups, test&#xD;
      group Shenqifuzheng injection of 500 ml, the control group 0.9% sodium chloride injection,&#xD;
      500 ml, intravenous drip, 1 times a day, 14 days post, rest is 7 days, 21 days each for a&#xD;
      period of treatment, observation of two procedures. At the same time, according to the NCCN&#xD;
      guide and the health ministry issued the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for cancer&#xD;
      treatment. The main curative effect of the clinic was to evaluate the pretreatment of cancer&#xD;
      due to the fatigue score of the patients before and after treatment -- the Piper fatigue&#xD;
      revision scale was used to evaluate the Chinese version. Assess effectiveness and safety&#xD;
      based on clinical assessment&#xD;

      Factors for the purpose of this study by observing theShenqifuzheng injection before and&#xD;
      after treatment in patients with carcinoma due to fatigue scale scores, the classification of&#xD;
      syndromes, the quality of life score changes and related laboratory index, evaluation factors&#xD;
      ginseng and astragalus injection on the digestive tract tumor (chemotherapy) in patients with&#xD;
      cancer-related fatigue and quality of life improved efficacy and safety. The experimental&#xD;
      group was randomly divided into 2 groups, experimental group Shenqifuzheng injection of 500&#xD;
      ml. The control group was 0.9% sodium chloride injection, 500ml, intravenous drip, 1 time&#xD;
      daily, 14 days for continuous use, 7 days of rest, and 1 treatment for each 21 days, and 2&#xD;
      courses were observed. At the same time, according to the NCCN guide and the health ministry&#xD;
      issued the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main efficacy evaluation indexes before and after treatment for cancer-related fatigue rating&#xD;
      - adopting the Piper fatigue scale revised Chinese version, compare the experimental group&#xD;
      and the control group before and after treatment cancer-related fatigue rating difference&#xD;
      have differences. Secondary efficacy evaluation index to compare the ECOG score difference&#xD;
      before and after the treatment, the quality of life score difference before and after the&#xD;
      treatment, TCM syndrome curative effect, single symptom curative effect of immune function,&#xD;
      tumors had curative effect (if any) and chemotherapy completion. Safety assessment includes&#xD;
      the observation of vital signs, blood routine, urinary routine, routine stool, liver&#xD;
      function, renal function, electrocardiogram examination, and adverse reactions during the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
