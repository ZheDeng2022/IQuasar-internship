      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of tinostamustine (EDO-S101) given&#xD;
      with or without radiation therapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed MGMT-unmethylated&#xD;
      glioblastoma. Tinostamustine may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth in patients with glioblastoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the safety profile and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      tinostamustine (EDO-S101) in the adjuvant phase of therapy for patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      MGMT-promoter unmethylated glioblastoma (GB) post chemoradiation with temozolomide. (Stage 1)&#xD;
      II. To characterize the safety profile and determine the MTD of EDO-S101 when given as a&#xD;
      single agent in the concomitant phase with radiation therapy (RT) in patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed GB who are O6-methylGuanine deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase&#xD;
      (MGMT)-promoter unmethylated. (Stage 2) III. To confirm the MTD of EDO-S101 in the&#xD;
      concomitant phase and adjuvant phase in an expanded population of newly diagnosed GB patients&#xD;
      who are MGMT-promoter un-methylated. (Dose Expansion Group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess anti-tumor activity for patients with newly diagnosed GB who are MGMT-promoter&#xD;
      unmethylated based on progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and overall&#xD;
      response rate (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Profiling tumor DNA, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), microRNA and epigenetic profiling&#xD;
      (DNA methylation) and evaluation of whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, microRNA&#xD;
      sequencing and cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and correlate with outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of tinostamustine. Patients who have completed&#xD;
      temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation therapy (RT) are assigned to Stage 1A or Stage 1B. Patients&#xD;
      who have received no treatment other than surgery are assigned to Stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 1A: Patients receive tinostamustine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 1B: Patients receive tinostamustine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 2: Patients undergo RT 5 days a week for up to 6 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive tinostamustine IV on day 1 or&#xD;
      days 1 and 15 (to be determined following stage 1). Treatment repeats every 21 days (day 1)&#xD;
      or 28 days (days 1 and 15) for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

             within 72 hours of starting first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth&#xD;
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the&#xD;
             duration of the study. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have completed standard radiation therapy with concurrent TMZ and must&#xD;
             not have evidence of progressive disease on post treatment imaging. Progression can&#xD;
             only be defined using diagnostic imaging if there is new enhancement outside of the&#xD;
             radiation field (beyond the high-dose region or 80% isodose line) or if there is&#xD;
             unequivocal evidence of viable tumor on histopathologic sampling (e.g., solid tumor&#xD;
             areas [i.e, &gt; 70% tumor cell nuclei in areas], high or progressive increase in MIB-1&#xD;
             proliferation index compared with prior biopsy, or evidence for histologic progression&#xD;
             or increased anaplasia in tumor). Note: Given the difficulty of differentiating true&#xD;
             progression from pseudoprogression, clinical decline alone, in the absence of&#xD;
             radiographic or histologic confirmation of progression, will not be sufficient for&#xD;
             definition of progressive disease in the first 12 weeks after completion of concurrent&#xD;
             chemoradiotherapy. (For Stage 1: post-chemoradiation group only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prescribed treatment with concomitant temozolomide must be consistent with the Food&#xD;
             and Drug Administration (FDA) package insert. The dose must be 75 mg/m^2 daily for the&#xD;
             6 to 6.5 weeks of radiation therapy. If the patient missed more than 1 week of&#xD;
             temozolomide dosing during radiotherapy, then they are not eligible for the trial.&#xD;
             EDO-S101 can accentuate thrombocytopenia induced by temozolomide. Therefore, if&#xD;
             patients had a platelet &lt; 75,000/mm^3 during concomitant temozolomide therapy during&#xD;
             radiation, they are not eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Complete blood count (CBC) should be monitored during chemoradiation and&#xD;
                  lowest platelet count must be submitted at registration. (For stage 1:&#xD;
                  post-chemoradiation group only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have undergone surgery of their GBM, and must not have had any further&#xD;
             treatment following surgery. A minimal interval of 7 days between the day of surgery&#xD;
             and the day of inclusion should be respected; a maximal interval of 31 days between&#xD;
             the day of surgery and the day of inclusion should be respected; the patient should&#xD;
             have fully clinically recovered from the surgery. (For stage 2: radiation with&#xD;
             concurrent and adjuvant EDO-S101 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must undergo surgery and must not have further treatment. (For MTD expansion&#xD;
             cohort only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received prior interstitial brachytherapy, implanted chemotherapy, or therapeutics&#xD;
             delivered by local injection or convection enhanced delivery. Prior treatment with&#xD;
             Gliadel wafers will be excluded. Concomitant use of the Optune device will also be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is currently participating or has participated in any other any other investigational&#xD;
             or therapeutic trial before or after chemoradiation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, within 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., =&lt; grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse&#xD;
             events due to a previously administered agent. Note: subjects with =&lt; grade 2&#xD;
             neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. Note: if&#xD;
             subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity&#xD;
             and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy. (For Stage 1:&#xD;
             post-chemoradiation group only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of a second malignancy diagnosed within three (3) years of&#xD;
             study enrollment or have a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires&#xD;

             the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): Patients treated with a SSRI AND&#xD;
             displaying a QTc prolongation are NOT eligible in the trial. Nevertheless, there is no&#xD;
             need to stop or change a SSRI if a patient is on a stable dose AND with no impact on&#xD;
             QT/QTc interval, since it is not expected that plasma concentration of the SSRI will&#xD;
             be affected by the administration of EDO-S101&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known gliomatous meningitis, extracranial disease, or multifocal disease. Subject&#xD;
             has multifocal GBM, defined as discrete sites of contrast enhancing disease without&#xD;
             contiguous T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) abnormality that require&#xD;
             distinct radiotherapy ports. Satellite lesions that are associated with a contiguous&#xD;
             area of T2/FLAIR abnormality as the main lesion(s) and that are encompassed within the&#xD;
             same radiotherapy port as the main lesion(s) are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
             Testing not required.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Use of valproate in any of its indications (epilepsy, mood disorder). Valproate, due&#xD;
             to its HDAC inhibiting activity is contraindicated. For those patients on valproate,&#xD;
             valproate will need to be discontinued and switched to a different anti-epileptic&#xD;
             agent or psychotropic agent. A washout period of 4 days from valproate acid will be&#xD;
             allowed prior to enrolling into the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who missed more than 1 week of temozolomide dosing during radiotherapy. (For&#xD;
             Stage 1: Post-chemoradiation group only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who had a platelet &lt; 75,000/mm^3 during concomitant temozolomide therapy&#xD;
