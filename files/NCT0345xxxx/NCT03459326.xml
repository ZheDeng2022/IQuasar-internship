  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization and the World Association for Sexual Health,&#xD;
      sexual health is directly associated with the psychological well-being and quality of life of&#xD;
      each individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infertility is a real public health problem. In recent years, there has been a clear decline&#xD;
      in male fertility in industrialized countries, particularly in sperm quality. Male&#xD;
      infertility may be perceived as a loss of masculinity and so men will be more reluctant to&#xD;
      talk about their fertility problem than women. The studies published so far have focused on&#xD;
      infertile men without any specification on the type or stage of care in Medically assisted&#xD;
      procreation (MAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through our work, we propose to evaluate the impact of the type of care in Medical Assistance&#xD;
      with procreation on the sexuality of man. Does the type of MAP technique used (intrauterine&#xD;
      insemination, in vitro fertilization or intra cytoplasmic sperm injection) have an impact on&#xD;
      male sexuality? Sexual health and reproductive health are closely linked; management of&#xD;
      sexual disorders is essential to improve the quality of life. A prevention of sexual&#xD;
      difficulties during the care of these patients in MAP can be set up in the MAP service from&#xD;
      Clermont-Ferrand hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of our study is therefore to evaluate the perceived quality of sexuality&#xD;
      by the man whose couple is engaged in a process of medical assistance to procreation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infertility is a real public health problem. In recent years, there has been a clear decline&#xD;
      in male fertility in industrialized countries, particularly sperm quality. In the general&#xD;
      population, 70% of desired pregnancies are obtained after 6 months and 90% after one year of&#xD;
      unprotected intercourse. A couple is considered infertile in the absence of pregnancy after&#xD;
      one year of unprotected sex. Currently about 15% of couples of childbearing age is 1 in 7&#xD;
      couples consult for infertility. A French team evaluated the infertility etiologies. Among&#xD;
      1686 couples, infertility was female in 33% of cases, male in 20% of cases and mixed in 39%&#xD;
      of cases. Infertility was said to be unexplained in 8% of the couples evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male partners of infertile couples experience significantly higher stress and sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction during the fertile period compared to the non-fertile period. The high stress&#xD;
      levels are probably due to the psychological pressure associated with efforts to conceive but&#xD;
      certainly also with the forced moment of sexual intercourse around the ovulatory cycle of the&#xD;
      partner. Sexuality can therefore be deprived of its recreational and erotic value and&#xD;
      subordinated to the purpose of pregnancy. The man and the woman become &quot;spawners&quot; and the&#xD;
      love relationship is organized towards a procreative goal, affecting the spontaneity of the&#xD;
      relationship of the couple. Sexual intercourse then proceeds less and less from erotic desire&#xD;
      and more and more desire for pregnancy. The man who doubts his fertility is ready to adjust&#xD;
      his sexuality for greater efficiency in order to obtain the child, which represents his&#xD;
      personal reassurance and the social proof of his sexual power. Sexual desire disorders are&#xD;
      therefore the most frequent sexual disorder in infertile couples. Treatments and medical&#xD;
      requirements to treat infertility may be responsible for inhibiting sexual desire. Indeed,&#xD;
      sex becomes impersonal and driven by medical procedures. Medical assistance with procreation&#xD;
      (MAP) is becoming increasingly important in our society. In 2011 according to the figures of&#xD;
      the agency of biomedicine, 23 127 children were born thanks to the attempts of MPAs made, or&#xD;
      2.8% of children born in the general population that same year. However, MAP techniques do&#xD;
      not always lead to pregnancy, according to the figures of the weekly epidemiological bulletin&#xD;
      on 100 couples who start IVF:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  41 will have a child thanks to IVF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  59 will not have them in the context of IVF:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  7 will have a child with another treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  11 will have a child naturally&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  11 will adopt a child&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  30 couples will not have children&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infertile men may feel stigmatized because they are perceived to be deficient in a specific&#xD;
      component of their masculinity. When men discover their infertility, men usually go through a&#xD;
      crisis. This crisis represents a manifestation of long-standing anxiety about the nature of&#xD;
      man, his role and function. The confusion of fertility, power and masculinity has&#xD;
      consequences for infertile men. Male infertility can be perceived as a loss of masculinity.&#xD;
      Men will be more reluctant to talk about their fertility problem than women. The literature&#xD;
      suggests that the exams and the vocabulary of consultation also contribute to the anxiety of&#xD;
      loss of male sexual identity, of self-deprecation in men. The diagnosis announcement is an&#xD;
      important moment of care. This announcement should be cautious and the words cleverly chosen&#xD;
      because the narcissistic injury can be profound. The team of Marci et al evaluated the impact&#xD;
      of the diagnosis of infertility on sexuality. It could be shown that men newly diagnosed as&#xD;
      infertile presented lower scores compared to fertile controls. This team showed that during&#xD;
      the early stages of the diagnosis of infertility, the sexual life of couples was reached. An&#xD;
      observational study also showed that 11% of the men had failed in the second collection&#xD;
      because of a diagnosis of infertility. Patients in the fertile group had inferior spermatic&#xD;
      characteristics compared with patients in the fertile group without significant difference.&#xD;
      In the literature, a higher prevalence of erectile dysfunction in infertile men is reported&#xD;
      compared to the general male population. The team of Khademi in 2008 show that 61.8% of&#xD;
      patients have sexual dysfunction including 2% with severe erectile dysfunction. An&#xD;
      observational study evaluated a total of 1,468 infertile men and 942 fertile men. The&#xD;
      incidences of premature ejaculation (PE) and erectile dysfunction (ED) in the infertile group&#xD;
      were significantly higher than those in the fertile group (PE: 19.01% vs. 10.93%, P &lt;0.001;&#xD;
      ED: 18.05% vs. 8.28%, P &lt;0.001). In addition, anxiety and depression were more prevalent&#xD;
      among infertile men compared to fertile men (anxiety: 38.01% vs 26.65%, p &lt;0.001, depression:&#xD;
      15.74% vs. 10.08% P &lt;0.001). Some authors reported that sexual arousal was maintained during&#xD;
      the management of infertility. Other results have reported a decrease in sexual arousal.&#xD;
      Despite the difficult stages they are going through, the 2 partners treated for infertility&#xD;
      maintain a good understanding within their couple and support each other. The studies&#xD;
      published so far have focused on infertile men without any specification on the type or stage&#xD;
      of management of MPA. Similarly, the type of infertility encountered is rarely mentioned.&#xD;
      Only one study assessed concordance between sperm characteristics and sexual dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of our study is therefore to evaluate the perceived sexual quality by the&#xD;
      man whose couple is cared for in MAP. It is an exploratory study of the control case type.&#xD;
      This work will make it possible to evaluate the impact of the type of treatment in MAP on the&#xD;
      sexuality of the man. Does the techniques used in MAP (Intra uterine insemination, in vitro&#xD;
      fertilization or intra cytoplasmic sperm injection) have an impact on male sexuality? In&#xD;
      order to be able to quantify sexual dysfunction in this study, the IIEF: the international&#xD;
      index of erectile function questionnaire will be given to the included patients. The IIEF is&#xD;
      an internationally validated test and translated in several languages. This questionnaire has&#xD;
      been the subject of several publications especially in the field of infertility (Bechoua et&#xD;
      al., 2016). It allows to assign a score of erectile dysfunction (severe score 1 to 10,&#xD;
      moderate score 11 to 16, low to moderate score 17 to 21, low score 22 at 25, no erectile&#xD;
      dysfunction score 26 to 30). This test also classifies sexual dysfunction under several&#xD;
      domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erectile function: item 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 15 (score 1 to 30) Orgasmic function: item 9 and 10&#xD;
      (score 0 to 10) Desire: item 11 and 12 (score 2 to 10) Sexual satisfaction: items 6, 7 and 8&#xD;
      (score 0 to 15) Overall satisfaction: item 13 and 14 (score 2 to 10)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men are often left behind and may be disinvested from MAP protocols. Depending on the&#xD;
      results, patients who have a significant impact on their sexuality of their care in MAP can&#xD;
      be diagnosed and supported with the establishment of a sexology consultation in the service.&#xD;
      Conducting a study of this type in the MAP service from CHU Estaing in Clermont-Ferrand will&#xD;
      open a space of expression complementary.&#xD;
