      The goal of this collaborative research is to study human genomes in children with suspected&#xD;
      congenital disease, multiple-congenital anomalies and/or multi-organ disease of unknown&#xD;
      etiology by understanding the potential value of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) in&#xD;
      establishing genetic diagnosis. The study will examine diagnosis rates, changes in clinical&#xD;
      care as a result of a genetic diagnosis, health economics including potential&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of WGS and patient and provider experience with genomic medicine.&#xD;

      The goal of this collaborative research is to study human genomes in children with suspected&#xD;
      congenital disease, multiple-congenital anomalies and/or multi-organ disease of unknown&#xD;
      etiology, in order to understand the potential value of WGS in establishing a genetic&#xD;
      diagnosis. The study will examine diagnosis rates, changes in clinical care as a result of a&#xD;
      genetic diagnosis, health economics including potential cost-effectiveness of WGS, and&#xD;
      patient and provider experience with genomic medicine. Other clinical information of the type&#xD;
      collected by treating physicians and stored in electronic medical records will also be&#xD;
      collected to aid in the interpretation of laboratory data. Participants will also be asked to&#xD;
      consent for future access of the medical record, future research on biospecimens and data&#xD;
      generated from genomic sequencing, and for the ability to re-contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this effort, Nicklaus Children's Hospital plans to create a large integrated&#xD;
      database that contains the DNA sequences of the participants' whole human genomes and&#xD;
      additional health information regarding characteristics and health of the persons whose&#xD;
      samples have been sequenced. Scientists can then use the database to try to link those&#xD;
      traits, diseases, and other conditions to changes in the sequence of the genome. Nicklaus&#xD;
      Children's Hospital plans to make the database available to its collaborators, such as RCIGM,&#xD;
      pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and other academic institutions which will use&#xD;
      the database to find better, innovative ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer and other&#xD;
      diseases. De-identified data from this study will be shared with the community at-large,&#xD;
      including publications and public databases. In addition, participants will be given the&#xD;
      option to allow biospecimens (i.e., residual blood, saliva, CSF, etc.) to be included in&#xD;
      biorepositories at Nicklaus Children's Hospital and Rady Pediatric Genomics &amp; Systems&#xD;
      Medicine Institute (RCIGM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will provide clinical laboratory-confirmed results related to the affected&#xD;
      patient's phenotype, including optional incidental findings unless subjects opt-out for these&#xD;
      additional results, to allow for these research findings to be used in clinical care.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this study will aggregate data regarding standard clinical genetic testing as&#xD;
      well as cost measures to not only identify differences in diagnostic rates, diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy, and times to diagnoses, but to determine the cost-effectiveness of this testing and&#xD;
      subsequent changes in care management. Clinical utility will be defined as changes in care&#xD;
      that follow directly from results of genetic testing (both positive and negative), including&#xD;
      standard clinical tests and WGS. This data will be used to further examine the analytic,&#xD;
      diagnostic, and clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of this testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WGS methods continue to improve and pediatric genomic medicine is a very new field of medical&#xD;
      practice. This study will also inform investigators regarding best practices, both in terms&#xD;
      of traditional medical outcomes and patient-centered outcomes. Consequently, this study will&#xD;
      also act as a biorepository for samples and data as the ability to share genomic and&#xD;
      phenotypic data amongst researchers is critical to progressing our understanding of the&#xD;
      nascent field of pediatric genomic medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use WGS to identify new genetic diagnoses in children with multiple congenital&#xD;
           anomalies, developmental delay, autism, seizures, intellectual disabilities,&#xD;
           neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the diagnosis rate of genetic diseases by WGS in previously undiagnosed&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the clinical utility of WGS in the care and management of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examine the health economics and cost-effectiveness of WGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluate the provider, patient and family experience with genomic medicine&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Collect biological samples and associated clinical data from pediatric patients who may&#xD;
           have a genetic disease and their family members (the &quot;Phenome&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Create, analyze and store genomic data from the biological samples. Genomic data will&#xD;
           include genomic (gDNA) sequences, RNA sequences, and/or other related 'omic data&#xD;
           (including, but not limited to, pharmacogenomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics).&#xD;
           Genomic data from WGS will include single nucleotide variants (SNVs), structural&#xD;
           variants such as copy number testing, genomic rearrangements, gene expression , the&#xD;
           &quot;whole transcriptome&quot; or more limited DNA sequencing panels of specific genes or of all&#xD;
           exons of genes (the &quot;Exome&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Analyze and report clinically-confirmed genomic diagnoses and treatment guidance through&#xD;
           use of new research technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Identify and study novel gene and disease processes.&#xD;
