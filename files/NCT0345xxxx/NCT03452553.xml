  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer. This type of&#xD;
      cancer may be &quot;hypervascular&quot;. Hypervascular means there is an increased number or&#xD;
      concentration of blood vessels. These blood vessels get their blood supply from the hepatic&#xD;
      artery, while the non-tumor liver tissue gets blood supply from the portal vein. Therefore,&#xD;
      blockage of the hepatic artery to cut off the blood supply to the tumor is possible without&#xD;
      affecting the normal liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research protocol will study chemoembolization using radiopaque beads loaded with a&#xD;
      chemotherapy drug called doxorubicin. Chemoembolization is a procedure in which the blood&#xD;
      supply to a tumor is blocked after anticancer drugs are given in blood vessels near the&#xD;
      tumor. In this study, the anticancer drug, doxorubicin, is attached to small beads that are&#xD;
      injected into an artery that feeds the tumor. The radiopaque beads (RO beads) are visible on&#xD;
      imagining scans (X-rays) so that the Interventional Radiologist performing the&#xD;
      chemoembolization procedure can see the location of the beads in the tumor during and after&#xD;
      the procedure. The visibility of the beads allows the interventional radiologist to confirm&#xD;
      where the beads loaded with doxorubicin have been delivered in the tumor; this in theory&#xD;
      could help to improve the efficiency of embolization and plan the next course of treatment.&#xD;
      In addition to the embolization, the beads elute a sustained dose of doxorubicin locally to&#xD;
      the tumor site as a second effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The usual treatment for HCC is to perform a procedure to the tumor known as Transarterial&#xD;
      Chemo-Embolization (TACE). TACE has been approved and used worldwide for over 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transarterial means that the treatment is delivered using a catheter inserted into the&#xD;
      hepatic artery. Embolization is a treatment that blocks or slows down the blood supply to&#xD;
      tissues. This procedure is performed to block the flow of blood to a tumor, so the cancer&#xD;
      cells die because the oxygen supply is interrupted. When the material used to block the blood&#xD;
      supply also delivers a chemotherapy drug to the tumor, it is called chemoembolization. The&#xD;
      most commonly used material for chemoembolization are drug-eluting beads (DEBs) that are&#xD;
      loaded with a chemotherapy drug (doxorubicin). These beads are not visible, during the&#xD;
      procedure, on the imaging (scanner, ultrasonography or MRI) while injected into the tumor.&#xD;
      The consequences of the blood flow interruption are visible on imaging (CT, MRI) in the weeks&#xD;
      following treatment (tissue infarction/tumor necrosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study uses the LC Bead LUMI™ radiopaque beads (RO beads). The difference is that RO&#xD;
      Beads are visible with X-Ray imaging (scanner, fluoroscopy). This is important because it&#xD;
      means that the Interventional Radiologist is able to verify, during the procedure, where the&#xD;
      beads have been delivered to the tumor. The Interventional Radiologist will identify the&#xD;
      blood supply to the tumor, and then inject the LC Bead LUMI™ loaded with doxorubicin and a&#xD;
      compatible contrast agent into the blood vessels that supply the liver tumor. These RO beads&#xD;
      block the blood vessel, starve the tumor of nutrients and deliver a slow release of the&#xD;
      doxorubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of the tests, investigations and procedures that will be requested as a part of the&#xD;
      study may be the same as what is routinely done in the diagnosis and treatment of HCC. These&#xD;
      tests will be used to determine if you are eligible to participate in this study and receive&#xD;
      the LC Bead LUMI™ loaded with doxorubicin. Some of the study assessments are done to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of the treatment procedure and others will be done for research&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the tests and evaluations will be scheduled with normally occurring&#xD;
      appointments, when possible; to reduce the number of visits the patient needs to make to the&#xD;
      study center. Study visits for tumor response evaluation occur at one month after the first&#xD;
      treatment then every 3 months for 2 years then every 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information obtained during your visits will help your study doctor determine what&#xD;
      choices you have for the next best course of action in treating your cancer. Options may&#xD;
      include; repeat the study treatment, propose another alternative treatment or to continue the&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
