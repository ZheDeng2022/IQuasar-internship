  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: to search for reasons for seeking orthodontic treatment, compliance during orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment, drop-out from orthodontic treatment and success of orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: evaluation before, during and at the end of orthodontic treatment. Clinical and&#xD;
      diagnostic evaluation of complexity before and at the end of orthodontic treatment,&#xD;
      evaluation of awareness of treatment need, impact on social and psychological aspects,&#xD;
      functional disturbances, impact of malocclusion on quality of life, social interaction,&#xD;
      ability to perform daily activities.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data will include diagnostic measurements on study casts, x-rays, and data from&#xD;
      questionnaires given to children and parents. Statistical analyses will explore predictors of&#xD;
      treatment success with treatment need, compliance and psycho-social domains.&#xD;
