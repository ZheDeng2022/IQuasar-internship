  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is performed in 20 different hospitals from 19 cities in China. Three sub-projects&#xD;
      are included. About sub-project 1, we build a clinical database system and a biological&#xD;
      sample bank for data and samples management, which is applicable in other hospitals in this&#xD;
      project. 1800 first-episode schizophrenia patients will be recruited in 19 sites and&#xD;
      randomized into 6 treatment groups (olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone,&#xD;
      amisulpride, haloperidol). Through 8-week treatment and follow-up, we collect&#xD;
      multidimensional indexes from psychopathology, neuropsychology, brain imaging, physiology,&#xD;
      biochemistry, and life stress data. The summarized data is analyzed to screen potential&#xD;
      biomarkers or biomarker panel that may predict the antipsychotic response, and ultimately to&#xD;
      establish a prediction model.Sub-project 2, as an extension of sub-project 1, includes&#xD;
      verification of the prediction model established in sub-project 1 and optimization of the&#xD;
      current therapy with add-on treatment. Firstly, the validation process of the prediction&#xD;
      model undergoes with an independent patient cohort. Next, we apply the add-on treatment to&#xD;
      the patients who don't have ideal response to antipsychotic treatment after 8-week treatment.&#xD;
      According to the results above, we manage to construct an optimized and individualized&#xD;
      therapy for schizophrenia.In the end,We tend to conduct a randomized double-blind controlled&#xD;
      trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination strategy for antipsychotic-induced&#xD;
      metabolism syndrome, which includes metformin and lifestyle intervention. In the meanwhile,&#xD;
      for schizophrenia patients at high-risk of metabolic syndrome, we tend to establish a&#xD;
      prevention strategy expected to reduce or delay the occurrence of metabolic syndrome, which&#xD;
      includes low-dose metformin and lifestyle intervention. We hope to successfully construct a&#xD;
      comprehensive intervention strategy on metabolic syndrome induced by antipsychotic&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;

      For sub-project1 and 2:Inclusion criteria: Participants are ineligible to enter the trial&#xD;
      under the following conditions: 1) Participants must be aged 18 to 65 years old who meet the&#xD;

&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria (any potential paticipant who meets any of the following criteria will be&#xD;
      excluded from participating in the study): 1). Participants with known or suspected&#xD;
      clinically unstable systemic medical disorder; 2). participant has a current or prior DSM-5/&#xD;

      body mass index ≥ 25.0kg / m2; B. hyperglycemia: fasting blood glucose ≥ 110mg/dl (6.1mmol/l)&#xD;
      and / or plasma glucose ≥ 140mg/dl(7.8mmol/l) after glucose load; and / or those who have&#xD;
      been diagnosed with diabetes and received treatment; C. hypertension: systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      (SBP) / diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 140/90mmHg, and / or those who have been diagnosed&#xD;
      as hypertension and received treatment; D. dyslipidemia: at fasting state, total cholesterol&#xD;
      (TG) ≥ 150 mg/dl (1.7mmol/l); and / or HDL-C: male &lt; 35mg/dl (0.9mmol/l), female &lt; 39mg/dl&#xD;
      (1.0mmol/l) . The inclusive criteria for patients at high-risk of MetS: A. paticipants are&#xD;
      taking antipsychotic drugs that significantly affect metabolisms, such as olanzapine,&#xD;
      clozapine or risperidone; B. paticipants have family history of diabetes, hypertension and&#xD;
      heart disease; C. the age of paticipants is over 40 years old; D. paticipants have no&#xD;
      nonalcoholic fatty liver and gout; E. paticipants who have one or two components of metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome but do not meet the diagnostic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For clinical and biological data collection, we collect blood samples and case information,&#xD;
      which contains demographic data, medical history (including current medical history, past&#xD;
      history, personal history and family history), medication regimen and results of follow-up&#xD;
      evaluation. The biological samples are stored using unique code whose storage information can&#xD;
      be linked to research case in the web server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Standard Operations Procedures (SOPs) are followed for data collection, storage,&#xD;
      tracking, and utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Professional technicians are employed for the establishment and subsequent maintenance of&#xD;
      Internet platform, including web server and mobile terminal applications (APP). Ancillary&#xD;
      researchers are involved for collection and timely upload of case information online.&#xD;
      Principal investigators are responsible for auditing the data and quality control.&#xD;
