  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research program is to implement and evaluate complementary interventions&#xD;
      designed to address underage alcohol, marijuana, tobacco and other drug use and abuse among&#xD;
      Native American youth residing in and around nine contiguous Indian reservations in rural&#xD;
      portions of a Southern California county.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component 1. Motivational Interviewing (MI) Evaluations (Identified PHI). Approximately 150&#xD;
      participants between 13 and 20 years of age will participate in the Motivational Interviewing&#xD;
      (MI) intervention and one follow-up assessment over an 18 month period. Questionnaires of&#xD;
      youth substance use and access patterns will be by phone or self-administered using paper,&#xD;
      iPad, and web-based surveys. Formal informed consent from participants 18 and older and&#xD;
      assent and parental/legal guardian consent will be obtained from those participants under 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component 2. Psychoeducation (PE) Evaluations (Identified PHI). Approximately 150&#xD;
      participants between 13 and 20 years of age will participate in the Psychoeducation (PE)&#xD;
      intervention and one follow-up assessment over an 18 month period. Questionnaires of youth&#xD;
      substance use and access patterns will be by phone or self-administered using paper, iPad,&#xD;
      and web-based surveys. Formal informed consent from participants 18 and older and assent and&#xD;
      parental/legal guardian consent will be obtained from those participants under 18.&#xD;

      Study Design. Following screening and giving informed assent/consent, eligible participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of two study conditions: (1) MI: Two hour session of&#xD;
      therapist administered MI, and (2) PE: Two hour session of therapist assisted viewing and&#xD;
      discussion of educational DVDs about adolescent alcohol use, drug use, and driving under the&#xD;
      influence provided by Human Relations Media, Mount Kisco, NY (hrmvideo.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions will be curriculum based in that each session will be introduced by the leader&#xD;
      with a brief description of problems associated with underage drinking, underage binge&#xD;
      drinking, underage tobacco and other drug use, and driving while intoxicated. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to the MI or PE condition, but will be able to choose an individual&#xD;
      or group intervention format. In a preliminary study, the investigators have found that many&#xD;
      youth prefer a group format. Both individual and group formats have been successfully used&#xD;
      previously in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be carried out pre-intervention and once within 18 months post-intervention.&#xD;
      Pre-intervention assessments will be carried out in person and post-intervention assessments&#xD;
      will be done in person, by telephone, or be web-based using questionnaires developed at Brown&#xD;
      University and previously used successfully in youth in this population. Participating youth&#xD;
      will be paid $75 for the initial two hour intervention and $75 for completing the follow-up.&#xD;
      The payments will be in the form of Target or other department store gift cards. All&#xD;
      questionnaires will be available on scannable paper forms or as a web-based application to&#xD;
      permit ease and accuracy of data transmittal to a database for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: In addition to collecting demographic data, the following measures will be used&#xD;
      pre-intervention (MI or PE) and at follow-up: Adolescent Drinking Questionnaire (ADQ), Drug&#xD;
      Use Questionnaire, Drinking and Drug Use Driving Scale, Tobacco Use Scale, Injury behavior&#xD;
      checklist, Student Self Check, Relationship with Parent/Guardian - Most Important, Teen&#xD;
      Monitoring (Chassin), Peer Substance Use, Peer Tolerance of Substance Use, Stage of Change&#xD;
      Assessment, MI Adherence Checklist (for the MI sessions only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examples of potential factors include information transfer, change in beliefs, internalizing&#xD;
      new norms, resolving ambivalence, establishing increased autonomy, empowering for change,&#xD;
      peer modeling, and peer support. The investigators will assess 1) these change factors, 2)&#xD;
      the participant's movement along the stages of behavior change to a new level of&#xD;
      drinking/drug use, and 3) self-reported changes in drinking, drug use, and intoxicated&#xD;
      driving. With these data the investigators will be able to determine not only the overall&#xD;
      efficacy of the MI vs. PE intervention in decreasing alcohol and drug use and intoxicated&#xD;
      driving, but also the type of behavior change (e.g., moving from pre-contemplation to action)&#xD;
      and the variables associated with that change (e.g., internalizing new norms, increased&#xD;
      autonomy, peer support).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MI intervention will incorporate open-ended questions, personalized feedback, and&#xD;
      discussion about participants' alcohol use and drug, associated risk behaviors (e.g.,&#xD;
      drinking and driving), and the consequences of these behaviors. Individual MI procedures will&#xD;
      incorporate the core principles of MI described by Miller and Rollnick, including expressing&#xD;
      empathy, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance, and supporting self-efficacy.&#xD;
      Therapist interventions will be tailored to the participants' readiness to change/current&#xD;
      stage of change (pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and&#xD;
      relapse).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the PE intervention, participants will view all four DVDs (all DVDs available from Human&#xD;
      Relations Media):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1: Underage Drinking: Know the Facts, Know the Risks describes negative consequences&#xD;
      of youth alcohol abuse, including deaths resulting from drunk driving, and alcohol poisoning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2: Too Much: Extreme Danger of Binge-Drinking presents information specifically about&#xD;
      the physiology of how binge drinking can cause death, and an interview with a parent of a&#xD;
      student who died from alcohol poisoning while partying with his friends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 3: Everything You Need to Know About Substance Abuse in 22 Minutes outlines alcohol,&#xD;
      tobacco, and other drugs' effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 4: Dying High 2: Real Stories of Drugged Driving shows consequences of driving under&#xD;
      the influence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training in MI. Under the supervision of Dr. Gilder, at least six training workshops will be&#xD;
      held with Tribal clinic study staff to deliver culturally appropriate MI to adolescent Native&#xD;
      Americans. Workshop leaders will be Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers (MINT)&#xD;
      certified PhD-level trainers with expertise in working with American Indian/Alaska Native&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of MI fidelity. Since tribal leaders and parents, citing confidentiality and&#xD;
      cultural concerns, stated that audio- and video-taping of MI sessions would not be&#xD;
      acceptable, the investigators will assess the MI sessions with the Adherence Checklist -&#xD;
      Individual and Group MI Prevention Session. The checklist contains 14 items which assess the&#xD;
      session's process and content and the therapist's adhering to the principles of MI. Items&#xD;
      include asking if the therapist discussed the pros and cons of changing behavior, and&#xD;
      introduced a change plan worksheet to the participant. Therapist fidelity to MI will be&#xD;
      assessed both during training and on an ongoing basis every 6 months during the study using&#xD;
      the MI Adherence checklist. If the average total checklist score of adherence falls below&#xD;
      80%, a quality improvement program will be instituted to identify the problem(s) and correct&#xD;
      it with additional training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up. The investigators believe, given the success of the preliminary pilot study in&#xD;
      recruiting reservation youth to the initial assessment and intervention, that successful&#xD;
      follow-up of participants represents the main potential problem for the study. These&#xD;
      obstacles were overcome, at least in part, by 1) instituting a web-based assessment that&#xD;
      adolescents can take any time, including free time at school; 2) keeping email and regular&#xD;
      mail addresses of participants current; 3) increasing payment for follow-up; 4) instituting&#xD;
      follow-up in conjunction with a program the adolescent is participating in, i.e. after school&#xD;
      youth program, and appointments at the clinic for medical and dental services. The Tribal IRB&#xD;
      has given permission for the web-based assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention study aims to recruit 150 participants to each intervention condition for a&#xD;
      total enrollment of 300 youth participants ages 13-20 years. Evaluation will be designed to&#xD;
      test that MI is more effective than the PE in reducing alcohol and drug use and intoxicated&#xD;
      driving at follow-up. Evaluations to test that MI is more effective than the PE in reducing&#xD;
      alcohol and drug use will be undertaken as follows: The primary outcome variables will be: in&#xD;
      the previous 6 months (1) quantity x frequency of drinking, (2) frequency of binge drinking&#xD;
      and being drunk; (3) number of days used cigarettes, other forms of tobacco, e-cigarettes and&#xD;
      nicotine inhalant devices, cannabis, &quot;Spice,&quot; stimulants, opiates, cough syrup, inhalants,&#xD;
      hallucinogens, and benzodiazepines; (4) drinking or using drugs and driving and/or being a&#xD;
      passenger in a car with a driver who has been using alcohol or drugs; (5) a negative&#xD;
      consequences of drinking or using drugs composite score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be generated for each variable. Statistical analyses assessing MI&#xD;
      vs. PE differences will be assessed as follows. For dichotomous variables, repeated-measures&#xD;
      chi-square analyses will be used. For continuous variables, repeated measures analysis of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVA) or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used. The Mann-Whitney Test will&#xD;
      be used for continuous variables that are not normally distributed. Repeated measures of&#xD;
      ordinal data for two time points will be assessed using the Wilcoxin Signed Ranks Test. With&#xD;
      2 groups, 150 participants in each group, an alpha = 0.01 to avoid a Type 1 error, a medium&#xD;
      effect size for the group of dependent variables analyzed in chi-square, ANOVA, and logistic&#xD;
      regression analyses, and a Bonferroni correction for 5 multiple comparisons in each set of&#xD;
      analyses, the power at the projected n for chi-square, ANOVA, and logistic regression will be&#xD;
      0.96, 0.96, and &gt;0.80, respectively. Power estimates were made using G*Power 3.61. If sample&#xD;
      size permits, a larger model examining the association of selected outcome variables (e.g.,&#xD;
      frequency of bingeing and drinking/driving in the past 6 months) with independent variables&#xD;
      (e.g., age, gender, stage of change, MI vs. PE intervention) in multiple and logistic&#xD;
      regression models will also be evaluated.&#xD;
