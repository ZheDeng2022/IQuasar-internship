    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of anetumab ravtansine when&#xD;
      given together with atezolizumab and how well they work in treating participants with&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as anetumab ravtansine and atezolizumab, may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify the recommended phase II dose of anetumab ravtansine combined with&#xD;
      atezolizumab in advanced MSLN+ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (Phase I) II. To determine&#xD;
      the confirmed response rate for the combination of anetumab ravtansine and atezolizumab in&#xD;
      MSLN+ 2nd line NSCLC. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe adverse events and toxicities of the combination treatment of anetumab&#xD;
      ravtansine and atezolizumab. (Phase I) II. To identify preliminary evidence of clinical&#xD;
      activity (i.e. response, timed endpoints, etc.) (Phase I) III. To determine the&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) and the 1-year PFS rate for the combination of anetumab&#xD;
      ravtansine and atezolizumab in 2nd-line NSCLC. (Phase II) IV. To determine the overall&#xD;
      survival of anetumab ravtansine combined with atezolizumab in second-line therapy of NSCLC.&#xD;
      (Phase II) V. Adverse events will also be summarized as well. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine using flow cytometry the levels of Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death&#xD;
      (BIM) in circulating CD8+ CD11a+ PD-1+ T-cells, in peripheral blood samples collected from&#xD;
      patients prior to initiation of therapy (baseline) and correlating these with confirmed&#xD;
      response rate during and following treatment with the combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine tissue MSLN and PD-L1 expression and correlate with response to combination&#xD;
      therapy with atezolizumab and anetumab ravtansine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate baseline serum soluble PDL-1 (sPDL-1) with response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of anetumab ravtansine followed by a phase&#xD;
      II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive anetumab ravtansine intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and atezolizumab&#xD;
      IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
