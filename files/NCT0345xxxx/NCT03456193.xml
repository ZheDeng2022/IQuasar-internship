      This is a prospective, single center, safety and feasibility trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      transplantation of the left atrium and pulmonary veins in patients with pulmonary vein&#xD;
      stenosis. Consented patients will be listed for transplantation. Once a suitable donor has&#xD;
      been identified, the left atrium, pulmonary veins and complete lung block will be harvested&#xD;
      from the donor and transported to Boston Children's Hospital as is the procedure for routine&#xD;
      lung transplantation patients. The left atrium and pulmonary veins will be transplanted into&#xD;
      the recipient. The recipient will receive the normal immunosuppression protocol used for&#xD;
      heart transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will include 5 patients.&#xD;

      Techniques for harvest of the posterior left atrium and pulmonary veins from a suitable organ&#xD;
      donor have been well established as this is currently accomplished during every harvest of&#xD;
      lungs for lung transplantation. The difference in this therapy is that the lung parenchyma&#xD;
      will not be utilized. However, the harvest from the donor will be exactly the same with the&#xD;
      full lung block typically harvested for lung transplant removed and transported back to the&#xD;
      site of implantation. The exact extent of pulmonary vein utilization from the lung block will&#xD;
      be determined at the time of implantation based on the exact anatomy and location of the&#xD;
      pulmonary vein disease of the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this represents a new transplantation approach, this program has been discussed with the&#xD;
      United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and the New England Organ Bank (NEOB). UNOS&#xD;
      identified this as a new area of transplantation related to but separate from heart or lung&#xD;
      transplantations. Eventually if this progresses to a national phase, it will require creation&#xD;
      of a new patient waiting list and all the policies that accompany a new area of&#xD;
      transplantation. Although there is enthusiasm at UNOS for this approach, they recommended&#xD;
      that it be pursued as a regional research program as an initial step. The NEOB also has&#xD;
      voiced support for this program in a meeting with them including their medical director. They&#xD;
      are interested in supporting this program as a Region 1 research program and will perform a&#xD;
      full evaluation for approval once local IRB approval has been granted. The Children's team&#xD;
      will work closely with NEOB to create a list of potential patients and identify suitable&#xD;
      donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utilizing standardized harvesting techniques will minimize any changes to the current harvest&#xD;
      approach and definition of tissue allocation during the harvest procedure. As the lung&#xD;
      parenchyma is unnecessary, it is expected that suitable donors for left atrial transplant&#xD;
      would come from two sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first source is brain dead donors in whom the lungs are not allocated for&#xD;
           transplantation based on rejection of the lungs for quality or no matching donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second source is donors after cardiac death (DCD) which are utilized in the adult&#xD;
           population for kidney, liver and lung transplantation. DCD organs are not currently&#xD;
           utilized pediatric lung transplantation. However, as the viability of these tissues,&#xD;
           including the entire lung block is well established, these represent a potential donor&#xD;
           pool for left atrial transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certainly experience with preservation of the kidney grafts for hours or days with integrated&#xD;
      perfusion systems has demonstrated the successful implantation of vascularized tissues&#xD;
      appropriately preserved can be extended beyond the traditional four hour window targeted for&#xD;
      lung transplantation. Kidney transplants are commonly done within 24 hours without evidence&#xD;
      of impact on the vascular patency these grafts. In addition, only vascular tissue is being&#xD;
      transplanted that has no effect on gas exchange or contractility. Accordingly it is expected&#xD;
      that the goal implantation time for left atrial transplants after harvest will not need to be&#xD;
      within the four to six hour window used for lung transplant but can be safely extended to 24&#xD;
      hours. This window extends the donor pool for left atrial transplants to the entire country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excision of recipient left atrium and stenotic pulmonary veins and implantation of left&#xD;
      atrial graft The set up for the operation will be identical to all major cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass cardiac cases. The surgical approach for the recipient will likely be a clamshell&#xD;
      incision that crosses the sternum in the fourth interspace. This is the same incision used&#xD;
      for lung transplant. The patient will be cannulated for cardiopulmonary bypass in the distal&#xD;
      aorta, SVC and low in the IVC. Cardiopulmonary bypass will be initiated and the patient will&#xD;
      be cooled to 18Â°C. Prior to arresting the heart, the donor left atrium and pulmonary veins&#xD;
      will be inspected in the lung block. The pulmonary veins from the donor will be mobilized and&#xD;
      prepared for resection from the lung block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cross clamp will be applied and the heart arrested. The pulmonary veins of the recipient&#xD;
      will be mobilized and transected beyond the level stenoses. The left atrium and pulmonary&#xD;
      vein graft then be brought to the field and positioned in the orthotopic position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anastomosis of the pulmonary veins will be completed with a generous diameter of the&#xD;
      anastomotic area to minimize any risk of late anastomotic narrowing even in the smallest of&#xD;
      pulmonary vein segments. The donor left atrium will be anastomosed to the posterior left&#xD;
      atrial cuff of the heart. Only the affected pulmonary veins with stenosis will be&#xD;
      transplanted. This may be one or up to all 4 main pulmonary veins. If an individual pulmonary&#xD;
      vein or side of pulmonary veins are unaffected, they will not have any manipulation or&#xD;
      intervention on them. A formal atrial fenestration will be created. Post-bypass evaluation&#xD;
      with transesophageal echocardiogram will assess pulmonary vein velocities and flow. The chest&#xD;
      will be closed and patient transferred intubated to the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the initial clinical experience with these transplants, a traditional immunosuppression&#xD;
      protocol for heart transplants will be followed. Over time new protocols will be developed&#xD;
      and tested which focused on minimizing the long-term immunosuppression regimens.&#xD;
