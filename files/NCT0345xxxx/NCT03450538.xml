      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trauma is defined as an injury caused by an external force to the body. Trauma is one of the&#xD;
      major causes of death in the world and accounts for almost five million deaths per year. To&#xD;
      quickly and accurately assess damage to internal organs and to be able to identify the&#xD;
      potentially fatal injuries, various forms of imaging are used. Examples of such imaging are&#xD;
      conventional x-ray scans, Focused Assessment by Sonography in Trauma (FAST), and Computed&#xD;
      Tomography (CT). In high-income countries, it has become common to utilize CT as a routine&#xD;
      investigation in trauma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of whole body CT (WBCT) scans as opposed to selective scanning has been associated&#xD;
      with survival benefits for trauma patients, even when the patients undergoing WBCT have more&#xD;
      severe injuries than the control group. The studies that investigate this association have&#xD;
      been done mostly in high-resource settings where the distance between resuscitation and&#xD;
      imaging facilities are short, imaging facilities are more readily available, and the quality&#xD;
      of the imaging may be better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trauma disproportionally affects low-resource settings. For example, road traffic injuries&#xD;
      are responsible for more than 1,3 million deaths per year and of these approximately 90&#xD;
      percent occur in low- and middle-income countries. In low-resource settings the CT may be&#xD;
      located far from the resuscitation and surgical resources, and the expertise needed to keep&#xD;
      patients stable during the transfer to and from the CT may be limited. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      unclear if the survival benefit associated with CT use in high-resource settings also can be&#xD;
      observed in low-resource settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess if CT within 24 hours of arrival is associated with survival in adult trauma&#xD;
      patients in an urban lower-middle income setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a retrospective analysis based on the cohort study Towards Improved Trauma Care&#xD;
      Outcomes in India (TITCO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will use the de-identified TITCO cohort, which includes data for a total of&#xD;
      16,000 trauma patients enrolled from four different public university hospitals in urban&#xD;
      India. The hospitals are located in Kolkata, Mumbai, and Delhi, and the data was collected&#xD;
      between July 2013 and December 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One dedicateds project officer per centre enrolled patients and collected data. The project&#xD;
      officer rotated through three shifts: day, evening, and night. The patients who arrived&#xD;
      during the shifts when the observer was not present on-site were also enrolled, and the&#xD;
      relevant data was retrieved from the patients' case records. The data from patients arriving&#xD;
      during the unobserved shifts was consistent with the data from the observed shifts. The&#xD;
      patients were followed until either death, discharge, or the length of their hospital stay&#xD;
      reached 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source and methods of participant selection and follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were enrolled and data collected as soon as possible after arrival by the&#xD;
      on-site project officer, or if the patient was admitted while the project officer was not&#xD;
      present, within the first days of admission. Patients were followed until death or discharge,&#xD;
      whichever occurred first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explanatory variable&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main variable investigated will be whether the patient underwent CT within 24 hours of&#xD;
      arrival to a participating centre, or not. CT here refers to any type of CT investigation&#xD;
      including both WBCT and selective investigations such as scans of the head, thorax, and&#xD;
      abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other covariates&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covariates will be systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), and Glasgow Coma Scale&#xD;
      (GCS), recorded in the emergency department after arrival; as well as sex, age, mechanism of&#xD;
      injury, anatomical injury severity quantified using the injury severity score (ISS) and delay&#xD;
      between injury and arrival at participating centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the outcome was extracted from the patients' records, as were the explanatory&#xD;
      variable, vital signs, and time data. Data on sex, age, and mechanism of injury was provided&#xD;
      by participants or extracted from records. ISS was calculated by a single accredited coder&#xD;
      based on injury descriptors extracted from patient records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project officers all held Master's degrees in the health sciences and were trained and&#xD;
      supervised continuously throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimation of the propensity score is expected to be the most data-intensive part of this&#xD;
      study. Because the propensity score will be based on a multivariable model with the&#xD;
      explanatory variable as a dichotomous dependent variable the sample size is based on the&#xD;
      requirements of such models. Simulation studies show a need for at least ten events, but&#xD;
      during some circumstances as much as 20 events, per parameter in the most complex model to&#xD;
      achieve reliable coefficient estimates. An event in this case refers to a patient undergoing&#xD;
      CT. Counting all covariates, and allowing systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR) and&#xD;
      age to be non-linearly associated with mortality by non-linear transformations such as&#xD;
      restricted cubic splines with three knots, the total number of parameters in the most complex&#xD;
      model would be 16. Using 20 events per parameter the required number of events would be 320.&#xD;
      Assuming that 20% underwent CT within 24 hours from arrival to participating centre, the&#xD;
      minimum required sample size would be 1600 observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative variables will be described as continuous. In estimating the propensity score&#xD;
      quantitative variables will be treated according to the techniques included in the ensemble&#xD;
      library, which may entail dichotomization but also non-linear transformations, for example&#xD;
      using splines or fractional polynomials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical language R will be used for all analyses. Sample characteristics will be&#xD;
      described using medians and inter-quartile ranges (IQR) for quantitative variables and counts&#xD;
      and percentages for qualitative variables. To assess if undergoing CT is associated with a&#xD;
      survival benefit two analyses will be undertaken. First, the crude absolute risk reduction&#xD;
      will be estimated by calculating the difference in mortality between patients undergoing CT&#xD;
      and those who did not. Second, a propensity score will be estimated using an ensemble machine&#xD;
      learning algorithm such as the Super Learner. The propensity score will be an estimate of the&#xD;
      probability that a patient underwent CT, and will be built based on the covariates detailed&#xD;
      above. The R package MatchIt, or similar, will then be used to identify pairs of observations&#xD;
      that had very similar propensity scores, but that differed in whether the patients underwent&#xD;
      CT. The adjusted absolute risk reduction will then be calculated as the difference in&#xD;
      mortality between those who underwent CT and those who did not, keeping only paired&#xD;
      observations. In formally testing the difference between the two proportions, 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals and a 5% significance level will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three sensitivity analyses will be conducted. In the first sensitivity analysis patients who&#xD;
      died or were discharged within 24 hours of arrival will be excluded from that analysis to&#xD;
      assess whether excluding patients who never had time to reach the CT affect the association.&#xD;
      In the second sensitivity analysis patients with a time between injury and arrival to&#xD;
      participating hospital that exceeded 24 hours will be excluded. Finally, in the third&#xD;
      sensitivity analysis both patients arriving later than 24 hours after injury and patients who&#xD;
      died or were discharged within 24 hours after arrival will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy to handle missing data&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the sample size requirement is reached if only patients with complete data on the outcome,&#xD;
      explanatory variable, and covariates are included then a complete case analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted. If the sample size requirement is not reached with a complete case analysis then&#xD;
      missing data will be handled employing multiple imputation using chained equations. If so,&#xD;
      the number of imputed datasets will be equal to the percentage of incomplete observations.&#xD;
      The analyses will be conducted separately in each imputed dataset and the main result&#xD;
      reported as the median and IQR across imputations.&#xD;
