  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decreased muscle mass (sarcopenia) and strength (dynapenia) are common during aging, with a&#xD;
      rate of muscle mass loss that is approximately 6% per decade between 30 and 70 years of age.&#xD;
      Muscle mass loss results in reduced strength and physical function (frailty), increased risk&#xD;
      for falls and bone fractures, and decreased quality of life. The age-related decrease in&#xD;
      testosterone plays a key role in the loss of muscle mass and strength for aging males. There&#xD;
      is increasing interest in nutritional and exercise strategies to prevent aging-related losses&#xD;
      in muscle mass and strength. Sexual dysfunction has a high prevalence among men (31%), and&#xD;
      include erectile difficulties (10%), lack of interest in sex (9%), and inability to achieve&#xD;
      orgasm (7%). There are multiple causes including low testosterone. There is growing interest&#xD;
      in natural supplements, and this study will compare under double blind procedures two natural&#xD;
      supplements with placebo (Men's Perfect Multi Formula and Andro Vitality) that have been&#xD;
      formulated by Purity Products. The supplements contain micronutrients, plant extracts, and&#xD;
      herbs, with the primary bioactives Rhaponticum carthamoides and magnesium. Rhaponticum&#xD;
      carthamoides, commonly known as maral root or Russian leuzea, is a perennial herb that grows&#xD;
      in South Siberia, and has been used to enhance muscular and sexual function, but more&#xD;
      evidence from properly designed human trials is needed to determine both efficacy and safety.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study using a randomized, parallel group design, is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of two supplements relative to placebo on strength, serum free and total testosterone&#xD;
      levels, sexual function, mood state, and quality of life compared to placebo over a 6-week&#xD;
      period in 120 males.&#xD;

      STUDY PARTICIPANT RECRUITMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited via mass advertising in the Charlotte Metropolitan area. Healthy&#xD;
      subjects will be screened during recruitment to determine study eligibility (via email and&#xD;
      phone). The Charlotte metropolitan area is the largest in the Carolinas, and the sixth&#xD;
      largest metropolitan area in the Southeastern region of the United States. Male participants&#xD;
      40 to 70 years of age will be selected who match the listed inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      (next page). The planned distribution of participants by racial/ethnic groups will reflect&#xD;
      the demographics of the metropolitan area [White non-Hispanic (60%), Black non-Hispanic&#xD;
      (24%), Hispanic (10%), and Asian or Pacific Islander non-Hispanic (3.5%)]. Those subjects who&#xD;
      meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomized into the study. The study duration for each subject will be 6 weeks. There will be&#xD;
      a total of 3 visits for this study. Following recruitment, there will be a 2-week washout&#xD;
      period for PDE5 medications. At each of the three morning visits (7:00-9:00 am), subjects&#xD;
      will fill in the symptom log (retrospective 3-week period) and have their blood drawn to&#xD;
      analyze serum levels of free and total testosterone, and to be tested for strength (isometric&#xD;
      hand grip, leg/lower back, YMCA bench press) and body composition (8-point bioelectrical&#xD;
      impedance). All subjects will be required to fast overnight for at least 9 hours prior to&#xD;
      each visit. Subjects will also be required to abstain from all vigorous exercise and sexual&#xD;
      activity at least 24-hours prior to each visit. Within three days prior to each lab visit,&#xD;
      subjects will use Survey Monkey via the Internet to fill in responses to three&#xD;
      questionnaires: CSFQ, WHO-QOL, and POMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PLAN A. V1 - Baseline Visit - Week 0 Prior to the first lab visit, subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited according to the listed inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects who agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study, will be sent the Informed Consent Document (ICD) for review and&#xD;
      signature. Subjects will fill in the Medical Health Questionnaire (MHQ) via Survey Monkey to&#xD;
      obtain demographic, lifestyle, and medical histories. Following recruitment, there will be a&#xD;
      2-week washout period for PDE5 medications. Within three days prior to the first lab visit,&#xD;
      subjects will supply responses to the CSFQ, WHO-QOL, and POMS Questionnaires via Survey&#xD;
      Monkey. The compensation contract will be reviewed and signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed Consent: At the first lab visit (V1), all subjects will review the Informed&#xD;
           Consent Document (ICD) that was previously sent via email attachment, and receive a&#xD;
           signed copy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires: Responses to the CSFQ, WHO-QOL, and POMS questionnaires sent prior to&#xD;
           the first lab visit via Survey Monkey will be reviewed for completeness. Subjects will&#xD;
           fill in the symptom log.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Sample: Subjects will have their blood drawn for analysis of free and total&#xD;
           testosterone. Subjects will be asked to come in to the clinic during the early morning&#xD;
           having fasted for at least 9 hours prior to the visit and refrained from having sexual&#xD;
           intercourse 24 hours prior to the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric and Strength Measures: Subjects will be measured for height and weight,&#xD;
           and percent body fat using 8-point BIA. Handgrip and leg/lower back strength will be&#xD;
           assessed with dynamometers (Figure 3). Subjects will also be tested for upper body&#xD;
           strength using the YMCA bench press test (reps with 80-pound barbell set with a&#xD;
           metronome for 30 lifts per minute).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization and Study Product Dispensing: Subjects will be assigned a randomization&#xD;
           number, and receive a 3 week supply of the study product. The study product will be&#xD;
           contained in supplement trays with specific dates and instructions applied. Subjects&#xD;
           must return the supplement trays at the next two lab visits to verify compliance with&#xD;
           the dosing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. V2 -Mid-Study Visit (Week 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retrieval Procedures: Subjects will return their supplement tray and any unused study&#xD;
           product.&#xD;
&#xD;

           interviewed by the clinic staff to determine whether there have been any changes in&#xD;
           their medical history, whether they have started taking any new medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires: Responses to the CSFQ, WHO-QOL, and POMS questionnaires sent within&#xD;
           3-days prior to the second visit via Survey Monkey will be reviewed for completeness.&#xD;
           Subjects will fill in the symptom log (3 week retrospective).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Sample: Subjects will have their blood drawn for analysis of free and total&#xD;
           testosterone. Subjects will be asked to come in to the clinic during the early morning&#xD;
           having fasted for at least 9 hours prior to the visit and refrained from having sexual&#xD;
           intercourse and all exercise 24 hours prior to the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric and Strength Measures: Subjects will be measured for weight, and percent&#xD;
           body fat using 8-point BIA. Handgrip and leg/lower back strength will be assessed with&#xD;
           dynamometers, and upper body strength with the YMCA bench press test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Product Dispensing: Subjects will receive their final 3-week supply of the study&#xD;
           supplements. Subjects must return the supplement tray at the final lab visit to verify&#xD;

&#xD;
      D. Investigational Study Products Formula 1 - a Men's Perfect Multi Formula boosted by extra&#xD;
      Magnesium and key vitamins and co-factors. 4 tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formula 2 - an Herbal blend - we're naming &quot;AndroVitality&quot; with Rhaponticum, Rhododendron&#xD;
      caucasicum, 180 mg magnesium, 10 zinc and 2000 IU vitamin D. 4 tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INSTRUCTIONS: Take 4 capsules daily, with water on an empty stomach. If the study participant&#xD;
      reports that they get an upset stomach from ingesting the capsules, they will be allowed to&#xD;
      consume a small snack. The investigators will store the study product in a locked cabinet in&#xD;
      a limited access room, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, i.e. in a dry&#xD;
      place and at room temperature. Purity Products will provide the ASU-NCRC Human Performance&#xD;
      Lab with sufficient study product to complete this study. The supplements and placebo&#xD;
      product, will be supplied to the Primary Investigator (DCN) in boxes using A, B, and C codes&#xD;
      so that both the investigators and the subjects will be blinded regarding the type of&#xD;
      supplement being ingested. Supplement trays will be given to each subject, and will contain&#xD;
      labels with the following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study code number&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient number&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Directions of use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Storage instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Concomitant Medication Prohibited Medications and Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following products and interventions are not permitted while the subject is in this&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      · No erectile dysfunction medications or dietary supplements containing ingredients&#xD;
      advertised for influences on sexual function or testosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Data Analysis and Statistical Methods Data will be entered into an Excel worksheet under&#xD;
      the direction of the Primary Investigator (DCN) and the Research Manager. Data statistical&#xD;
      analysis (with identifier information deleted) will be conducted by Drs. Nieman, Canu, and&#xD;
      Broman-Fulks. The basic statistical model will be a 3 (group) x 3 (time) repeated measures&#xD;
      ANOVA within the SPSS Generalized Linear Model (GLM). Subjects will be randomized in equal&#xD;
      numbers to one of three groups: two supplement groups; Placebo. The blinding code will be&#xD;
      created by Purity Products and stored in a locked cabinet, and provided to the Primary&#xD;
      Investigator AFTER all data have been collected. The file linking ID numbers and names of&#xD;
      study participants will be stored at uStor, the secure storage site for Appalachian State&#xD;
      University (http://ustorcloud.appstate.edu). Analysis and interpretation of data from the&#xD;
      CSFQ, WHO-QOL, and POMS questionnaires will be under the direction of clinical psychologists&#xD;
      Drs. Canu and Broman-Fulks. Prior to the initiation of the study, this protocol including the&#xD;
      informed consent form will be submitted to the ASU IRB and the trial will not start until&#xD;
      unconditional approval is received. All guidelines from the ASU IRB for protection of&#xD;
      personal data will be followed. The Primary Investigator will assign a subject number to each&#xD;
      subject that will be used for identification whenever subject related data are recorded for&#xD;
      the sponsor or reported. Subjects who are randomized, but drop out prior to completing the&#xD;
      study will be recorded. A record of reasons why subjects drop out of the study will be&#xD;
      maintained. After data analysis the Primary Investigator will summarize the results in a&#xD;
      final report which accurately reflects the clinical data of this study.&#xD;
