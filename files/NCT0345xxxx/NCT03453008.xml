  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following a stroke , 55% of the patients do not recover any traction of the upper limb and&#xD;
      30% a residual motricity not allowing a functional grip. For this last group of patients,&#xD;
      there are major therapeutic issues to restore a functional grip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to relieved the spastic cocontractions before and after usual&#xD;
      injection of botulinum toxin A at stroke patient.&#xD;

      Descriptive study of spastic cocontraction index before and after botulinum toxin A&#xD;
      injections during active elbow extension in chronic vascular hemiplegic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spastic cocontraction score will be compared between T1 (before the Botulinum toxin A&#xD;
      injection) and T2 (4 weeks after the botulinum toxin A injection in the elbow flexors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no control group. The patient is his own witness: the non-paretic side is considered&#xD;
      as the physiological reference in terms of the level of spastic cocontractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin A injections are performed in routine clinical practice in the Physical&#xD;
      Medicine and Rehabilitation Department, following the recommendations in force. This&#xD;
      treatment has been shown to be effective on spasticity in several high-level studies. The&#xD;
      reduction of spasticity, evaluated clinically (Tardieu and Ashworth scale), is a criterion of&#xD;
      efficacy of botulinum toxin A injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the effectiveness of botulinum toxin A injections on the other components&#xD;
      of muscular hyperactivity, such as the reduction of spastic cocontraction during active&#xD;
      movements, is poorly performed in clinical and clinical research. This protocol includes&#xD;
      specific assessments to evaluate the evolution of spastic cocontraction.&#xD;

    <measure>Limitation of Active Motion Angle Elbow Extension</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Limitation of Active Motion Angle (LAMA) is the clinical measure of the consequences of a spastic cocontraction in a patient. To calculate it, we subtract the maximum elbow extension angle obtained during the PASSIVE stretch of the muscles at the maximum elbow extension angle obtained during a voluntary ACTIVE contraction. As part of the protocol, the LAMA will be instrumentally measured with the 3D kinematic system (Optitrack).&#xD;
This data is expressed in gross value (in degrees) or in percentage (depending on the maximum amplitude obtained during passive stretching).</description>

    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Motor Function Assessment (FMA-Motor), based on the motor recovery scheme described by Brunnstrom (1975), is a scale of evaluation of voluntary reference motor function in the cerebral adult, often used in research and development in clinical practice. The FMA-Motor part of the upper limb is rated 66. It has high validity, reliability and sensitivity to change.</description>

    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Functional abilities with the Wolf Motor Function Test validated in more than 16 languages (including French) since 2013, is a standardized scale evaluating upper limb capacities in cerebral palsy adults. Originally designed by Steven Wolf (1987) to quantify the effects of stress-induced therapy, this tool is often used in research protocols in the acute and chronic phase brain. The scale consists of performing 17 standardized tests, classified in order of increasing complexity, which solicit the proximal joints</description>

    <description>Two evaluations before the toxin injection (T0 and T1), to quantify cocontractions and to determine the toxin injection pattern.&#xD;
The first evaluation (T0) will be carried out within a period of between 1 month and 15 days before the injection. This evaluation makes it possible to pose the indication for the realization of injection of Botulinum Toxin A (TBA).&#xD;
The second evaluation (T1) will be performed on the day of the injection to specify the muscle targets to be injected.&#xD;
The first evaluation is a Clinical evaluation and second is Instrumental evaluation</description>
