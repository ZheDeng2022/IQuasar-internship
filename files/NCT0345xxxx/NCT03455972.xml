  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CART therapy has showed good safety and efficacy in treatment of lymphoma and acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia. Researchers want to see if this helps people with high risk multiple&#xD;
      myeloma after auto-HSCT.To test the safety and efficacy of giving targeting CD19 and BCMA T&#xD;
      cells in treating high risk multiple myeloma followed with auto-HSCT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Adults ages 18-75 with high risk Multiple Myelomas (R-ISS III stage or with extramedullary&#xD;
      infiltration or with del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), 1q21+ or disease progression&#xD;
      during treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history Physical exam Blood and urine tests Heart tests Bone marrow sample Multiple&#xD;
      scans and X-rays Participants will have apheresis. Blood is removed through a needle in an&#xD;
      arm. T cells are removed. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cells will be changed in a laboratory. Participants will get auto-HSCT. Hematopoietic&#xD;
      reconstitution after auto-HSCT, participants will get the T cells through the IV within 3&#xD;
      days. Maintenance therapy with IMiDs was received after combined CAR T infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this, participants will stay in the hospital for at least 9 days and stay nearby for 2&#xD;
      weeks. Then they will have blood tests and see a doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the clinic 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the infusion, then every&#xD;
      3 months until disease progression. A bone marrow sample will be taken at the 3-month visit.&#xD;
