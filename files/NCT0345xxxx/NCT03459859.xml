  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the combination of Pevonedistat/Low-Dose Cytarabine (LDAC)&#xD;
      therapy will be tolerable, that a recommended phase 2 dose of Pevonedistat in combination&#xD;
      with LDAC will be identified, and that the combination therapy will show evidence of clinical&#xD;
      activity in adult patients with Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) and&#xD;
      Advanced Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS).&#xD;
