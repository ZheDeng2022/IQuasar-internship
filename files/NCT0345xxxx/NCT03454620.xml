    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of GC1118 in combination&#xD;
      with irinotecan or FOLFIRI in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)&#xD;

      A Phse 1b/2a, dose-finding, open-label, prospective study&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of the Phase 1b part designed to determine the MTD and RP2D of GC1118&#xD;
      when administered in combination with irinotecan or FOLFIRI to patients with recurrent&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumors and the Phase 2a part designed to assess the efficacy of GC1118 in&#xD;
      combination with FOLFIRI as second-line therapy for recurrent/metastatic colorectal cancer&#xD;
