      This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label, phase III trial in patients with&#xD;
      biopsy-proven prostate cancer. Patients will receive regular standard of clinical care. The&#xD;
      only study-specific procedures will the administration of 18F-DCFPyL followed by a PET/CT&#xD;
      scan. Differences in theoretical optimal clinical management based on a review of clinical,&#xD;
      biochemical and radiographic subject data before and after 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging by a&#xD;
      central panel of experts will be captured at study completion.&#xD;

      Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to assess the differences in theoretical&#xD;
      optimal clinical management afforded by 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in prostate cancer patients as&#xD;
      proposed by a central panel of experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Differences in theoretical optimal clinical management based on a review of clinical,&#xD;
      histopathological, biochemical and radiographic subject data both before and after 18F-DCFPyL&#xD;
      PET/CT imaging retrospectively by a central panel of experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan positivity fraction in patients with biochemically recurrent&#xD;
           prostate cancer, stratified by PSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Immediate AE up to 90 minutes post-administration of 18F-DCFPyL.&#xD;
