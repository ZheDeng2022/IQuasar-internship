  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed as a prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing&#xD;
      arthroscopic Bankart repair and Remplissage with an open Latarjet coracoid transfer for the&#xD;
      treatment of recurrent anterior glenohumeral instability with subcritical bone loss.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presently, consensus guidelines for the surgical management of anterior glenohumeral&#xD;
      instability are lacking. While there has been continual evolution in available arthroscopic&#xD;
      instrumentation, this has not translated to improvements in patient outcomes. Isolated&#xD;
      arthroscopic bankart repair is often associated with unacceptably high rates of failure, with&#xD;
      a recent systematic review identifying continued recurrence rates of 14.2%. Improved&#xD;
      recognition of bone defects and identification of critical defect sizes that contribute to&#xD;
      recurrent instability and failed stabilization have lead to improvements in treatment&#xD;
      algorithms. It has been widely accepted that glenoid defects exceeding 20% of anteroposterior&#xD;
      (AP) width and humeral head defects exceeding 30% of the humeral head width contribute to&#xD;
      recurrent instability. For defects of this magnitude, isolated arthroscopic Bankart repair is&#xD;
      insufficient in restoring joint stability, and more extensive procedures are required. This&#xD;
      can include adding a remplissage to the arthroscopic Bankart repair or open allograft&#xD;
      reconstruction for humeral defects; or Latarjet coracoid transfer for glenoid defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, often patients present with combined 'bipolar' bone loss, where individual defects&#xD;
      are subcritical in size. There is increasing recognition that the presence of this combined&#xD;
      bone loss may lead to increased rates of failure with an isolated arthroscopic bankart&#xD;
      repair. Currently, accepted treatment options for bipolar bone loss include a combined&#xD;
      arthroscopic Bankart repair and remplissage, or a Latarjet coracoid transfer. While there is&#xD;
      supportive biomechanical data for each procedure, and limited case series in the literature,&#xD;
      there remains a paucity of high-quality evidence to guide treatment for this complex clinical&#xD;
      scenario. Consequently, we aim to perform a pilot study designed as a prospective, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial comparing arthroscopic Bankart repair and Remplissage with an open Latarjet&#xD;
      coracoid transfer.&#xD;

    <measure>Western Ontario Shoulder Instability (WOSI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Western Ontario Shoulder Instability (WOSI) questionnaire is a tool designed for self-assessment of shoulder function for patients with instability problems. Difference between study arm outcomes will be assessed using pre-op and post-op WOSI score as a covariate.&#xD;
This questionnaire has 21 questions, each scored on a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 being the best score (no limitations related to the shoulder) and 100 representing the worst score.&#xD;
Overall, the questionnaire is scored as a percentage of the maximum score of 2100 points.&#xD;
There are subscale components reporting on: physical symptoms (questions 1 through 10; maximum score of 1000); sports/recreation/work (questions 11 through 14; maximum score 400); lifestyle (questions 15 through 18; maximum score 400); and emotion (questions 19-21; maximum score 300).&#xD;
Subscale scores are added to determine the total score out of a possible 2100 points, with 2100, or 100%, representing the worst possible score.</description>

    <measure>Simple Shoulder Test (SST)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Simple Shoulder Test (SST) is a series of 12 &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; questions the patient answers about the function of the involved shoulder. The answers to these questions provides a standardized way of recording the function of a shoulder before and after treatment. Differences between study arm outcomes will be assessed using pre-op SST scores as a covariate</description>
