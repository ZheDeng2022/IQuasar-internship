  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will examine the benefit of this amino acid based hydration solution in&#xD;
      patients with IBD who have undergone a total colectomy and have either ileostomies or&#xD;
      jpouches. Findings from this study and possible future studies could have broad implications&#xD;
      for patients with malabsorption resulting from many underlying conditions, including IBD.&#xD;
