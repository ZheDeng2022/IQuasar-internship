  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that a gradual reduction in antihypertensive treatment in&#xD;
      nursing home (NH) patients with low systolic blood pressure (SBP) can improve survival&#xD;
      through a controlled increase in SBP and a decrease in secondary morbidity due to&#xD;
      'overmedication'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the investigators propose a randomized, case/control trial in NH patients ≥ 80&#xD;
      years with a SBP&lt;130 mmHg with &gt;1 anti-Htn drugs. This trial will consist of two parallel&#xD;
      arms: the intervention arm will entail antihypertensive drug step-down, while the control arm&#xD;
      will comprise the standard anti-hypertensive treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure (BP), principally systolic hypertension, is a common condition in older&#xD;
      people and is considered a major determinant not only of cardiovascular morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, but also of several other age-related diseases, including frailty, cognitive&#xD;
      decline and loss of autonomy. The Hypertension in the Very Elderly Treatment (HYVET) study&#xD;
      showed the beneficial effect of antihypertensive treatment in patients ≥ 80 years. More&#xD;
      recently, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) study showed that even in&#xD;
      subjects 75 years and older, CVD outcomes and total mortality were reduced with intensive&#xD;
      treatment as compared to the standard therapeutic strategies. However, both HYVET and SPRINT&#xD;
      were conducted in selected populations since they excluded the most frail subjects, those&#xD;
      with clinically significant cognitive decline and dementia, those with several cardiovascular&#xD;
      and other co-morbidities, as well as patients living in nursing homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interestingly, observational studies in these frail people, have shown no or even an&#xD;
           inverse relationship between BP and morbidity and mortality. The PARTAGE longitudinal&#xD;
           study was performed in 1130 subjects ≥ 80 years living in nursing homes (NHs). These&#xD;
           subjects were receiving at mean 7.1 drugs/day; 2/3 of them were under antihypertensive&#xD;
           drugs (mean 2.2 drugs/day). The PARTAGE study showed an over-mortality in hypertensive&#xD;
           subjects with low SBP (&lt;130 mmHg) treated with 2 or more antihypertensive drugs. These&#xD;
           individuals, who represented 20% of the total studied population, exhibited 80% increase&#xD;
           in mortality compared to all other groups, even after adjustment for several&#xD;
           comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The recent European guidelines for hypertension indicate that in people ≥ 80 years with&#xD;
           SBP≥160 mmHg there is evidence to recommend reducing SBP to between 150 and 140 mmHg.&#xD;
           However, no recommendation exists on which strategy to follow if treatment decreases SBP&#xD;
           to lower levels (ex: 120 mmHg) especially on the more frail and polymedicated patients&#xD;
           of that age. Thus, in this case, physicians can either continue the same treatment of&#xD;
           reduce the number of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These contrasting results in old hypertensives reflects the enormous functional&#xD;
           heterogeneity among individual of this age-group and clearly show that functional status&#xD;
           rather than chronological age should guide therapeutic strategies. Thus, the guidelines&#xD;
           for robust older individuals cannot be extrapolated to very old, frail individuals, who&#xD;
           have been completely excluded from the above-mentioned clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only way is to conduct a controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
