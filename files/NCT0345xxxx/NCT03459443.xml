    <measure>Change From Baseline In Composite Biopsy Score At End Of Initial 12-Month Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of initial 12-Month Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>The composite biopsy score was based on a score incorporating changes in the activity index, glomerular C3c staining, and glomerular macrophage infiltration at the end of the initial 12-month Treatment Period. The scores from the 3 elements (activity index, glomerular C3c staining, and glomerular macrophage infiltration) added together provided a single composite biopsy score, ranging from 0 to 21. Higher scores indicated worse outcomes.</description>

             opinion of the principal investigator (PI), and present prior to study entry and&#xD;
             confirmed during Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If on corticosteroids, anti-hypertensive medications, anti-proteinuric medications&#xD;

             or hematopoietic stem cell/marrow transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a history or presence of any clinically relevant co- morbidities that would make&#xD;
             the participant inappropriate for the study (for example, a comorbidity which is&#xD;
             likely to result in deterioration of the participant's condition, affect the&#xD;
             participant's safety during the study, or confound the results of the study), in the&#xD;
             opinion of the PI&#xD;
&#xD;

             any time over the preceding 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Is a renal transplant recipient or receiving renal replacement therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have other renal diseases that would interfere with interpretation of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have evidence of monoclonal gammopathy of unclear significance, infections,&#xD;
             malignancy, autoimmune diseases, or other conditions to which C3G or IC-MPGN is&#xD;
             secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have been diagnosed with or show evidence of hepatobiliary cholestasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Females who are pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant during the study or&#xD;
             within 90 days of danicopan administration or participants with a female partner who&#xD;
             is pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant during the study or within 90&#xD;
             days of danicopan administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Have a history of febrile illness, a body temperature &gt;38°Celsius, or other evidence&#xD;
             of a clinically significant active infection, within 14 days prior to danicopan&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have evidence of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B infection, or active&#xD;

             cephalosporins, and carbapenems, which, in the opinion of the investigator and/or an&#xD;
             appropriately qualified immunology or infectious disease expert, would make it&#xD;
             difficult to properly provide either empiric antibiotic therapy or treat an active&#xD;
             infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Have participated in a clinical study in which an investigational drug was given&#xD;
             within 30 days, or within 5 half-lives of the investigational drug, whichever is&#xD;
             longer, prior to the first dose of danicopan&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Have received eculizumab at any dose or interval within the past 50 days prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of danicopan&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Have a 12-lead echocardiogram (ECG) with a QTcF &gt;450 millisecond (msec) for males or&#xD;
             &gt;470 msec for females, or have ECG findings which, in the opinion of the PI, could put&#xD;
             the participant at undue risk&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Have received any drug known to prolong the QTc interval within 2 weeks of the first&#xD;

             undue risk&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Have any of the following laboratory abnormalities at screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alanine transaminase &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase &gt; ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil counts &lt;1,000/microliter&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &gt;1.5× ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Indirect bilirubin &gt; ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the PI, would make the&#xD;
                  participant inappropriate for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Are unwilling or unable to comply with the study protocol for any reason&#xD;
