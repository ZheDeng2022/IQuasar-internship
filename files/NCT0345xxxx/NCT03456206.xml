      Chronic inflammatory diseases (CID) - including inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease&#xD;
      and ulcerative colitis), rheumatic conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis,&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis), inflammatory skin diseases (psoriasis) and multiple sclerosis are&#xD;
      diseases of the immune system that have some shared genetic and environmental predisposing&#xD;
      factors, but still little is known on the effects of lifestyle as a prognostic factor on&#xD;
      disease risk. This observational study will contribute to preexisting research on lifestyle&#xD;
      factors by identifying diet factors associated with risk of developing CID, using prospective&#xD;
      register data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use data from all of the 57,053 participants in the Danish cohort &quot;Diet,&#xD;
      Health and Cancer (DHC)&quot; together with registry data. Blood samples, anthropometric measures&#xD;
      and questionnaire data on diet and lifestyle were collected at the DHC study entry. The&#xD;
      National Patient Registry (NPR) will be used to obtain to identify patients with CID during&#xD;
      follow-up. Follow-up information on death and immigration will be collected in March 2018&#xD;
      from the Danish Civil Registration Register.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome CID is defined as at least one of the following CIDs: Crohn's disease, ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis, psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis/ankylosing arthritis, or&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis, during the follow-up period from 1993 to March 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that &quot;the risk of CID will be significantly higher among those with&#xD;
      a low fibre/high red and processed meat intake compared to those with a high fibre/low red&#xD;
      and processed meat intake.&quot; Based on previous research on a shared etiology in CIDs a second&#xD;
      hypothesis is that &quot;the postulated causality between low fibre/high red and processed meat&#xD;
      intake and risk of developing CID is applicable for each of the CID-diagnoses.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The core study is an open register-based cohort study. The study does not need approval from&#xD;
      the local Ethics committee or Institutional Review Board by Danish law. The study was&#xD;
      approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (2012-58-0018) Study findings will be&#xD;
      disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, patient associations and presentations at&#xD;
      international conferences.&#xD;

      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a cohort study with prospective register data follow up. The Danish&#xD;
      cohort &quot;Diet, Health and Cancer&quot; (DHC) will be used. The DHC Study is an ongoing Danish&#xD;
      cohort study designed to investigate the relation between diet, lifestyle and disease risk.&#xD;
      The cohort consists of 57,053 persons, recruited between December 1993 and May 1997. All the&#xD;
      subjects (50 to 64 years of age) gave detailed information on diet (food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire) and other lifestyle data together with biological samples. Blood samples,&#xD;
      anthropometric measures and questionnaire data on diet and lifestyle were collected at study&#xD;
      entry. Data from the DHC cohort will be combined with Danish national registers (the National&#xD;
      Patient Registry (NPR), the Danish Civil Registration Register, and The Danish National&#xD;
      Prescription Registry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures and follow-up: The National Patient Registry (NPR) will be used to obtain to&#xD;
      identify patients with CID during follow-up. The NPR contains data on all patients admitted&#xD;
      to Danish hospitals since 1977. The register covers both inpatient and outpatient records and&#xD;
      indicates the main medical reason for diagnostic procedures or treatment (since 1994&#xD;
      according to the tenth version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)). For&#xD;
      this study there will be extracted data from NPR from 1993 to March 2018. The outcome CID is&#xD;
      defined as at least one of the following diseases in the NPR; inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
      (IBD) (ICD10 codes: K50-K51), psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis (ICD10 codes: M073, M090, L40),&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis/ankylosing arthritis (ICD10 codes: M059. M060, M069, M089, M459, M46),&#xD;
      or multiple sclerosis (ICD10 codes: G35, G35.9), during the follow-up period. The Danish&#xD;
      National Prescription Registry will be used to identify the most severe cases of the&#xD;
      following diseases listed above, as it is expected that the patients have medication in&#xD;
      relation to the diseases. Follow-up information on death and immigration will be collected in&#xD;
      March 2018 from the Danish Civil Registration Register.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure and possible confounders: Information on exposure is defined as high fibre intake&#xD;
      and high red and processed meat intake and were collected at enrolment of the DHC cohort&#xD;
      using questionnaires and interviews. In short, the food-frequency questionnaire, diet&#xD;
      consumption was assessed in 12 categories of predefined responses, ranking from &quot;never&quot; to&#xD;
      &quot;eight times or more per day&quot;. The daily intake was then calculated by the software program&#xD;
      FoodCalc. FoodCalc is a simple program to calculate intake of nutrients when given a list&#xD;
      with amounts of different foods consumed and another list with contents of nutrients for the&#xD;
      different foods. Both intake of dietary fibre and red meat and processed meat were measured&#xD;
      as continues variable in g/day. Information on possible confounders will also be obtained&#xD;
      from the questionnaire data at enrolment in relation to sex, age, BMI, smoking and other&#xD;
      lifestyle factors and information on co-morbidity will be obtained from NPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses: The intention is to use data obtained from this prospective cohort&#xD;
      study to explore the ability to predict risk of CID (Y=primary endpoint) and to explore&#xD;
      whether diets low in fibre AND high in red and processed meat (X=assessed at baseline) are an&#xD;
      informative prognostic factor on disease risk. Descriptive analyses for categorical variables&#xD;
      will be presented as frequencies, and differences between CID cases and non-cases will be&#xD;
      evaluated by Chi-square test. Continuous variables will be tabulated as medians (with&#xD;
      quartiles, Q1 and Q3) and nonparametric tests on the equality of medians will be used to test&#xD;
      for differences between groups. P-values below 0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant. Negative binomial regression will be applied to calculate incidence rates per&#xD;
      1000 patient years and incidence rate ratios (IRR) between exposures. To investigate the risk&#xD;
      of and time to CID-diagnosis the Fine-Gray competing risk regression model will be applied,&#xD;
      and thus competing risk of death will be taken into account while handling emigration as&#xD;
      censoring, and reporting cumulative incidences and sub-hazard ratios (SHR) and the&#xD;
      corresponding p-values for CID associated with specified food substitutions. Regressions will&#xD;
      be carried out as both crude regression, only including the exposure, and adjusted for age,&#xD;
      sex, lifestyle factors and selected comorbidities. Analyses will be conducted using Stata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if the hypothesized causality between diet factors and development of CID is&#xD;
      applicable for all of the CIDs there will be conducted subanalyses on each of the&#xD;
      CID-diagnoses. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted on data from the Danish National&#xD;
      Prescription Registry to evaluate the validity of the CID diagnoses, as it is expected that&#xD;
      they get treatment in relation to the diseases. Data on medication and treatment of each&#xD;
      diagnosis will be analysed separately.&#xD;
