  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to understand the effect of a caffeine intake, sleep habits, anxiety&#xD;
      about surgery, alcohol intake and smoking status upon the dose of the anaesthetic drug,&#xD;
      propofol, required for anaesthetic induction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesise that modifiable environmental factors may cause reversible&#xD;
      changes in a patients neurobiology which affect their responsiveness to anaesthetic drugs.&#xD;
      Such factors may include chronic caffeine intake, chronic sleep deprivation, acute anxiety&#xD;
      about surgery, alcohol intake and smoking. Investigation of the relationship between such&#xD;
      factors and the dose of anaesthetic required for loss of consciousness may not only allow for&#xD;
      better prediction of dose requirements but may also allow for optimisation of patients prior&#xD;
      to undergoing general anaesthesia with a view to decreasing anaesthetic dose requirements and&#xD;
      the complications associated with this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this questions, the investigators will be asking patients admitted for any day&#xD;
      case surgery at Chelsea &amp; Westminster hospital to complete five short questionnaires and a&#xD;
      demographic sheet addressing 1) Caffeine intake 2) Sleep habits 3) Anxiety about the&#xD;
      operation 4) Alcohol intake 5) Smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will then be compared to the amount of the anaesthetic drug Propofol required and the&#xD;
      time taken to induce loss of consciousness prior to surgery. Loss of consciousness will be&#xD;
      measured subjectively by loss of eye opening response and loss of verbal response when a&#xD;
      patient is asked to count upwards from 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also wish to investigate whether these same 5 factors affect patient&#xD;
      reported postoperative pain and analgesia requirements. As such the investigators will also&#xD;
      ask participants to rate their level of pain whilst at rest and whilst coughing at 1 hour&#xD;
      after the operation. We will also record how much analgesia is requested and received in the&#xD;
      postoperative period.&#xD;
