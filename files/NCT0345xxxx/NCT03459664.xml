    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a cross sectional, severity stepped, evidence-based care model for&#xD;
      patients with mental disorders (RECOVER).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECOVER is a consortium of well-known institutions for the treatment and integrated care of&#xD;
      patients with mental disorders, patient associations, relative associations, research&#xD;
      institutions, health care insurances and authorities from the care region Hamburg, Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to evaluate the RECOVER care model with treatment as usual (TAU) regarding&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness (costs, efficiency and cost utility) for patients with mental disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following questions are examined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does RECOVER reduce psychiatric health care costs compared to TAU?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does RECOVER improve patient relevant outcomes (i.e. symptom remission, response, daily&#xD;
           functioning and quality of life)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is RECOVER cost effective compared to TAU? (from a payer's and societal perspective)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total sample of 890 patients with mental disorders will be assessed at baseline (before&#xD;
      treatment) and randomized into the RECOVER care model or get TAU. Follow-up assessments are&#xD;
      conducted after 6 month and 12 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As primary outcomes, cost reduction, improvement in symptoms (i.e. amount of remission and&#xD;
      response to treatment, daily functioning and quality of life) and cost-efficiency-ratios will&#xD;
      be measured. In addition, several secondary outcome parameters will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: The present randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluates the cross-sectional, severity&#xD;
      stepped, evidence-based approach of the RECOVER model in patients with mental disorders. With&#xD;
      its focus on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, the study aims to improve the health care&#xD;
      system in Germany.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited from regular care settings (in-patient and out-patient&#xD;
      services, general practitioners, psychotherapists) and via the RECOVER homepage. Upon&#xD;
      fulfillment of the inclusion criteria and after having obtained informed consent,&#xD;
      participants will undergo a complex baseline psychiatric diagnostic assessment, including&#xD;
      among other measures the global assessment of functioning (GAF), severity of illness (CGI-S)&#xD;
      and specification of diagnosis (SCID I and SCID II). Based on these three instruments,&#xD;
      participants will be divided into four degrees severity: Grade 1 = mild, Grade 2 = medium,&#xD;
      Grade 3 = medium to high, Grade 4 = severe mental disorder. Accordingly, there will be four&#xD;
      strata of similar sample sizes (planned n=268, including 30% drop out rate; see power&#xD;
      analysis below). Each participant will then be randomized either to the RECOVER treatment&#xD;
      condition or the treatment as usual (TAU) condition. Randomization will be conducted by an&#xD;
      independent person not involved in the RCT or diagnostic assessment, who will receive the&#xD;
      pseudonymised participant ID and stratum number. A previously with the STATA 14 program&#xD;
      defined list will be used to achieve randomization. When the planned sample size per stratum&#xD;
      is achieved, no further patients will be included in this stratum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a complete list of measures, please refer to outcome measures section. In addition,&#xD;
      secondary data will be obtained from external data owners, essential for the achievement of&#xD;
      RECOVER's research objective - the determination of health costs. These include personal&#xD;
      patient-related data such as data from health insurances companies (e.g. data from inpatient&#xD;
      and outpatient medical services, rehabilitation services, transport, medical aid, drug/&#xD;
      medication data, home assistance and care services, work disability and sickness benefit/&#xD;
      allowance data). These will be inquired from the health insurance for the years 2016 to 2021&#xD;
      at the 12-month point in time and continuously assessed within the quality assurance study.&#xD;
      Subsequently, a monetary valuation is carried out using standardized monetary valuation&#xD;
      rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse events (SAE) will be documented from the first contact (i.e. registry)&#xD;
      between patient and study staff and will be included in the participant's record. A copy of&#xD;
      each SAE protocol will be directly forwarded to the study's central management. Each SAE is&#xD;
      assessed in terms of its causal relationship between the event and the study procedures&#xD;
      (&quot;&quot;serious undesirable, study-related event&quot;). For each SAE, the SAE protocol must be filled&#xD;
      in (with pseudonymised data only) and will be immediately discussed with the study&#xD;
      management, who will check the protocol for plausibility and completeness and evaluate the&#xD;
      event. Events that have not yet been formally completed are tracked. If the undesired event&#xD;
      has been resolved, a final documentation is provided on the SAE protocol. The executive&#xD;
      committee is informed by the study management and asked for an assessment. If all assessments&#xD;
      have shown that the suspected case is an SAE, all study staff will be informed by the study&#xD;
      management immediately, but at the latest within 7 days of notification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is based on a power calculation to detect a statistically significant&#xD;
      difference between the intervention (RECOVER) vs. standard care (TAU) in order to yield a&#xD;
      small to medium standardized mean difference between the groups (Cohen's f of 0.175) after 12&#xD;
      months. At a power of at least 80% with a type 1 error rate of 5%, 2-sided testing and 10% of&#xD;
      declared variance due to baseline, at least 233 study participants are required. For testing&#xD;
      hypotheses involving the interaction of intervention and stratification subgroup, sample size&#xD;
      increases to n=383. Diagnostics and therapy are carried out in approx. 50 clusters with&#xD;
      approx. 21 participants each and an intraclass correlation (ICC) of .05 is assumed for the&#xD;
      primary, continuous outcome. This results in a design effect of approximately 2.0 and a total&#xD;
      sample size of 890 patients (including 30% dropout). With an estimated participation rate of&#xD;
      50%, 2140 patients must be addressed for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be supervised by the local Department of Medical Biometry and&#xD;
      Epidemiology. The analysis of primary and secondary outcome data is performed according to&#xD;
      the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. Missing values for the follow-up time points will be&#xD;
      accounted for within mixed linear and logistic regression models. For sensitivity analyses,&#xD;
      missing values will be replaced by multiple imputation and per-protocol (PP) analyses. The&#xD;
      analysis of therapy utilization and productivity losses is performed descriptively as well as&#xD;
      with difference-in-difference regressions (to analyze the measured costs over time). In&#xD;
      addition, multivariate analyses will be carried out. Remission and response data are analyzed&#xD;
      using logistic regression, while remission (non-clinical, i.e., performance under critical&#xD;
      cut-off) and response (i.e. reduction in symptom severity of 50%) are specifically determined&#xD;
      for each psychiatric condition during follow-up as compared to the baseline measurement.&#xD;
      Changes in symptoms, level of functioning and health associated quality of life are analyzed&#xD;
      with difference-in-difference-regression. To estimate cost efficiency, incremental&#xD;
      cost-efficiency-relation (ICER) is calculated. To estimate the ICER's uncertainty,&#xD;
      cost-efficiency-acceptance-curves based on net-benefit-regressions are calculated. All&#xD;
      secondary outcome parameters are descriptively investigated as well as using multivariate&#xD;
      analyses (e.g. logistic regression, difference-in-difference-regression). To assess&#xD;
      inhibiting and promoting factors for the RECOVER model, qualitative measures are applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study data are immediately entered into a database. To minimize input errors, all data&#xD;
      are entered by two different staff members independently. During data entry, integrity checks&#xD;
      are performed to minimize input errors. These tests are carried out on the basis of a data&#xD;
      validation plan and are countersigned by the head of study and the study statistician. The&#xD;
      data input system enables continuous quality control of the input process via integrated&#xD;
      inspection functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the data entry, the access rights to the database are cancelled and the&#xD;
      database is exported to the data transformation system. There, final plausibility checks are&#xD;
      carried out and the data are checked for consistency and completeness. Missing values and&#xD;
      inconsistencies are reported back to the examiner and processed by the person responsible. As&#xD;
      soon as all corrections have been completed, the database is closed and transferred to the&#xD;
      study statistician. All data entries, modifications or deletions are logged. All data (i.e.&#xD;
      completed questionnaires, database) will be protected against unauthorized access, i.e. by&#xD;
      physical locking in steel cabinets or secured by a system of individual access&#xD;
      authorizations. In accordance with the principles of good clinical practice, all study data&#xD;
      and relevant correspondence are archived by the investigators. Once the study has been&#xD;
      completed, the all archived data will be stored by the University of Hamburg in accordance&#xD;
      with legal regulations. The lead investigator is responsible for storing and archiving the&#xD;
      study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance will be achieved by evaluation and comparison of data assessed at baseline&#xD;
      and at follow-up assessments after six month (t6) and after one year (t12). Data contains&#xD;
      measures of disease symptoms and severity (e.g., HEALTH-49, CGI-S, PANSS, PHQ-9, GAD-7,&#xD;
      PHQ-15, PID-5). The daily function level is measured with the GAF, and health-related quality&#xD;
      of life is assessed with the EQ-5D-5L and the SF-12. Treatment satisfaction will also be&#xD;
      measured. The therapeutic coherence is determined with regard to both drug and non-drug&#xD;
      treatment. All therapeutic services will be continuously documented in terms of number, type&#xD;
      and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and monitoring will be carried out by treatment-unrelated, independent&#xD;
      researchers (Dept. of Health Economics and Healthcare Research, Dept. of Medical Psychology&#xD;
      and the Dept. of Medical Biometry and Epidemiology, UKE). They will primarily monitor&#xD;
      compliance with the principles of good clinical practice and the study protocol, as well as&#xD;
      proper data collection and input. Data verification will mainly focus on key variables that&#xD;
      are defined at the beginning of the study. Frequency and duration of monitor visits will&#xD;
      depend on recruitment progress, protocol compliance and data quality. It will be the&#xD;
      monitor's responsibility to regularly check data collection and input, monitor adherence to&#xD;
      the study protocol, and check that data are complete, consistent and correct. The monitor&#xD;
      should have access to all data sources that can be used to verify the questionnaire&#xD;
      information. In addition, in accordance with the regulations governing the monitoring of&#xD;
      clinical trials, it is necessary for the investigator to grant the monitor access to the&#xD;
      proportion of all pseudonymised patient files directly associated with the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study results as well as a detailed study protocol will be published in national and&#xD;
      international peer-reviewed scientific journals. A publication agreement for the&#xD;
      participating institutions will be achieved within a consortium agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data, personal identification data and scientific data, will be stored in the UKE's Dept.&#xD;
      of Health Economics and Healthcare Research and Dept. of Medical Psychology for 10 years.&#xD;
      Consent declarations will be stored in the study center's paper archive until a legally&#xD;
      compliant scan is implemented. At all other locations, data will only be stored temporarily&#xD;
      for immediate data processing as proposed within the study framework.&#xD;
