  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study that aims to better understand the genetic causes of&#xD;
      frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), Multiple Systems Atrophy (MSA), and Progressive&#xD;
      Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). It is hoped the information gathered in this study will help lead&#xD;
      to better diagnostics and future treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comparative and longitudinal studies reveal clinical differences between subgroups of&#xD;
      patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), including Progressive Non-fluent Aphasia (PNFA),&#xD;
      Semantic Dementia (SD), patients with a disorder of social comportment and personality (SOC),&#xD;
      and non-aphasic patients with executive dysfunction (EXEC). MRI studies of cortical atrophy&#xD;
      and fMRI studies show correlated neural defects in FTD subgroups. The investigators will&#xD;
      obtain converging evidence from multiple sources to test hypotheses about the neural basis&#xD;
      for cognitive functions such as semantic memory, grammatical processing, and social&#xD;
      functioning in these FTD subgroups, while improving clinical care for these patients. Recent&#xD;
      studies have linked progressive supra nuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple systems atrophy (MSA)&#xD;
      to FTD. The investigators will obtain comparable neuropsychological and biomarker data in&#xD;
      order to compare these patient groups.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The University of Pennsylvania is a participant in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center 's FTLD-NACC initiative to create a national database of data specific to FTD spectrum diseases.The FTLD NACC initiative will enable research centers focusing on FTD spectrum diseases to gather standardized data on their FTLD patients, all of which will be combined into a single database and made freely available to researchers around the world.&#xD;
The FTLD-NACC collects data standardly obtained in this study, including neurocognitive assessments, MRI imaging data, and biomarkers collected through lumbar puncture and blood draw.The FTLD-NACC is designed to facilitate collaborative research and will allow researchers to maximize the use of clinical information and biological material available on frontotemporal degenerative spectrum diseases. Subjects will be able to choose whether or not their research data is shared with the FTD-NACC.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>As this is an ongoing, longitudinal study, IPD will be available through the duration of the study.</ipd_time_frame>
