    <textblock>
      Post-stroke fatigue is common and negatively influences post-stroke recovery. Today, there is&#xD;
      insufficient evidence how to treatment post-stroke fatigue. Our objective is to investigate&#xD;
      if a structured cardiorespiratory interval training program added to the early supported&#xD;
      discharge (ESD)-service results in relieved post-stroke fatigue and increased oxygen uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 1:1 prospective randomized open- label trial(Two-centre study) with blinded&#xD;
      evaluators (PROBE-design) of 50 participants referred to ESD with study start at 4 (±1) weeks&#xD;
      after discharge from the stroke unit. The intervention group (N=25) receives a structured&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory interval training program on ergometer cycle, 30-40 minutes, 3 days a week&#xD;
      for 8 weeks. The cardiorespiratory interval training program comprises of 4x4 minute&#xD;
      interval, at 70 to 80% of peak heart rate, interrupted by 3 minutes active recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group (N=25) receives usual ESD care. The primary outcome will be a shift in the&#xD;
      Swedish Fatigue Assessment Scale before intervention (baseline) versus 8 weeks months after&#xD;
      start of intervention in the intervention and control groups. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness, compliance, adherence and adverse events.&#xD;

      Stroke is a major cause of disability among adults. After stroke, post-stroke fatigue is a&#xD;
      common and negatively influences post-stroke recovery. Today, there is insufficient evidence&#xD;
      how to treatment post-stroke fatigue. Post-stroke fatigue is considered to have a&#xD;
      multifactorial cause and it is biologically plausible that fatigue might be related to&#xD;
      physical deconditioning and reduced physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After stroke, functional limitations often lead to a reduction in physical activity, which in&#xD;
      turn may lead to decline in cardiorespiratory fitness. Cardiorespiratory fitness is often&#xD;
      measured as peak oxygen consumption, VO2peak. Studies have reported that physical activity&#xD;
      and cardiorespiratory fitness is lower in stroke victims than gender- and aged-matched&#xD;
      healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention aimed to increased cardiorespiratory fitness has been highlighted as an&#xD;
      important component in in stroke rehabilitation. Guidelines for physical activity and&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness following stroke recommend cardiorespiratory training 20-60&#xD;
      minutes, 3-7 days a week at 50-80% of maximal heart rate. Interval training (4 x 4 minutes)&#xD;
      has showed to improve cardiovascular fitness at different patient groups, including Stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, stroke unit and early supported discharge service (ESD) is recommended as an effective&#xD;
      way to improve patient outcome and quality of care following stroke. The ESD service provides&#xD;
      support and rehabilitation for the patients in their own environment and the rehabilitation&#xD;
      is often focused on activities in daily living and mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate if a structured cardiorespiratory interval&#xD;
      training program added to the early supported discharge (ESD)-service results in relieved&#xD;
      post-stroke fatigue and increased oxygen uptake. Furthermore, the study will explore whether&#xD;
      it is feasible and safe for patients with post-stroke fatigue to perform a structured&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory interval training program in their home environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method/design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 1:1 prospective randomized open-label trial (Two-centre study) with blinded&#xD;
      evaluators (PROBE-design) comparing 8 weeks structured cardiorespiratory interval training&#xD;
      program added to standard ESD care compared with standard ESD care alone in 50 patients with&#xD;
      post-stroke fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive stroke patients who receives stroke unit care followed by ESD-service at Umeå&#xD;
      Stroke Center, University Hospital, Umeå, Sweden and Gävle hospital, Region Gävleborg,&#xD;
      Sweden. A stroke physician will examine the patients 4 (± 1) weeks after discharge from the&#xD;
      stroke unit. The patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria will receive oral and written&#xD;
      information. Thereafter, the potential participants will be given at least 24 hours until&#xD;
      they are asked for written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent, an incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test will be performed on an&#xD;
      ergometer cycle (pre-treatment test). The participants will also estimate post-stroke fatigue&#xD;
      with the Swedish fatigue assessment scale (S-FAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (N=50) eligible for study participation according to inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be randomly assigned to the intervention group(N=25) or the control&#xD;
      group(N=25). The randomization procedure will be web-based using program Minim. Minimization&#xD;
      will be used to create groups for intervention and control in order to stratify groups and&#xD;
      ensure balance at study entry with respect to significant variables. The participants will be&#xD;
      stratified according to sex, age and stroke severity (Modified Rankin Scale 0-1 vs ≥2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke patients in the control group will receive usual ESD care including information about&#xD;
      post-stroke fatigue, support and practical advice about how to identify and manage fatigue&#xD;
      symptoms in daily tasks, such as the adaptation and prioritization of activities, physical&#xD;
      activity and rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the intervention group will receive structured cardiorespiratory interval&#xD;
      training program on an ergometer cycle. This is in addition to usual ESD care. The training&#xD;
      will be conducted 30-40 minutes, 3 days a week for 8 weeks. Based on the incremental&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (pre-treatment test) an individual training heart rate range of&#xD;
      70 to 80% of maximal heart rate (HR peak) will be set. The participants will wear a heart&#xD;
      rate monitor during the training and be instructed to exercise within the heart rate range.&#xD;
      An experienced physiotherapist will be present and guide the training sessions during the&#xD;
      first weeks. When the participants become more familiar with the exercise, the&#xD;
      physiotherapist will monitor the training through phone or telemedicine equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . The training session will start with a 10 minutes warm-up followed by 25 minutes of 4x4&#xD;
      minute interval, at 70 to 80% of peak heart rate, interrupted by 3 minutes active recovery&#xD;
      and 5 minutes cool down. In order to get a estimation of perceived exertion, the participant&#xD;
      will rate on The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale every minute during the&#xD;
      4-minute intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was estimated by a power calculation. The power calculation was based on the&#xD;
      level of fatigue assessed with the Swedish Fatigue Assessment scale (primary outcome). The&#xD;
      absolute reliability for the Swedish Fatigue Assessment scale is 9 points, which means that a&#xD;
      9 points change is required to indicate a real change of fatigue level. 21 persons per group&#xD;
      are needed for power of 80 % significance level of 0.05 (2 sided t-test, assuming a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 10). This calculation is based on a t-test assuming a standard deviation of 10&#xD;
      points. A total of 50 participants (25 participants per group) will enter this study. The&#xD;
      analyses of primary and secondary outcome will be on the basis of intension to treat.&#xD;
      Two-sided students t-test or two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to compare&#xD;
      groups for the pre-treatment test and post treatment test.&#xD;
