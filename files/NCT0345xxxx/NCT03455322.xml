  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of midodrine plus octreotide versus&#xD;
      norepinephrine and to determine the predictive factors of response in patients with HRS-AKI.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both sexes aged 18 years or older having cirrhosis, ascites, and a diagnosis of HRS-AKI based&#xD;
      on the 2015 International Club of Ascites (ICA) diagnostic criteria [2] were eligible for&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and eligibility criteria were verified upon admission to the ICU. A diagnosis of&#xD;
      AKI was established through comparing sCr value at time of ICU admission to that recorded in&#xD;
      the patient's file. Patients who meet all other diagnostic criteria of HRS-AKI provided by&#xD;
      the previous definition [2] were enrolled in the study. Qualified patients were subjected to&#xD;
      baseline assessments after informed consent signature. It included vital sign measurements,&#xD;
      presence of comorbidities, height and weight, Child-Pugh score and Sequential Organ Failure&#xD;
      Assessment (SOFA) score. Vital signs, Blood urea nitrogen, sCr, serum sodium, serum albumin,&#xD;
      total bilirubin, and complete blood count with differential were measured at baseline and at&#xD;
      daily basis throughout the study period. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive&#xD;
      either continuous infusion of norepinephrine in an initial dose of 0.5mg/h (Maximum 3 mg/h or&#xD;
      oral midodrine 5mg three times/day (Maximum 12.5mg three times/day) plus octreotide 100μg/6h&#xD;
      as subcutaneous injection (Maximum 200 μg/6h). Duration of treatment was allowed to extend to&#xD;
      a maximum of 10 days. Administration of albumin at doses of 20 to 40 gm/day was recommended,&#xD;
      as clinically indicated, for all patients in both study arms as per current ICA guidelines.&#xD;
