  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study allows patients to take part of the decision making between a unicompartment knee&#xD;
      (partial ) or a total Knee replacement . Using the measures of a decision aid questionnaire&#xD;
      which explicitly details the risks and benefits of both procedures.The study will use&#xD;
      subjective (reported by patient) and objective data (which will be measured) to allow the&#xD;
      determination if one option is superior to the other. Information gathered from this study&#xD;
      will be used to assist future patients in selecting the surgical option that best fits their&#xD;
      life style.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A feasibility pilot study of a randomized clinical trial will help to evaluate the outcomes&#xD;
      of both procedures and help shape a multicentre Canadian study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis of the knee is an increasingly common problem for many Canadians aged 50 or&#xD;
      greater. When conservative management fails, patients are often offered a type of knee&#xD;
      replacement as treatment. The choices are a total knee replacement or a partial knee&#xD;
      replacement, which carry distinct advantages and disadvantages. Typically, patients with&#xD;
      partial knee replacement have less post operative pain, quicker recovery and enhanced&#xD;
      function with greater knee bend. There is however a higher chance of revision where the pain&#xD;
      is not relieved or the implant fails. The decision for which replacement to offer is now&#xD;
      primarily surgeon driven, shaped by their experience, review of evidence and capability to&#xD;
      perform either of these options. Canadian patients would benefit from a decision making model&#xD;
      so their own values can shape and determine the decision. This research hopes to evaluate the&#xD;
      merits of a patient based decision aid which explicitly details the risks and benefits of&#xD;
      both procedures as they are best understood today. Further, the quality of the current&#xD;
      evidence is only moderately strong limited by patient selection biases and there is a need&#xD;
      for contemporary comparative study trial of the 2 procedures to help clinicians and patients&#xD;
      make the decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A feasibility pilot study of a randomized clinical trial is being proposed to evaluate the&#xD;
      outcomes of both procedures, which will help shape a multicentre Canadian study.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire is the sum of WOMAC A (total pain), WOMAC B (stiffness) and WOMAC C (functional impairment) subscores. All the items are scored on a scale of 0-4; lower scores are indicative of lower disease burden. Values are summed for a combined WOMAC score (Total score ranges from 0-96, with higher scores indicating worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Oxford Knee Score (OKS)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported questionnaire. The sum of the questionnaire will be totaled. Oxford Knee Score Scale range 0 (severe arthritis) - 48 (satisfactory joint function)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Knee Society Score (KSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee Society Score (KSS) is comprised of 4 components: 1) An &quot;Objective&quot; Knee Score (7 items: 100 points), 2) A Patient Satisfaction Score (5 items: 40 points), 3) A Patient Expectation Score (3 items: 15 points), and 4) A Functional Activity Score (19 items: 100 points). Although the specific scores are not distinguished as &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;poor,&quot; a higher value represents a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Quantitative analysis of gait using EMG and motion capture</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A ten-camera infrared motion capture system will be used to track patients gait in a Biomechanics Laboratory. Retroreflective markers will be placed on the body in various locations to track muscle activity. Patients will be asked to perform 5 trials of level walking, 5 trials of inclined and declined walking (12.5% slope), 5 trials of going up and down stairs and 5 trials of sitting and standing motions. Only patients exhibiting the following characteristics will be suitable for assessment: BMI of 35 or less, No other ipsilateral or contralateral lower limb joint disorders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Term Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients recovery will be evaluated using the 40 item, quality of recovery (QoR-40) questionnaire. The sum of all scores (the total) will be reported (Minimum=40, Maximum=200). Higher scores are indicative of better perceived recovery while lower scores are associated with a worse perceived recovery.</description>
