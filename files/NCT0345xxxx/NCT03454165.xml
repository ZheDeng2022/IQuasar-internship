    <textblock>
      A Phase I Trial of BNC105P in combination with BTK inhibitor ibrutinib in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia(CLL). This study proposes that ibrutinib&#xD;
      will have far greater efficacy when it is combined with drugs that kill the CLL cells in&#xD;
      peripheral circulation, thereby preventing them from returning to the protective lymph node&#xD;
      niche. The study will establish the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) of the combination of BNC105P&#xD;
      with ibrutinib, characterize the pharmacodynamic effects of BNC105P alone and in combination&#xD;
      with ibrutinib in CLL cells, and provide preliminary assessment of the efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination in CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a Screening Period with baseline tumor assessment before BNC105P&#xD;
      administration, a Treatment Period with up to six 21-day cycles and Follow-up Period.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a total of six cycles of therapy unless treatment is discontinued&#xD;

      A Phase I Trial of BNC105P in combination with BTK inhibitor ibrutinib in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Ibrutinib inhibits the pro-survival&#xD;
      BCR signaling of CLL cells in the stromal niche resulting in their egress to the periphery.&#xD;
      Importantly, if administration of ibrutinib is stopped, the CLL cells rapidly return to the&#xD;
      lymph node. In some patients, the drug-induced increase in circulating CLL cells has been&#xD;
      seen for more than a year reflecting the fact that the cells do not readily die once they&#xD;
      exit the lymph node. Resistance to ibrutinib has been observed as mutations in the&#xD;
      drug-binding cysteine in its target, BTK. This resistance is likely to become far more&#xD;
      prevalent as patients remain on ibrutinib for months or years. We propose that ibrutinib will&#xD;
      have far greater efficacy when it is combined with drugs that kill the CLL cells in&#xD;
      peripheral circulation, thereby preventing them from returning to the protective lymph node&#xD;
      niche. BNC105P works through an entirely different mechanism, i.e. tipping the balance of&#xD;
      pro-survival and pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member proteins toward the latter, resulting in&#xD;
      cell death. This pathway of apoptosis occurs at all stages of the cell cycle which is&#xD;
      important considering that the majority of peripheral CLL cells are non-cycling (in G0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a Screening Period with baseline tumor assessment before BNC105P&#xD;
      administration, a Treatment Period with up to six 21-day cycles and Follow-up Period.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a total of six cycles of therapy unless treatment is discontinued.&#xD;
