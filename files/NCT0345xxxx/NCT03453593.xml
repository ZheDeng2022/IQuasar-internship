      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trauma is major threat to population health worldwide, each year killing more people than&#xD;
      malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and maternal conditions combined. Almost five millions deaths&#xD;
      occur annually as a result of injuries and of these approximately 90 percent occur in low-&#xD;
      and middle-income countries (LMIC). An increase in road traffic deaths has been seen in many&#xD;
      LMIC where motorization and urbanization has not been accompanied sufficiently by improved&#xD;
      road safety strategies. In fact, in the age group 15-29 years, road traffic injuries are the&#xD;
      leading cause of death worldwide. With these changing patterns in global health, trauma is&#xD;
      now a condition needing greater priority to reduce avoidable mortality in young and&#xD;
      middle-aged adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early detection of potentially lethal or disabling injuries is crucial to reduce trauma&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity. Imaging is at the core of such detection, and computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT) is standard in trauma systems all over the world. Studies comparing whole body CT (WBCT)&#xD;
      to selective CT imaging suggest that WBCT is associated with better outcomes and lower&#xD;
      mortality rates. In a well structured environment, WBCT during trauma resuscitation was&#xD;
      associated with significantly decreased mortality in haemodynamically stable as well as in&#xD;
      haemodynamically unstable major trauma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a strong push to perform CT as early as possible as part of the diagnostic workup.&#xD;
      Immediate CT and rapid bleeding control without patient transfer, close distance of the CT&#xD;
      scanner to the trauma room, as well as immediate WBCT after initial examination compared to&#xD;
      selective CT imaging according to the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines was&#xD;
      associated with improved probability of survival of severely injured patients in high income&#xD;
      countries. However, no similar studies have been conducted in LMIC. There are concerns about&#xD;
      such investigations delaying time-critical interventions. In low-resource settings the CT may&#xD;
      be located far from the resuscitation and surgical resources, and the expertise needed to&#xD;
      keep patients stable during the transfer to and from the CT may be limited. Therefore,&#xD;
      whether time to CT is associated with survival remains unknown in low-middle income settings&#xD;
      disproportionally affected by trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether time to CT is associated with survival in adult trauma patients in an urban&#xD;
      lower-middle income setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective analysis of the cohort study Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcomes in&#xD;
      India (TITCO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The de-identified TITCO cohort includes a total of 16,000 patients enrolled from four public&#xD;
      university hospitals in urban India between July 2013 and December 2015. The hospitals are&#xD;
      located in the megacities Mumbai (two centres), Delhi and Kolkata. One project officer at&#xD;
      each site performed the data collection. Data was gathered prospectively on-admission on a&#xD;
      standardized intake form for eight hours per day by directly observing the staff delivering&#xD;
      trauma care. They rotated daily through each eight-hour shift (morning, evening, night),&#xD;
      including public holidays. For patients admitted outside the eight-hour &quot;observed shift&quot;, the&#xD;
      data was retrospectively retrieved from patient records within days. Time to first CT was&#xD;
      recorded within the first 24 hours of arrival to a participating centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source and method of participant selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The one-site project officer included patients from participating hospitals, either by&#xD;
      prospective observation or by retrospective data retrieval from patient records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time from injury to CT imaging in hours, extracted from patient records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covariates&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age in years, sex, whether the participant was transferred from another health facility,&#xD;
      mechanism of injury recorded as road traffic injury, railway injury, fall, assault or other,&#xD;
      all extracted from patient records or reported by participants. Vital signs on arrival to&#xD;
      participating centre including systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), and Glasgow&#xD;
      coma scale (GCS). Vital sign data was extracted from patient records. Anatomical injury&#xD;
      severity quantified using the injury severity score (ISS), calculated by a single accredited&#xD;
      coder based on text injury descriptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias&#xD;
&#xD;
      All project officers observing and collecting the data had a health science master degree.&#xD;
      They were not employed by participating centres but by the project administration centrally.&#xD;
      In addition, they were continuously trained and supervised through out the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative variables will be handled as continuous. Variables for which a non-linear&#xD;
      association with survival can be assumed, such as age, systolic blood pressure, heart rate&#xD;
      and time between arrival and CT will be modelled using restricted cubic splines with three&#xD;
      knots placed at equally spaced percentiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      R, a language and environment for statistical computing, will be used for all statistical&#xD;
      analyses. A predictive approach will be employed to test the internal validity of the&#xD;
      findings by temporally splitting the sample in two parts, henceforth referred to as the test&#xD;
      and validation samples. The earlier half of observations from each participating centre will&#xD;
      form the test sample whereas the later half from each centre will form the validation sample,&#xD;
      ensuring that the relative contribution of each centre is approximately the same in both&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures will then be conducted in both samples. First, sample&#xD;
      characteristics will be presented using medians and inter-quartile ranges (IQR) for&#xD;
      quantitative variables and counts and percentages for qualitative variables. Second, to&#xD;
      assess how time to CT is associated with survival a logistic regression model will be used. A&#xD;
      minimal model including only time to CT modelled using restricted cubic splines will be built&#xD;
      to generate a crude estimate of the association. A full model including all covariates listed&#xD;
      above in addition to time to CT will then be built to generate an adjusted estimate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the differences and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) between the time to CT&#xD;
      parameter coefficients in the test and validation samples will be assessed using&#xD;
      bootstrapping, to produce an estimate of the findings robustness. When relevant, a 5%&#xD;
      significance level will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy to handle missing data&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the required sample size is reached if only patients with complete data on the outcome,&#xD;
      explanatory variable, and covariates are included then a complete case analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted. If not then missing data will be handled with multiple imputation using chained&#xD;
      equations. The number of imputed datasets will be equal to the percentage of incomplete&#xD;
      observations. The analysis will be conducted separately in each imputed dataset and the main&#xD;
      results presented as medians with IQR across imputations. For confidence intervals the most&#xD;
      extreme values of pooled upper and lower bounds will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulation studies of proportional hazard models' sample size requirements indicate a need&#xD;
      for at least ten events per parameter (see below) in the hypothetically most complex model&#xD;
      for the model to produce reliable coefficient estimates. An event here is an observation with&#xD;
      the outcome. Each of time to CT, age, SBP and HR will contribute with two parameters when&#xD;
      modelled using restricted cubic splines. Sex, transfer status, GCS, and ISS each accounts for&#xD;
      one parameter. Mechanism of injury contributes with four parameters. Taken together the full&#xD;
      model will include 16 parameters and hence require 160 events. Assuming an outcome prevalence&#xD;
      of 20% based on previous research each of the test and validation samples need to include at&#xD;
      least 800 observations. The minimum total sample size required is therefore 1600&#xD;
      observations.&#xD;
