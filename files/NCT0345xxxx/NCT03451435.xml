  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulp re-vascularization/regeneration is a procedure performed to allow pulpal stem cells to&#xD;
      survive and/or differentiate to allow immature tooth root structures to grow to full&#xD;
      maturity. Currently, the procedure includes disinfection of the necrotic root canal space and&#xD;
      induction of bleeding to potentiate pulpal stem cell differentiation to allow root growth on&#xD;
      an immature root. A number of studies conducted previously demonstrate that N-acetyl cysteine&#xD;
      (NAC) potentiates differentiation of pulpal stem/stromal cells and protects pulpal cells from&#xD;
      apoptosis. 14-18 human subjects will be recruited forming two groups where pulp&#xD;
      re-vascularization/regeneration procedures will be performed with or without the use of NAC&#xD;
      treatment prior to induction of bleeding. Recall follow-up appointments will be done at 6&#xD;
      months and 1 year post treatment with subsequent yearly appointments until full root growth&#xD;
      has been achieved.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We will recruit 14-18 patients under the age of 18 by means of advertising at UCLA. Two&#xD;
      groups will be formed, one with NAC treatment during endodontic revascularization and one&#xD;
      without. Each patient will have an adult tooth where the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tooth with necrotic pulp and immature apex(apices)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulp space is not needed for post/core, final restoration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compliant patient who is willing to come for at least 2-3 treatment appointments and 2-3&#xD;
           follow-up recall appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are not allergic to calcium hydroxide intra-canal medicament&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate consent forms will be obtained by the patient and the patient's parent or legal&#xD;
      guardian. If we recruit 18 patient, 9 patients will be under regenerative endodontic&#xD;
      therapy/re-vascularization with NAC and 9 patients without NAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures will be applied to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Appointment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local anesthesia administration, dental dam isolation and access&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Copious, gentle irrigation with 20mL NaOCL (sodium hypochlorite) using an irrigation&#xD;
           system that minimizes the possibility of extrusion of irrigants into the periapical&#xD;
           spaces. The concentration of NaOCL will be low (1.5%, 20mL/canal for 5 minutes).&#xD;
           Afterwards, irrigation with 17% EDTA (20mL/canal for 5 minutes) will be done. Irrigating&#xD;
           needle position should be about 1mm from root end, to minimize cytotoxicity to stem&#xD;
           cells in the apical tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dry canals with paper points&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Place calcium hydroxide into canal(s) delivered via syringe&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seal access with 3-4mm of a temporary restorative material such as CavitTM, IRMTM or&#xD;
           glass ionomer. Dismiss patient for 2-4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second Appointment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess response to initial treatment. If there are signs/symptoms of persistent&#xD;
           infection, consider repeating the procedures of the First appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anesthesia with 3% mepivacaine without vasoconstrictor, dental dam isolation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Copious gentle irrigation with 20mL of 17% EDTA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take a radiograph to ensure previous calcium hydroxide has been fully removed form the&#xD;
           canal system&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dry with paper points&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For study patients only: Irrigate canal system with NAC (20mM NAC, 30mL/canal) gently&#xD;
           for 10 minutes and then dry canal(s) with paper points&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Create bleeding into the canal system by over-instrumenting (endo file, endo explorer).&#xD;
           Induce bleeding by rotating a pre-curved (approximately 45 degrees at the apical 1-2mm&#xD;
           of file) K-file at 2mm past the apical foramen with the goal of having the entire canal&#xD;
           filled with blood to the level of the cemento-enamel junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stop the bleeding at a level that allows for 3-4mm of restorative material. Place a&#xD;
           resorbable matrix (CollaPlugTM, CollacoteTM, CollatTapeTM) over the blood clot if&#xD;
           necessary to achieve a better stop for mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) or Bioceramic&#xD;
           fast set putty (BC). Place white MTA as capping material on top of the resorbable&#xD;
           matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The access is closed with 3-4mm layer of glass ionomer (Fuji IXTM, GC America, Alsip,&#xD;
           IL), composite or alloy over the capping material. For resin modified glass ionomers and&#xD;
           composite, 40 seconds of light curer will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up recall appointments: Clinical and Radiographic exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extra-oral examination: No pain, extra-oral swelling nor extra-oral sinus tract&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra-oral examination: No pain, intra-oral swelling of mucosa nor intra-oral sinus&#xD;
           tract&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take 1 straight on periapical radiograph and 1 angled periapical radiograph. Resolution&#xD;
           of apical radiolucency (often observed within 6-12months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record any increased width of root walls (this is generally observed before apparent&#xD;
           increase in root length and often occurs 12-24 months after treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record any increase in root length (in mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test vitality of pulp with Endo-Ice and Electric pulp tester (EPT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record which goals have been attained (primary, secondary and/or tertiary)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of success of RET is measured by the extent to which it is possible to attain&#xD;
      primary, secondary and tertiary goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary goal: The elimination of symptoms and the evidence of bony healing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary goal: Increased root wall thickness and/or increased root length&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tertiary goal: Positive response to vitality testing&#xD;
