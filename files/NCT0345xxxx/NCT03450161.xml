      Randomized, double-blinded, three arm study in adult patients undergoing first time coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery with median sternotomy. The investigators will examine&#xD;
      the effects of three fentanyl dosing schemes (high-dose bolus, low-dose bolus, continuous&#xD;
      dose) on the area of hyperalgesia and allodynia at 24 and 48h as well as on persisting pain&#xD;
      at 3, 6, and 12 months. Additionally, the investigators will measure fentanyl concentrations&#xD;
      throughout anesthesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, double-blinded (patient, anesthesiologist, assessor) clinical&#xD;
      study. This study will examine three different clinically used application schemes of&#xD;
      fentanyl, an opioid used as the standard of care in routine practice. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive one of the following three treatment arms for anesthesia maintenance&#xD;
      (pre-sternotomy):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. High-dose fentanyl bolus (20 µg/kg of body weight [BW]; e.g. 70kg 1400 µg or 1.4mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Low-dose fentanyl bolus (3 µg/kg BW; e.g. 70kg 210 µg or 0.2mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Continuous fentanyl application by Shibutani scheme&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study will include data from 69 adult patients (23 per arm) undergoing first time,&#xD;
           elective, on-pump CABG surgery with median sternotomy and central cannulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following randomization by the sealed envelope technique, fentanyl kits will be drawn up&#xD;
           by an anesthesiologist not involved in patient care or outcome assessment. Patients with&#xD;
           preexisting chronic pain, opioids in the last 30 days, a BMI&gt;36kg/m2, sleep apnoea,&#xD;
           renal failure (clearance &lt;30ml/min), with neuraxial anesthesia, pregnant, with planned&#xD;
           wound infiltration, known allergies/intolerance to opioids, and unable to understand&#xD;
           pin-prick testing will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At induction, all patients will receive a standard 3 µg/kg bolus of fentanyl (not study&#xD;
           medication, but rather standard of care). 5 minutes prior to sternotomy, the patient&#xD;
           will receive analgesia maintenance (one of the three fentanyl study arms). Clinicians&#xD;
           will at all times be able to administer a bolus of fentanyl on a perceived &quot;as needed&quot;&#xD;
           basis (not study medication, but rather standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objective of this trial is to assess whether or not different intraoperative&#xD;
           dosing schemes of fentanyl during on-pump CABG surgery influence the area of&#xD;
           hyperalgesia as measured by sternal pin-prick testing on the first postoperative day. As&#xD;
           the mechanisms causing opioid-induced analgesia are poorly understood but appear to be&#xD;
           dosis-related, the investigators will examine 3 clinically used fentanyl application&#xD;
           schemes in cardiac surgery: 1) a high-dose bolus group, 2) a low-dose bolus group, and&#xD;
           3) a low-dose continuous infusion group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           [i.e. does fentanyl dosing influence the area of hyperalgesia?]&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary objectives of this trial are 1) to explore the intraoperative&#xD;
           concentrations of fentanyl in these various dosing schemes during and after&#xD;
           extracorporeal circulation (ECC).&#xD;
&#xD;
           [i.e. determine the time course of fentanyl with ECC and its association with&#xD;
           hyperalgesia; explorative] 2) to explore a possible association between fentanyl dosing,&#xD;
           hyperalgesia, and persisting pain 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           [i.e. clinical implication on persistent/chronic pain; explorative]&#xD;
