  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL) as a biomarker to measure levels of Pathogen- Associated&#xD;
      Molecular Patterns (PAMP) during septic shock. This will allow evaluating interest of this&#xD;
      biomarker to monitor and manage a septic shock. Consecutive patients admitted for sepsis in&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit Department will be included. This biomarker will be compared to all the&#xD;
      parameters monitored usually for these patients in standard care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock still represent a major cause of admission in intensive care unit, incidence of&#xD;
      severe sepsis is increasing, even in western countries, due to aging populations and&#xD;
      comorbidities. Definition of septic shock was revised in 2016 by a task force, which&#xD;
      emphasizes the need for future iterations. Indeed, there are no simple clinical or biological&#xD;
      criteria ton diagnose septic patients with high risk of shock, or to prognose its severity.&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) are the wider biomarkers used to monitor&#xD;
      septic patients. But they do not correlate with sepsis severity and moreover do not&#xD;
      distinguish unequivocally between infection and noninfected systemic inflammatory response&#xD;
      syndrome (SIRS). Each microorganism has number of PAMPs, cell wall components&#xD;
      (lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, peptidoglycan, outer membrane vesicles), flagella, mannan…&#xD;
      High levels of these pathogen fragments are released in the bloodstream during sepsis. They&#xD;
      trigger release of inflammatory cytokines that drive the sepsis cascade. Mannose binding&#xD;
      lectin plays a pivotal role in innate immunity, binding with surface sugars of wide range of&#xD;
      pathogens and their fragments. Thus MBL promotes opsonophagocytosis and activates the&#xD;
      lectin-complement pathway. Fc-MBL, an engineered version of MBL has been developed to capture&#xD;
      microorganism and treat sepsis. An ELISA, using Fc-MBL was developed to measure PAMPs in&#xD;
      whole blood during sepsis. This assay will use Fc-MBL ELISA to quantify PAMPs during septic&#xD;
      shock, to improve diagnostic and monitoring. But also, identifying patients with high levels&#xD;
      of PAMPs for dialysis-like sepsis therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAMP's level will be compared to clinical, biological, microbiological and therapeutic&#xD;
      outcomes. Its sensitivity will be evaluated by its kinetic among a septic shock (defined with&#xD;
      Sepsis-3 criteria) and by correlation with CRP (C-Reactive Protein) and PCT (Procalcitonin).&#xD;
      Its specificity will be evaluated by comparing its levels during septic and non-septic&#xD;
      shocks.&#xD;
