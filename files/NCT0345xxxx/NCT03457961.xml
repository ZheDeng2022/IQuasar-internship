      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disease which affects approximately 70,000 patients in&#xD;
      Hong Kong and 50 billion people worldwide. Among these patients one-third remained&#xD;
      unresponsive to antiepileptic agents. Continual drug manipulation is an essential therapeutic&#xD;
      option for these patients with refractory epilepsy. In particular, rational polytherapy has&#xD;
      become the mainstay of treatment for the sub-group of patients who have failed two or more&#xD;
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substantial amount of research has shown that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA) may&#xD;
      play a key role in the pathophysiology of several neurological diseases, including epilepsy.&#xD;
      Animal models of epilepsy and clinical studies demonstrate that NMDA receptors activity and&#xD;
      expression can be altered in association with epilepsy and particularly in some specific&#xD;
      seizure types. NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to have antiepileptic effects in&#xD;
      both clinical and preclinical studies. There is some evidence that conventional antiepileptic&#xD;
      drugs may also affect NMDA receptor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the medium to long-term effects of AMPA/NMDA receptor antagonist in an Asian&#xD;
      cohort as there is a relative lack of clinical data in this population To explore the&#xD;
      efficacy of AMPA/NMDA receptor antagonist in patients with partial onsets seizures that may&#xD;
      secondarily generalize and the specific side effects of AMPA/NMDA receptor antagonist in&#xD;
      relation to behavioral problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A semi-prospective design is adopted to recruit patients who are indicated and started on&#xD;
      AMPA/NMDA receptor antagonist aged 12 or above in Hong Kong. This study will collect&#xD;
      information about demographic details, medical history and seizure information. Assessment of&#xD;
      seizure frequency is based on seizure diary and interviews with family members. Physical&#xD;
      examination, electrocardiogram and other medical information relevant to the follow-up of the&#xD;
      patient will be collected.&#xD;

      Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disease which affects approximately 70,000 patients in&#xD;
      Hong Kong and 50 billion people worldwide. Among these patients, one-third remained&#xD;
      unresponsive to antiepileptic agents. Continual drug manipulation is an essential therapeutic&#xD;
      option for these patients with refractory epilepsy. In particular, rational polytherapy has&#xD;
      become the mainstay of treatment for the sub-group of patients who have failed two or more&#xD;
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using AEDs with different mechanisms of action is a strategy adopted by many doctors around&#xD;
      the world. In this regard, perampanel (PER) is an agent which is first in its class, with&#xD;
      specific antagonistic action on ionotropic Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic&#xD;
      acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor of post-synaptic neurons. The pharmacokinetics of PER&#xD;
      suggested that it has a half-life of approximately 105 hours and the steady-state&#xD;
      concentrations that can be reached in 14 days. PER is approximately 95% bound to plasma&#xD;
      proteins. This metabolism is mediated by CYP 3A4 or CYP 3A5. The usual dosage of PER is&#xD;
      between 2mg and 12 mg. PER can be administered once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of five clinical studies demonstrated the efficacy of PER among patients with&#xD;
      refractory epilepsy. These were all double-blind studies and all of them evaluated the 50%&#xD;
      responder rate as a seizure outcome. The corresponding risk ratio for 50% responder rates for&#xD;
      4mg, 8mg and 12mg were 1.54, 1.8 and 1.72. The most common treatment-emergent adverse effects&#xD;
      were dizziness, drowsiness, headache, fatigue, nasopharyngitis. The pooled results suggested&#xD;
      that a higher dose was more efficacious if the side effects could be tolerated. There was an&#xD;
      on-going study on the use of PER among patients with secondarily generalized seizures.&#xD;
      Perampanel has been approved in many countries such as USA, EU, Australia, Canada,&#xD;
      Switzerland, Singapore, and Malaysia, as an adjunctive therapy for refractory partial&#xD;
      seizures with or without secondary generalisation among patients above 12 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substantial amount of research has shown that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA) may&#xD;
      play a key role in the pathophysiology of several neurological diseases, including epilepsy.&#xD;
      Animal models of epilepsy and clinical studies demonstrate that NMDA receptors activity and&#xD;
      expression can be altered in association with epilepsy and particularly in some specific&#xD;
      seizure types. NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to have antiepileptic effects in&#xD;
      both clinical and preclinical studies. There is some evidence that conventional antiepileptic&#xD;
      drugs may also affect NMDA receptor function.&#xD;
