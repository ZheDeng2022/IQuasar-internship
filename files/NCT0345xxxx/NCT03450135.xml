  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of adolescent depression is steadily rising in the U.S., especially among&#xD;
      adolescent girls. Currently 20% of adolescent girls experience major depression compared with&#xD;
      6% of boys (National Institute of Mental Health, 2016). The profound gender disparity in&#xD;
      depression that emerges at puberty, but not before, implicates a role of ovarian steroid&#xD;
      hormones in promoting affective (mood) symptoms in adolescent girls. In addition to dramatic&#xD;
      physical maturation and a rapidly changing reproductive hormone environment at puberty,&#xD;
      adolescence is also a time of exposure to substantial psychosocial stress, particularly in&#xD;
      girls. It is well documented that stress interferes with the maturation of neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      trajectories and is a critical precipitating factor in the pathway to psychopathology.&#xD;
      However, the neuropathophysiological mechanisms linking stress exposure and sensitivity to&#xD;
      ovarian hormone fluctuations at puberty to the onset and maintenance of depression symptoms&#xD;
      in adolescence have yet to be elucidated, and is the purpose of this research.&#xD;

      Framed within a diathesis-stress model of disease, the primary objective of this research is&#xD;
      to determine a pathophysiological role of estradiol (E2) variability in the context of severe&#xD;
      psychosocial stress exposure in regulating neurophysiological correlates of affective state&#xD;
      change in girls (ages 11-14) during the pubertal transition (i.e., Tanner developmental&#xD;
      stages 3 or 4). The rationale for examining E2 variability as a diathesis for mood impairment&#xD;
      is twofold. First, sensitivity to hormonal flux during specific reproductive events has been&#xD;
      shown to trigger affective symptoms in susceptible women, and second, E2 is a powerful&#xD;
      neuroregulator of neural networks implicated in depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      55 peripubertal girls undergoing a healthy pubertal transition will be recruited for the&#xD;
      study. Over an 8-week period, depression symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies&#xD;
      Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC)), anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-C)),&#xD;
      and perceived stress (perceived stress scale (PSS)), and salivary E2 measured by liquid&#xD;
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) will be assessed on a weekly basis. An&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG) during an emotional go/no-go task will be performed after the&#xD;
      8-week collection period to probe neurophysiological correlates of maturing fronto-limbic&#xD;
      circuitry and assess key domains of cognitive and emotional processing impacted by the&#xD;
      hormonal milieu. At the follow-up visit, an acute psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress&#xD;
      Test) will be administered to examine cortisol and autonomic stress reactivity. The central&#xD;
      hypothesis of the proposed research is that the amplitude and synchrony of frontal neural&#xD;
      oscillations evoked during the cognitive-affective processing paradigm, and cortisol&#xD;
      reactivity to the psychosocial stressor will partially mediate the relationship between&#xD;
      greater E2 variability and elevated depression symptoms in peripubertal girls, and this&#xD;
      relationship will be particularly strong in girls who have experienced recent (within six&#xD;
      months) psychosocial stress.&#xD;
