  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RBC transfusion for&#xD;
      support of acute anemia in cardiovascular surgery patients based on the clinical outcome of&#xD;
      renal impairment following transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) treated with the INTERCEPT&#xD;
      Blood System (IBS) for Red Blood Cells compared to patients transfused with conventional&#xD;
      RBCs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, active controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-design, non-inferiority study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening/Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to minimize the number of patients who enroll in the study but do not require RBC&#xD;
      transfusion, only patients with a relatively high likelihood to receive a RBC transfusion as&#xD;
      determined by the Investigator (e.g., patients receiving aspirin, clopidogrel (or analogs)&#xD;
      and/or GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors), or patients with a TRUST Score of ≥3 will be eligible for&#xD;
      enrollment. Patients ≥ 11 years of age undergoing complex cardiac surgery may be identified&#xD;
      through pre-operative scheduling procedures in advance of their operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potentially eligible patients will be approached for study consent prior to their&#xD;
      surgical procedure. Subjects who consent to the study will be assigned a study ID number and&#xD;
      undergo screening. Screening data collection and procedures will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics (age, sex), vital signs, height, weight, EKG, type of scheduled surgery, need&#xD;
      for irradiated RBCs, medical and surgical history, transfusion history, physical examination,&#xD;
      concomitant medications, complete blood count, blood type, blood chemistry, DAT, IAT,&#xD;
      specific immune reactivity to IBS RBCs, and pregnancy test (when applicable). A blood sample&#xD;
      for HLA antibodies will also be obtained and sent to a central lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening will include documentation of the patient's pre-surgical exposure to radiographic&#xD;
      contrast media and number of prior pregnancies (females). Screening data may be derived from&#xD;
      the medical record when performed within 7 days of screening. Eligibility status and other&#xD;
      study data including all TRUST components will be entered into the clinical database via an&#xD;
      electronic data capture (EDC) system using electronic case report forms (eCRFs). Patients who&#xD;
      fail eligibility for any or multiple inclusion/exclusion criteria may be rescreened for&#xD;
      eligibility closer to the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized up to 7 days before or on the day of scheduled surgery&#xD;
      (Day 0). An Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) will be used for electronic randomization&#xD;
      of eligible patients. Randomization (in 1:1 ratio for Test:Control) stratified by site,&#xD;
      pre-existing renal impairment (baseline sCr ≥1.2mg/dL), and cardiac surgery group (more at&#xD;
      risk for renal complication vs. less) will be employed. Screened subjects who receive a red&#xD;
      cell transfusion prior to randomization will no longer be considered for randomization, and&#xD;
      their participation in the study will end. Randomized subjects who do not receive any study&#xD;
      RBC transfusions following randomization to within the first 48 hours after completion of&#xD;
      surgery will be discontinued from the study and replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only delegated blood bank staff will have access to subjects' treatment arm assignment. RBC&#xD;
      unit labels will be identical for Test and Control products. Operating room staff, surgical&#xD;
      staff, ICU staff, and others caring for participating patients, as well as the sponsor (and&#xD;
      delegates), will be blinded to treatment assignment. Unblinded CRAs will monitor the&#xD;
      production of the RBC components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a subject is randomized, only study RBCs (Test or Control, per the subject's&#xD;
      randomization) should be dispensed and transfused during the acute transfusion support period&#xD;
      (Day 0 to Day 7 post surgery, hospital discharge, or death, whichever is first), as&#xD;
      clinically indicated and determined by the treating physician. In rare exceptions where study&#xD;
      RBCs are unavailable or patient's need for RBC transfusions exceeds the quantity of study&#xD;
      RBCs in inventory at the hospital blood bank (e.g. during a Massive Transfusion Protocol), a&#xD;
      transfusion using non-study RBC (conventional) may be given to provide the patient with an&#xD;
      appropriate and necessary treatment. In this case, a protocol deviation should be documented.&#xD;
      If a study RBC transfusion is given after randomization before surgery commences, a protocol&#xD;
      deviation should also be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment assessments will be divided into an acute transfusion support period starting the&#xD;
      day of surgery during which study RBC (Test or Control) are administered, a post-surgical&#xD;
      follow-up period of a minimum of 28 days after the last study transfusion to collect&#xD;
      additional safety data, a clinical assessment at day 30 after surgery specifically for&#xD;
      mortality and RRT status, and a visit at day 75 (±15) after the last study transfusion to&#xD;
      assess mortality and RRT status, and collect samples for serological screening for antibodies&#xD;
      specific to INTERCEPT RBCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, anesthesia and surgical procedures will be performed according to the local&#xD;
      standards of care. Following the acute transfusion support period (Day 0 to Day 7), subjects&#xD;
      may receive conventional RBC components if additional transfusions are needed, as indicated&#xD;
      by their treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Assessments: Monitoring and Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline through Acute Transfusion Support Period (Pre-Op Day -1 to Post-Op Day 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic and laboratory measures will be assessed pre-operatively (Day -1, Baseline) and&#xD;
      daily as available in the medical record from post operative Day 1 through Day 7, hospital&#xD;
      discharge or death, whichever occurs first. If a subject is discharged prior to Day 7 but&#xD;
      returns to the study site for a standard of care visit on Day 7, blood samples should be&#xD;
      obtained on that day for a complete blood count and sCr determination. Randomized subjects&#xD;
      who do not receive an RBC transfusion following randomization to within the first 48 hours&#xD;
      after surgery will be discontinued from the study and replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic parameters that will be monitored include heart rate, blood pressure, mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure, central venous pressure (CVP), and peripheral oxygen saturation via pulse&#xD;
      oximetry probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory parameters that will be monitored include BUN, creatinine (sCr), AST, ALT,&#xD;
      fibrinogen, bilirubin, troponin, hemoglobin, and platelet counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample for sCr will be taken at 48 (±4 hours) after completion of surgery, and sCr&#xD;
      will be determined on a daily basis during the acute transfusion support period up to 7 days&#xD;
      post-surgery. Other parameters will be collected on eCRFs only when available in the medical&#xD;
      record, i.e., it is not mandatory to order or obtain other labs daily if not performed as a&#xD;
      standard of care. Laboratory parameters will be measured by a CLIA accredited local&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of radiographic contrast media will be documented starting 7 days prior to surgery,&#xD;
      as will details related to the specific surgical procedure (type of procedure, start and end&#xD;
      times, RBC components transfused, all other blood components transfused, estimated blood loss&#xD;
      from the surgical procedure, concomitant medications, intraoperative cell recovery and&#xD;
      reinfusion, hemodilution procedures, and nadir temperature. Additionally, daily estimated&#xD;
      blood loss from chest tube(s) and from other sources, and day of chest tube removal will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfusion reactions, AEs and SAEs will be assessed on a daily basis and documented in the&#xD;
      eCRF from the start of the first study transfusion through post-operative Day 7 and as&#xD;
      available through day 28 after the last study transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative Day 8 to 28 Days After Last Study Transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be monitored for transfusion reactions, AEs and SAEs following the 7-day acute&#xD;
      transfusion support period, through 28 days after the last study transfusion or death,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first, according to the local standard of care. In an outpatient setting,&#xD;
      weekly telephone surveillance calls to the subject will be performed in order to collect&#xD;
      safety events until the next follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      28 (±3) Days After Last Study Transfusion or Premature Discontinuation from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have been discharged should be scheduled for the follow up visit 28 (±3) days&#xD;
      after the last study transfusion to obtain additional safety information, including&#xD;
      patient-reported AEs/ SAEs; laboratory results including sCr, DAT/ IAT; a sample for HLA&#xD;
      antibodies and antibodies specific to INTERCEPT RBCs will be obtained, either in hospital or&#xD;
      at clinic visit. All randomized subjects who receive any study RBC transfusion must have&#xD;
      their vital status documented at this visit, or earlier if the subject dies prior to the&#xD;
      visit. If a subject has been discharged, other safety information (e.g., AEs and SAEs) may be&#xD;
      obtained through medical records, the subject's physician, or a telephone interview with&#xD;
      either the subject or a family member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 Days After Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      All randomized subjects who receive a study RBC transfusion must have their vital status and&#xD;
      need for RRT documented at Day 30 after surgery. RRT that is provided prophylactically during&#xD;
      surgery while patient is on a bypass machine (the pump), does not meet this endpoint. The&#xD;
      vital status and RRT assessment on Day 30 can be performed either from the medical records,&#xD;
      from a phone call to the subject or family, or during the visit 28±3 days after the last&#xD;
      study transfusion (only if the last study transfusion was given at day 2 or later in the&#xD;
      acute transfusion support period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study: 75 (±15 Days) After last Study Transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      75 (±15) days after the last study transfusion (End of Study), serum samples for antibodies&#xD;
      specific for INTERCEPT RBCs will be obtained, either in hospital, at a clinic visitor or&#xD;
      offsite. Mortality and the need for RRT will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study data and safety will be monitored by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Board (DSMB). The primary mission of the DSMB is to ensure patient safety and protocol&#xD;
      compliance for data collection. The DSMB will be assembled by the Sponsor and composed of&#xD;
      transfusion medicine and other experts as per the DSMB charter. DSMB members will be&#xD;
      independent of the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Analysis and Early Stopping Rule&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aside from the blinded interim analysis for sample size re-estimation*, no other interim&#xD;
      analysis is planned for this study to compare treatment differences with respect to efficacy&#xD;
      or safety at any time prior to the completion of the study. Specific stopping rules, defined&#xD;
      for safety considerations, are defined in Section 4.6 of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *A blinded interim analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed after&#xD;
      approximately 300 patients have been treated in both treatment groups combined. The sample&#xD;
      size will be reassessed and may be adjusted to ensure adequate power in consultation with the&#xD;
      FDA at that time.&#xD;
