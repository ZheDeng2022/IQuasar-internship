  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From 3 large patient databases, patients diagnosed with AMD who have never taken&#xD;
      levodopa(L-DOPA) containing medications have a mean age of diagnosis at 71 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have been treated with L-DOPA containing medications have a mean age of&#xD;
      diagnosis of AMD at 79 years. L-DOPA binds to GPR143 in the retinal pigment epithelium, and&#xD;
      releases PEDF, which protects the retina and downregulates VEGF, which is the cause of&#xD;
      neovascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will evaluate the safety and tolerability of carbidopa-levodopa in patients&#xD;
      with Neovascular AMD, and measure the effects on visual acuity and retinal abnormalities due&#xD;
      to &quot;wet&quot; (neovascular) AMD. The Investigators will evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      carbidopa-levodopa in patients with Dry AMD and Geographic Atrophy, and measure the effects&#xD;
      on visual acuity, area of geographic atrophy and other retinal abnormalities due to &quot;dry&quot;&#xD;
      AMD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness, in individuals&#xD;
      over the age of 50, in the developed world. AMD becomes more common as people age, and is&#xD;
      more common in lightly pigmented individuals. AMD appears more common in patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease, than in those without. The AREDS nutritional supplements are effective&#xD;
      in slowing the progress of intermediate AMD(5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most AMD is &quot;dry AMD&quot;, which progresses relatively slowly and may impair vision, but usually&#xD;
      does not lead to legal blindness. There are two forms of AMD, &quot;wet AMD&quot; and geographic&#xD;
      atrophy (GA), that can cause more profound vision loss. In aggregate they occur in about 25%&#xD;
      patients with AMD. Wet AMD is due to new growth of abnormal blood vessels under the retina.&#xD;
      The new blood vessels are believed to be due to an excessive release of vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor (VEGF) by the retinal pigment epithelium(RPE) cells. Wet AMD is now effectively&#xD;
      treated with intraocular injections of VEGF inhibitors. Geographic Atrophy, the other form of&#xD;
      advanced AMD, represents focal death of the RPE cells and overlying neurosensory retina.&#xD;
      There is no current treatment for GA. It is suspected that GA is due in part to a localized&#xD;
      inflammatory response, damage to RPE cells and loss of RPE cell function. It may also be&#xD;
      speculated that stimulation of RPE cells to release a potent neurotrophic factor, pigment&#xD;
      epithelium derived factor (PEDF) may slow progression of GA. In 2008, Dr. Brian McKay&#xD;
      identified a receptor, G protein coupled receptor&#xD;
&#xD;
      #143(GPR143), on the surface of RPE cells and discovered that L-DOPA was the natural ligand&#xD;
      or stimulator of GPR143. Dr McKay showed that treatment of RPE cells with exogenous L-DOPA&#xD;
      resulted in the release of additional PEDF. In subsequent work Dr McKay's group also showed&#xD;
      that L-DOPA stimulation of PEDF in RPE cells was also associated with a decrease in VEGF.&#xD;
      Thus, Dr McKay hypothesized that exogenous LDOPA may prevent the onset of AMD or progression&#xD;
      to wet AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015, Dr McKay and his associates published a paper that showed that patients, who had&#xD;
      been treated with L-DOPA, had a delay in the onset of AMD by 8 years, compared to patients&#xD;
      who had not been treated with L-DOPA. In addition, those who had AMD and went on to develop&#xD;
      wet AMD, did so 5 years later than those with no history of L-DOPA treatment. L-DOPA is an&#xD;
      intermediate in the pigmentation pathway. Dr McKay and his associates suggested that the&#xD;
      reason darkly pigmented races do not get AMD nearly as frequently as lighter pigmented races,&#xD;
      is that they produce more pigment, and thus more L-DOPA to stimulate GPR143 on RPE cells.&#xD;
      According to this hypothesis, the stimulated RPE cells release PEDF and decrease VEGF, which&#xD;
      together are responsible for the protective effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacology of L-DOPA and carbidopa:&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-DOPA is formed by 3-hydroxylation of tyrosine by tyrosine-3-monooxygenase (tyrosinase).(18)&#xD;
      The primary metabolic pathway of L-DOPA is decarboxylation by amino acid decarboxylase to&#xD;
      dopamine, which is responsible for most, but not all, of its pharmacologic effects and&#xD;
      toxicity. When carbidopa is administered with LDOPA, systemic levels of L-DOPA double and&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS) L-DOPA increases from about 1% of the administered dose to about&#xD;
      4%. Levodopa freely passes from the systemic circulation into the retina and brain, but&#xD;
      dopamine and carbidopa do not. Adverse events are markedly decreased when carbidopa is&#xD;
      administered with L-DOPA, because systemic levels of the toxic metabolite of L-DOPA,&#xD;
      dopamine, are markedly reduced. In most patients, 25 mg of carbidopa is sufficient to control&#xD;
      side effects of 100 mg of L-DOPA, primarily nausea, by 90%. L-DOPA is the natural ligand for&#xD;
      GPR143 in the RPE cells. The Investigators' intent is to increase the L-DOPA available to RPE&#xD;
      surface receptors (GPR 143) while minimizing peripheral toxicity. This concept is unique,&#xD;
      because all other uses of L-DOPA rely on CNS conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine, in order to&#xD;
      produce the desired effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there are no established animal models for AMD, and L-DOPA has a good safety profile in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and patients with Parkinson's disease, the Investigators propose a&#xD;
      prospective experiment to determine the safety and tolerability of L-DOPA, in a population of&#xD;
      patients with AMD. The participants will be made aware of potential side effects of L-DOPA,&#xD;
      which are listed in the Informed Consent, during the consent process. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      elicited by questioning the participants at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will also be advised to call the site, if they have any medical problem&#xD;
      between visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will also use this study to examine whether L-DOPA has a positive effect on&#xD;
      visual acuity and pathologic retinal changes of &quot;dry&quot; AMD with geographic atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameters to be evaluated are best corrected ETDRS visual acuity, area of geographic&#xD;
      atrophy by Fundus AutoFluorescence (FAF), macular thickness by spectral domain optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (SD OCT), new blood (hemorrhage) by direct retinal examination, and&#xD;
      subjective decrease in vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will receive randomly assigned, single blind, commercially available&#xD;
      carbidopa-levodopa 25-100 mg, two tablets once daily hs, or two tablets dosed TID (three&#xD;
      times daily), in the morning, with supper and hs for one month, or placebo two tablets dosed&#xD;
      three times daily, in the morning, with supper and hs (200-600 mg of levodopa daily). This is&#xD;
      the equivalent of low to moderate doses of carbidopa-levodopa in patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (daily dose of levodopa 200-800 mg). If a study participant experiences non-serious,&#xD;
      but bothersome adverse effects while taking the study medication, the dose may be reduced to&#xD;
      1 tablet hs, or 1 tablet TID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects: 154 randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: 12 months of treatment, with visits at Baseline, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months, 9 months and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: A statistically significant difference in progression of area of geographic&#xD;
      atrophy with carbidopa-levodopa treatment compared to treatment with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and Activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Informed Consent at Baseline;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ophthalmic history and comprehensive eye examination; including visual acuity, with best&#xD;
           optical correction, using an EDTRS chart, in both eyes prior to randomization,&#xD;
           ophthalmoscopic examination, a subjective vision questionnaire and SD OCT with FAF;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Repeat assessment of visual acuity using an EDTRS chart, subjective vision&#xD;
           questionnaire, ophthalmoscopic examination, and SD OCT at 1, 3, 6 9, and 12 month&#xD;

&#xD;
        8. Pill count at visits 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7;&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Non-directed assessment of adverse events at each visit, including classification as to&#xD;
           severity, seriousness and body system.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Concomitant medications at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: Statistics will be generated for, at a minimum, , area of geographic atrophty,&#xD;
      ETDRS visual acuity, central retinal thickness and presence of hemorrhage. Within patient&#xD;
      trajectories for these outcomes will be plotted, incorporating information on dose and&#xD;
      duration. Analysis of Variance may be conducted to relate logarithm of dose and duration of&#xD;
      treatment to the outcomes listed above.&#xD;
