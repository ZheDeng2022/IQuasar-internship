  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) was introduced by Jalan and Williams in&#xD;
      2002 to describe the acute deterioration in liver function over 2 to 4 weeks in a patient&#xD;
      with well-compensated cirrhosis associated with a precipitating event (hepatotoxic:&#xD;
      superimposed hepatitis viral infection, drug-induced liver injury, hepatotoxins, or excessive&#xD;
      alcohol consumption; extra hepatic: variceal bleeding or sepsis), leading to severe&#xD;
      deterioration in clinical status with jaundice and hepatic encephalopathy and/or HRS.&#xD;
      Following this concept, several proposals for the diagnostic criteria of ACLF have been&#xD;
      suggested.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There may be regional differences in etiology, pathogenesis, and natural course of ACLF,&#xD;
      which may in turn influence the overall outcome of this syndrome. So, proper diagnosis of&#xD;
      ACLF and its precipitating factors in our locality enable us for proper management of these&#xD;
      cases and dealing with these precipitating factors to be avoided later on in patients with&#xD;
      liver cirrhosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the pattern of acute on chronic liver cell failure (ACLF) within 28 days&#xD;
      including prevalence, percipitating factors, and outcome.&#xD;
