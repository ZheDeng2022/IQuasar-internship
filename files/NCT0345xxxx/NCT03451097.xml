      Heart failure (HF) has been defined as an abnormality of cardiac structure or function&#xD;
      leading to failure of the heart to deliver oxygen at a rate commensurate with the&#xD;
      requirements of the metabolizing tissues, despite normal filling pressures (or only at the&#xD;
      expense of increased filling pressures). Heart failure may result from ventricular pump&#xD;
      dysfunction, volume overload with preserved pump function, and pressure overload with&#xD;
      preserved pump function.Determinations of the degree of heart failure severity are essential&#xD;
      for clinical assessment and treatment evaluation. Remarkably, no readily applied standardized&#xD;
      method of quantifying heart failure severity exists for pediatric patients. Although standard&#xD;
      index methods from the adult population, such as the New York Heart Association&#xD;
      Classification, have been applied to non-infant pediatric populations, none have been&#xD;
      validated in children. The NYHA classification measures functional capacity, not heart&#xD;
      failure severity. The NYHA classification is inappropriate for use in pediatrics because&#xD;
      functional capacity and responses to heart failure states differ in children compared with&#xD;
      adults. Children have markedly different cardiac physiology, clinical presentations, and&#xD;
      compensatory mechanisms. Moreover, the etiologies of heart failure in children are very&#xD;
      different from those in adults. For these reasons, Ross et al.,developed a scale that is&#xD;
      useful for grading heart failure severity in infants from birth to 6 months of age but is not&#xD;
      applicable to older children and adolescents (Original Ross Classification).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many have since used the &quot;Ross Classification,&quot; including Wu et al., who confirmed an&#xD;
      incremental rise in PNE (Plasma Norepinephrine) concentrations and progressive&#xD;
      down-regulation of Î²-receptor density in children with increasing Ross class. In 1994, the&#xD;
      Canadian Cardiovascular Society's Consensus Conference statement on the &quot;Diagnosis and&#xD;
      Management of Heart Failure,&quot; adopted the Ross Classification as their official scoring&#xD;
      system for children. Ross propose an age-based Ross classification using the original&#xD;
      variables that proved to be sensitive and specific and adding the new evidence-based data.&#xD;
      The age ranges of 0-3 months, 4-12 months, 1-3 years, 4-8 years, and 9-18 years were chosen&#xD;
      because the variables in the classification are generally stable during these periods but&#xD;
      vary between them. The scoring system can be used as a continuous data set for comparison&#xD;
      with outcomes, or it can be categorized by points.&#xD;
