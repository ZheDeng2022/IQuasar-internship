  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyponatremia was defined as a serum sodium concentration &lt;135 mmol/L that occurred at least&#xD;
      once during a patient's hospital stay from admission to discharge. Elderly patients with&#xD;
      fragility fractures are particularly susceptible to hyponatremia because of their impaired&#xD;
      physiology, multiple comorbidities (such as hypocortisolism, hypothyroidism, hepatic&#xD;
      cirrhosis, renal disease, and congestive heart failure), polypharmacy (e.g.,&#xD;
      antihypertensives, antidepressants, and antiepileptics), hospitalization, perioperative fluid&#xD;
      restrictions, and homeostatic stress from the fracture itself and the subsequent surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: aims to to find incidence of hyponatremia in sample of 70 elderly patients with&#xD;
      fractures around the hip, effect of hyponatremia on mental state of the patients by using&#xD;
      Modified Mini-Mental state (3MS) examination and to find mortality rate for 6 months post&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: aims to compare sample of 18 elderly hyponatremic patients with fractures around the&#xD;
      hip (case group) with sample of 10 elderly normonatremic patients with osteoartharitis of&#xD;
      knee or hip who admitted for elective joint replacement (control group) as regards; serum&#xD;
      sodium, 3M score, and CSF glutamate to find correlation between the cognitive status assessed&#xD;
      by 3M score and CSF glutamate as a biomarker for hyponatremia.&#xD;

      These patients are also at a higher risk of the complications of hyponatremia such as brain&#xD;
      injury, the main result of acute symptomatic hyponatremia and associated with significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Severe hyponatremia (i.e., a serum sodium concentration &lt;125 mmol/L)&#xD;
      ), if unrecognized in its first stages and left untreated, has a high rate of mortality; for&#xD;
      this reason, an accurate clinical assessment must be made, focusing on fluid status,&#xD;
      examining the potential etiology, and conducting the appropriate investigations. In&#xD;
      approximately 50% of patients, chronic hyponatremia results from inappropriate antidiuretic&#xD;
      hormone secretion. Chronic mild hyponatremia is usually asymptomatic and is traditionally&#xD;
      regarded as benign. However, it is associated with a lower bone mineral content and density&#xD;
      in nearly all regions of the hip, with more pronounced losses in the trochanteric and femoral&#xD;
      neck regions. It can also lead to osteoporosis, abnormal gait patterns, cognitive impairment,&#xD;
      bone demineralization, respiratory failure, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, falls, and&#xD;
      fractures. Compared to normonatremic individuals, hyponatremic individuals are known to have&#xD;
      a longer time from admission to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glutamate which is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in our body may play role in&#xD;
      implication of hyponatremia on the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample can be taken while&#xD;
      dripling during spinal anathesia for surgical intervention for determination of glutamate&#xD;
