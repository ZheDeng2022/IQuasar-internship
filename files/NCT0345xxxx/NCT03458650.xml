    <textblock>
      &quot;This study is a single-center, randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      designed not only to assess pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of LXI-15028 but also&#xD;
      to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of main metabolite M1 in vivo in 38 healthy&#xD;
      adult Chinese subjects after receiving escalating single oral doses of 50 mg, 100 mg and 200&#xD;
      mg and multiple oral doses of 100 mg of LXI-15028.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study includes 3 dose groups which are 50 mg (Group 1), 100 mg(Group 2) and 200 mg(Group&#xD;
      3) respectively. For 50 mg and 200 mg dose groups, each is planned to enroll 12 healthy&#xD;
      subjects (investigational drug :placebo=10:2), half males and half females. Five subjects of&#xD;
      each gender will receive LXI-15028, while 1 subject of each gender will receive placebo; 100&#xD;
      mg dose group plans to enroll 14 healthy subjects (investigational drug:placebo=10:4), half&#xD;
      males and half females. Five subjects of each gender will receive LXI-15028, while 2 subjects&#xD;
      of each gender will receive placebo. Intra-group randomization will be implemented in each&#xD;
      dose group; each subject will receive either LXI-15028 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes 2 parts of single-dose and multiple-dose administration. The single-dose&#xD;
      study will use gradually escalation dosing to evaluate the 3 doses of 50 mg, 100 mg and 200&#xD;
      mg. Within 4 days after each dose is administered, the investigators will assess the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability data to decide whether to proceed with the next escalated single dose.&#xD;
      Within 4 days of 200 mg single-dose administration, the investigators will assess the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability data to decide whether to proceed with 100 mg multiple-dose study.&#xD;
      Multiple-dose study will be investigated in 100 mg group only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of screening period, treatment period and follow-up in each dose group.&#xD;
      The treatment period in 50 mg and 200 mg dose groups include single-dose administration only.&#xD;
      While the treatment period in 100 mg dose group includes both single-dose and multiple-dose&#xD;
      administration. The subjects in 100 mg dose group will enter multiple-dose period following&#xD;
      completing single-dose period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In escalated single-dose study, the subjects in each dose group will receive single oral dose&#xD;
      of 50 mg LXI-15028 tablet or 1 matching placebo tablet at fasted state, or 100 mg LXI-15028&#xD;
      tablet or matching placebo 1 tablet, or 2 100 mg LXI-15028 tablets or 2 matching placebo&#xD;
      tablets. Blood samples will be collected before administration (0h), and 15 min (0.25h), 30&#xD;
      min (0.5h), 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 2.5h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 48h and 72h after administration.&#xD;
      In multiple-dose study, the subjects will continuously receive oral 100 mg LXI-15028 tablet&#xD;
      or 1 matching placebo tablet once daily (QD) for 10 times. Blood samples of trough&#xD;
      concentration will be collected before the 8th to 10th administration (0h) in multiple-dose&#xD;
      study. And blood samples will be collected at 15 min (0.25h), 30 min (0.5h), 1h, 1.5h, 2h,&#xD;
      2.5h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 48h and 72h after the 10th administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected blood samples will be processed to obtain plasma. Liquid Chromatographic(LC)&#xD;
      /Mass Spectra(MS)/Mass Spectra (MS) method will be used to determine plasma concentrations of&#xD;
      LXI-15028 and its major metabolite M1 in order to evaluate the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      characteristics of LXI-15028 and its metabolite M1 after oral administration of LXI-15028&#xD;
      tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety will be assessed by physical examination, vital signs, ECG, laboratory&#xD;
      examinations and adverse events in subjects receiving LXI-15028 tablet.&#xD;
