      This study is to examine whether the efficacy of DBT for BN is comparable with drug&#xD;
      treatment, whether short-term and long-term efficacy of DBT combined with drug treatment of&#xD;
      BN is better than single DBT or single drug treatment, and trying to explore predictable&#xD;
      biological indicators of short-term and long-term efficacy of DBT for BN. Our study will use&#xD;
      multi-center randomized controlled study design. 165 outpatients with BN will be recruited&#xD;
      from Shanghai Mental Health Center, No.6 Hospital of Peking University and Shanghai Tongji&#xD;
      Hospital. There will be three groups: DBT treatment group, Fluoxetine treatment group, DBT&#xD;
      combined with fluoxetine treatment group. We prepare to recruit 165 patients with BN ,and&#xD;
      each group is 55, and then three groups will be given standard intervention for 12 weeks. To&#xD;
      assess the eating disorder symptoms, impulsive and emotional change, clinical symptom scales,&#xD;
      psychological scales and the security indexs will be used at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12&#xD;
      weeks (end of treatment), 16weeks(1 month after treatment),24 weeks (3 months after&#xD;
      treatment) and 36 weeks (6 months after treatment follow-up). Furthermore, brain MRI will be&#xD;
      used for DBT treatment group at baseline, and 36 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bulimia nervosa(BN) is a chronic and refractory mental disorder characteristic of recurrent&#xD;
      binge eating and weight control which mostly occur in adolescents and young women. The&#xD;
      life-time prevalence ranges from 1.0%-4.2%, while in middle school and university, the&#xD;
      prevalence can be 4.7-17%, and keep increasing. The recurrence rate of BN is also high, which&#xD;
      can reach 25-63% six months after recovery. The nature cause can last several years showing a&#xD;
      chronic feature. Patients with BN can also suffer from other severe psychosomatic&#xD;
      complications, which harm the patients physical and mental health, thus lead to a mortality&#xD;
      of 1% and negative impact on patients life and his/her family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antidepressant fluoxetine can reduce binge eating and purging behaviors in BN patients in a&#xD;
      short time. It is the only drug approved by the US FDA for the treatment of BN, and also&#xD;
      helps to prevent recurrence. However, there are still a considerable proportion of patients&#xD;
      who keep a poor response to the medication. Cognitive behavioral therapy, Interpersonal&#xD;
      therapy and other traditional psychotherapy are effective for BN patients, however, as many&#xD;
      as 50% of BN patients still have ED symptoms. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a more&#xD;
      effective new treatment method. Dialectical behavior therapy as a new and effective&#xD;
      psychological therapy in the treatment of BN, proven to reduce binge eating, purging&#xD;
      behaviors and non-suicidal act of self harm in adolescents and adults in foreign countries,&#xD;
      now shows its superiority in the treatment of BN. At present, because of an acute shortage of&#xD;
      psychotherapists in China, carrying out the DBT group is significant. However, currently&#xD;
      there are no related research reports in china.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to examine whether the efficacy of DBT for BN is comparable with drug&#xD;
      treatment, whether short-term and long-term efficacy of DBT combined with drug treatment of&#xD;
      BN is better than single DBT or single drug treatment, and trying to explore predictable&#xD;
      biological indicators of short-term and long-term efficacy of DBT for BN. This study will use&#xD;
      multi-center randomized controlled study design. 165 outpatients with BN will be recruited&#xD;
      from Shanghai Mental Health Center, No.6 Hospital of Peking University and Shanghai Tongji&#xD;
      Hospital. This study will use multi-center randomized controlled study design. 165&#xD;
      outpatients with BN will be recruited from Shanghai Mental Health Center, No.6 Hospital of&#xD;
      Peking University and Shanghai Tongji Hospital. There will be three groups: DBT treatment&#xD;
      group, Fluoxetine treatment group, DBT combined with fluoxetine treatment group. The&#xD;
      investigator prepare to recruit 165 patients with BN ,and each group is 55, and then three&#xD;
      groups will be given standard intervention for 12 weeks. To assess the eating disorder&#xD;
      symptoms, impulsive and emotional change, clinical symptom scales, psychological scales and&#xD;
      the security indexs will be used at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks (end of treatment),&#xD;
      16weeks(1 month after treatment),24 weeks (3 months after treatment) and 36 weeks (6 months&#xD;
      after treatment follow-up). Furthermore, brain MRI will be used for DBT treatment group at&#xD;
      baseline, and 36 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed with sufficient consideration about innovation as well as&#xD;
      feasibility, and is to be operated on well proved theoretical basis and guidance of an&#xD;
      operation manual. If successful, results of this study may bring great improvement to&#xD;
      clinical practice of this refractory mental disorder.&#xD;
