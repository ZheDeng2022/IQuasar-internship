      The Purpose of this project is to implement ENABLE (Educate, Nurture, Advise, Before Life&#xD;
      Ends) at four community cancer practices that have a high percentage of rural and/or&#xD;
      medically-underserved patients diagnosed with advanced cancer and their family caregivers.&#xD;
      The ENABLE principal investigator (PI) and the Coordinating Center team are located at the&#xD;
      University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Site teams are - Spartanburg SC/Gibbs Cancer&#xD;
      Center, Birmingham VA Medical Center, University of South Alabama/Mitchell Cancer Institute,&#xD;
      UAB Division of Gynecologic Oncology and UAB Department of Hematology Oncology.&#xD;

      ENABLE is an evidence-based concurrent oncology palliative care model that is ready for&#xD;
      implementation. It can overcome the barriers created by rural geography and addresses the&#xD;
      often unrecognized and unmet needs of the family caregivers. The EIT is an emerging&#xD;
      conceptual model for translating evidence into practice. The central core is the linkage&#xD;
      between evidence and stakeholders. Successful implementation results from the interaction of&#xD;
      Intervention Program/Policy (ENABLE), Implementation Processes (community-based participatory&#xD;
      research methods[CBPR] within a learning collaborative) and the Practical Progress Measures&#xD;
      (RE-AIM). On-going consideration of the Multi-level Context is pivotal to successful&#xD;
      implementation. This approach has the potential to have a high impact on reducing disparities&#xD;
      resulting from the gap between ASCO recommendations and current oncology and palliative care&#xD;
      practices in rural patients and families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Urgent Need to Improve Rural Palliative and End-of-life Care for Patients and Caregivers&#xD;
      According to the 2010 US Census data, nearly 60 million citizens live in rural or&#xD;
      non-metropolitan areas; however, less than 10% of the 833 US palliative care programs are&#xD;
      located in rural areas (data provided by the Center to Advance Palliative Care Registry).&#xD;
      Rural advanced cancer patients are vulnerable and at high risk of experiencing social&#xD;
      isolation and disparities in palliative care due to long distances from treatment centers,&#xD;
      low population density, and limited clinical expertise (because rural primary care clinicians&#xD;
      and hospices programs have relatively few terminally-ill patients.) Rural location is related&#xD;
      to less and later hospice use. Hence, most rural cancer patients are unlikely to have access&#xD;
      to interdisciplinary team-based palliative and hospice care recommended by ASCO2 and National&#xD;
      Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. These patients will lack this expertise or be&#xD;
      transferred to a distant site for palliation.6 Patients transferred to distant tertiary care&#xD;
      settings are at high risk of spending their last days or weeks of life far from home and&#xD;
      loved ones. Conversely, rural patients may suffer during their last weeks or days of life&#xD;
      without the benefit of state-of-art treatments of pain or other causes of distress. A US&#xD;
      palliative care report card identified rural location as high risk for little access to&#xD;
      palliative care. By definition, palliative care includes family caregiver support. An&#xD;
      estimated million Americans are informal caregivers defined as an unpaid individual who&#xD;
      assist someone with functional impairment with activities of their daily living to some&#xD;
      degree. Informal caregiving can have deleterious effects on the caregivers' physical and&#xD;
      emotional health; a phenomenon referred to as caregiver burden. A recent meta- analysis&#xD;
      showed that cancer caregivers in particular, compared to non-caregiver controls, exhibited&#xD;
      higher levels of stress and depression, and lower subjective well-being and physical health.&#xD;
      ENABLE includes the evidence-based, caregiver-specific COPE (Creativity, Optimism, Planning,&#xD;
      Expert information) intervention, developed by McMillan and colleagues. COPE, based in&#xD;
      problem-solving education theory, is designed to improve caregivers' creative&#xD;
      problem-solving, realistic optimism, reasonable goal-setting, and knowledge/utilization of&#xD;
      relevant resources. Compared to usual care, two weeks post-intervention, caregivers in COPE&#xD;
      showed improvements in caregiver burden and overall QOL. COPE is the basis of the ACS&#xD;
      caregiving guide and has been adapted for caregivers in other diseases.&#xD;

    <description>The General Organizational Index (GOI) is used to describe the organizational strengths of an organization serving healthcare. The total range of the score would be 12 (lowest - no implementation of good organizational structure) to 60 (full implemented organizational structure). The score is derived from 12 categories which are assigned a score of 1 (no implementation) to 5 (fully implemented); hence a total possible score of 12 - 60.</description>
