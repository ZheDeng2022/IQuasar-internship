      Study compares four portable vision measurement and eye-imaging technologies in terms of&#xD;
      accuracy and time and ease of use with older adult (ages 40-100) participants in a&#xD;
      developing-country setting (India). Specifically, the five portable devices will be measured&#xD;
      against the baseline of the traditional eye-examination techniques, including the use of eye&#xD;
      charts and phoropters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a large and increasingly costly problem for India.&#xD;
      Recent research estimates that NCDs could cost the Indian economy US$6.2 trillion from&#xD;
      2012-2030 if left unaddressed. For some NCDs, new solutions will need to be developed for&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment, while, for others, the necessary interventions exist but are not&#xD;
      readily available to all who need them. Visual impairment is one area of health in which&#xD;
      limited access to diagnostic and treatment technologies jeopardizes the health and economic&#xD;
      well-being of the population. This is particularly true in India, where the population is&#xD;
      rapidly aging and, despite the presence of some high-quality medical facilities, there&#xD;
      remains a large burden of unaddressed visual impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loss of visual acuity can negatively impact individual and household income by reducing&#xD;
      productivity or hours worked among the visually impaired; it can also affect economic&#xD;
      wellbeing via the need for caretakers. There are two key tests that determine visual acuity&#xD;
      and measure vision loss:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Basic visual acuity (BVA), which is assessed using the naked eye or, when applicable,&#xD;
           eyeglasses, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), which uses refraction to determine eyeglass/contact&#xD;
           lens prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, diagnosing vision-hindering eye conditions requires specific medications or&#xD;
      surgical procedures. Diagnosis of glaucoma, cataracts, or diabetic retinopathy typically&#xD;
      requires a physician to examine a patient's retinas, corneas, and/or pupils at close range&#xD;
      using specialized equipment, in conjunction with the visual acuity tests described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BCVA tests typically require heavy, cumbersome, and expensive equipment such as phoropters&#xD;
      (instruments that measure the refractive state of the eye). Likewise, eye diseases typically&#xD;
      require the use of specialized equipment such as slit lamp microscopes, ophthalmoscopes, and&#xD;
      tonometers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the recent and anticipated availability of affordable and lightweight portable&#xD;
      technologies which can be used both by medical professionals and by trained laypeople has&#xD;
      made eye testing easier and faster. This study will validate a number of new handheld devices&#xD;
      developed for visual acuity measurement and retinal imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study explores testing for visual acuity and other impairments like diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and cataract without the use&#xD;
      of traditional stationery and expensive instruments such as phoropters and conventional&#xD;
      autorefractors and at a comparatively low cost. If the devices are proven able to accurately&#xD;
      evaluate visual acuity and produce high-quality retinal images that can be used to aid&#xD;
      diagnosis, it will be a breakthrough in reducing barriers of access to eye care facilities&#xD;
      encountered by the majority of the rural population in India and other developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, since these devices are convenient and relatively easy to use, they can be easily used&#xD;
      in household/community surveys involving vision measurement; the investigators are proposing&#xD;
      to perform data collection for this study in India partially in order to investigate the&#xD;
      potential for use of one or more of handheld devices in upcoming waves of the Longitudinal&#xD;
      Aging Study in India (Protocol Number 16715), a nationally-representative aging and&#xD;
      retirement study that collects data on multiple dimensions of aging, including socioeconomic,&#xD;
      cognitive, and health indicators with the aim of informing national policy and practice&#xD;
      relating to older adults. Specifically, the study involves an extensive biomarkers module&#xD;
      which includes direct measurement of multiple medical and anthropometric indicators, such as&#xD;
      blood pressure, grip strength, lung function, height, and weight. The current version of the&#xD;
      biomarkers module calls for the use of a traditional eye chart to measure BVA; however,&#xD;
      future versions of the study would greatly benefit from the use, if feasible, of portable and&#xD;
      inexpensive devices which would allow researchers to collect richer and more accurate data on&#xD;
      visual acuity and/or eye conditions and therefore provide a more detailed picture on older&#xD;
      adults' eye health, as well as the predictors and correlates of eye health, on a national&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the data gained from this study, the investigators hope to be able to develop useful&#xD;
      recommendations for researchers, community health organizations, and health care&#xD;
      professionals whose studies and patients would benefit from access to relatively low-cost&#xD;
      portable vision measurement and retinal imaging devices. In particular, Indian consumers will&#xD;
      have access to all devices pending market approval.&#xD;
