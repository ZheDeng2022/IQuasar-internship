    <textblock>
      The mOm Incubator is a collapsible infant incubator designed to provide a level of&#xD;
      thermoregulation that meets the standards set for conventional incubators whilst being low&#xD;
      cost and space-saving. Babies recruited will be clinically stable, at least 30 weeks&#xD;
      gestational age and require at least 48 hours incubator care. A standard or test incubator&#xD;
      will be used for the first 24 hours chosen randomly, then the baby will be moved to the over&#xD;
      arm for a further 24 hours.&#xD;

      Investigators will recruit babies who are in the Neonatal Unit at St. Peter's Hospital.&#xD;
      Babies will be clinically stable from a cardio-respiratory point of view. They will also be&#xD;
      requiring incubator care (so they will weigh less than approximately 1400g) but not requiring&#xD;
      additional humidification. This effectively excludes babies born less than 30 weeks gestation&#xD;
      who are routinely humidified for the first week (if 28-30 weeks gestation) or two weeks (if&#xD;
      less than 28 weeks gestation). Some term babies may also be eligible for the study if they&#xD;
      are being nursed in an incubator for clinical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification and recruitment of babies will be carried out by the attending Consultant&#xD;
      Neonatologist and the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For twins, consecutive enrolment will be possible if only one mOm incubator is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two arms to the protocol. The first arm will consist of standard incubator&#xD;
      care, where the care of the baby is unchanged, but non-invasive, more frequent (hourly)&#xD;
      temperature and other physiological measures of stability than would normally be collected in&#xD;
      routine care (nominally every three hours) will be collected. The second arm will be the baby&#xD;
      receiving normal care in the mOm incubator, with another set of hourly detailed,&#xD;
      non-invasive, observations. The planned care and monitoring of the baby will be otherwise&#xD;
      unchanged. No additional blood tests or any other invasive testing or monitoring are&#xD;
      required. The clinical team will have full control and responsibility for the baby's care and&#xD;
      can terminate the study for the baby at any time for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, investigators will collect the views of staff on the baby's comfort, visibility,&#xD;
      care, usability and acceptability during each arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each arm of the study, the secondary outcome measures are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) pulse rate (as a measure of clinical stability) (2) respiratory rate (as a measure of&#xD;
      clinical stability) (3) apnea and bradycardia episodes recorded by nursing staff (clinical&#xD;
      stability) (4) temperature (as a measure of clinical stability) (4) adverse events related to&#xD;
      incubator performance (5) cleaning ease and time took (6) set up time (7) staff structured&#xD;
      feedback&#xD;
&#xD;
      36 eligible babies will be recruited into the study at a single site, being identified by the&#xD;
      clinical team. All 36 will experience a 24 hour period in each of the two incubators (mOm and&#xD;
      standard) (48 hours in total), in a randomly allocated order. Babies will act as their own&#xD;
      controls in this cross-over study design. If any babies fail to complete the 48-hour study&#xD;
      procedures (e.g. due to data incomplete or baby withdrawn) further babies will be recruited&#xD;
      to achieve 36 complete datasets.&#xD;
