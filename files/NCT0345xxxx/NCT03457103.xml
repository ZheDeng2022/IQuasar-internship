    <textblock>
      Capnometry-Assisted Breathing Training for COPD (CATCH) is a behavioral intervention that&#xD;
      aims to promote optimal, self-regulated, mindful breathing. A portable capnometer is used&#xD;
      in-session to provide continuous visual feedback of Respiratory Rate (RR), End-Tidal Carbon&#xD;
      Dioxide Tension (ETCO2), and breathing pattern. The tailored CATCH intervention will&#xD;
      emphasize a slow, quiet, regular, nasal breathing pattern, as well as pursed lips breathing&#xD;
      (PLB). CATCH is once weekly for 6 weeks, for a total of 6 sessions; each session is&#xD;
      approximately 60 minutes long. The principal investigator will implement the CATCH&#xD;
      intervention. The principal investigator will implement the CATCH intervention. Patients will&#xD;
      use the Address Stress app on a smart phone or computer tablet as part of their home&#xD;
      breathing exercises.&#xD;
