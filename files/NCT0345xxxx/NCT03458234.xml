      This study offers focal therapy for prostate cancer by using an intra-urethral&#xD;
      radiotransponder temporarily placed during radiotherapy. The study aims to improve the&#xD;
      risk-benefit ratio of therapy for early prostate cancer and potentially lessen symptom burden&#xD;
      over time.&#xD;

      This study offers focal stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer by using an&#xD;
      intra-urethral radiotransponder placed temporarily during each of the 5 radiotherapy&#xD;
      treatments. The study aims to improve the risk-benefit ratio of therapy for early prostate&#xD;
      cancer and potentially lessen symptom burden over time while also accessing early efficacy,&#xD;
      late toxicity, and overall quality of life post-treatment. Patients will be followed for 24&#xD;
      months (2 years) with follow-up appointments at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.&#xD;

    <description>This study will enroll patients that have a confirmed histology of prostate cancer. They will undergo a 3T MRI scan as well as a CT simulation with 16 French Foley Catheter containing dummy beacons for treatment planning purposes. The patient will then receive focal stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) at a dose of 40 gy in 5 total fractions. Patients will be followed for 24 total months with specific follow-ups at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.</description>

    <intervention_name>16 French Foley Catheter</intervention_name>
    <description>A Foley catheter is a medical apparatus that creates a passageway for the drainage and collection of urine. This type of catheter is made of a pliable material that indwells into an individual's bladder by way of the urethra.&#xD;
Featuring two separate channels down the tube, Foley catheters allow absolute stability and safe extraction. One channel of the catheter, by method of a balloon, is stabilized in a bladder; the other channel allows for the passage and collection of urine, by means of a leg bag or bedside drainage bag.&#xD;
Foley catheters are usually constructed out of either silicone or latex.</description>
