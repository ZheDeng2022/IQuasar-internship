  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the effect of treatment for acquired speech&#xD;
      impairment can be enhanced by combining effective behavioral treatment with non-invasive&#xD;
      brain stimulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which delivers&#xD;
      low-intensity current to the scalp, and is a safe and well-tolerated approach that poses a&#xD;
      non-significant risk to participants. tDCS provides low intensity neural stimulation which&#xD;
      has been shown to facilitate motor learning in other domains of stroke rehabilitation such as&#xD;
      arm motor learning but the potential to enhance speech motor learning has not been explored.&#xD;
      This will be examined with a series of single-case experimental designs.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    COVID-19: protocol requires a large number (20+) of specifically timed visits. Because a&#xD;
    mistimed visit would disqualify a participant, we have suspended until travel and data&#xD;
    collection can be assured.&#xD;

    <description>Introduction of the independent variable (treatment) across three different points in time. Participants will be randomly assigned to have each treatment phase begin after 3, 4, or 6 baseline sessions. This current stimulates the cortex, with anodal stimulation leading to a depolarized state in which neurons are more likely to fire.</description>
