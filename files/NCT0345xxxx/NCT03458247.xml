      The purpose of this study is to test whether a dose escalation up to 2000 mg per day of&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate is feasible and lead to disease stabilization in castration-resistant&#xD;
      metastatic prostate cancer patients who experience disease progression within the first 6&#xD;
      months of abiraterone actetate at standard dose (1000 mg/d) and have a plasma abiraterone&#xD;
      concentration below 8.5 ng/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a non-comparative phase 2 study in which patients will be included in two successive&#xD;
      steps. Patients with mCRPC will be included in the first step and treated with standard dose&#xD;
      (1000 mg/day) of ABI + prednisone /prednisolone (10 mg/d) according to the summary of product&#xD;
      characteristics and monitored for trough ABI plasma level each month for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second step intrapatient ABI dose escalation (2000 mg/day) + prednisone/prednisolone&#xD;
      (10 mg/d) will be realized for patients from the first step experiencing progressive disease&#xD;
      within 6 months of ABI standard dose and with mean ABI plasma level during the first three&#xD;
      months &lt; 8.5 ng/mL&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) causes approximately 307,500 deaths&#xD;
      annually worldwide. mCRPC has been defined as a clinical state in which, despite suppressed&#xD;
      circulating testosterone levels lower than 50 ng/dL, the androgen receptor axis is&#xD;
      reactivated. This reactivation is mainly due to the multiple signaling mechanisms in prostate&#xD;
      cancer cells along with their microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, research efforts aimed at identifying new strategies to inhibit the androgen receptor&#xD;
      axis. Abiraterone acetate (ABI) is a first-in-class inhibitor of cytochrome (CYP) 17A1, a&#xD;
      critical enzyme for extra-gonadal and testicular androgen syntheses. ABI has shown impressive&#xD;
      efficacy in treatment of mCRPC. ABI plus low-dose prednisone was first shown to improve&#xD;
      survival in mCRPC patients pre-treated with docetaxel, and the combination therapy has since&#xD;
      been approved for this purpose. Moreover, ABI plus low-dose prednisone resulted in prolonged&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) as compared with placebo plus prednisone in docetaxel-naive patients.&#xD;
      In these patients, ABI was associated with a median progression free survival of 16 months&#xD;
      and median overall survival of 35 months. However, around 40% of patients do not experience&#xD;
      PSA response to ABI therapy at 3 months. This parameter has been consistently identified as a&#xD;
      surrogate parameter of time to progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As ABI is an oral agent that is subject to both inter- and intra-individual variability in&#xD;
      bioavailability, its pharmacokinetics might be a critical parameter for its anticancer&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators first established a simple method to mesure plasma ABI concentration by HPLC.&#xD;
      They then conducted a prospective observational study in which they aimed to explore the&#xD;
      relationship between ABI trough concentration and PSA response in mCRPC patients and to&#xD;
      identify the critical determinants for its activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      73 mCRPC patients, in whom treatment with ABI was indicated, were recruited from December&#xD;
      2012 to December 2014 in the oncology department of Cochin Hospital in Paris, France. The&#xD;
      plasma concentration of ABI was determined at baseline, and then one (M1), two (M2) and three&#xD;
      (M3) months after treatment initiation. The primary study objective was to investigate the&#xD;
      relationship between ABI mean plasma trough concentration (ABI Cmin) and PSA response. PSA&#xD;
      response was defined as a PSA decline of at least 50% after receiving ABI for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In multivariate analysis, ABI Cmin was the only factor independently associated with PSA&#xD;
      response: OR=1.12, [1.0-1.3], P=0.03. Based on these results, they established an optimal&#xD;
      threshold of ABI C min by building a ROC curve. The treshold value of 8.45 ng/mL was&#xD;
      associated with a specificity of and sensitivity of 70% [49-84] and 79% [63-81],&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As plasma ABI exposure is a key element of PSA response, it supports the exploration of&#xD;
      benefits of a pharmacokinetically-guided dosing strategy for ABI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a phase I trial, the recommended dose of ABI was 1000 mg per day as a plateau of endocrine&#xD;
      effects was reported at doses greater than 750 mg. However, to their knowledge, no data&#xD;
      regarding the effect of ABI on tissue androgens are available, and no dose limiting toxicity&#xD;
      was identified up to 2000 mg per day which support the rational of a dose-escalation&#xD;
      strategy. In a phase 2 study, 41 mCRPC patients received 1000 mg twice a day of ABI (2000&#xD;
      mg/day) and the tolerance profile appeared similar than with lower dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase II trial, investigators aim to confirm the preliminary results presented above&#xD;
      in a larger population. Moreover, their objective is to test whether a dose escalation up to&#xD;
      2000 mg per day is feasible and lead to disease stabilization in progressive patients within&#xD;
      the first 6 months of treatment.&#xD;
