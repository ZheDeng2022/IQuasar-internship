  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if using advanced magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (AMRI) will improve the targeting of brain tumor needle biopsies compared to the&#xD;
      standard targeting techniques. Researchers also want to learn how the results of the images&#xD;
      and biopsies compare to each other to try to improve the way researchers and radiologists use&#xD;
      AMRI images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The perfusion scan is not FDA approved or commercially&#xD;
      available. It is currently only being used in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no cost to you for the advanced MRI, additional anesthesia, special pathology&#xD;
      stains, and/or gene testing for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participant is being asked to take part in this study because participant has a lesion in&#xD;
      participant's brain which is suspected or proven to be a tumor and participant has been&#xD;
      scheduled for surgery to remove it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some parts of brain tumors are more aggressive than other parts. A needle biopsy only gets a&#xD;
      small part of the brain tumor cells. Doctors (neurosurgeons) want to get a biopsy sample from&#xD;
      the most aggressive part of the tumor. Researchers think that AMRI techniques may help to&#xD;
      better target the most aggressive part of the tumor for the needle biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMRI Scan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the images that will be taken as part of participant's standard of care&#xD;
      surgery preparation, participant will have an AMRI scan performed. The AMRI has several&#xD;
      parts. There are 2 perfusion scans that use a contrast dye to look at small blood vessels.&#xD;
      There is a spectroscopy scan to looks at the chemical make-up of the tumor. There is also a&#xD;
      diffusion scan to look at how water moves in the tumor and can see the white matter that&#xD;
      connects both sides of brain parts. The AMRI scans are performed in the same way as normal&#xD;
      MRI scans and in the same scanner. They can be noisy, but do not feel any different than&#xD;
      standard MRI exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most cases, the AMRI should take less than 1 hour to complete and will be performed within&#xD;
      2 weeks before participant's standard of care surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery During the surgery, the neurosurgeon(s) will use the information collected from the&#xD;
      AMRI to decide what area of the brain tumor will be biopsied. The biopsies are only from&#xD;
      areas that would normally be cut out during surgery and will not change the way the surgery&#xD;
      is done even if participant chooses not to take part in this study. Biopsies (from up to 5&#xD;
      locations, each smaller than participant's thumbnail) will be taken before the tumor is&#xD;
      surgically removed. The tumor tissue samples from the biopsies will be tested to learn more&#xD;
      about the tumor and optionally the DNA inside(the genetic material of cells - this procedure&#xD;
      is described in the optional procedures section below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgery is over, participant will continue to have participant's standard of care&#xD;
      follow-up appointments in the neurosurgery clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study After the biopsy is complete, your active participation on this study will be&#xD;
      over. Participant's medical records will continue to be reviewed for up to an additional 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Medical Record Review:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participant's active participation on this study is over, participant's medical record&#xD;
      will be reviewed to learn how participant is doing, what other treatments participant may&#xD;
      have had and how they worked, if participant had any new brain problems or if the tumor came&#xD;
      back. Researchers will review and record information from participant's medical records for&#xD;
      up to 5 years after participant's active participation on this study is over.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is &gt;18 years old, agrees to participate in the clinical study and to complete&#xD;
             all required visits and evaluations. The pediatric population has a different disease&#xD;
             profile from the glioma patients we hope to recruit. To reduce heterogeneity in the&#xD;
             patient population we will not consider patients younger than 18 for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is a candidate for cerebral tumor resection with lesion suspected to be or&#xD;
             previously biopsy proven to be a primary brain tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is able to understand and give consent to participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient agrees to undergo, prior to the procedure, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI,&#xD;
             within 14 days and preferably with 3 days of the planned procedure) with perfusion,&#xD;
             diffusion and spectroscopic imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has a GFR &gt; 60. In patients with moderate renal failure (GFR 30-60), an&#xD;
             alternate injection with 2 times half-dose multihance (gadobenate dimeglumine) or&#xD;
             gadovist (gadobutrol) will be considered, if a contrast exam is deemed clinically&#xD;
             necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient is found to have unfavorable anatomy to indicate that stereotactic biopsy&#xD;
             could not be safely performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pacemakers, electronic stimulation, metallic foreign bodies and devices and/or other&#xD;
             conditions that are not MR safe, which include but are not limited to: electronically,&#xD;
             magnetically, and mechanically activated implants, ferromagnetic or electronically&#xD;
             operated active devices, metallic splinters in the eye, ferromagnetic hemostatic clips&#xD;
             in the central nervous system (CNS) or body, cochlear implants, other pacemakers,&#xD;
             insulin pumps and nerve stimulators, non-MR safe lead wires, prosthetic heart valves&#xD;
             (if dehiscence is suspected), non-ferromagnetic stapedial implants, pregnancy,&#xD;
             claustrophobia that does not readily respond to oral medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior brain tumor treatment, including surgical resection, radiation therapy or&#xD;
             chemotherapy for a primary brain neoplasm. Previous biopsy will not disqualify the&#xD;
             patient from participation. Remote history (&gt; 6month) of non-CNS malignancy in&#xD;
             remission, without evidence of current/ prior brain metastasis, will also not&#xD;
             disqualify patient from participating.&#xD;
