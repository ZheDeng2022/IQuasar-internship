      This study aims to evaluate for the first time in Colombia the immunogenicity and safety of&#xD;
      autologous DCs as enhancers of the immune response in patients with ductal breast cancer who,&#xD;
      prior to surgical resection of the tumor, will receive neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with&#xD;
      Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide. concomitantly with the transfer of autologous DCs. This&#xD;
      clinical trial is based on the concept proposed in countries like France more than a decade&#xD;
      ago, that chemotherapy or radiotherapy cause the tumor cells to release certain signals that&#xD;
      favor the activation of the immune system against cancer. Therefore, the combined use of&#xD;
      chemotherapy with vaccination with dendritic cells would provide the immune system with&#xD;
      greater antitumor response capacity, taking advantage of the release of said signals to&#xD;
      initiate a series of processes that would be reflected in the activation of T lymphocytes&#xD;
      capable of destroying the remaining cells of the tumor. To determine the specificity of the&#xD;
      response evoked by the adoptive transfer of autologous DCs, in each patient the degree of&#xD;
      recognition of the tumor by the immune system before and after said procedure will be&#xD;
      evaluated. These results will be compared with those of patients who participated in a&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Adoptive transfer of autologous DCs generated in vitro, in patients with stage&#xD;
      IIA-IV breast cancer who receive neoadjuvant therapy with Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      is a safe procedure that stimulates anti-tumor immune responses in treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the use of DCs when used in patients with stage&#xD;
      IIA-IV breast cancer in association with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with&#xD;
      Doxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Generate immuno-competent dendritic cells in conditions of Good Clinical Practice and&#xD;
           Good Laboratory Practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine in each patient the immunological status of specific T lymphocytes against&#xD;
           tumor antigens, before and after chemotherapy, in order to demonstrate whether the&#xD;
           adoptive transfer of DCs favors the anti-tumor immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Register in patients with breast cancer in neo-adjuvant chemotherapy the class and&#xD;
           frequency of adverse effects that could be generated as a result of the adoptive&#xD;
           transfer of autologous DCs.&#xD;

      The Fundación Salud de los Andes in the framework of a strategic alliance with the National&#xD;
      University of Colombia has been working in the planning and development of a clinical trial&#xD;
      in Colombia that promotes the search for new therapeutic alternatives for cancer patients. As&#xD;
      a translational medicine project, it aims to make the laboratory findings available to the&#xD;
      patient. This study explores the combination of immunotherapy (cell therapy) with&#xD;
      chemotherapy, in order to obtain better results in the therapeutic management of tumors in&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer is a pathology that in recent years has increased vertiginously its incidence&#xD;
      globally. Given the advanced state in which this tumor is usually diagnosed in our&#xD;
      environment, the prognosis is seriously compromised, which has led to the current breast&#xD;
      cancer represents a major public health problem in Colombia. The established therapies for&#xD;
      the management of patients with this type of tumors such as chemotherapy, radio-therapy or&#xD;
      surgery, are effective to reduce much of the established tumor mass, but fail to eliminate&#xD;
      residual cancer cells, so - often - these treatments cannot prevent the recurrence of the&#xD;
      disease. In addition to the above, the quality of life of the patients treated is strongly&#xD;
      affected by the toxicity of these treatments on healthy tissues and their undesirable&#xD;
      effects, which frequently affects poor adherence to treatment. That is why it is necessary to&#xD;
      search for new therapeutic alternatives that are more specific to the tumor and that are&#xD;
      better tolerated by patients. Due to the high specificity of the immune system for the&#xD;
      recognition of tumors, different modalities of immune therapy for tumor control are currently&#xD;
      being explored, which seek to enhance the performance of the patient's defense system so that&#xD;
      a cytotoxic and memory response is established against them. tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study Clinical Trial Phase I / II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who attend the consultation due to their mammary pathology for the start of&#xD;
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy will be pre-selected to participate in the study. The participation&#xD;
      of the volunteers will be subject to compliance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      defined for the study, as well as the signing of the informed consent. The participants will&#xD;
      be randomly distributed into two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT GROUPS As part of the clinical evaluation at the entrance of the study, a battery of&#xD;
      laboratory tests (basic and specific to the trial) will be carried out. Subsequent to the&#xD;
      corroboration of compliance with the inclusion criteria, patients will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of the two study groups: The first group (A) will be the negative control group, which&#xD;
      includes patients who will receive only the standardized chemotherapy treatment for the&#xD;
      pathology. The second group (B) will consist of those patients who were randomly selected to&#xD;
      receive the adoptive transfer of mature autologous DCs in combination with the neo-adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy. In this way, the total of 30 patients will be distributed as follows: 15&#xD;
      patients for group A and 15 patients for group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients of group B will undergo an apheresis procedure in order to obtain a sample&#xD;
      enriched in peripheral blood monocytes from which monocytes will be purified for the&#xD;
      production of DCs. The generation of DCs will be carried out under strict conditions of Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practices and Good Laboratory Practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adoptive transfer will be carried out concomitantly with the neo-adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment (eight and 15 days after chemotherapy dose for a total of 6 injections with&#xD;
      autologous DCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the period of application of the doses, a permanent clinical evaluation will be carried&#xD;
      out to the patients, to register possible adverse effects (evaluation of the safety of the&#xD;
      adoptive transfer of autologous DCs). The effect on the immune response of autologous DCs&#xD;
      transferred to patients on chemotherapy vs. the effect on the immune response of chemotherapy&#xD;
      without transfer, will be analyzed in each patient before and after chemotherapy using the&#xD;
      state of the art of immunological techniques with which will measure the extent of anti-tumor&#xD;
      CD8+ T cells expansion (evaluation of the immunogenicity of the adoptive transfer of&#xD;
      autologous DCs).&#xD;
