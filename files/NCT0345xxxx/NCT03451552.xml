  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some people living with health problems require extra support to properly manage their&#xD;
      conditions, as family doctors are only able to spend limited time in the office with these&#xD;
      patients. There are many resources and programs in the community that can provide the&#xD;
      necessary time and support for these patients, yet many patients are unaware that such&#xD;
      resources exist. Patient navigators have been shown to be useful in helping patients with&#xD;
      certain conditions (such as cancer) to get to the resources they need, especially when they&#xD;
      have social challenges that make it difficult for them to reach these programs (for example,&#xD;
      language or transportation barriers, poverty, or poor social support). This study will look&#xD;
      at how helpful Navigators are to link patients at family doctors' offices to community&#xD;
      resources. To do this, family doctors' offices in Ottawa and Sudbury will be recruited. All&#xD;
      offices will receive training on directing patients to CRs and will be assigned a patient&#xD;
      navigator to support patients access CRs. Half of the patients referred to CRs by their&#xD;
      providers will have access to the navigator (intervention) assigned to the practice. This&#xD;
      study will assess whether access to a navigator increases patients' access to community&#xD;
      health and social services compared to usual standard of care. In addition, the study aims to&#xD;
      understand whether English and French speaking individuals are as likely to benefit from a&#xD;
      navigator in accessing community resources in the language of their choice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project builds on work conducted between 2013 and today. The Canadian Institutes&#xD;
      of Health Research's Community Based Primary Health Care Team Grant SPOR initiative funded a&#xD;
      five-year program of research (known as IMPACT: Innovative Models Promoting Access-to-Care&#xD;
      Transformation, http://www.impactresearchprogram.com/). The goal of the IMPACT Project is to&#xD;
      increase access to community-based primary health care for vulnerable populations. The lead&#xD;
      for the Ontario arm of the IMPACT project, Simone Dahrouge, has undertaken a community&#xD;
      engagement initiative within the Champlain Local Health Integration Network (LHIN) to&#xD;
      understand the barriers patients face to adequately access community based health and social&#xD;
      resources (CRs) and how these can be overcome. Under that funding, the team undertook an&#xD;
      extensive consultation process to identify a regional priority gap, select and adapt an&#xD;
      intervention, and implement and evaluate a single arm intervention. The investigators are&#xD;
      currently in the last phase of that project, which is serving as a feasibility phase for the&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. The feasibility study is evaluating the acceptability, demand,&#xD;
      implementation, adaption, integration, and practicality of the study intervention and related&#xD;
      activities to optimize appropriate access to CRs for primary care patients. Enrolment for&#xD;
      that project will be completed by March 2018. This study received ethics approval from the&#xD;
      OHSN Research Ethics Board (Protocol #20160914-01H), Bruyère Continuing Care Research Ethics&#xD;
      Board (Protocol #M16-1616-055), Hôpital Montfort Research Ethics Board (Protocol #&#xD;
      SD-DP-27-02-17), and the University of Ottawa Research Ethics Board (Protocol #&#xD;
      A05-17-04).That trial is a registered clinical trial: NCT03105635.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the feasibility phase the team established a regional stakeholder advisory group&#xD;
      (Champlain LHIN). The composition of the advisory group has been adapted to meet the needs of&#xD;
      the study. In the initial phase the composition was broad until the region identified the&#xD;
      priority area and approach to addressing the gap. The committee is now composed of patients&#xD;
      of various minority communities who contribute their lived experience, primary care providers&#xD;
      from different care models and leaders from organizations responsible for community services&#xD;
      (Community Care Access Centres and Community Health Centres) who inform the feasibility of&#xD;
      the approach for each context, and best approach to integrating of the two sectors, health&#xD;
      planners (the LHIN Primary Care Lead, senior integration specialist and others) who bring&#xD;
      their broader context health services knowledge as well as resources (such as practice&#xD;
      transformation facilitation services) to the project, as well as other stakeholders that&#xD;
      inform specific components of the intervention (Ontario 211, Champlain Healthline). That&#xD;
      Committee meets regularly and contributes directly to the direction of the study design,&#xD;
      implementation, evaluation and dissemination. Because the committee fundamentally represents&#xD;
      the interests of the region, it is often referred to in this document as 'the region&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial consultative phase identified poor access to CRs as a priority access gap. The&#xD;
      research team relied on a scoping review conducted for the IMPACT program and conducted&#xD;
      several interviews and focus groups with community stakeholders to inform the best approach&#xD;
      addressing this gap. The region selected to implement a patient navigator who can assist&#xD;
      patients for whom the use of a community service is recommended by their primary care&#xD;
      provider achieve access to that service. Primary care providers rarely make specific&#xD;
      recommendations to access CRs; largely because they are unaware of these. They make general&#xD;
      recommendations to improve healthy behaviours, but do not refer to specific types of&#xD;
      services. Two realist reviews have been commissioned and completed by a team of experts to&#xD;
      help us understand the critical success factors and shape our intervention. One review is&#xD;
      focused on &quot;community navigators&quot; and the other on &quot;primary care referral to community&#xD;
      services&quot; to help the team understand the factors that support us. This information was used&#xD;
      to develop the ARC intervention. A number of themes identified in these reviews including&#xD;
      training for clinical staff to identify and refer to relevant CRs to address patients' social&#xD;
      barriers; implementing a champion within practice to integrate referral into usual care; use&#xD;
      of electronic health records to prompt provider referral and share information between&#xD;
      provider and the community; and developing a screening process and promotional material to&#xD;
      prompt referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, the region developed the Access to Resources in the Community/Accès aux&#xD;
      Resources Communautaires (ARC) intervention. The ARC project will build on this work by&#xD;
      focussing on improving access to community resources in patients' language of choice and&#xD;
      emphasizing access to French-language resources for Francophones in Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to optimize appropriate access to community based services for&#xD;
      socially complex primary care patients, including Franco-Ontarians living in minority&#xD;
      situations, and promote the continuity of information across primary and community care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES AND DELIVERABLES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective A: Optimize equitable utilization of community based resources&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deliverable 1: Effectiveness of a patient navigator on utilization of CRs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deliverable 2: Make policy recommendations to address remaining gaps&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deliverable 3: Establish a model of navigation that is transferable and scalable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective B: Support continuity of information across Primary and Community Care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deliverable 4: Establish a process that support appropriate exchange of information across&#xD;
      the two sectors&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective, mixed method (patient) randomized controlled trial of navigation services provided by Ontario 211 vs. navigation services provided by a lay Patient Navigator. Randomization is 1:1 control:intervention.&#xD;
The mixed method design is a sequential, explanatory design. Patients having consented to participate in the study will complete a survey, after which their random assignment to one of two arms (intervention or control) will be revealed.&#xD;
The randomization schedule will be blocked at the practice level to ensure a balance of control and intervention patients for each practice, including all providers.&#xD;
Patients randomized to the intervention arm will have access to services provided by the ARC Patient Navigator, whereas patients randomized to the control arm will be directed to the Ontario 211 navigation service.</intervention_model_description>
