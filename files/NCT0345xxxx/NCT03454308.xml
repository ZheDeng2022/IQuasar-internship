  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a two--arm Randomized controlled trial (RCT) design that will assess efficacy of&#xD;
      the Smartphone Medication Adherence Stops Hypertension (SMASH) mobile health ( mHealth)&#xD;
      program compared to an enhanced standard care (SC) program. Participants will be&#xD;
      African-American (AA) hypertension patients with no other known chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants found to have uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) and medication non-adherence via&#xD;
      electronic device monitoring will be randomized to SMASH or enhanced Standard Care (SC). The&#xD;
      SMASH group will receive reminders in the form of auditory and visual reminders from a pill&#xD;
      monitoring device when their medication dose is due, they will monitor their blood pressure&#xD;
      at home and will receive tailored motivational text messages based upon levels of adherence .&#xD;
      Enhanced SC group will use the pill monitoring device without reminder functions enabled and&#xD;
      will receive text messages on topics of healthy lifestyles not related to medication&#xD;
      adherence and hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active intervention will continue for 6 months and follow-up will continue for 1 year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      192 AAs (21-59 yrs ) with uncontrolled HTN (no other comorbidities) and Medication&#xD;
      Non-Adherence (MNA) will be recruited according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria found&#xD;
      elsewhere. In the first phase of screening,resting BP protocols will be performed to&#xD;
      determine hypertension is uncontrolled. Only subjects with verified uncontrolled HTN will&#xD;
      proceed to the second screening phase .This is a 4 week medication monitoring phase using an&#xD;
      electronic medication device with reminder alerts deactivated.Medication non-adherence (MNA)&#xD;
      will be determined through medication possession ratio and by the timestamped intake&#xD;
      adherence to their predesignated intake schedule across the 4 week period. MA score &lt;0.85&#xD;
      over the 4-week screening and whose subsequent resting BP evaluations reconfirm uncontrolled&#xD;
      HTN will be eligible for enrollment into the RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMASH subjects will have their pill monitor reminder functions activated, start receiving&#xD;
      personalized motivational text messages and provided and instructed on use of a validated&#xD;
      Bluetooth--enabled BP monitor used at home during the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhanced SC subjects will continue to use the pill device with reminder functions disabled&#xD;
      for another 6 months. In order to control for attention exposure SC subjects will be sent&#xD;
      text messages on topics related to healthy lifestyle behaviors (diet, physical activity,no&#xD;
      smoke exposure) but not related to Medication Adherence (MA) or HTN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will complete 5 study visits where BP,medication possession ratios, and surveys&#xD;
      will be completed. 24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure (ABP) monitoring will be performed every&#xD;
      6-months (4 times) during the study.&#xD;
