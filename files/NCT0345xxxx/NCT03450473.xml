    <textblock>
      Large abdominal wall hernias are surgically challenging to repair and often associated with&#xD;
      significant postoperative complications. Risk factors associated with surgical site&#xD;
      complications, such as infection and wound dehiscence, include obesity, diabetes, and&#xD;
      smoking. In these high risk patients, the placement of synthetic mesh increases the risk of&#xD;
      mesh infection, enterocutaneous fistula formation, and mesh explantation. One of the larger&#xD;
      studies of risk factors associated with mesh explantation demonstrated concomitant&#xD;
      intra-abdominal procedures have a greater than 6-fold increased hazard of subsequent mesh&#xD;
      explantation. As an alternative to synthetic meshes, bioprosthetic meshes derived from the&#xD;
      decellularization and processing of allogeneic or xenogeneic tissue sources have been&#xD;
      introduced that can often allow the surgeon to treat the surgical site occurrences and&#xD;
      salvage the repair without required mesh explantation. Low rates of mesh infection and&#xD;
      explantation have been reported for bioprosthetic meshes and are recommended in these&#xD;
      complicated patients by the Ventral Hernia Working Group, based on the best available&#xD;
      clinical evidence. Despite widespread use of bioprosthetic mesh, there continues to be&#xD;
      concern for complications associated with their use (i.e. high seroma and recurrence rates,&#xD;
      etc.). This has led to the modification of these matrices by several industry leaders&#xD;
      (Acelity, Cook, Integra, etc.) to include a fenestrated platform to allow for fluid to flow&#xD;
      through the matrix upon implantation while supporting regeneration in complex abdominal wall&#xD;
      reconstruction. To our knowledge, there are no clinical studies prospectively evaluating the&#xD;
      long term clinical outcomes for abdominal wall reconstruction procedures involving&#xD;
      fenestrated macropourous biologic matrices.This macroporous technology allows for tissue&#xD;
      revascularization and integration of the biologic graft and thus an expected improvement in&#xD;
      overall outcome. Bioprosthetic fenestrated materials such as Surgimend MP® were developed to&#xD;
      assist with earlier incorporation and vascularization of the biologic graft while providing&#xD;
      reinforcement of hernia repair. However, there is an absence of high quality prospective data&#xD;
      regarding the use of these materials in complicated abdominal wall reconstruction, and no&#xD;
      comparative data exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, case series study evaluating the efficacy and performance of&#xD;
      SurgiMend MP® during complex ventral hernia repairs. This case series involves a biologically&#xD;
      derived hernia mesh under its cleared FDA indication for hernia repair. Efficacy will be&#xD;
      determined by quantifying surgical complications, hernia recurrence, and cost effectiveness&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Subjects will be identified by the investigators and/or personnel assigned by the&#xD;
      investigators, as patients with large complex ventral hernia expected to be repaired with&#xD;
      bioprosthetic mesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a baseline visit where they will have a physical exam and complete quality&#xD;
      of life questionnaires and a pain scale. Photographs will be taken at this visit as well.&#xD;
      Demographic and medical and surgical history will be collected. The investigators will then&#xD;
      assess the subject intra-operatively to confirm the need and appropriate placement of&#xD;
      SurgiMend mesh. The subjects that have mesh placed will be followed at hospital discharge, 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months, and 12 months to assess for changes in health, adverse events,&#xD;
      questionnaire completion, and evaluation of surgical site for complications and recurrence.&#xD;
      The visits may take place by phone if the subject cannot return to clinic.&#xD;
