  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peri-implantitis are important disease entities as a result of their high prevalence and the&#xD;
      lack of a standard mode of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-surgical therapy of peri-implant disease, especially when bone loss is not high, appears&#xD;
      to be partially effective in resolving the disease. In several cases, however, only limited&#xD;
      improvements have been reported in the main clinical parameters (bleeding at the survey and&#xD;
      presence of the pocket) and there is a clear tendency to relapse of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these cases it is therefore recommended to consider adjunctive therapies. Numerous&#xD;
      approaches have been used for implant surface decontamination including mechanical, chemical&#xD;
      and treatments by means of air-powder or laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present randomized controlled clinical trial will be to assess the efficacy in&#xD;
      improving clinical parameters of two further methods of implant surface decontamination&#xD;
      (Er:YAG laser or air-abrasive device) after mechanical and chemical cleaning during non&#xD;
      surgical treatment of peri-implantitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peri-implantitis, defined as an inflammatory lesion in the surrounding peri-implant tissues&#xD;
      with loss of supporting bone, are important disease entities as a result of their high&#xD;
      prevalence and the lack of a standard mode of therapy. Although the current epidemiological&#xD;
      data are limited, peri-implantitis affects 28-56% of the subjects and 12-43% of the implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous approaches have been used for implant surface decontamination during peri-implant&#xD;
      surgery, including mechanical, chemical and laser treatments. Using conventional mechanical&#xD;
      means, eradication of pathogens on implant surfaces with threads and often with rough surface&#xD;
      structures is difficult. Treatment models, such as debridment, effectively used to treat&#xD;
      teeth with periodontitis, cannot be used in the same way on rough threaded implant surfaces.&#xD;
      The implant rough surface structure also provides the bacteria with ''protected areas'',&#xD;
      inaccessible to conventional mechanical removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A treatment protocol that may offer an advantage over traditional mechanical treatment&#xD;
      includes the use of laser therapy. Data have shown that treatments with Er:YAG lasers have a&#xD;
      bactericidal effect. Er:YAG laser treatment can debride the implant surface effectively and&#xD;
      safely. Slightly better clinical results in terms of bleeding on probing and clinical&#xD;
      attachment level have been reported by Er:YAG laser treatment as compared with traditional&#xD;
      non-surgical mechanical debridement with curette and chlorhexidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The air abrasive method for the removal of bacterial plaque on tooth surfaces has also been&#xD;
      used in the treatment of peri-implantitis, demonstrating no relevant adverse effects. Until&#xD;
      recently, air-polishing devices have used a slurry of water and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3)&#xD;
      and pressurized air/water. A less abrasive method using an amino acid glycine has been proven&#xD;
      to be effective in removing bacterial biofilm structures in deep periodontal pockets and safe&#xD;
      by not causing emphysema. Moreover the use of a glycine-based powder does not seem to cause&#xD;
      titanium implant surface changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present randomized controlled clinical trial will be to assess the efficacy in&#xD;
      improving clinical parameters of two further methods of implant surface decontamination&#xD;
      (Er:YAG laser or air-abrasive device) after mechanical and chemical cleaning during non&#xD;
      surgical treatment of peri-implantitis.&#xD;
