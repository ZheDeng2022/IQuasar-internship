      This pilot phase II trial studies how effective pembrolizumab and liver-directed therapy or&#xD;
      peptide receptor radionuclide therapy are at treating patients with well-differentiated&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumors and symptomatic and/or progressive tumors that have spread to the liver&#xD;
      (liver metastases). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help&#xD;
      the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread. Liver-directed therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, transarterial&#xD;
      embolization, yttrium-90 microsphere radioembolization, and cryoablation may help activate&#xD;
      the immune system in order to shrink tumors that are not being directly targeted. Peptide&#xD;
      receptor radionuclide therapy is a form of targeted treatment that is performed by the use of&#xD;
      a small molecule, which carries a radioactive component attached to a peptide. Once injected&#xD;
      into the body, this small molecule binds to some specific sites on tumor cells called&#xD;
      receptors and emit medium energy radiation that can destroy cells. Because this radionuclide&#xD;
      is attached to the peptide, which binds receptors on tumor lesions, the radiation can&#xD;
      preferably be targeted to the tumor cells in order to destroy them. Giving pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      combination with liver-directed therapy or peptide receptor radionuclide therapy may work&#xD;
      better than pembrolizumab alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination with PRRT, transarterial&#xD;
      embolization, and radioembolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the best observed overall response rate (ORR) in lesion(s) not targeted for&#xD;
      liver-directed therapy (abscopal effect) to pembrolizumab plus liver-directed therapy&#xD;
      according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for patients with&#xD;
      metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (WD-NETs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the best observed ORR to pembrolizumab plus peptide receptor radionuclide&#xD;
      therapy (PRRT) according to RECIST 1.1 for patients with metastatic grade 2 and 3 WD-NET&#xD;
      (Ki-67 &gt; 10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate duration of response (DOR) in patients receiving pembrolizumab in combination&#xD;
      with liver-directed therapies or PRRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) in subjects treated with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      combination with liver-directed therapies or PRRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Best observed radiographic ORR per modified RECIST (mRECIST) in lesions targeted for&#xD;
      liver-directed therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Duration of response in lesions targeted for liver-directed therapy by mRECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare ORR, DOR, and PFS based on immune-related (ir)RECIST with the same measures&#xD;
      assessed by RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate clinical outcomes (ORR, DOR, PFS) with baseline immune cell infiltration and&#xD;
      PD-L1 staining in cycle 1 and cycle 5 tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the level of PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue prior to liver-directed therapy&#xD;
      (prior to PRRT) and 5 weeks following liver-directed therapy (following PRRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare pre-treatment and on-treatment PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue in patients&#xD;
      with documented partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) response to patients with&#xD;
      stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess T cell infiltration on the pre-177Lu-DOTATATE (pre-PRRT) and on the on-treatment&#xD;
      tumor tissue biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To use immunohistochemistry to assess the change in the ratio of tumor infiltrating CD8&#xD;
      and regulatory T cell (Treg) cells (CD8/Treg) over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To correlate pre-treatment and on-treatment CD8/Treg ratio in patients with documented&#xD;
      PR or CR response to patients with SD or PD response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To assess baseline circulating T cell receptor (TCR) repertories and changes in TCR&#xD;
      repertories with treatment, and correlate baseline and turnover of repertories to clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To analyze the relationship between baseline tumor proliferative index (as measured by&#xD;
      Ki67) and response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. PRRT using 177Lu-DOTATATE(Lutathera®) will be offered to patients with&#xD;
      somatostatin receptor positive (SSTR+) tumors with Ki-67 index &gt; 20% (well-differentiated&#xD;
      grade 3). Patients may have any number of liver and/or extrahepatic lesions with liver&#xD;
      parenchyma replacement by tumor &lt; 75%. 200±20 millicurie (mCi) of 177Lu-DOTATATE will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously per treatment on outpatient basis. Patients will receive a total&#xD;
      of four treatments of 177Lu-DOTATATE, administered every 8±1 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I (PRRT): Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with somatostatin receptor positive tumors with Ki-67 index &gt;&#xD;
      20% (well-differentiated grade 3) and any number of liver and/or extrahepatic lesions, who&#xD;
      have &lt; 75% liver parenchyma replacement by tumors, receive lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate (Lu-177&#xD;
      DOTATATE) IV over 30 minutes on day 2. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 4 cycles.&#xD;
      Patients who achieve progressive or stable disease response after cycle 4 may receive an&#xD;
      additional 4 cycles of pembrolizumab and lutetium Lu-177 DOTATATE in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II (TRANSARTERIAL EMBOLIZATION [TAE]): Patients receive pembrolizumab as in Group I.&#xD;
      Patients with any number of liver lesions, largest being no larger than 5 cm, who have &lt; 75%&#xD;
      liver parenchyma replacement by tumors, undergo TAE over 2-3 hours, 3-7 days following the&#xD;
      first dose of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP III (RADIOEMBOLIZATION [RE]): Patients receive pembrolizumab as in Group I. Patients&#xD;
      with any number of liver lesions, largest measuring more than 5 cm, who have &lt; 75% liver&#xD;
      parenchyma replacement by tumors, undergo yttrium-90 microsphere RE 3-15 days following the&#xD;
      first dose of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;

             aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 5 times ULN, INR &gt;1.5 times ULN, albumin &lt;2.0mg/dl).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
