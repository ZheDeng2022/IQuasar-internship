  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate if combined modulated ultrasound and electric current&#xD;
      stimulation (CUSECS) is an effective adjunctive treatment to use to treat diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcers when compared against usual care. Consenting patients with diabetic foot ulcers (DFUS)&#xD;
      and meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated in to either an experimental group&#xD;
      or a control group. The experimental group will receive the adjunctive CUSECS treatment along&#xD;
      their usual treatment for their diabetic ulcer. They will be required to attend the Diabetic&#xD;
      Foot clinic in St. James's hospital twice a week for a maximum of eight weeks. The CUSECS is&#xD;
      provided by attaching small electrodes around the ulcers to provide electric current&#xD;
      stimulation. A probe is used on the ulcers to provide the ultrasound waves. Both aiming to&#xD;
      increase the blood flow to an area to increase wound healing. The control group will be&#xD;
      required to attend the diabetic foot clinic for their usual care for their diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcer once a week for a maximum for eight weeks. Once a week both groups ulcers will be&#xD;
      assessed and measured and a photograph solely of the wound will be taken for documentation of&#xD;
      wound healing. Wound pain as determined using the 0-10 Numeric pain rating scale will also be&#xD;
      measured once a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The movement in participant's ankle will be measured (flexion, extension, inversion) at the&#xD;
      start and at the end of the study to see if treatment has improved its movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this study participants' will also be requested to fill out a SF-36 questionnaire&#xD;
      at the start and at the end of the 8 week trial. This questionnaire evaluates a person's&#xD;
      health related quality of life in which the research wants to see if it is affected by a&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcer. The self-efficacy of participants will also be assessed using PROMIS®&#xD;
      Item Bank v.1.0 - General Self-Efficacy at the start and at the end of the 8 week trial. The&#xD;
      cost of treatment for each arm will be calculated taking into account both direct (cost of&#xD;
      treatments, consumables etc.) and indirect costs (loss of earnings, travel, parking etc.).&#xD;
      Therefore, as part of this study, participants will be asked about mode of transport and&#xD;
      transport time to and from the clinic and if their diabetic foot ulcer has affected their&#xD;
      ability to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic foot ulcer reoccurrence rates will be monitored in both groups by a follow up&#xD;
      appointment 4 weeks after each group completes treatment or monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from both groups will be examined and compared to see if CUSECS is effective in healing&#xD;
      DFUs. The primary outcome of interest is wound healing and is determined by the number of&#xD;
      wounds healed and the time to complete wound healing within eight weeks. All data will be&#xD;
      stored confidentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that there is be increased healing rates in subjects treated with&#xD;
      CUSECS in combination with standard care compared to those treated with standard care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to provide evidence for continuing improvement in treatment for those&#xD;
      suffering with diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;

      Study Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is predicted to be one of the greatest challenges for individuals and society as a&#xD;
      whole into the future. Persons with diabetes are 50 times more likely to develop a foot ulcer&#xD;
      than their non-diabetic counterparts (1). The prevalence of foot ulceration in this patient&#xD;
      group is suggested to range from 3-10 %(1). These wounds are difficult to heal and this is&#xD;
      often compounded by the presence of multiple co-morbidities. Furthermore, diabetes is the&#xD;
      leading cause of non-traumatic limb amputation in the world (2). Within 18 months following&#xD;
      amputation, almost 50 percent of these people will develop ulceration on the other limb and&#xD;
      of these, 58% will have further amputations within three to five years(3). It is worthy of&#xD;
      note that the three-year mortality rate after the first amputation is between 20 and 50&#xD;
      percent (4, 5). Having diabetes impacts negatively on the individuals' heath related quality&#xD;
      of life when compared to the general population (6). The most important variable influencing&#xD;
      changes in HRQOL is the presence of complications of diabetes. Having a foot ulcer causes a&#xD;
      loss of mobility for the individual thereby decreasing social functioning. Furthermore almost&#xD;
      50% of people will suffer with intractable pain (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Working Group of the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) highlight the continuing&#xD;
      difficulties in selecting clinically effective treatments for diabetic foot infection and&#xD;
      ulceration. In two commissioned systematic reviews they point to the large number of&#xD;
      treatment options available while at the same time the relative weakness of evidence to&#xD;
      support the use of many of these options (7, 8). Two of these treatments, electrostimulation&#xD;
      and ultrasound, were utilised in this study. While both these technologies have been shown to&#xD;
      be effective in chronic wound healing, the use of combined modulated ultrasound and&#xD;
      electrical current stimulation (CUSECS) is a new and not widely studied treatment Avrahami&#xD;
      (9). The merits of each treatment individually will be explored below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Widespread interest and research into the use of electrostimulation is evident since the&#xD;
      1960s (10). Electrostimulation has been shown to have an effect on a range of mechanisms&#xD;
      which are beneficial to wound healing including;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement of blood flow&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in tensile strength&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stimulation of protein and DNA synthesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reductions in oedema&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decreased bacterial growth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Promotion of epithelial, fibroblast, neutrophil and macrophage cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in pain. (11,12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peters, et al. carried out an RCT to assess the impact of a 50 V current being applied to the&#xD;
      wounds of those in the intervention group overnight (8 hours) using a microcomputer. Both&#xD;
      groups also received usual care. Results indicate that 65% healed in the treatment group&#xD;
      treated vs 35% in the control group (p= 0.058). Wound size reduction was not statistically&#xD;
      different between the groups and in both groups the more compliant patients had better&#xD;
      outcomes (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound has also shown promising results in the treatment of Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU).&#xD;
      For example, Ennis, et al. with a sample of 133 patients treated the intervention group with&#xD;
      40 KHz of ultrasound at an intensity of 0.1 -0.5 W/cm2 as well as usual care. The treatment&#xD;
      was administered 3 times a week for 4 minutes over 12 weeks or until healed. Results indicate&#xD;
      a better healing rate in the intervention group than the control (40.7% vs 14.3% p = 0.0366)&#xD;
      and the treatment was found to be well tolerated and had no ill effects (14). In a 3 armed&#xD;
      study also with DFU patients Yao, et al. also applied treatments with low-frequency&#xD;
      ultrasound. The three groups had differing amounts of ultrasound per week (Group 1: 3 x week,&#xD;
      Group 2: 1 x week, Group 3: placebo). The 3 times per week group showed the greatest amount&#xD;
      of wound size reduction compared with baseline (86% p &lt; 0·05) leading the authors to conclude&#xD;
      that the treatment applied when applied 3 times per week led to better wound outcomes (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of these two treatments is not widely studied but given their potential and&#xD;
      documented efficacy as outlined above the proposition to combine them would appear to be&#xD;
      reasonable. Two published studies to date has looked at the combination of these therapies&#xD;
      for DFUs (9). Avrahami et al. carried out a retrospective analysis of 300 wounds which were&#xD;
      treated with CUSECS. They looked specifically at 65 wounds both diabetic foot ulcers (n=27)&#xD;
      and venous leg ulcers (n= 38). Patients all had at least 8 treatments in a minimum of 4&#xD;
      weeks, twice weekly with CUSECS using the BRH-A2 device (BRH Medical). Results indicate that&#xD;
      59.3 % of the diabetic foot ulcers achieved 50% closure within 4 weeks. The authors found no&#xD;
      significant association between gender, wound size on presentation or the longevity of the&#xD;
      wound on the outcomes. In a small prospective case series O'Connor, et al. found a mean wound&#xD;
      size reduction of 71% in DFUs when treated twice a week with CUSECS. They suggest that CUSECS&#xD;
      offers promise as an adjunct therapy for diabetic foot ulcers (16). More comprehensive and&#xD;
      robust evidence is now required to ascertain the effectiveness of CUSECS as a therapy for&#xD;
      DFUs. This study aims to address that deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's focus is to determine the impact of the use of CUSECS in DFUs. This study will&#xD;
      build on the existing evidence and will provide the first RCT data for this therapy. It is&#xD;
      envisaged that this can provide evidence for continuing improvement in treatment for those&#xD;
      suffering with DFUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study the following protocol will be followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects Planned Sample sizes of 24-50 have been recommended for pilot feasibility&#xD;
      studies (17-21). Therefore, a sample size of 46 will be selected for this study (23 per&#xD;
      group), plus 10% to allow for dropout, giving a sample size of 50 evaluable participants (25&#xD;
      per group). An evaluable participant is one who satisfies all inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
      and who completes the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who attend the diabetic foot clinic in St. James's hospital who are interested&#xD;
      in part taking in the study and who meet the inclusion criteria and who do not meet the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The podiatrist working in the diabetic foot clinic in each site will screen all subjects who&#xD;
      express an interested in participating to ensure they meet the inclusion criteria and not the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will provide to the attending podiatrist a list of unique ID's with a&#xD;
      corresponding randomised study group. The podiatrist will identify patients who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion study criteria and who are willing to participate in the study. If&#xD;
      eligible, the podiatrist will issue the participant with either the control or experimental&#xD;
      'Patient Information Leaflet'. This allocation will be based on the systematic inclusion on&#xD;
      the ID list. Subjects randomized to the experimental group will be identified by their&#xD;
      randomization code beginning with A001 (for the first subject randomized to the experimental&#xD;
      Group). Participants randomized to the control group will be identified by their&#xD;
      randomization code beginning with B001 (for the first subject randomized to the control&#xD;
      group) at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signed and dated written informed consent must be obtained from each patient prior to&#xD;
      enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consent form must embody the requirements of informed consent as required by the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki and following the guidance provided in IE ISO 14155 (Appendix C).&#xD;
      This consent form must have relevant Institutional Review Boards (IRB) / Ethical committee&#xD;
      (EC) approval prior to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signed (witnessed mark in the case of subjects who are unable to write) and dated informed&#xD;
      consent must be obtained from each subject prior to enrollment in the study. Information on&#xD;
      the trial will be offered both verbally and in written form to all potential subjects before&#xD;
      informed consent is obtained. The investigator must explain to the patient the nature of the&#xD;
      study, its purpose, procedures, expected duration, benefits and possible risks in&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This information will be offered in easy to understand non-technical language where possible.&#xD;
      Subjects will be afforded ample time (not less than 24 hours) to consider whether or not to&#xD;
      participate in the trial. The subject will be given the right to ask questions and be&#xD;
      informed of their rights to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice. A copy of&#xD;
      the signed and dated informed consent form will be provided to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The podiatrist working in the diabetic foot clinic in each site will screen all subjects&#xD;
           who express an interested in participating to ensure they meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
           and not the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The podiatrist will assign those subjects who meet the inclusion criteria with a unique&#xD;
           ID provided by the investigator. This allocation will be based on the systematic&#xD;
           inclusion on the ID list. They will issue them with relevant 'Patient information&#xD;
           leaflet' to their randomisation group. This leaflet will contain background information&#xD;
           on the study and the information on the relevant protocol and attendance requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These subjects will be screened by the study investigator to ensure that they do not&#xD;
           meet any of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To ensure they meet the study eligibility criteria, medical history and demographics&#xD;
           will be recorded and the ulcer will be assessed for any infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The researcher will discuss the study information contained on the information leaflet&#xD;
           with the potential participant, in a private room. This information will be provided in&#xD;
           plain English and in a manner and pace that suits the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The researcher will inform the potential participant that they will meet with them at&#xD;
           their next clinic visit to obtain consent (within a minimum of 24hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment and treatment Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will attend their diabetic foot clinic in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will be assisted by the study investigator and or the podiatrist in to a&#xD;
           comfortable position on the patient plinth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential subjects will be rescreened for inclusion and exclusion criteria by the study&#xD;
           researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All wound dressings will be removed by the study researcher or the clinic podiatrist.&#xD;
           The foot ulcer will be assessed for signs of infection by the study researcher.&#xD;
           Infection will be assessed clinically by signs and symptoms that include purulent&#xD;
           drainage, erythema, warmth, cellulitis, increased exudation, malodor, increased&#xD;
           tenderness or pain and fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a wound is considered infected by the researcher at the first visit, the subject will&#xD;
           be excluded from participating in the trial. However, the subject can be rescreened for&#xD;
           participation after complete resolution of the wound infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria, have capacity to consent and wish to enroll on&#xD;
           the study will be asked to sign and date the written informed consent form by the study&#xD;
           researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participants are unable to sign/ date or to make their mark on the consent form, this&#xD;
           will be signed and dated by a witness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be given a copy of the signed and dated consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects randomized to the experimental group will be identified by their randomization&#xD;
           code beginning with A001 (for the first subject randomized to the experimental group).&#xD;
           They will continue their standard care with the addition of CUSECS twice a week for 8&#xD;
           weeks by the BRH-A2 device. A follow up appointment will be organised 4 weeks after&#xD;
           receiving their last treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects randomized to the control group will be identified by their randomization code&#xD;
           beginning with B001 (for the first subject randomized to the control group) at this&#xD;
           visit. These subjects will continue their standard care and will be monitored weekly for&#xD;
           8 weeks with a follow up appointment 4 weeks after their last review in clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic and medical history information of subjects will be recorded in the Case&#xD;
           Report Forms (CRFs) by the study researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At visit 1 the BRH-A2 documentation software will be opened on the BRH-A2 wound healing&#xD;
           device by the study investigator and a specific participant file using the assigned&#xD;
           randomization code will be set up on the system for each participant. Detailed patient&#xD;
           data, including specific details regarding the location, type and characteristics of&#xD;
           ulcer will be inputted. This file will be saved on the BRH-A2 system and will be used to&#xD;
           store all participants relevant wound data for the duration of the trial. This data will&#xD;
           be secured using the advanced privacy mechanisms which are inbuilt on the BRH-A2 wound&#xD;
           healing device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound pain will be assessed, measured and recorded using the 0-10 Numeric pain rating&#xD;
           scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life score will be measured and recorded by the administration of the SF-36&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will also be asked to fill out PROMIS® Item Bank v.1.0 - General Self-Efficacy&#xD;
           questionnaire to assess their self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ankle Range of Motion of the foot with DFU will be measured in degrees using a&#xD;
           goniometer for flexion, extension &amp; inversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator assessment of the wound to include photograph and measurement using the&#xD;
           BRH-A2 wound healing device integrated measurement technology will occur after any&#xD;
           debridement if necessary has taken place and the wound is cleaned with normal saline (or&#xD;
           other designated wound cleanser used within the clinic setting).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound bed condition will be assessed using the Photographic Wound Assessment Tool&#xD;
           (PWAT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For those in the experimental group, the first CUSECS treatment with the BRH-A2 wound&#xD;
           healing device will be administered after all baseline evaluations have been completed.&#xD;
           The following treatment process will be followed for the BRH-A2 treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The participant will be given a clear explanation of the procedure and what to&#xD;
                expect during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The study investigator will apply the 4 electrode pads (disposable, single&#xD;
                participant use) to clean dry skin around the target ulcer at a minimum distance of&#xD;
                5cm from the wound edges.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The BRH-A2 ultrasound probe will be covered with a clean single use liner.&#xD;
                Ultrasonic waves are transmitted through a probe which is placed over the wound and&#xD;
                the surrounding peri-wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The combined modulated ultrasound and electric current stimulation therapy will be&#xD;
                applied for 15 minutes during each treatment. The present treatment parameters are&#xD;
                set to deliver modulated frequency ultrasound of between 1.0-3.0MHz with a maximum&#xD;
                intensity of 2.0W/cm². The BRH-A2 is present to deliver electric stimulation&#xD;
                current frequencies of between 4000Hz - 4250Hz ±1 with inferential output waveforms&#xD;
                and an interferential beat frequency of PPS 1-250Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once all wound assessments and treatments are complete participants foot ulcers will be&#xD;
           redressed according to their standard care treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost of treatment for each group will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of concomitant medications will be recorded on the Case Report Forms (CRFs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All adverse events will be recorded on the Case Report Forms (CRFs) and the SAE&#xD;
           reporting forms if necessary at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments will be scheduled for each group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental group - twice weekly for 8 weeks (16 follow up visits and 1 final review at&#xD;
           week 12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group- once weekly for 8 weeks (8 follow up visits and 1 final review at week&#xD;
           12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will occur during treatment period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All wound dressings will be removed by the study researcher or clinic podiatrist. The&#xD;
           foot ulcer will be assessed for signs of infection by the study investigator. Infection&#xD;
           will be assessed clinically by signs and symptoms that include purulent drainage,&#xD;
           erythema, warmth, cellulitis, increased exudation, malodor, increased tenderness or pain&#xD;
           and fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a wound infection is detected during the trial, treatment with BRH-A2 will be&#xD;
           discontinued and the subject will be treated according to the local hospital or clinic&#xD;
           protocol for managing wound infection. Active treatment will resume once the infection&#xD;
           has been resolved. If infection is present for more than 2 weeks, the subject will be&#xD;
           discontinued from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The BRH-A2 documentation software will be opened on the BRH-A2 wound healing device and&#xD;
           the relevant participant randomization coded file will be opened. Participant data will&#xD;
           be updated on this file.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once a week for participants in both groups assessment of the wound through photograph&#xD;
           and measurement using the BRH-A2 wound healing device integrated measurement technology&#xD;
           will occur after any debridement if necessary has taken place and the wound is cleaned&#xD;
           with normal saline (or other designated wound cleanser used within the clinic setting).&#xD;
           Wound pain will be recorded using the 0-10 Numeric pain rating scale and Wound bed&#xD;
           condition will be assessed using the assessed using the Photographic Wound Assessment&#xD;
           Tool once a week also.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CUSECS treatment with the BRH-A2 wound healing device will be administered to subjects&#xD;
           in the experimental group as previously discussed twice a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once all wound assessments and treatments are complete the participant's foot ulcer will&#xD;
           be redressed according to participant standard care treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost of treatment for each arm of the research will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the final visit for both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound pain will be assessed, measured and recorded using the 0-10 Numeric pain rating&#xD;
           scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life score will be measured and recorded by the administration of the SF-36&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will also be asked to fill out PROMIS® Item Bank v.1.0 - General Self-Efficacy&#xD;
           questionnaire to assess their self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ankle Range of Motion of the foot with DFU will be measured in degrees using a&#xD;
           goniometer for flexion, extension &amp; inversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The use of concomitant medications will be recorded on the Case Report Forms&#xD;
                (CRFs).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All adverse events will be recorded on the Case Report Forms (CRFs) and the SAE&#xD;
                reporting forms if necessary at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Throughout the process the treatment will be explained to the participants and they&#xD;
                have the option to withdraw from the study at any time. They will be reassured that&#xD;
                withdrawing from the study will not affect the treatment of their DFU by their&#xD;
                podiatrist in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who participated in the study will be followed up and reviewed 4 weeks after the&#xD;
      final treatment. The following procedures will be conducted at the follow-up visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Digital evaluation of wound surface area using BRH-A2 wound measurement software for any&#xD;
           wounds that remain open or that have reopened.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of participants' foot ulcers which remain open or have reopened. Photograph&#xD;
           and measurement using the BRH-A2 wound healing device integrated measurement technology&#xD;
           will occur once ulcers are exposed, debrided and are cleaned with normal saline (or&#xD;
           other designated wound cleanser used within the clinic setting) as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound bed condition will be assessed using the Photographic Wound Assessment Tool&#xD;
           (PWAT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound pain will be assessed, measured and recorded using the 0-10 Numeric pain rating&#xD;
           scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once all ulcer assessments and treatments are complete participants foot ulcers will be&#xD;
           redressed with current standard care treatment plan if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of concomitant medications will be recorded on the Case Report Forms (CRFs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All adverse events will be recorded on the Case Report Forms (CRFs) and the SAE&#xD;
           reporting forms if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be discharged from the study. Duration of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study for each subject will be 12 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental group: Twice weekly visits for 8 weeks (16 follow up visits and 1 final&#xD;
           review at week 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: Once weekly visits for 8 weeks (8 follow up visits and 1 final review at&#xD;
           week 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawals&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be informed that they have the right to withdraw study at any time and&#xD;
      that this will not affect their treatment of their Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). In addition,&#xD;
      the investigator may discontinue a participant from the study at any time if the investigator&#xD;
      considers it necessary for any reason including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant no longer meets inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the participant's physician for any reason instruct the withdrawal of the patient&#xD;
           from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse experiences, which include categories of intolerable side effects or current&#xD;
           illnesses, that may preclude continued treatment or confound evaluation of the treatment&#xD;
           outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If an infection is detected during the trial treatment with BRH-A2 will be discontinued.&#xD;
           The subject must be temporarily withdrawn from the study. Active treatment can resume&#xD;
           after the infection has been resolved. In this case the subject must start the study at&#xD;
           Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If infection is present for more than 2 weeks, the subject will be discontinued from the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-compliance with treatment regimen or study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease progression which requires results in inability to continue to comply with study&#xD;
           procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consent withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient fails to return for treatment up (after three documented attempts to contact the&#xD;
           subject).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An adverse event which results in inability to continue to comply with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject has not been withdrawn from the study and fails to return for their next&#xD;
      scheduled visit during the 8 week trial, a good faith effort of 2 phone calls and 1&#xD;
      documented attempt will be made to contact the subject and determine the reason(s) why the&#xD;
      subject failed to return for a necessary visit. The reason(s) for withdrawal must be recorded&#xD;
      on the Case Report Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Support from the Biostatistical Consulting and Support Services at the RCSI will be sought&#xD;
      before undertaking statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Populations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intent-to-Treat: All subjects who are randomized into the study following the pre-treatment&#xD;
      period. However, any participant who withdraws with consent from the study have the right to&#xD;
      withdraw their data up to the time of publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per Protocol: All subjects who demonstrate compliance with the device treatment protocol by&#xD;
      completing 80% of visits during the scheduled trial period (12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Demographics and Patient Characteristics Subject demographics and baseline&#xD;
      evaluations, including physical examination and medical history, will be summarized by&#xD;
      analysis population using counts and percentages, as appropriate, for categorical variables&#xD;
      (such as sex), and using means, standard deviations, medians, maxima, and minima, as&#xD;
      appropriate, for continuous variables (such as age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical testing for baseline comparability between the treatment and control groups will&#xD;
      be performed on variables that have the potential to influence CUSECS evaluations (such as&#xD;
      ulcer size, ulcer duration, ulcer location, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endpoint analyses will be conducted on the Per Protocol subject population. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be the effectiveness of CUSECS on wound healing of DFUs as measured by the&#xD;
      number of subjects with complete wound closure after 8 weeks of treatment and the time to&#xD;
      reach complete wound closure. Difference in wound size - Percent difference in wound surface&#xD;
      area will be recorded from baseline to subjects' final treatment (or sooner if complete wound&#xD;
      healing occurs earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are observational and not hypothesis driven. The efficacy analyses&#xD;
      will be performed using descriptive statistics (e.g., arithmetic mean, standard deviation,&#xD;
      frequency, etc.) for continuous and discrete variables, and graphical displays (e.g.,&#xD;
      tabulations, stem and leaf plots, etc.) of efficacy assessments will be generated, as&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deviations from Statistical Plans&#xD;
&#xD;
      As appropriate, additional, exploratory analysis (e.g., regression by covariate) may be&#xD;
      performed with data from this efficacy study. Any analysis of this type will be reported as&#xD;
      exploratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Criteria for Study Termination&#xD;
&#xD;
      All reports of SAEs and UADEs will be evaluated by the study Principle Investigator (PI) and&#xD;
      reported to the study site IRBs as required. The study may be suspended or terminated at any&#xD;
      time without the need for statistical analysis by the investigator or the sponsor if the PI&#xD;
      or any of the study IRBs determine that the BRH-A2 presents unacceptable risk to the study&#xD;
      participants for reasons related to patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will not be initiated until written approval has been obtained from the relevant&#xD;
      Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/ Research Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, data will only be identified by an identification number and the&#xD;
      patient's initials. Jagmed Limited affirms and upholds the principle of the patient's right&#xD;
      to protection against invasion of privacy. Throughout the study, data will only be identified&#xD;
      by the randomization identification number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Handling and Record Keeping&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collected within this study is covered by Irish Law 'Data Protection Acts 1988 and&#xD;
      2003&quot;. All information collected during this study shall be kept strictly anonymously in&#xD;
      keeping with the data protection acts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data management plan will be developed by the researcher before data collection commences.&#xD;
      All data stored on the researcher's database will be protected with an encrypted password.&#xD;
      Patient anonymity will be protected at all times as patient data will be coded and not&#xD;
      identifiable directly. The key to the code book information will be secured separately from&#xD;
      the dataset in an encrypted file, which will only be accessible by the researcher and the&#xD;
      supervisors of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A password protected folder will be set up on the RCSI V: DRIVE which will be used to store&#xD;
      electronic data securely. All hard copy data will be scanned electronically and saved in the&#xD;
      secure V: DRIVE folder. Hard copy data will be shredded once scanned and saved on the V:Drive&#xD;
      folder. All research subject data stored on the BRH-A2 device will be backed up onto the&#xD;
      secure V:Drive folder. Research data will be stored for a period of 5 years in compliance&#xD;
      with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Control and Quality Assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;The sponsor is responsible for implementing and maintaining quality assurance and quality&#xD;
      control systems with written SOPs to ensure that trials are conducted and data are generated,&#xD;
      documented (recorded) and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and the applicable&#xD;
      regulatory requirement (s).&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Monitors should be appointed by the sponsor. The monitor should be appropriately trained and&#xD;
      have the scientific and/or clinical knowledge needed to monitor the trial adequately.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;The purpose of trial monitoring is to verify that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The rights and well-being of human subjects are protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s),&#xD;
      with GCP, and with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) (22).&#xD;
