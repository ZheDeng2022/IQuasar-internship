    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine of local application of commericially-available,&#xD;
      FDA-approved preparation of simvastatin is effective in increasing clinical attachment levels&#xD;
      (primary outcome), as well as alveolar bone (secondary outcome) compared to standard&#xD;
      mechanical therapy in patients on periodontal maintenance therapy (PMT). Subjects undergoing&#xD;
      PMT at the UNMC College of Dentistry clinics will be recruited to participate in the&#xD;
      randomized one-year clinical trial based on the following eligibility criteria: 1) diagnosis&#xD;
      of chronic advanced periodontitis (generalized or localized), 2) participating in regular PMT&#xD;
      visits (3-6) month intervals), 3) no systemic diseases or medication which significantly&#xD;
      impact periodontal inflammation or bone turnover (e.g. steroids, bisphosphonates, &gt; 325 mg&#xD;
      aspirin/day and in good general health, 4) one experimental quadrant of the mouth with an&#xD;
      inflamed 6-9 mm interproximal posterior periodontal pocket with history of bleeding on&#xD;
      probing (BOP), 5) willingness to sign consent form. Subjects will be divided into two groups&#xD;
      for additional therapy in a 6-9 mm interproximal periodontal pocket at baseline: 1) local&#xD;
      anesthesia and mini-flap reflection with subgingival mechanical debridement plus application&#xD;
      of the simvastatin-methylcellulose gel or 2) local anesthesia and mini-flap reflection with&#xD;
      subgingival mechanical debridement plus application of saline. Samples/measurement will be&#xD;
      obtained at the designated experimental site at baseline, 2 weeks, 6 and 12 months during&#xD;
      PMT: 1) digital radiographs (baseline and 12 months only; bone height measurements), 2)&#xD;
      presence of explorer-detectable supragingival plaque, 3) 30-second gingival crevicular fluid&#xD;
      (GCF) sample (markers of inflammation, bone turnover), 4) recession from the cemento-enamel&#xD;
      junction, 5) probing pocket depth and bleeding on probing (BOP). Following the 12-month&#xD;
      visit, the research-specific intervention and measurements in the experiment quadrant will be&#xD;
      removed from routine PMT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental records of patients attending routine periodontal maintenance therapy visits at the&#xD;
      UNMC College of Dentistry clinics are reviewed as part of the direct supervision by faculty,&#xD;
      including investigators involved int his study. Assessment includes review of medical and&#xD;
      dental histories and previous oral hygiene and periodontal charting. Subjects who appear to&#xD;
      qualify (40-85 years old, diagnosis of advanced chronic adult periodontitis, one quadrant&#xD;
      with at least 3 posterior teeth and one 6-9 mm periodontal pocket, no systemic diseases or&#xD;
      medications which significantly impact periodontal inflammation and bone turnover) will be&#xD;
      informed of the study, given an opportunity to ask questions, and given an informed consent&#xD;
      form to take home. Once signed consent is obtained, subjects will be randomized to one of the&#xD;
      two groups: 1) SRP + SIM or 2) SRP + methylcellulose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit, all women subjects will be given a urine pregnancy test. Once the&#xD;
      pregnancy test is determined to be negative, the following sequence of procedures will be&#xD;
      performed by the faculty investigator (AK, RR, RH): 1) assignment of the experimental site&#xD;
      (6-9 mm pocket with previous bleeding on probing); 2) remove supraginigval plaque from the&#xD;
      experimental tooth with explorer [record positive sites]; 3) insert paper strip into facial&#xD;
      and lingual of experimental site sulcus for 30 seconds for gingival crevicular fluid (GCF)&#xD;
      sample, remove and place into sterile vial, and freeze at -80ยบ C for testing inflammation&#xD;
      markers; 4) measure recession on experimental teeth and adjacent interproximal tooth at&#xD;
      mesial-facial, mid-facial, distal-facial, mesial-lingual, mid-lingual and distal lingual with&#xD;
      UNC 15 probe; 5) measure probing pocket depths at same surfaces as recession; 6) record sites&#xD;
      that bleed within 30 seconds. After the faculty investigator (primary or secondary&#xD;
      investigator) leaves, the participating personnel (LK) will; 7) take a baseline radiograph,&#xD;
      administer local anesthesia to the experimental site via local injection, 9) surgical&#xD;
      mini-flap reflection localized to the experimental site (papilla reflection), 10) remove most&#xD;
      of the remaining interproximal soft tissue to allow access to the root and measure markers of&#xD;
      inflammation, 11) scaling/root planing of site to remove supra- and subgingival bacterial&#xD;
      plaque and calculus; 12) placement of SIM-methylcellulose gel, 13) repositioning of papilla&#xD;
      to initial location and placement of intra-oral cyanoacrylate; 14) finish full-mouth&#xD;
      measurement of probing depths and bleeding on probing; 15) perform full-mouth scaling to&#xD;
      remove supra- and subgingival bacterial plaque and calculus; 16) review oral hygiene&#xD;
      instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that steps 14, 15 and 16 could be completed prior to steps 1-13 on all teeth&#xD;
      except experimental and adjacent teeth due to availability of faculty investigators at the&#xD;
      time of the PMT appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also possible that steps 1-13 could be completed at a separate appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return for postoperative visit in two weeks. Subjects will return for&#xD;
      subsequent PMT visits after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Steps 14-16 will be completed at each&#xD;
      visit as part of routine PMT. At 6 and 12 months, steps 2-6 will also be completed. At 12&#xD;
      months, a radiograph will also be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental record data that will be recorded at each visit includes probing depths (PD),&#xD;
      recession, bleeding on probing (BOP) and presence of plaque (+/-) at test site and adjacent&#xD;
      interproximal sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected amount of time for the baseline visit in 90-120 minutes. The expected amount of&#xD;
      time for subsequent visits in 60-90 minutes.&#xD;
