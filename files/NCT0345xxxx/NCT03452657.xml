      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of intravitreous&#xD;
      ranibizumab treatment versus sham injections for prevention of high-risk DR.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, sham-controlled clinical trial. In&#xD;
      this trial, 118 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects with signed informed consent are screened&#xD;
      and assigned randomly (1:1) to one of the following parallel groups: Group A-Intravitreous&#xD;
      0.5 mg ranibizumab injections and Group B-sham injections. All participants have visits at 0&#xD;
      month, 1 month, and 2 months, followed by visits every 3 months thereafter through 1 year.&#xD;
      The main efficacy and safety outcomes assessment will be finished at the end of 12 months.&#xD;
