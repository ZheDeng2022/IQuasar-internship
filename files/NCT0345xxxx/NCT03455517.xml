  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) is the gold treatment for fit and young&#xD;
      patients with Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia (CLL). However, patients with a mutation known as&#xD;
      IGVH unmutated and patients with a particular characteristic known as 'disrupted TP53' show&#xD;
      an inferior outcome after FCR in terms of survival. Venetoclax as a single agent or combined&#xD;
      with rituximab is an effective treatment for relapsed/refractory patients with IGVH unmutated&#xD;
      CLL and/or del(17p) and is associated with a high rate of clinical responses.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) is the gold treatment for fit and young&#xD;
      (age ≤65 years) patients with CLL. However, IGVH unmutated patients and patients with&#xD;
      disrupted TP53 show an inferior outcome after FCR in terms of PFS and OS. Venetoclax as a&#xD;
      single agent or combined with rituximab is an effective treatment for relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      patients with IGVH unmutated CLL and/or del(17p) and is associated with a high rate of&#xD;
      clinical responses and MRD-negative responses. The achievement of a MRD negative response in&#xD;
      CLL is the best treatment endpoint since it is associated with an improved PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In treatment-naive patients with unmutated IGVH and/or disrupted TP53 the venetoclax and&#xD;
      rituximab combination could be a more effective regimen than FCR with a 15% increase in the&#xD;
      CR rate.&#xD;
