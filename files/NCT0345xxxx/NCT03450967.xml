      -  Clinical Phase: phase II single arm study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Objectives: Response rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of Subjects: 27 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Population: recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigational Product(s), Dose, and Mode of Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Durvalumab 1500mg plus tremelimumab 75mg via IV infusion Q4W, starting on Week 0, for up to a&#xD;
      maximum of 4 doses/cycles followed by durvalumab monotherapy 1500mg via IV infusion Q4W,&#xD;
      starting 4 weeks after the last infusion of the combination until progression.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proton therapy 5 GyE x 5 fractions&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Study Assessments and Criteria for Evaluation: Safety Assessments: according to NCI CTCAE&#xD;
      version 4.0 Efficacy Assessments: according to RECIST version 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Statistical Methods and Data Analysis: PFS: from the date of treatment to the date of&#xD;
      progression or death or last follow-up OS: from the date of treatment to the date of death or&#xD;
      last follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Sample Size Determination: Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
      HNSCC. In this phase II study, up to approximately 27 eligible patients will be enrolled. It&#xD;
      is anticipated that full accrual to this study will take approximately 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: Objective response rate ≤10% H1: Objective response rate ≥35% According to Simon's&#xD;
      two-stage optimal design (power of 90% and one-sided alpha of 0.05), this study needs total&#xD;
      27 evaluable patients. At the first stage, 11 patients would be enrolled. If two or more&#xD;
      among them achieve objective response, the study will go forward the second stage. At the&#xD;
      second stage, 16 additional patients (total 27 patients) would be enrolled. Among the total&#xD;
      27 evaluable patients, six or more objective responses are necessary for this drug to be&#xD;
      evaluated further in the group of R/M HNSCC&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of Head and neck cancer (HNC) is approximately 6% of all cases with a world&#xD;
      annual incidence and nearly 90 to 95% of HNC is squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). [1] For&#xD;
      patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC (R/M HNSCC), cytotoxic-based chemotherapy remains&#xD;
      the standard therapeutic option. The median survival of these patients treated with&#xD;
      cytotoxic-based chemotherapy, however, is only 6 to 10 months. For those who are not&#xD;
      candidates for chemotherapy, the prognosis is even worse with median survival of 3 to 6&#xD;
      months. [2-4] Thus, new therapeutic options for these patients are needed to improve the&#xD;
      treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that durvalumab plus tremelimumab combined with proton therapy would be&#xD;
      effective in R/M HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of immunotherapy and RT can be effective regimen because immunologic response&#xD;
      might be enhanced by RT through the alteration of microenvironment within the irradiated&#xD;
      field, tumor antigen release and &quot;abscopal effect&quot; at distant metastatic sites. In addition,&#xD;
      the benefit of proton therapy is to deliver RT dose just to target lesion. The irradiated&#xD;
      volume can be significantly reduced with proton therapy compared to X-ray treatment, thus&#xD;
      proton therapy will provide better quality of life compared to X-ray during palliative RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the durvalumab (MEDI4736) + tremelimumab combination therapy treatment group will&#xD;
      receive durvalumab (MEDI4736) (1500mg Q4W) in combination with tremelimumab (75 mg IV Q4W)&#xD;
      for up to 4 doses/cycles each, followed by durvalumab (MEDI4736) 1500mg Q4W until confirmed&#xD;
      disease progression unless there is unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another&#xD;
      discontinuation criterion is met. The first durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy dose at 1500mg&#xD;
      Q4W will be 4 weeks after the final dose of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in combination with&#xD;
      tremelimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tremelimumab will be administered first; the durvalumab (MEDI4736) infusion will start&#xD;
      approximately 1 hour (maximum 2 hours) after the end of the tremelimumab infusion. If there&#xD;
      are no clinically significant concerns after the first cycle, then, at the discretion of the&#xD;
      Investigator, all other cycles of durvalumab (MEDI4736) can be given immediately after the&#xD;
      tremelimumab infusion has finished.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Any unresolved toxicity NCI CTCAE Grade ≥2 from previous anticancer therapy with the&#xD;
             exception of alopecia, vitiligo, and the laboratory values defined in the inclusion&#xD;

             not require systemic therapy Patients without active disease in the last 5 years may&#xD;
             be included but only after consultation with the study physician Patients with celiac&#xD;
             disease controlled by diet alone&#xD;

             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, serious chronic&#xD;
             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase&#xD;
             risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of another primary malignancy except for Malignancy treated with curative&#xD;

             lentigo maligna without evidence of disease Adequately treated carcinoma in situ&#xD;
             without evidence of disease&#xD;
