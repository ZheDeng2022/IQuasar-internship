      The investigators will conduct pre-implementations assessments of primary care clinics within&#xD;
      a rural health system to determine current practices and capacities regarding colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (CRC) screening and follow-up, preferred evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to&#xD;
      improve follow-up, and factors that could influence successful implementation and eventual&#xD;
      impact of a multi-level intervention to increase timely and complete follow-up after positive&#xD;
      fecal occult blood test (FOBT) in rural patients.&#xD;

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Primary Care Provider/Staff Participants Interviews</arm_group_label>
    <description>Up to two primary care providers and at least one staff person at each of the 16 clinics, with approximately 5 interviewees per clinic. Eligible providers and staff include physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, case managers, medical assistants, administrative staff, or other employees of the clinic involved in the cancer screening and follow-up process.&#xD;
If the participant verbally consents, the research team member will conduct an interview with the provider to learn about the current processes used to support and monitor colorectal cancer screening (CRC) from screening initiation through follow-up; assess capacity and interest in implementing Evidence Based Practices for supporting and monitoring CRC screening, including any ideas interviewees have or find appealing; and engage the organizations as partners to build interest, capacity, and infrastructure for future intervention trial and other future studies.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Patient Participants Interviews</arm_group_label>
    <description>10 patients across 5 clinics will be recruited for interviews, which will address the patient experience with screening and follow-up.&#xD;
If the participant verbally consents, the research team member will conduct an interview with the patient participant to gain a deeper understanding of the CRC screening process from the patient's perspective; the gaps, challenges, or road blocks/speed bumps to completing CRC screening steps; and what organizations can do better or differently to help people complete the CRC screening process.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Patient Participants Anonymous Survey</arm_group_label>
    <description>-Patient participants will be recruited to take an anonymous mailed survey, which will address patient level barriers to screening and follow-up focusing on out of pocket costs.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Colonoscopy Provider/Staff Participants Interviews</arm_group_label>
    <description>Colonoscopy providers and a staff or mid-level provider in each office will be recruited for interviews.&#xD;
If the participant consents, the research team member will conduct an interview to learn about current processes used to support and monitor colorectal cancer screening from the perspective of gastroenterology/colonoscopy sites and to learn about how gastroenterology/colonoscopy sites communicate and coordinate care with other healthcare organizations and patients to support and monitor colorectal cancer screening.</description>
