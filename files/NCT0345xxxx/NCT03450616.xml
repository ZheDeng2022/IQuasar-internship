    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine how the PICO™ Negative Pressure Wound Therapy&#xD;
      compares to standard care treatment for venous stasis ulcers, as there is no evidence to&#xD;
      date.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind, randomized pilot study conducted in patients with bilateral venous&#xD;
      stasis leg ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare the rate of healing for venous stasis ulcers when using&#xD;
      the PICO™ single use Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) system versus standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine if the PICO™ NPWT system results in an increased rate&#xD;
      of healing when compared to standard of care for the treatment of venous stasis ulcers.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with bilateral venous leg ulcers (one on each lower extremity) (defined as any&#xD;
             break in the skin that has either been present for longer than 6 wks or occurred in a&#xD;
             person with a history of venous leg ulceration).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The ulcer is required to be venous in appearance (ie: moist, shallow, and of an&#xD;
             irregular shape), and judged unlikely to heal within 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years old or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an ankle brachial pressure index of at least 0.8 that was measured within the&#xD;
             previous 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  • Patients on anticoagulants- (ie: warfarin, direct thrombin inhibitors).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have a pressure index measured within the previous 3 months to be&#xD;
                  greater than 1.20&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with venous stasis ulcers greater than 17cm by 17cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Gross leg edema&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Severe wound exudate&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Previously confirmed and untreated osteomyelitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with necrotic tissue with eschar present.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with wounds that involve exposed arteries, veins, nerves, bone fragments&#xD;
                  or sharp edges.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with wounds that requires surgical suction.&#xD;
