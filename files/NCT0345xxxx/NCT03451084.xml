      ASLAN003-003 is a multi-center, Phase IIA study to evalute the efficacy of ASLAN003 in AML&#xD;
      patients who are ineligible for standard treatment with an expansion cohort in&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory patients, and to determine the appropriate dose of ASLAN003 in&#xD;
      combination with azacitidine in older (more than or equal to 60 years) AML patients who have&#xD;
      exhausted any approved and available treatment options.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      ASLAN003-003 is a multi-center, Phase IIA study to determine the optimum dose of ASLAN003&#xD;
      based on the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of varying doses of ASLAN003 (100 mg QD, 200&#xD;
      mg QD, 100 mg BID, and possibly 200 mg BID) administered to AML subjects daily for a&#xD;
      continuous 28-day treatment cycle until disease relapse, disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 2 parts and plans to enroll a total of 44 to 56 patients with 18 to 24 patients&#xD;
      in Part 1 and 26 to 32 patients in Part 2 (comprising Parts 2A and 2B). The Overall Complete&#xD;
      Remission Rate will be evaluated in AML patients not eligible for standard treatment (Part 1)&#xD;
      and in relapsed and refractory AML patients (Part 2A) using the optimum dose of ASLAN003&#xD;
      established in Part 1 of the study. In Part 2B of the study, the appropriate dose of ASLAN003&#xD;
      in combination with azacitidine in older (more than or equal to 60 years) AML patients who&#xD;
      have exhausted any approved and available treatment options will be determined.&#xD;

        <title>Overall Complete Remission Rate</title>
        <description>Defined as the proportion of patients with a best response of complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), defined in accordance with the IWG Response Criteria in AML from day 29. Treatment failure is defined as not achieving any response 4 months after study treatment. IWG Response Criteria in AML defines CR or CRi as:&#xD;
Complete remission (CR): Bone marrow blasts &lt;5 percent; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count &gt;1.0 x 109/L (1000/µL); platelet count &gt;100 x 109/L (100,000/µL); independence of red cell transfusions&#xD;
CR with incomplete recovery (CRi): All CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (&lt;1.0 x 109/L (1000/µL)) or thrombocytopenia (&lt;100 x 109/L (100,000/µL))</description>
        <time_frame>4 months after study treatment</time_frame>
        <population>The primary efficacy endpoint was OCRR, defined as the proportion of subjects with a best response of CR or CRi.&#xD;
The &quot;Measure Type&quot; and data in the &quot;Outcome Measure Data Table&quot; is reported as &quot;Count of Participants&quot; and corresponding proportion is provided next to the count.&#xD;
Two subjects who had major protocol deviations were excluded from the Evaluable for Response (EFR) analysis set. Primary and secondary efficacy analyses were performed on the EFR set.</population>
