    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well autologous NY-ESO-1-specific CD8-positive T lymphocytes&#xD;
      (modified T lymphocytes [T cells]), chemotherapy, and aldesleukin with or without dendritic&#xD;
      cell-targeting lentiviral vector ID-LV305 (LV305) and immunotherapeutic combination product&#xD;
      CMB305 (CMB305) work in treating participants with sarcoma that has spread to other places in&#xD;
      the body (advanced) or that has come back (recurrent). Modified T cells used in this study&#xD;
      are taken from participants, are changed in a laboratory, and may &quot;kill&quot; some types of tumor&#xD;
      cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Cyclophosphamide may help the body get ready to receive the&#xD;
      modified T cells. Interleukins, such as aldesleukin, are proteins made by white blood cells&#xD;
      and other cells in the body and may help regulate immune response. LV305 and CMB305 may help&#xD;
      stimulate the immune system. Giving modified T cells, chemotherapy, aldesleukin, LV305, and&#xD;
      CMB305 may work better in treating participants with sarcoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety of adoptively transferred CD8 T cells targeting NY-ESO-1 positive (+)&#xD;
      tumors given alone and in combination with antigen-specific vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the functional and numeric in vivo persistence of NY-ESO-1-specific CD8 T-cells&#xD;
      given alone and in combination with antigen-specific vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy achieved following adoptive transfer of NY-ESO-specific&#xD;
      CD8 T cells in combination with LV305 alone and with G305 vaccine in patients with advanced&#xD;
      synovial and mixed round cell liposarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the influence of antigen-specific vaccination on the induction of both CD8 and&#xD;
      CD4 T cells to NY-ESO-1 and non-targeted tumor-associated antigens (antigen-spreading) and&#xD;
      the correlation of these responses with clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 0: Participants receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day&#xD;
      -2 and autologous NY-ESO-1-specific CD8-positive T lymphocytes IV over 60 minutes on day 0.&#xD;
      Then, 6 hours later and twice a day for 14 days, receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 1: Participants receive cyclophosphamide, autologous NY-ESO-1-specific CD8-positive T&#xD;
      lymphocytes, and aldesleukin as in Cohort 0. Participants also receive dendritic&#xD;
      cell-targeting lentiviral vector ID-LV305 intradermally (ID) on days 1, 22, 43, and 64 in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After conclusion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 4 weeks for 168 days,&#xD;
      then every 3 months for 24 months.&#xD;
