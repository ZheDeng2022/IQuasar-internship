  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The air we breathe contains 21% of oxygen. Oxygen is vital for the cells ability to produce&#xD;
      energy and without it we could not survive. Oxygen normally exists as a molecule consisting&#xD;
      of two atoms, O2. It has two unpaired electrons and thus is unstable and willing to accept&#xD;
      electrons to become stable. During the formation of ATP a transportation of electrons happens&#xD;
      over the inner membrane of the mitochondria's. Oxygen can accept these and is thereby reduced&#xD;
      to water. Normally about 4% is not fully reduced and instead produces superoxide. Superoxide&#xD;
      is transformed to hydrogen peroxide by superoxide dismutase (SOD) and then into oxygen and&#xD;
      water by catalase and glutathione peroxidase. It is also possible for hydrogen peroxide to be&#xD;
      converted to hydroxyl radicals by Fenton reactions. All these radicals are called reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species (ROS) and they are highly reactive and capable to induce damage to cellular&#xD;
      components as proteins, DNA and lipids. Under normal conditions SOD, catalase and glutathione&#xD;
      peroxidase work as anti-oxidative compounds to prevent oxidative stress and damage. However,&#xD;
      under hyperoxic conditions these defences can be overwhelmed, resulting in the formation of&#xD;
      excess ROS and thus oxidative damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During general anaesthesia the use of supplemental oxygen to avoid life-threatening&#xD;
      hypoxaemia has been common practice for many years and a fixed fraction of inspired oxygen&#xD;
      (FiO2) ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 is often used. This lead to supranormal levels of oxygen in&#xD;
      the lungs and most of the patients also have supranormal levels of partial pressure of&#xD;
      arterial oxygen in their blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine otherwise healthy ambulant patients undergoing minor orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgery during general anaesthesia to elucidate metabolic and physiological changes caused by&#xD;
      ventilation with FiO2 0.50 for at least 45 minutes using standard respiratory settings.&#xD;
      Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and arterial blood will be collected prior to and after&#xD;
      surgery. The two EBCs and two blood samples will be stored at -80°C for analysis after all&#xD;
      patients have been included. The metabolic changes will be measured with NMR technique and&#xD;
      multivariate statistical analysis comparing baseline values with values obtained after oxygen&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collapse of the small airways induced by anaesthesia and FiO2 will be evaluated by measuring&#xD;
      resistance and reactance with airway oscillometry after surgery compared to a baseline&#xD;
      measurement before surgery.&#xD;

      Oxygen supplement during general anaesthesia During general anaesthesia the use of&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen to avoid life-threatening hypoxaemia has been common practice for many&#xD;
      years. This lead to supranormal levels of oxygen in the lungs (hyperoxia) and most patients&#xD;
      also have supranormal levels of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) in their blood&#xD;
      (hyperoxaemia). The same iatrogen hyperoxia is also common in mechanically ventilated&#xD;
      patients in the intensive care unit. Is seems to be forgotten that supplemental oxygen is a&#xD;
      medicine and like all medication it should not be administered in excess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During general anaesthesia a fixed fraction of inspired oxygen ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 is&#xD;
      often used. Patients are monitored with continuously measurement of peripheral oxygen&#xD;
      saturation and if this is low or an arterial gas shows low PaO2 then FiO2 is further&#xD;
      increased. However, a decrease beyond the prefixed FiO2 is seldom done even if oxygen&#xD;
      saturation is 100% or the arterial gas shows a high PaO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More and more evidence question the safety of this liberal use of hyperoxia as high oxygen&#xD;
      supplement and the formation of ROS can lead to cell dysfunction and thereby contribute to&#xD;
      pulmonary dysfunction postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse effects of oxygen FiO2 exceeding the atmospheric content of 0.21 can have direct&#xD;
      toxic effects on lung tissue especially for FiO2 exceeding 0.60. Studies from the 1970's&#xD;
      showed that when breathing FiO2 1.0 for more than four hours people experienced mild symptoms&#xD;
      like tracheobronchitis and pleuritic. This is a mild irritation behind the sternum, in the&#xD;
      airways or in the lungs. This discomfort is aggravated by deep inspiration and can cause&#xD;
      cough. They also showed that a high FiO2 of 0.95-1.0 given for several days lead to pulmonary&#xD;
      edema and eventually lung fibrosis. High FiO2 also induce collapse of lung areas leading to&#xD;
      pulmonary shunt because of reabsorption atelectasis and induce pulmonary vasodilatation but&#xD;
      otherwise induce vasoconstriction in all others vascular beds (except in uterus) and thereby&#xD;
      reduce cardiac output and end organ perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The precise mechanism of the direct cellular damage and vasoconstriction is unknown but is&#xD;
      believed to be due to increased production of ROS5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical setting with critical ill patients hyperoxia and hyperoxaemia has been&#xD;
      associated with increased mortality specifically in subgroups of patients with stroke,&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury and those resuscitated from cardiac arrest and it is also shown to&#xD;
      increased infarct size and mortality after cerebral and myocardial infarction. Perioperative&#xD;
      treatment with high FiO2 has also been associated with increased mortality and major&#xD;
      respiratory complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabonomics Lately there has been a lot of attention on the formation of ROS during&#xD;
      hyperoxic conditions. Besides induction oxidative stress ROS also affects a number of&#xD;
      signal-transduction-pathways that leads to cellular changes. These changes can be detected&#xD;
      using metabonomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabonomics is the analysis of all small molecules or metabolites present in a given sample&#xD;
      using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or mass spectrometry (MS). Metabonomics gives a&#xD;
      &quot;snapshot&quot; of all metabolites in a given sample and thus has great potential to find several&#xD;
      new biomarkers by analysis of the continuous changes in the metabolic profile in response to&#xD;
      a given exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oscillometry Anaesthesia and high FiO2 lead to collapse of the small airways. A new airway&#xD;
      oscillometry system (TremoFlo C-100) enables a simple and non-invasive measurement of changes&#xD;
      in the small airways. The system measure resistance and reactance non-invasively during&#xD;
      normal breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial We will examine otherwise healthy ambulant patients undergoing minor orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgery during general anaesthesia to elucidate metabolic and physiological changes caused by&#xD;
      ventilation with FiO2 0.50 for 45 minutes following standard settings. Exhaled breath&#xD;
      condensate (EBC) and arterial blood will be collected prior to the surgery and repeated&#xD;
      during surgery after 45 minutes of mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 0.50. The two EBCs and&#xD;
      two blood samples will be stored at -80°C for analysis after all patients have been included.&#xD;
      The metabolic changes will be measured with NMR technique and multivariate statistical&#xD;
      analysis comparing baseline values with values obtained after 45 minutes of oxygen exposure.&#xD;
      All specimens will be destroyed after the NMR analyses. Collapse of the small airways induced&#xD;
      by anaesthesia and FiO2 will be evaluated by measuring resistance and reactance after surgery&#xD;
      compared to a baseline measurement before surgery.&#xD;
