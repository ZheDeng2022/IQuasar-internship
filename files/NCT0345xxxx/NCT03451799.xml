    <textblock>
      Enrolled subjects will be placed on a 16-week ketogenic diet (subject specific as prescribed&#xD;
      by RD) while receiving standard of care cancer treatment (Radiation + Temozolomide). Study&#xD;
      dietitians will create personalized meal plans for each patient with the goal of achieving&#xD;
      and maintaining protocol defined metabolic ketosis. Subjects will be monitored for safety,&#xD;
      nutrition, quality of life, and standard of care tumor assessments over the course of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

      Enrolled subjects will be placed on a 16-week ketogenic diet (subject specific as prescribed&#xD;
      by RD) while receiving standard of care cancer treatment (Radiation + Temozolomide). Study&#xD;
      dietitians will place patients on a strict and controlled diet that manages daily&#xD;
      macronutrient breakdown and increases the ratio of dietary fat relative to protein and&#xD;
      carbohydrate consumption. Dietitians will provide guidance and teaching of the diet, as well&#xD;
      as, monitoring and diet adjustment to ensure metabolic ketosis. Dietitians and study&#xD;
      physicians (and their staff) will monitor subjects for safety, nutrition, quality of life,&#xD;
      and standard of care tumor assessments over the course of the study.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adults (age â‰¥ 18 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Newly or recently diagnosed glioblastoma. Patients may enroll in the study from the&#xD;
             time of diagnosis (prior to the initiation of standard-of-care chemoradiation) up&#xD;
             until the initiation of post-radiation adjuvant chemotherapy (typically approximately&#xD;
             3-4 weeks after the completion of radiation therapy). Overall, this provides a window&#xD;
             of approximately 3 months from the time of diagnosis for patients to enroll in this&#xD;
             study. No recurrent glioblastoma is allowed on trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Being seen for treatment of glioblastoma at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Note: Okay if&#xD;
             patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy at another facility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on low and managed doses of steroids are permitted. Up to 8 mg dexamethasone&#xD;
             or steroid equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky Performance Status of &lt;70 as deemed by physician or equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body Mass Index of &lt;22 kg/m2 (rounded to nearest integer)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with disorders that affect lipid metabolism such as pyruvate carboxylase&#xD;
             deficiency, porphyria, primary carnitine deficiency, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I&#xD;
             or II deficiency, carnitine translocase deficiency, Beta-Oxidation Defects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical comorbidities that in the opinion of the investigator limits the patient's&#xD;
             ability to complete this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant, nursing, or implanted with an intrauterine device (IUD) that is not MR&#xD;
             compatible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are vegan or vegetarian will be excluded, as the ketogenic diet includes&#xD;
             foods that may interfere with these preferences&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on high doses of steroids will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients currently receiving experimental therapeutic therapy will be excluded from&#xD;
             the trial. Note: Off-label therapy use is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to adhere to the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of allergic reactions to surgical steel or elastomer/rubber are&#xD;
             excluded from the activity monitor portion of the study. Because the activity monitor&#xD;
             uses a Bluetooth low energy Transceiver, individuals using pacemakers, implantable&#xD;
             cardiac defibrillators, neuro-stimulation devices, cochlear implants, hearing aids, or&#xD;
             other electronic medical equipment should also be excluded from wearing the activity&#xD;
             monitor. They can still use the Aria scale to record weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with mechanically, magnetically, or electrically activated implants, such as&#xD;
             cardiac pacemakers, neurostimulators, and infusion pumps, that are not magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging/positron emission tomography (MRI/PET) compatible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with ferromagnetic implants and ferromagnetic foreign bodies, such as&#xD;
             intracranial, aneurysm clips, shrapnel and intraocular metal chips as these could&#xD;
             become dislodged.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to tolerate MRI/PET imaging secondary to an inability to lie supine or&#xD;
             severe claustrophobia as assessed by the treating physician or principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to lie still, hold their breath, or follow imaging procedure&#xD;
             instructions as assessed by the treating physician or PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose most recent renal function test does not meet Cedars-Sinai Medical&#xD;
             center standard of care MRI contrast protocol requirements (glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
             &lt;45ml/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known allergy to Fludeoxyglucose F18 (F18-FDG) radioactive tracer or&#xD;
             gadolinium-based contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with allergy to animal dander or animal-instigated asthma.&#xD;
