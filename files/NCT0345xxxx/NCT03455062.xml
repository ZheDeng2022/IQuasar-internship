  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In terms of immunity, pregnancy can be considered a semi-allogeneic transplant. There are&#xD;
      several immunological mechanisms for implantation and maintenance of pregnancy by induction&#xD;
      of tolerance without induction of immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study wants to evaluate the impact of immunodepression on women's fertility by studying&#xD;
      the fertility of transplanted cardiac, renal, hepatic and pulmonary women.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A study of HIV-positive immunocompromised patients in medically assisted procreation,&#xD;
      published in January 2016, found lower rates of implantation, clinical pregnancy, and newborn&#xD;
      babies in these patients compared to HIV-negative patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studying the fertility of transplanted immunocompromised women would provide adequate&#xD;
      information on fertility and pregnancy possibilities for these patients, study their&#xD;
      fertility on a larger scale and finally better understand the role of immunodepression in&#xD;
      fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy is considered an allogeneic semi-graft, one can question the fertility of these&#xD;
      patients under long-term immunosuppressive treatment. In particular, is there an impact on&#xD;
      embryo implantation and on the development of pregnancy? To try to answer this problematic,&#xD;
      we propose a retrospective non-interventional study to evaluate the birth rate after&#xD;
      spontaneous or induced pregnancy in women who have tried to procreate after&#xD;
      transplantation.The data will be collected using questionnaires submitted to the women&#xD;
      present in the list of patients transplanted from the Organ Transplant Unit (OTU) of Toulouse&#xD;
      University Hospital who have agreed to participate. This will make it possible to&#xD;
      retrospectively study fertility data in these patients and to carry out, with the necessary&#xD;
      hindsight, statistics on pregnancy rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure: birth rate after spontaneous or induced pregnancy in liver,&#xD;
      heart, lung or kidney transplant patients who have attempted to procreate post-transplant is&#xD;
      a good primary endpoint because it is a unique clinical criterion. relevant to the purpose of&#xD;
      the study, specific and objective.&#xD;

    <description>Recruitment of participants through the list of cardiac, renal, hepatic, pancreatic or pulmonary transplant patients collected from the the Organ Transplant Unit.&#xD;
A letter from the the Organ Transplant Unit will initially be sent to patients informing them of the study and if they do not wish to participate they can report their opposition by email.&#xD;
A fertility questionnaire will be send and that will have to be returned by the patient in order to be included in the study.&#xD;
The questionnaires, anonymous, will be numbered according to their order of return.</description>
