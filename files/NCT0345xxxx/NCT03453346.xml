  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of generic sofosbuvir, an&#xD;
      investigational anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug, combined with weight-adjusted ribavirin&#xD;
      for treatment-naive Chinese adults chronically infected with genotype 2 HCV, the second most&#xD;
      prevalent genotype in China. One hundred and thirty-two (132) subjects, including one hundred&#xD;
      and twenty (120) non-cirrhotics and twelve (12) compensatory cirrhotics, were medicated with&#xD;
      sofosbuvir 400 mg daily combined with weight-adjusted ribavirin 1000-1200 mg daily. The&#xD;
      treatment course lasted 12 successive weeks and thereafter all the study participants entered&#xD;
      into a 12-week treatment-free follow-up period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that China has a population of over 10 million infected with HCV and also a&#xD;
      highly variable HCV genotype geographic distribution. Genotype 2 HCV is reported to be the&#xD;
      second most common type (~25%) in Chinese population and associated with a high risk of acute&#xD;
      liver disease exacerbation and other extrahepatic diseases. Sofosbuvir is a pan-genotypic HCV&#xD;
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase inhibitor directing at HCV RNA replication. Genotype 2&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C has a high treatment response to the combined regimen of peginterferon&#xD;
      and weight-adjusted ribavirin. The all-oral combination regimen of sofosbuvir and ribavirin&#xD;
      is expected to completely suppress genotype 2 HCV replication in subjects chronically&#xD;
      infected with HCV and achieve a sustained virologic response, namely, HCV not detected or&#xD;
      below a predefined limit in plasma, 12 or 24 weeks after cessation of treatment.&#xD;
