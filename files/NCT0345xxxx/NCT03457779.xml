  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to describe and discover new insights into the glucose, amino acid,&#xD;
      and lipid metabolic dependencies of TNBC via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy&#xD;
      analysis of in vivo [1,2-13C] glucose-labeled breast cancer biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to correlate the dominant metabolic dependencies of TNBCs with&#xD;
      pathologic response to preoperative chemotherapy, and with the cancers' molecular signaling&#xD;
      pathways assessed via NGS and RPPA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the recognized hallmarks of cancer cells is deregulated cellular metabolism,&#xD;
      characterized by enhanced metabolic autonomy compare with non-transformed cells. Tumor cells&#xD;
      typically display an overall increase in glucose metabolism, associated with enhanced aerobic&#xD;
      glycolysis and decreased oxidative phosphorylation, accompanied by a requirement for a high&#xD;
      rate of protein, nucleotide, and fatty acid synthesis to provide the raw materials for cell&#xD;
      division. 13C-glucose is a non-radioactive stable isotope tracer that has been widely used in&#xD;
      vitro, in vivo, and in patients in a variety of disease settings to study glucose, amino&#xD;
      acid, and lipid metabolism, at steady state and following intervention. [1,2-13C] glucose can&#xD;
      provide additional information on the activity of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway&#xD;
      versus glycolysis. Administration of intravenous 13C-glucose is a convenient and affordable&#xD;
      approach to analyzing the metabolomics of human cancers in their native microenvironments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The metabolic dependencies of the various breast cancer subtypes are poorly understood.&#xD;
      Importantly, in depth analyses of the in situ metabolic processes utilized by triple-negative&#xD;
      breast cancers (TNBCs) using state-of-the-art in vivo [1,2-13C]-glucose infusions in patients&#xD;
      with TNBC has never been done. In TNBC, oncogenic activation of key signaling pathways leads&#xD;
      to altered metabolic programming resulting in an increased dependence on exogenous nutrients&#xD;
      such as glucose and glutamine. These data further suggest a hypothesis that TNBCs may employ&#xD;
      a cellular mechanism called macropinocytosis to ingest and degrade interstitial albumin to&#xD;
      accumulate glutamine. This process may then be exploited for therapeutic gain through&#xD;
      enhanced uptake by cells that utilize macropinocytosis to meet their metabolic requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, administration of [1,2-13C]-glucose to patients with TNBC will be done prior&#xD;
      to patients undergoing a biopsy of their breast cancer as well as blood sample collection&#xD;
      which will allow for in depth evaluation of glycolysis as well as lipid and amino acid&#xD;
      metabolism by Joshua Rabinowitz, PhD, at Princeton University who is an international expert&#xD;
      in cancer metabolomics. RAS and PI3K pathway and other genomic alterations as well as pathway&#xD;
      activation status will be determined by next generation sequencing (NGS) and by reverse phase&#xD;
      protein array (RPPA), and will be correlated with the metabolic findings, and both will be&#xD;
      assessed in the context of the patients' response to standard preoperative chemotherapy.&#xD;
