  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, open label, multicenter, dose escalation study of RXDX-106 in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, who have no available therapy&#xD;
      likely to convey clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of RXDX 106.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of Phase 1 is to assess safety and tolerability, determine the&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and assess the pharmacokinetics of RXDX-106. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of RXDX-106, as assessed by&#xD;
      objective response rate (ORR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1&#xD;
      (RECIST v1.1) and Immune Response Related Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) in patients with&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed starting dose of RXDX-106 was calculated based upon nonclinical toxicology&#xD;
      studies to determine a recommended first-in-human starting dose, which may be below the&#xD;
      biologically active level. Therefore, in order to minimize the number of patients treated at&#xD;
      this dose, an accelerated titration design will be used for the first cohort, after which, a&#xD;
      conventional 3+3 scheme will be followed for enrollment in subsequent dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final determination of the single agent RP2D will be based on available safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      PK, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy data from different dose levels and schedules tested, but&#xD;
      will be no higher than the maximum tolerated dose. After RP2D has been determined, additional&#xD;
      expansion cohorts of patients (up to 15) with specific tumor types, treatment history, and/or&#xD;
      expression of a specific biomarker may be enrolled.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive continuous daily oral doses of RXDX-106 in 21 day cycles. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), study drug will be administered in an escalated fashion starting at dose of 10 mg/day and will proceed at the dose levels prespecified by the dose escalation schema. Once daily dosing for RXDX-106 will initially be tested. However, other dosing schedules (eg, every other day, weight based, etc) may be tested based on safety and PK data to optimize drug exposure.</description>
