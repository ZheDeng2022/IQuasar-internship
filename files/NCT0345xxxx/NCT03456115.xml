    <textblock>
      The research team has developed a prototype for an investigational mechanical nasal dilator&#xD;
      and the investigators aim to evaluate its efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators wish to address the following research questions: 1) How does&#xD;
      mechanical nasal obstruction affect patients' lives? The investigators aim to answer this&#xD;
      question with use of validated questionnaires. 2) How do currently available mechanical nasal&#xD;
      dilators affect objective and subjective findings related to nasal obstruction? This will be&#xD;
      evaluated with objective nasal airflow testing and with modifications to validated&#xD;
      questionnaires 3) How does the investigational team's novel device affect these same outcome&#xD;
      measures? 4) Do patients find the investigational device subjectively comfortable and&#xD;
      efficient?&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restricted nasal breathing is a common complaint among patients presenting to Otolaryngology&#xD;
      clinics. In fact, one in eight people experiences some degree of nasal obstruction, or&#xD;
      regular difficulty breathing through the nose, which is often the result of a narrowing or&#xD;
      collapse of the internal nasal valve. This condition is a daily source of discomfort that&#xD;
      reduces productivity and quality of life. Sufferers report shortness of breath throughout the&#xD;
      day, difficulty sleeping and habitual snoring, and limited stamina during sports and&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Slight dilation of the nasal passages directly counteracts nasal obstruction and reverses&#xD;
      symptoms in 89% of those afflicted. To this end, many patients undergo functional rhinoplasty&#xD;
      procedures to surgically widen the nasal passages. However, up to 20% of patients experience&#xD;
      unimproved or worsened symptoms postoperatively. Moreover, these surgeries are invasive,&#xD;
      requiring autologous grafts taken from the nose, ear, or ribs; and surgeries entail a&#xD;
      yearlong recovery period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal dilators such as Breathe Right strips offer a potential alternative to surgery, as&#xD;
      these dilators mechanically expand the nasal passages to effectively relieve obstruction.&#xD;
      However, existing products are designed as sleep aids, and customers find them uncomfortable,&#xD;
      difficult to use, and too visible to wear in public. Although the mechanism for reversing&#xD;
      nasal obstruction is straightforward, surgery is considered the only viable option for those&#xD;
      who struggle to breathe during the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Engineers from the Johns Hopkins Biomedical Engineering Department, partnered with clinicians&#xD;
      from the Johns Hopkins Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, have developed&#xD;
      the Schnozzle, a small silicone stent to counteract nasal valve collapse and relieve&#xD;
      restricted nasal breathing. The investigators hypothesize that this device will improve&#xD;
      symptoms of nasal obstruction and provide patients with a viable alternative to visible&#xD;
      non-invasive devices or surgical management. The aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility and comfort of this device in comparison to existing commercially available&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from patients presenting to Otolaryngology clinics with&#xD;
      symptoms of nasal obstruction. The otolaryngologist in clinic will screen these patients for&#xD;
      nasal valve collapse as in standard clinical practice. This involves visualizing the nasal&#xD;
      cavity through nasal endoscopy and evaluating the nasal valve using Cottle maneuver (applying&#xD;
      lateral force to the cheek to open the nasal valve) or the modified Cottle maneuver (using a&#xD;
      cotton tip applicator to open the nasal valve from inside the nasal cavity) and evaluating&#xD;
      for improvement in nasal obstruction symptoms. Improved nasal airflow during the maneuver&#xD;
      suggests nasal valve collapse contributes to restricted nasal airflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical Otolaryngologist will counsel participants with nasal valve collapse regarding&#xD;
      the various treatment options as in routine clinical practice (management options include to&#xD;
      doing nothing, using existing nasal dilator devices, or undergoing surgery). Patients will&#xD;
      then be invited to participate in the study, which will involve a study session in which&#xD;
      patients are fitted with several nasal dilator devices, instructed in proper care and use,&#xD;
      and report on their function and comfort. Additional participants will be recruited from&#xD;
      patients who present to clinics with symptoms unrelated to nasal breathing to serve as a&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient expresses interest in participating, the patient will be introduced to a member&#xD;
      of the research team to discuss the study and complete informed consent. All participation is&#xD;
      voluntary and participants are able to withdraw from the study at any point. The study&#xD;
      participant will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes the previously&#xD;
      validated Nasal Obstruction and Septoplasty Effectiveness (NOSE) instrument, questions&#xD;
      regarding the patient's current treatments, and a ranking of their preferred characteristics&#xD;
      of an ideal nasal dilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be asked to inhale rapidly into an airflow transducer to measure peak&#xD;
      nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF). Following the pre-test survey participants will be fitted with&#xD;
      existing nasal dilator products per manufacturer recommendations (Breathe Right strips, Max&#xD;
      Air nose cones, Sleep Right dilator, and Nozovent dilator), and the experimental nasal&#xD;
      dilators designed by the research team. In this crossover design study participants will be&#xD;
      blinded as to which dilators are branded and which are experimental. The order of fitting&#xD;
      nasal dilators will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each fitting and use for 5 minutes to adjust to the device and confirm there is no&#xD;
      immediate discomfort or irritation, participants will undergo repeat PNIF testing with each&#xD;
      device, then will be free to go home and trial the devices. Participants will be given a&#xD;
      schedule specifying one device to use for at least one continuous hour per day in a&#xD;
      randomized order, while also being blinded as to which device participants will be using&#xD;
      (Schnozzle, Breathe Right, Max Air, Sleep Right, Nozovent). The devices will be numbered in a&#xD;
      random fashion, for participants to be able to identify which device via the assigned number&#xD;
      the devices are scheduled to use. Participants will similarly use the device number when&#xD;
      performing any device evaluation. Participants are free to wear the assigned nasal dilator at&#xD;
      their leisure, but must log the hours and activities performed while wearing the device (for&#xD;
      example, &quot;10am-11am exercising&quot;). Participants are not required to wear a device in public at&#xD;
      work or during exercise unless participants feel comfortable doing so. All devices should be&#xD;
      worn overnight. If there is any discomfort, irritation, skin breakdown, or epistaxis the&#xD;
      participant should stop wearing the device and contact the research team immediately. Each&#xD;
      morning, the participant will complete a survey summarizing their experience using the&#xD;
      assigned device. Before returning to the clinic for the conclusion of the study, participants&#xD;
      may have several days without an assigned device. Participants are free to stop wearing all&#xD;
      devices or use any device as participants please as long as it is consistent with proper care&#xD;
      and use of the device(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After at least five days (one day per device) the participant will return to the office for&#xD;
      an exit interview with the study team in regards to their subjective experience with each&#xD;
      device. At the end of each trial participants will be asked to fill out a concluding survey&#xD;
      regarding the device participants were using. At their exit interview participants will be&#xD;
      asked to hand in the survey for each device participants trialed.&#xD;
