  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitals in the French West Indies (Fort-de-France (Martinique); Basse-Terre and&#xD;
      Pointe-à-Pitre (Guadeloupe); and French Guiana (Cayenne, Saint-Laurent du Maroni)) have noted&#xD;
      the emergence of eosinophilic meningitis cases in recent years. This finding is part os&#xD;
      eosinophilic meningitis cases emergence and meningoencephalitis caused by the parasite&#xD;
      Angiostrongylus cantonensis on the American continent and in the Greater Antilles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2013, the investigation of an eosinophilic meningitis case by the Basse-Terre hospital&#xD;
      team with a positive specific PCR in the CSF (CDC, Atlanta, USA) showed the first case of&#xD;
      neuromeningeal angiostrongylosis in Guadeloupe. A similar case was diagnosed by serology at&#xD;
      Pointe-à-Pitre University Hospital a few years earlier without having been published, and&#xD;
      another serious case diagnosed also at Pointe-à-Pitre University Hospital Center in January&#xD;
      2017. The team at the Martinique University Hospital Center also reported several cases of&#xD;
      eosinophilic meningitis with positive serologies for A. cantonensis carried out in&#xD;
      laboratories outside Martinique (Laboratory of Parasitology, Gonesse, France; Thailand; and&#xD;
      Tropical Institute and Public Health, Switzerland) in recent years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emergence of this parasitosis is related to the introduction of the intermediate host&#xD;
      Achatina fulica on the American continent and the geographical evolution of the&#xD;
      angiostrongylosis cases is intrinsically linked to that of the Achatins. To date, only two&#xD;
      studies report the environmental presence of Angiostrongylus cantonensis in the Lesser&#xD;
      Antilles. One proved the presence in rats (23.4%) on the island of Grenada, and the other in&#xD;
      Guadeloupe, showing that 32.4% of Achatina fulica collected carried the parasite by specific&#xD;
      PCR. In Martinique, where the number of cases is increasing, and in French Guiana, where&#xD;
      there is an increase in the number of cases in neighboring countries, especially Brazil, no&#xD;
      study has been conducted on this parasite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel with this finding, several serious digestive tables associated with strong&#xD;
      hypereosinophilia were reported in Martinique and Guadeloupe in the 90s but also in recent&#xD;
      years, the last case in December 2016. Etiological diagnoses were established by the&#xD;
      discovery of Angiostrongylus costaricensis parasite in ileal pathological specimens. However,&#xD;
      these cases could never be investigated by serology or specific PCR due to lack of diagnostic&#xD;
      tools available in the French West Indies and Guiana region, and more broadly in metropolitan&#xD;
      France.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Angiostrongylosis is a parasitosis caused by the nematode Angiostrongylus sp. The adult&#xD;
      parasite lives in the rat's arteries (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus), its definitive&#xD;
      host, where it breeds. Stage 1 immature larvae are released into the environment in rat&#xD;
      droppings. Stage 3 larval maturation, which is essential for the re-contamination of final&#xD;
      hosts, is mainly carried out in the Buyina fulica mollusc (common name: Achatine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mode of contamination in humans is by ingestion of stage 3 parasitic larvae according to&#xD;
      various modes: accidental ingestion of molluscs or salads soiled by &quot;molluscan slime&quot;&#xD;
      (example: by consumption of salad, vegetables, non-washed fruits), voluntary ingestion of&#xD;
      molluscs, manipulation of molluscs (children or fishermen), use of drinking water drawn from&#xD;
      natural and non-disinfected water bodies. Hand-carried transmission after handling of&#xD;
      Achatines is most often reported in young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, these larvae have a different preferential tropism depending on the species of&#xD;
      Angiostrongylus. The two main pathogenic species for humans are Angiostrongylus cantonensis&#xD;
      and Angiostrongylus costaricensis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiostrongylus cantonensis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ingestion by man, the larvae of Angiostrongylus cantonensis migrate to the central&#xD;
      nervous system. They cause eosinophilic angiostrongyl meningitis and meningoencephalitis,&#xD;
      which can lead to severe neurological sequelae (paralysis) or even death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These clinical features are associated with eosinophilic pleocytosis in CSF (eosinophilic&#xD;
      meningitis) and blood eosinophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiostrongylus cantonensis was first described in Canton, China in 1935. To date, it is&#xD;
      present in the Pacific Islands, Australia, Africa and recently on the American continent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiostrongylus costaricensis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ingestion, the larvae of Angiostrongylus costaricensis migrate intestines and into the&#xD;
      abdominal cavity. They cause severe abdominal pain mimicking those of appendicitis,&#xD;
      haemorrhage and perforation digestive that can lead to death (2 to 8% of cases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major eosinophilia usually accompanies these unspecific clinical pictures. Angiostrongylus&#xD;
      costaricensis does not have the same geographical distribution as Angiostrongylus&#xD;
      cantonensis. It was first described in Costa Rica in 1967 and is endemic on the American&#xD;
      continent, where it is at the origin of many human cases.&#xD;
