      Pain control for acute isolated back pain and sciatica is a nebulous and often illusive task&#xD;
      in the emergency department, and a challenge face everyday by emergency medicine physicians.&#xD;
      Standard pain control practices are poorly defined in practice and in the literature. NSAIDs&#xD;
      alone have been shown to be less-than-adequate controllers of acute back pain warranting&#xD;
      emergency department visits and have little bearing on long-term pain control or recovery.&#xD;
      Opioids are additionally poor long-term pain controllers and are gaining public controversy&#xD;
      for their overuse. Modalities such as acupuncture, massage, thermotherapy, and spinal&#xD;
      manipulation have been described in the literature with minimal evidence. Aromatherapy for&#xD;
      pain control has been recently demonstrated as effective in the management of burn-dressing&#xD;
      changes as well as post-operative pain management in children. It is an inexpensive and&#xD;
      easily employed modality not yet explored in the emergency department for acute pain such as&#xD;
      isolated back pain and sciatica. The authors propose to study Rosa damascena oil aromatherapy&#xD;
      for the control of isolated acute back pain in the emergency department compared to almond&#xD;
      oil placebo. The authors hypothesize that Rosa damascena will provide additional pain relief,&#xD;
      as a known analgesic, when compared to almond oil aromatherapy. The authors will identify&#xD;
      patients presenting to the Stony Brook University Hospital (SBUH) Emergency Department (ED)&#xD;
      with acute isolated back pain and sciatica and test this hypothesis using a blind randomized&#xD;
      approach. Patients included will be those above the age of 18 with isolated, non-traumatic&#xD;
      back pain and sciatica lasting less than 2 weeks. Primary outcomes measured will include&#xD;
      decrease in pain severity on a visual analog scale after 30 minutes of aromatherapy and again&#xD;
      at 60 minutes post-therapy. Secondary outcomes measured will include patient satisfaction,&#xD;
      need for clinician-determined rescue medications, and minimal clinical importance difference&#xD;
      of pain control. Aromatherapy will be provided with both essential oil concentrated Rosa&#xD;
      damascena and almond extract delivered via soaked-cotton ball 20-30 cm from the patient's&#xD;
      face.&#xD;

      A. SPECIFIC AIMS This study aims to research the use of aromatherapy for pain control in the&#xD;
      emergency department, specifically, acute back pain. Aromatherapy, particularly Rose&#xD;
      Essential Oil (Rosa damascena) has been studied in recent literature and shown to be&#xD;
      effective versus placebos for the control of acute pain with lasting effects during burn&#xD;
      dressing changes and post-operative pain management. These studies have been small and&#xD;
      specific to discrete clinical conditions. Their evidence supports the use of aromatherapy for&#xD;
      acute pain control with additional patient satisfaction benefit, but they are not yet&#xD;
      externally validated to more common conditions facing emergency medicine physicians. The&#xD;
      investigators chose to study acute isolated back pain and sciatica presenting to the&#xD;
      emergency department and the use of Rosa damascena essential oil versus a control of Almond&#xD;
      Oil for the treatment of isolated back pain and sciatica. The authors will investigate the&#xD;
      use of aromatherapy in pain management by measuring and comparing pre- and post-treatment&#xD;
      pain levels using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. A significant reduction in&#xD;
      pain by 13 mm on the VAS has been previously demonstrated as the minimal clinically important&#xD;
      difference for treatment of pain. The primary endpoint will be the evaluation of significant&#xD;
      change in VAS score greater than 13 mm between both groups immediately following a 30 minute&#xD;
      blinded aromatherapy treatment and again 30 minutes later. The secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, need to rescue medication (its type and dose), and subjective changes&#xD;
      in pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Background and Significance Aromatherapy has been hypothesized to be an effective&#xD;
      management strategy for acute pain control. Its use has been recently demonstrated in Iran,&#xD;
      using Rosa damascena (Damask Rose) essential oil. Rosa damascena is believed to possess&#xD;
      anti-anxiolytic, sedative, anticonvulsive, and analgesic effect on the central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) when delivered through the olfactory system (Mohebitabar et al. 2016). This theory is&#xD;
      believed to be in part due to the lateral gate theory of pain control and a stimulant's&#xD;
      ability to inhibit transmission of stimuli through pain fibers. However, while any olfactory&#xD;
      stimulant might be hypothesized to do just that, only Rosa damascena has been shown to&#xD;
      produce significant reduction in pain on the VAS as well as patient satisfaction when&#xD;
      compared to scented placebos like Almond Oil. Rosa damascena has been shown to improve pain&#xD;
      control during dressing changes of second- and third-degree burns (Bikmoradi et al 2016). It&#xD;
      has also been shown effective and equal to NSAID treatment of immediate post-operative pain&#xD;
      in children (Marofi et al. 2015). It may be an affordable and easy-to-use modality for pain&#xD;
      control in the emergency department. Its prior studies are small in sample size and carry&#xD;
      little external validity that could be applied to an American Emergency Department&#xD;
      population. The authors aim to assess whether aromatherapy using Rosa Damascena is&#xD;
      reproducible in the emergency department for control of isolated and acute back pain, two&#xD;
      common painful conditions seen with poor evidence for proper pain control. Validity of Rosa&#xD;
      damascena aromatherapy in acute back pain and sciatica may open new doors of pain control to&#xD;
      be researched in the emergency department and will further characterize the use of&#xD;
      aromatherapy in modern medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Preliminary Studies The known external studies of Rosa damascena have been cited above and&#xD;
      will be presented in the references section. The authors have not yet studied aromatherapy in&#xD;
      the emergency department and will be completing this study fresh, based on methodology used&#xD;
      in external aromatherapy and back pain treatment studies. The Minimal Clinically Important&#xD;
      Difference (MCID) of 13 mm on the VAS has been studied repeatedly and validated as the&#xD;
      minimal VAS change needed for a patient to express significantly subjective improvements in&#xD;
      pain (Gallagher, Leibman, and Bijur 2001)(Jensen and Chen 2003). Successful pain treatment&#xD;
      has been shown by using 3-5 drops of 40% Rosa damascena oil on a cotton ball or gauze pad&#xD;
      20-30 cm from a patients face for 30 minutes (Bikmoradi et al. 2016). Additionally, uses of&#xD;
      rescue medications and patient satisfaction have been commonly used as secondary measures in&#xD;
      both aromatherapy and landmark back pain treatment studies. Patient demographics include age,&#xD;
      gender, comorbidities, prior treatment, BMI, education, marital status, and pain identifiers&#xD;
      have been repeatedly used to assess patient demographic distribution in many benchmark&#xD;
      Emergency Medicine acute pain management studies (Chang et al 2015.)(Friedman et al. 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Research Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale and Overview Isolated acute back pain (less than 2 weeks duration) and sciatica are&#xD;
      common complaints to the emergency department requiring acute pain management with often&#xD;
      chronic follow-up. Their abundance in the ED as well as poorly defined treatment&#xD;
      recommendations make them an excellent candidate to study the use of aromatherapy in the&#xD;
      emergency department. The authors will replicate the Rosa damascena trials referenced above&#xD;
      in similar protocols, patients will be recruited if they fit the attached inclusion criteria&#xD;
      and do not meet exclusion criteria. Patients will be treated with either Almond Oil extract&#xD;
      or Rosa damascena extract, and both the investigator and patient will be blinded to the&#xD;
      control arm. A VAS pain scale will be recorded before treatment, after 30 minutes of&#xD;
      treatment, and after a following 2nd 30 minutes. Patients will additionally be asked about&#xD;
      their satisfaction and subjective changes in pain, they will be blinded to their prior VAS&#xD;
      line placements for proper evaluation of objective pain level changes. Demographics thought&#xD;
      to contribute to the sensation of pain, expression of pain, and response to pain treatment&#xD;
      will additionally be collected without entangling Private Health Information (PHI). Finally,&#xD;
      the use of rescue medication such as NSAIDs or Narcotics at the treating physician's&#xD;
      discretion will be recorded as an indicator of treatment failure and complication. Pain will&#xD;
      be qualified in its type, locations, duration, immediate episodes prior to presentation, and&#xD;
      prior remote episodes in the patient's lifetime health history. Pain will also be quantified&#xD;
      by attempted at-home treatments prior to presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Site The entirety of this prospective clinical trial will be conducted at the Stony&#xD;
      Brook Hospital Emergency Department, an ED with over 110,000 annual visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Sample Patients will be recruited into this study by an investigator in the Stony Brook&#xD;
      Emergency Department. A sample size was calculated to be 30 patients for each treatment arm&#xD;
      based on a power of 0.80, desired p value below 0.05, and 95% confidence intervals with the&#xD;
      anticipated possibility of patient loss or desire to withdraw during treatment. Patients will&#xD;
      be approached for recruitment after an attending or resident physician has seen them and does&#xD;
      not anticipate immediate need for narcotic pain medication, immediate imaging, or immediate&#xD;
      threats to life or limb. Patients will be included by the attached inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Double-blinding will be ensured by block randomization of each treatment arm,&#xD;
      performed outside of the emergency department. In the Emergency Department Research Offices,&#xD;
      the two treatment arms will be allocated into identical, individual vessels with only a&#xD;
      codified label applied to each. Using block randomization, 30 treatments will be distributed&#xD;
      to each arm in secret by a clinical research assistant or investigator. Each treatment will&#xD;
      be codified individually and recorded in secrecy and kept from the investigators.&#xD;
      Randomization will then arrange the total 60 treatments in longitudinal order for sequential&#xD;
      random treatments to be selected as each patient is recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Patients will be approached in private and the name, title, and role of the&#xD;
      investigator explained after asking permission to speak with the patient. The patient will be&#xD;
      told that the investigators are conducting a clinical research trial for the treatment of&#xD;
      acute back pain and sciatica. Aromatherapy will be explained as the treatment of interest and&#xD;
      a modality that has been tested and proven effective in other types of pain. The use of&#xD;
      Almond products and Rose products will be briefly discussed with the patients. Patient's will&#xD;
      be asked about any allergies and then asked specifically about allergies to Almonds, Roses,&#xD;
      perfume, and ibuprofen. Patients will be informed that speaking with the investigator is&#xD;
      entirely optional, as is participating in the study, as there may be no direct benefit to&#xD;
      them despite disclosure of their private information to the investigator. An Inclusion and&#xD;
      Exclusion form will be reviewed with the patient and their chart, noting their sequential&#xD;
      patient number in this study as the only de-identified patient ID. No PMI will be collected;&#xD;
      no medical record numbers (MRN), address, phone number, emails, name, SSN, DOB, chief&#xD;
      complaint, past medical history (PMH), past surgical history (PSH) , or medications will be&#xD;
      recorded. The risks and benefits will be explained to the patient including risk of allergy,&#xD;
      risk of no change in pain, benefit of pain improvement, and benefit of contribution to&#xD;
      medical research. The consent form will be reviewed in full and any questions answered. Those&#xD;
      patients interested in participating and able to grant consent will do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Rosa damascena 40% and Almond Oil 40% kept outside of the ED will be prepared each&#xD;
      day and dispersed into identical vessels with randomized identification numbers. The coded&#xD;
      numbers and their respective modality will be recorded by an investigator not involved in&#xD;
      delivery and kept secured. Patients will be assigned into random treatment arms by block&#xD;
      randomization and their coded treatment recorded on the patient data sheet. Patients will be&#xD;
      given 4 drops of either modality (40%) on a cotton ball kept between 20 and 30 cm from their&#xD;
      face for 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regards to study blinding, the treatments will be randomly assigned and the patients&#xD;
      will not be told which treatment they are receiving. The patients will be aware that the&#xD;
      study involves Rose and Almond scents and will likely be able to identify the scent used in&#xD;
      their treatment. However, at the end of the study procedures, an independent observer will&#xD;
      assess the patient's pain after the aromatherapy has been removed from the room, and will not&#xD;
      be aware of which patients received which treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Statistics VAS differences immediately after treatment and 30-minutes following will be&#xD;
      aggregated from their respective 100 mm VAS for pain and the change calculated for each&#xD;
      patient. One-tailed paired t-Tests will be then conducted on the means after standard&#xD;
      deviation is calculated and compared between treatment and control groups. A chi-squared test&#xD;
      will then be applied between both groups for analysis of significant differences in patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and subjective reports of pre- and post-treatment pain. The use of rescue&#xD;
      medications by type and dosage will be measured as a percentage of each group and compared&#xD;
      via t-Test between both groups.&#xD;
