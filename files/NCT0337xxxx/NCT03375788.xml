  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common in individuals with obesity and is a&#xD;
      significant threat to public health, because it can lead to impaired liver function and liver&#xD;
      failure. Growth hormone is a hormone produced in the pituitary gland that helps regulate&#xD;
      metabolism and growth. Individuals with obesity, on average, secrete less growth hormone than&#xD;
      individuals without obesity. There are data to suggest that growth hormone may help to reduce&#xD;
      the amount of fat in the liver, and may also reduce inflammation in the liver, both of which&#xD;
      would be helpful to individuals with NAFLD. The purpose of this study is to investigate&#xD;
      whether treatment with a drug called tesamorelin, which is a growth hormone releasing hormone&#xD;
      analogue, will decrease liver fat and improve liver inflammation and scarring in obese&#xD;
      individuals with NAFLD.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Men and women 18-65yo&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30kg/m2, or, for participants with known steatohepatitis, BMI&#xD;
             ≥ 25kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hepatic steatosis as demonstrated by either a) Grade 1+ steatosis on a liver biopsy&#xD;
             performed within 12 months of the baseline visit, without &gt;10% reduction in body&#xD;
             weight or addition of medications to treat fatty liver, or b) liver fat fraction ≥5%&#xD;
             on hydrogen-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Hepatitis C antibody and Hepatitis B surface antigen negative. Subjects without known&#xD;
             history of Hepatitis C or Hepatitis C treatment who have a positive Hepatitis C&#xD;
             antibody but a negative hepatitis C viral load will also be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For females ≥50yo, negative mammogram within 1 year of baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. If use of vitamin E ≥400 international units daily, stable dose for ≥6 mos&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Up to date with colon cancer screening recommended by the participant's primary care&#xD;
             physician, using whatever methodology the primary physician recommends. This will be&#xD;
             ascertained by self-report. (If a participant does not have a primary care physician,&#xD;
             we will discuss that colon cancer screening is recommended, typically starting at age&#xD;
             50y, and refer the participant to primary care through Partners if s/he desires.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Heavy alcohol use defined as consumption of &gt; 20 grams daily for women or &gt; 30 grans&#xD;

             ≥6.5%. Participants with stable use of metformin ≥6 months will be permitted if it is&#xD;
             being used for pre-diabetes or another non-diabetes indication (e.g., PCOS).&#xD;

             of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or exam. If a subject is not known to&#xD;
             be cirrhotic at screen but is found to be cirrhotic based on the results of liver&#xD;
             biopsy at baseline, this subject will be referred to a hepatologist for clinical care&#xD;
             and will be excluded from further participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             coronary interventions; b) more than 2 myocardial perfusion studies; 3) more than 2&#xD;
             computed tomography angiograms&#xD;

         23. Active consideration for a procedure or treatment that involves significant radiation&#xD;
             exposure as defined above in the 12 months following randomization&#xD;
