  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bell's palsy is defined as a facial nerve palsy without any other known cause. The common&#xD;
      practice for this disease consists of the use of oral steroids. Such treatment can cause harm&#xD;
      to people who have disabilities or prior conditions such as pregnancies, diabetes, obesity&#xD;
      and/or high blood pressure. While the use of intratympanic injection for sudden sensory&#xD;
      hearing loss is well rehearsed in many practices, similar management of facial nerve palsy&#xD;
      due to Bell's phenomenon is rare and a few researches have been conducted regarding the&#xD;
      subject. In this research we suggest intratympanic injections for these patients as a&#xD;
      treatment for Bell's palsy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bell's palsy is defined as a facial nerve paralysis without any other known diagnosis or&#xD;
      cause .Its' estimated occurrence is in 20 to 30 people per 100,000 people per year. The&#xD;
      occurence is greater in patients older than 65 years old and lower in children younger than&#xD;
      13 years old. There are many estimated etiologies for Bell's palsy, such as failure of the&#xD;
      vasa nervosa, viral infections, ischemic neuropathies and auto immune reactions. Of those,&#xD;
      viral hypothesis is the most widely accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prognosis for recovery for most patients is 80% to 90%. One series showed that only 17&#xD;
      out of 1505 patients demonstrated moderate to severe sequela and none had complete facial&#xD;
      nerve paralysis. The common practice for the management of Bell's palsy consists of oral&#xD;
      steroids with or without the antiviral medications. A recent study made by the Department of&#xD;
      Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck surgery in Korea indicated that Intratympanic&#xD;
      injections could replace the use of oral steroids . Another recent study by Jong job lee et&#xD;
      al. has shown that Intratympanic injections have prolonged uptake in rats, in comparison to&#xD;
      Intraperitoneal injections.&#xD;
