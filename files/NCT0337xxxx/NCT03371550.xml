  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CHRT) is the standard of care for unresectable locally advanced&#xD;
      stage III non-small cell lung cancer. However, the optimal combination remains unclear. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 2 induction chemotherapy cycles (days 1 and&#xD;
      22) with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 followed by concurrent chemotherapy&#xD;
      (weekly docetaxel-cisplatin, 20 mg/m2) and 3-D conformal radiotherapy for 6 weeks (66 Gy/5&#xD;
      fractions per week/2 Gy per fraction). ). The primary endpoint is the response rate.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are toxicity, time to progression, and overall survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most common malignancy among men in most countries and constitutes the&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Non-small cell histology represents roughly 80% of&#xD;
      lung cancer cases comprising one third of patients with stage III, locally-advanced disease&#xD;
      at diagnosis. Some stage IIIA cancers are considered resectable but many stage IIIA (with&#xD;
      bulky N2) and stage IIIB (T4 any N M0, any T N3M0) cancers are considered unsuitable for&#xD;
      surgery. However, some authors have shown that surgery after chemoradiotherapy (CHRT) is&#xD;
      beneficial for at least progression-free survival (PFS). Since the 90s, CHRT has become the&#xD;
      cornerstone of inoperable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A&#xD;
      meta-analysis of 52 randomized studies showed a survival improvement of 3% at 2 years and 2%&#xD;
      at 5 years for patients treated with CHRT versus radiotherapy alone [6]. Concomitant&#xD;
      chemoradiation was demonstrated to be better than sequential administration in terms of&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) in 3 out of 4 randomized studies with esophagitis as the dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity. Nevertheless, the median survival was around 16 months and improvement is needed.&#xD;
      To better control micrometastatic disease and reduce distant relapses, one possibility is to&#xD;
      increase radiosensitization with higher doses of chemotherapy.The aim of this phase II study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the anti-tumoral activity of a weekly docetaxel-cisplatin combination&#xD;
      administered concurrently with radiotherapy after 2 induction cycles with the same drugs.&#xD;
