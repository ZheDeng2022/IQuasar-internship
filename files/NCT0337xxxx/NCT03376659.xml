    <textblock>
      This is a dual arm, open label phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity&#xD;
      of the combination of durvalumab with CV301 in combination with maintenance chemotherapy for&#xD;
      patients with metastatic colorectal or pancreatic cancer whose disease is stable on, or&#xD;
      responding to 1st line therapy for metastatic disease. Patients with metastatic colorectal or&#xD;
