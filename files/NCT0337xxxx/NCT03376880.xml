    <textblock>
      In obese children, excess fat on the thorax exerts an unfavorable burden on the respiratory&#xD;
      system, particularly during exercise; however, it is unclear if this burden reduces exercise&#xD;
      tolerance, provokes dyspnea on exertion, or contributes to respiratory symptoms that could be&#xD;
      misdiagnosed as asthma, placing obese children at risk of unnecessary treatment and&#xD;
      potentially a reluctance to exercise explaining reports of low physical activity and fitness&#xD;
      levels, which are counterproductive to weight loss. The investigators will examine the&#xD;
      respiratory effects of obesity in prepubescent boys and girls, including those with&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms misdiagnosed as asthma, before and after 1) a program of weight loss and&#xD;
      regular exercise and 2) continued weight gain as compared with prepubescent normal weight&#xD;
      boys and girls before and after 1 year. These results will have broad and immediate clinical&#xD;
      impact on the care of obese children, especially those with respiratory symptoms misdiagnosed&#xD;
      as asthma, and the results could alter interventional approaches for preventing and treating&#xD;
      childhood obesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In obese children, excess fat exerts an unfavorable burden on the respiratory system,&#xD;
      particularly during exercise, potentially reducing exercise tolerance and leading to DOE&#xD;
      (dyspnea on exertion), which could explain reports of low physical activity and fitness&#xD;
      levels in obese children. The investigators propose that most of the respiratory effects in&#xD;
      obese children are the result of low lung volume breathing, i.e., a reduction in functional&#xD;
      residual capacity (FRC) at rest, and end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this application is to investigate the respiratory effects of&#xD;
      obesity in prepubescent children, including obese children with respiratory symptoms&#xD;
      misdiagnosed as asthma, before and after 1) a program of weight loss and regular exercise and&#xD;
      2) continued weight gain as compared with normal weight children before and after 1 yr. The&#xD;
      investigative approach will be to examine respiratory function, exercise tolerance, and&#xD;
      dyspnea on exertion (DOE) in prepubescent obese boys and girls, including those misdiagnosed&#xD;
      with asthma (i.e., asthma not confirmed by lung function tests), before and after 1) weight&#xD;
      loss (or an equivalent reduction in BMI percentile) and regular exercise and 2) continued&#xD;
      weight gain (or an increase in BMI percentile) as compared with prepubescent normal weight&#xD;
      boys and girls before and after a control period of 1 yr.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The following hypotheses will be tested in obese children as compared with&#xD;
      normal weight children:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1) Obesity will decrease respiratory function but to a greater extent in obese children&#xD;
      misdiagnosed with asthma as evidenced by altered pulmonary function and breathing mechanics&#xD;
      at rest; Aim 2) Obesity will decrease exercise tolerance (as evidenced by peak maximum oxygen&#xD;
      uptake (VO2) in ml/min/kg, i.e., physical fitness), but not cardiorespiratory fitness (as&#xD;
      evidenced by peak VO2 in % of predicted based on ideal body wt), except in obese children&#xD;
      misdiagnosed with asthma where both may be reduced during graded cycle ergometry; Aim 3)&#xD;
      Obesity will increase DOE but to a greater extent in obese children misdiagnosed with asthma&#xD;
      as evidenced by increased ratings of perceived breathlessness during constant load exercise&#xD;
      cycling; and Aim 4) Weight loss and regular exercise will improve respiratory function,&#xD;
      exercise tolerance, and DOE in obese children, including those misdiagnosed with asthma,&#xD;
      while continued weight gain will worsen respiratory function, exercise tolerance, and DOE in&#xD;
      obese children, including those misdiagnosed with asthma, as compared with normal weight&#xD;
      children before and after 1 yr.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term objective is to investigate the effects of obesity on respiratory function,&#xD;
      exercise tolerance, and DOE, examine obesity-related respiratory symptoms misdiagnosed as&#xD;
      asthma in obese children, and provide novel results that could alter interventional&#xD;
      approaches for preventing obesity and treating obesity in obese children. Thus, these results&#xD;
      will have broad and immediate clinical impact on the care of obese children, especially those&#xD;
      with respiratory symptoms misdiagnosed as asthma.&#xD;

          -  Otherwise healthy with normal lung function; prepubescent (Tanner equal to or less&#xD;
             than 3); age and gender specific BMI &gt; 95th percentile, but less than 150% of the 95th&#xD;
             percentile based on the CDC standards or age and gender specific BMI between the 16th&#xD;

             ability to perform pulmonary and exercise test accurately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with significant diseases other than obesity or shortness of breath on&#xD;
             exertion will be excluded. Subjects participating in regular conditioning-type&#xD;
             vigorous exercise two times or more per week will be excluded (i.e., sports training).&#xD;
             Children who are non-English speaking will be excluded from the study because the&#xD;
