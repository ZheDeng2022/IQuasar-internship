  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study includes patients with relapsed acute leukemia who have previously been treated&#xD;
      with standard treatment that is still present and there is no curative treatment option&#xD;
      available. Researchers are studying whether the drug Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin, followed by an&#xD;
      infusion of blood cells called leukocytes from a donor, can stimulate the immune system to&#xD;
      potentially fight the leukemia. Gemtuzmab ozogamicin is a class of drugs known as an antibody&#xD;
      drug conjugate. The drug is given on days 1,4,7. It is infused, attaches to cells with a&#xD;
      certain marker on the surface (the majority of which would be leukemia cells). The drug is&#xD;
      then internalized and the chemotherapy drug becomes activated. Gemtuzumab is currently FDA&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infusion of leukocytes to stimulate the immune system to fight your leukemia is&#xD;
      investigational and has not been proven to cure cancer. This combination of Gemtuzumab&#xD;
      Ozogamicin and donor leukocytes is not an FDA approved treatment and is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially a total of 6 patients will be included in the study to assess the safety of the&#xD;
      treatment. Once 6 patients have been treated and no unacceptable toxicities are seen, more&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled. The study will treat up to 18 patients on the study.&#xD;

             before transfusion or infusion and up to 7 days before recovery of cells or tissue; or&#xD;
             (B) You use an appropriate algorithm designed to evaluate volumes administered in the&#xD;
             48 hours before specimen collection, and the algorithm shows that plasma dilution&#xD;
             sufficient to affect the results of communicable disease testing has not occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical situations in which you must suspect plasma dilution sufficient to affect the&#xD;
             results of communicable disease testing will exclude the donor. Such situations&#xD;
             include, but are not limited to the following:(A) Blood loss is known or suspected in&#xD;
             a donor over 12 years of age, and the donor has received a transfusion or infusion of&#xD;
