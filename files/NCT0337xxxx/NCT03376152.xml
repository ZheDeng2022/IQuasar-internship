  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the impact of a pilot Rural Electric Kettle Promotion Program&#xD;
      offered to low-income households in rural Anhui Province, China. The primary objective of&#xD;
      this study is to determine whether this promotion program causes poverty households currently&#xD;
      boiling their drinking water with solid-fuels (or drinking untreated water or bottled water)&#xD;
      to switch to boiling their drinking water with electric kettles, and if so, how such a switch&#xD;
      might improve safe drinking water access and/or reduce household air pollution.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research suggests that increasing the use of electric kettles for boiling (i.e.,&#xD;
      treating) drinking water in low-income areas of rural China could help expand access to safer&#xD;
      drinking water, reduce household air pollution, and improve environmental and health outcomes&#xD;
      in rural Chinese households currently boiling drinking water with solid-fuels (or not&#xD;
      treating their water, or drinking contaminated bottled water).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a parallel arm cohort cluster-randomized controlled trial design with a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio. The study will randomize 30 clusters (i.e., villages) to treatment or control&#xD;
      using stratified randomization by geography (two levels: mountains and plains) and by cluster&#xD;
      proportions of reported electric kettle use at baseline. Randomization sequence generation&#xD;
      will be conducted by A. Cohen using a random number generator (with a reproducible seed) in&#xD;
      Stata v.13.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect data from 30 randomly selected households in 15 villages, for a total&#xD;
      of 900 households. This sample size was powered to measure a 15% (or larger) change in&#xD;
      electric kettle adoption, because the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention&#xD;
      (China CDC) will be unlikely to rollout a national program if adoption rates are less than&#xD;
      15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline data collection and randomized allocation, in the intervention group&#xD;
      village-level promotion events will take place in November-December of 2017, and will be&#xD;
      organized by the provincial and county China CDC, in collaboration with the National Center&#xD;
      for Rural Water Supply Technical Guidance (NCRWSTG). At these promotion events, households in&#xD;
      the intervention group will be provided free, food-grade quality, electric kettles, as well&#xD;
      as promotional materials (a calendar and poster) and information about the benefits of&#xD;
      electric kettle use and improved hygiene and sanitation practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of known issues with decreasing adoption of drinking water treatment after behavior&#xD;
      change promotion interventions such as this, and considering expected seasonal variation in&#xD;
      boiling practices and frequencies, study data was initially planned to be collected over a&#xD;
      period of 12 months (with additional qualitative follow-up via focus groups: 2019-03,&#xD;
      2019-08).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We were able to extend the follow-up data collection period from 12-months to 24-months, so&#xD;
      we did not collect data from focus groups in 2019-03 or 2019-08 as originally planned.&#xD;
      Follow-up data collection was completed in November 2019. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we&#xD;
      again postponed plans to collect data from focus groups (data cleaning efforts were delayed&#xD;
      until 2021). Logistics allowing, we intend to collect data from focus groups in 2022.&#xD;
