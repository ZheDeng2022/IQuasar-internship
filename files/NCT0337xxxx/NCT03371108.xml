&#xD;
          7. Inadequately controlled thyroid disease, defined as a TSH or free T4 value &gt; the upper&#xD;

             prohibited; chronically administered oral, inhaled, topical, or intra-articular&#xD;
             corticosteroids at a stable dosage are allowed if no increase in dose is anticipated&#xD;
             during the study; See Appendix 3 [Section 17.3] for a list of allowed and prohibited&#xD;
             concomitant medications).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Current use of medication intended to cause weight loss or weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;

             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any history of pancreatitis or pancreatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Any diagnosis or condition that requires the subject to undergo procedures that could&#xD;
             decrease antibodies in plasma or that would require treatment with immunosuppressant&#xD;
             agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Any condition e.g., splenectomy, autoimmune disease, or rheumatologic disease, that&#xD;
             could affect immunologic responses, could indicate an altered immune system, or could&#xD;

&#xD;
         21. Any unresolved infection or a history of active infection within 30 days before&#xD;
             screening other than mild or viral illness (as judged by the Investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Any other disease or condition that in the opinion of the Investigator could confound&#xD;
             the study results or limit the subject's ability to participate in the study or comply&#xD;
             with follow-up procedures; or any other factor that would indicate a significant risk&#xD;
             of loss to follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Intolerance or history of hypersensitivity to insulin glargine or any excipient of IP.&#xD;
