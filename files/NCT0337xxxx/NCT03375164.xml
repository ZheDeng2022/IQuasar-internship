  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial is a single-dose controlled trial using&#xD;
      rAAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin for DMD patients. Cohort A will include six patients ages 3&#xD;
      months to 3 years, and Cohort B will include six patients ages 4 to 7 years old. All patients&#xD;
      will receive intravenous SRP-9001.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the gene will be infused via peripheral arm vein so that it can reach all the&#xD;
      muscles in the body. Six DMD patients ages 3 months to 3 years in Cohort A, and six DMD&#xD;
      patients ages 4 years to age 7 years in Cohort B, will be enrolled. All patients will receive&#xD;
      SRP-9001. Patients will have infusions over 1-2 hours in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit&#xD;
      (PICU) at Nationwide Children's Hospital. Before the gene therapy a muscle biopsy will be&#xD;
      done at the screening visit. Patients will have a second muscle biopsy to see if the gene&#xD;
      allowed for replacement of the missing dystrophin protein at 90 days post-delivery. After the&#xD;
      gene transfer, patients will be carefully monitored, for 5 years to evaluate any side effects&#xD;
      of the treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Gross Motor Scaled Score measures motor development. The Bayley-III Gross Motor Subtest will be scored for Cohort A on every follow up visit starting at Day 30 through 3 years. Any patient that is 43-47 months of age, inclusive, at time of screening will have the scaled score calculated compared to normative data for 42 month old children. The Bayley-III provides normative data for children 1-42 months of age.</description>
