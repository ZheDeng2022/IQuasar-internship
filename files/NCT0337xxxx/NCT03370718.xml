  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib works in treating patients with adrenal&#xD;
      cortex cancer that has spread to nearby tissue, lymph nodes (locally advanced), or other&#xD;
      places in the body (metastatic), and cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable).&#xD;
      Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate progression free survival at 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Best overall response rate. II. Overall survival (OS). III. Toxicity assessment by the&#xD;
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (V)4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Pharmacokinetics and cabozantinib serum levels to assess correlation with response to&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Steroid hormone biomarkers as markers of disease response. III. Study the effect of&#xD;
      cabozantinib on immune markers by obtaining optional biopsy and blood samples collections at&#xD;
      baseline, during therapy and at time of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Pharmacogenomics of drug disposition gene variants that potentially influence&#xD;
      cabozantinib pharmacokinetics (PK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30-37 days.&#xD;
