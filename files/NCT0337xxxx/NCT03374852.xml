  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm, phase II trial, of 45 patients with locally advanced pancreatic&#xD;
      ductal adenocarcinoma. The efficacy of the novel drug and mitochondrial inhibitor, CPI-613,&#xD;
      in conjunction with standard-of-care FOLFRINOX, as a first-line therapy will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Pre-treatment, diagnostic biopsy tissue will be collected when available, and clinical data&#xD;
      will be evaluated to determine if the combination results in improved overall survival&#xD;
      compared to historical experience.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) To determine if CPI-613 increases overall survival (OS) when used in combination with&#xD;
      mFOLFIRINOX, in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary (Exploratory) Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the safety of CPI-613 + mFOLFIRINOX combination in patients with locally&#xD;
           advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To collect tissue specimens for future correlative studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To estimate median progression free survival (PFS) when CPI- 613 is used in combination&#xD;
           with mFOLFIRINOX, in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To estimate the percent resected when CPI-613 is used in combination with mFOLFIRINOX in&#xD;
           patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer&#xD;
