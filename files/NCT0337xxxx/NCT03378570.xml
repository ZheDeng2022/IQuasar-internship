  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of different treatment locations using&#xD;
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to treat major depressive disorder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is little standardization between rTMS treatment programs as to what is the&#xD;
      best way to localize the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is the FDA-approved&#xD;
      treatment location for clinical rTMS for major depressive disorder (MDD). Different targeting&#xD;
      methods yield locations that can vary by up to a few centimeters. By comparing different&#xD;
      treatment locations and obtaining neurobehavioral, neuroimaging, cognitive, and&#xD;
      neuropsychological measures, this study would provide the opportunity to identify the optimal&#xD;
      treatment targeting method when using rTMS for major depressive disorder in a clinical&#xD;
      setting. This study will specifically be focusing on comparing the two most common targeting&#xD;
      methods: a target 5.5cm anterior to the motor strip on the left prefrontal scalp and the F3&#xD;
      target location on the left prefrontal scalp as identified using the 10-20 EEG system&#xD;
      nomenclature.&#xD;
