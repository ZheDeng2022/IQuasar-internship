      This is a non-interventional, multi-country, multi-centre cohort study based on existing data&#xD;
      from medical records of patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC treated with&#xD;
      afatinib (Gi(l)otrif®) as the first-line treatment followed by osimertinib in case the T790M&#xD;
      resistance mutation was developed.&#xD;

        Study is planned that around 65 study centres in 11 countries will be participating in this&#xD;
        noninterventional study and at least 190 consecutive eligible patients will be enrolled to&#xD;
        the study. Every patient who fulfils inclusion and exclusion criteria and agree to&#xD;
        participate in the study (if a written informed consent is required for this NIS by local&#xD;
        regulation and legal requirement) will be selected until the required sample size is&#xD;
        achieved.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received drug(s) other than osimertinib as the second-line treatment&#xD;
             and/or patients who received drug(s) other than afatinib (Gi(l)otrif®) as the&#xD;
             first-line treatment&#xD;
