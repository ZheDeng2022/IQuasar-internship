  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common congenital malformations. The right&#xD;
      ventricle in the sub-aortic position, or &quot;systemic right ventricle&quot; is one of these complex&#xD;
      cardiac diseases. Several studies show that adults with CHD and especially systemic right&#xD;
      ventricle have reduced exercise capacity. In addition, studies have shown that there is a&#xD;
      correlation between alteration of aerobic physical capacity and alteration of right&#xD;
      ventricular systolic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding and assessing the determinants of the physical capacity of patients with&#xD;
      systemic right ventricles and evaluating their quality of life could allows us to improve&#xD;
      their therapeutic management and also to expand patient indications to a program cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation. This can benefit them on their exercise capacity, their tolerance to exercise&#xD;
      and their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to study the correlation between the quality of life and the aerobic physical&#xD;
      fitness of patients with a systemic right ventricle and to determine the clinical and&#xD;
      paraclinical parameters that have an impact on the aerobic physical fitness of these&#xD;
      patients. The quality of life of patients with a systemic right ventricle will be compared to&#xD;
      that of the general population.&#xD;

      100 patients will be enrolled in this study. 25 sites will participate to the enrollment,&#xD;
      belonging to the French national network for complex congenital heart diseases (M3C) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient is included during his annual medical check-up. Quality of life questionnaire and&#xD;
      other examinations are performed during this site visit. Its is a part of his usual care. No&#xD;
      supplementary visit, directly related to the research, are necessary.&#xD;
