  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a serious disease and the third most common cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease following myocardial infarction and stroke. The most common symptoms of acute PE are&#xD;
      breathlessness and respiratory pain. Although many patients have respiratory pain in acute&#xD;
      PE, the treatment of pain is not well described in literature. It is also unclear how long&#xD;
      after acute PE the respiratory pain persists. In other conditions with respiratory associated&#xD;
      pain, clinical treatment guidelines are available to avoid complications, such as pneumonia,&#xD;
      related to impaired respiratory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized controlled multicenter study is to evaluate the effect of a&#xD;
      treatment, in patients with respiratory associated acute PE pain, consisting of information&#xD;
      on anatomy and physiology in acute PE and breathing technique in addition to usual care&#xD;
      treatment. The above treatment will be compared to conventional treatment in PE with&#xD;
      respiratory associated pain, which means treatment with analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred sixty patients recruited from the Sahlgrenska University Hospital and Alingsås&#xD;
      Hospital will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups are examined before and after interventions related to respiratory associated&#xD;
      pain, measured with visual analogue scale (VAS), analgesic consumption, lung function&#xD;
      measured with Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF), physical disability impairment measured by&#xD;
      Disability Rating Index (DRI) and questions about the patients self-efficacy on managing&#xD;
      their respiratory associated pain, days hospitalized, pneumonia rate during or after&#xD;
      hospitalization, oxygen saturation and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups are followed from the inclusion date to 14 days after inclusion through physical&#xD;
      visits by the physiotherapist during hospital care and by telephone contact after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the positive clinical experience of the information and breathing technique can be&#xD;
      confirmed in the study, the method could be spread and used as an easily accessible new&#xD;
      treatment method.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is one of the manifestations of venous thromboembolism (VTE)&#xD;
      and is a serious and potentially life threatening condition. VTE is the third most common&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease after myocardial infarction and stroke, and in the West, with its&#xD;
      aging population, a major health problem. In Sweden, the number of diagnosed cases of acute&#xD;
      PE is 20-60 per 100,000 inhabitants per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common symptoms of acute PE are breathlessness and respiratory associated pain. The&#xD;
      respiratory pain is an inflammatory pain that originates from the vessels where the embolisms&#xD;
      are located. The pain occurs through an irritation of the visceral pleural membrane and&#xD;
      creates a sharp, clearly localized pain that increases during deep breathing, coughing and in&#xD;
      some cases in motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden´s guidelines for the treatment of venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism state that &quot;thrombosis can cause acute pain and the disease may generate&#xD;
      anxiety especially in respiratory symptoms&quot;. It is unclear how long the pain persists. In a&#xD;
      previous study of our research group, 30% of patients had residual respiratory associated&#xD;
      pain at discharge after being treated for acute PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many patients have respiratory associated pain in acute PE, there are no clear&#xD;
      description of how this pain should be treated in current guidelines internationally and&#xD;
      nationally in Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence exists that patients with respiratory pain for example after surgery or after costae&#xD;
      fracture, should use breathing exercises to increase their ventilation and reduce the risk of&#xD;
      complications such as pneumonia and atelectasis.The exercise consists of deep breathing&#xD;
      exercise focusing on exhalation with a positive expiratory pressure-device or breathing&#xD;
      exercise focused on inhalation with an inhalation spirometer, which has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      pleural pressure, increase lung expansion and provide better gas exchange. As far as we know,&#xD;
      there are currently no studies on the treatment of respiratory related pain in acute PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of a treatment method in addition to the usual&#xD;
      care treatment for patients with respiratory associated pain in acute PE. The treatment&#xD;
      consists of information and breathing technique and is compared in the usual care treatment&#xD;
      for patients with respiratory associated pain, which means treatment with analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are recruited from wards at the Medical, Cardiovascular and Oncology Clinics at&#xD;
      Sahlgrenska University Hospital and Alingsås Hospital. Patients are identified and recruited&#xD;
      in the ward they are cared for by physical therapist on duty. All requested patients receive&#xD;
      oral and written patient information and shall give their informed consent before inclusion&#xD;
      in the study. The patient is randomized via closed-envelope randomization by an independent&#xD;
      person to participation in either treatment group or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Upon inclusion, all patients receive detailed written and oral information about&#xD;
      the study and how to register in the study protocols by the physiotherapist at the hospital&#xD;
      where they are being treated. The patients randomized to the treatment group also receive&#xD;
      information on anatomy and physiology in acute PE as well as the breathing technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information that the patient in the treatment group receives is information about what&#xD;
      acute PE is regarding anatomy and physiology, a review of what causes the respiratory&#xD;
      associated pain in acute PE and also a review of the breathing technique to manage their&#xD;
      respiratory associated pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups are informed about using the analgesics they need, but the treatment group is&#xD;
      instructed to primarily use breathing techniques to cope with the pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A protocol about the information on anatomy and physiology as well as about the breathing&#xD;
      technique is used to ensure that the physiotherapists in the study provide the same&#xD;
      standardized information to the patients. Written information on anatomy and physiology and&#xD;
      breathing technique is also given to patients in the treatment group so that he/she can&#xD;
      control that he/she uses the breathing technique correctly when the physiotherapist is not&#xD;
      present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the time hospitalized, the patient is visited by the physiotherapist day 1, day 2 and&#xD;
      at the day for discharge. If the patient has questions or needs support concerning the&#xD;
      breathing technique between visits, visits by the physiotherapist or telephone contact are&#xD;
      possible. All patients are monitored for 14 days from the inclusion date regarding pain,&#xD;
      analgesic consumption and breathing technique training for the patients in the treatment&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up with the patient takes place on day 7 and day 15, if the patient is discharged&#xD;
      from hospital, this follow-up is done over the phone. On day 15, the patients send the study&#xD;
      protocols to the physiotherapist responsible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed with Statistic Package for the Social Sciences (SPPS). Both parametric&#xD;
      and non-parametric statistics will be used. Data is presented as mean, standard deviation or&#xD;
      median and range depending on the variable type. For comparisons between groups in&#xD;
      quantitative variables, paired t-tests and ANOVA with post-hoc analyzes will be used. For&#xD;
      qualitative variables, Mann Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test will be used. Variables&#xD;
      that are dichotomous will be analyzed by Chi2 test or Fisher's exact test.&#xD;

How sure are you that you can achieve a small to moderate decrease in your respiratory associated pain by means other than increased medication?&#xD;
How sure are you that you can achieve a significant reduction in your respiratory associated pain by means other than increased medication?
