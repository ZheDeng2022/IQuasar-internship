    <textblock>
      Historical Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower extremity amputation is among the oldest known surgical procedures in medical history.&#xD;
      Despite the passage of over two millennia, however, relatively little has changed in the&#xD;
      operative approach. Currently, lower limb amputation is indicated most frequently for lower&#xD;
      extremity compromise due to severe peripheral vascular disease, followed in short order by&#xD;
      trauma, tumors, infections and congenital limb deficiencies. Estimates of frequency of lower&#xD;
      limb amputations range from 30,000-40,000 cases per year in the United States alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal function of the lower limb is enabled through the interplay of multiple muscle groups&#xD;
      acting in concert. Ambulation is a remarkably orchestrated biomechanical process that is&#xD;
      dependent upon a complex feedback loop involving the central and peripheral nervous systems&#xD;
      and the musculoskeletal system. In their native state, the muscles of the lower extremity&#xD;
      exist in a balanced agonist/antagonist milieu in which volitional activation of one muscle&#xD;
      leads not only to its contracture, but also passive stretch of its opposite. Changes in&#xD;
      muscle tension manifest through these changes lead to stimulation of specialized receptors&#xD;
      within the muscle fibers that transmit joint position information to the cerebral cortex.&#xD;
      Such feedback, in conjunction with cutaneous sensory information from skin mechanoreceptors,&#xD;
      provides us with a sense of limb proprioception that ultimately enables high fidelity limb&#xD;
      control, even in the absence of visual feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the standard operative approach to lower limb amputation at either the below knee&#xD;
      (BKA) or above knee (AKA) level obliterates many of the dynamic relationships characteristic&#xD;
      of the uninjured lower extremity. Initial exposure is accomplished through either a&#xD;
      stair-step (BKA) or fishmouth (AKA) pattern incision, followed by progressive transection of&#xD;
      muscles, vessels, nerves and bone at the level of the incision. Tissues distal to the site of&#xD;
      structural transection are discarded, regardless of whether or not there may be viable&#xD;
      segments, and the proximal residual muscles are layered over the distal transected bone in&#xD;
      order to provide insulation to this exposed osseous surface. The surrounding skin is then&#xD;
      advanced over the bone/muscle infrastructure in order to achieve definitive closure. The&#xD;
      rudimentary approximation of tissues in the distal limb in these approaches results in a&#xD;
      disorganized scar mass in which normal dynamic muscle relationships are destroyed. The&#xD;
      uncoupling of native agonist/antagonist muscle pairings results in isometric contraction of&#xD;
      residual muscle groups upon volitional activation, producing incomplete, unbalanced neural&#xD;
      feedback to the brain that results in aberrant perception of residual limb position. Such&#xD;
      disturbed feedback not only results in impaired ambulatory function with prosthetics, but&#xD;
      also manifests as pathological sensory perception of the extremity in the form of phantom&#xD;
      limb and phantom pain symptomatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, providers and patients have tolerated the limitations of these approaches due to the&#xD;
      fairly simplistic goal of lower limb amputation: to provide a stable, padded surface for&#xD;
      prosthesis mounting. Historically, lower limb prostheses have afforded amputees the&#xD;
      opportunity to recover at least some measure of ambulatory function. Standard lower limb&#xD;
      prostheses currently afford the wearer the walk in a rudimentary fashion, as well as&#xD;
      occasionally run. However, such devices have generally not been able to recapitulate the&#xD;
      complex biomechanics of the human lower limb due to limited ranges of motion and lack of&#xD;
      feedback control. These limitations have resulted in substantially altered kinematics in&#xD;
      lower limb amputees that are associated with derangements in energy expenditure profiles that&#xD;
      worsen with laterality and ascending level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An age is dawning, however, in which the capabilities of modern prostheses are broadening&#xD;
      remarkably. Technological advances including increasingly miniaturized electronics, wireless&#xD;
      communications and ever-refined positional sensors have enabled prosthetic developers to&#xD;
      create next-generation bionic limbs with markedly enhanced degrees of freedom over prior&#xD;
      models. Such prostheses have been demonstrated to markedly improve the energy expenditure of&#xD;
      amputees who utilize them appropriately. Even more advanced prostheses are currently under&#xD;
      development that incorporate the ability to provide active intrinsic limb control to&#xD;
      facilitate complex motor actions such as dancing and balancing on one leg. In addition,&#xD;
      prototype prosthetics are currently being developed that have the potential to offer sensory&#xD;
      feedback - both tactile and positional - in a manner never before witnessed. Such&#xD;
      prosthetics, while not yet available commercially, are presently being utilized in&#xD;
      experimental settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these technological advancements in the sphere of prosthesis development have not&#xD;
      been matched with surgical advancements with regards to management of the residual limb.&#xD;
      Classic techniques to lower limb amputation do not provide innervated interfaces that can&#xD;
      serve as relays for complex prosthesis control; without such biological actuators in the&#xD;
      residual limb to provide conduits for information exchange, next generation prostheses are of&#xD;
      little use. Stated another way, next generation prosthetics currently incorporate drivers and&#xD;
      sensors capable of providing far more enhanced functionality than ever before witnessed, but&#xD;
      standard approaches to limb amputation do not provide a way of effectively linking these&#xD;
      prosthetics to their intended beneficiaries. An evolution in the manner in which lower limb&#xD;
      amputations are performed is now required - one that will provide a biological interface that&#xD;
      will allow lower limb amputees to take advantage of the enhanced capabilities offered by the&#xD;
      remarkable prostheses currently under development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous Pre-Clinical or Clinical Studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognition of the increased need for effective neural interfaces for prosthetic limbs has&#xD;
      been evidenced by an expanding number of efforts in this sphere over the past decade. Initial&#xD;
      efforts to provide high resolution control of distal prostheses were focused primarily on&#xD;
      direct and indirect brain interfaces, either through placement of electroencephalographic&#xD;
      scalp sensors or implantable parenchymal electrodes, respectively. However, such endeavors&#xD;
      have been plagued by poor resolution, inconsistencies in signal acquisition and progressive&#xD;
      foreign body reactions leading to impulse degradation over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the limitations of brain interfaces have become more evident, focus has shifted to direct&#xD;
      peripheral nerve interfaces including interposed sieves and cuffs designed to transduce&#xD;
      electrical signals directly from individual nerve fascicles to distal prostheses. Such&#xD;
      monitors have, however, shown little clinical promise due to progressive nerve compression&#xD;
      secondary to scarring, as well as significant neurological crosstalk and interference in&#xD;
      biological models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, the most promising efforts regarding peripheral nerve interface development are now&#xD;
      within the realm of biological systems. The two leading models in this sphere are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Targeted Muscle Reinnervation (TMR): TMR is a technique whereby a series of nerve&#xD;
           transfers is utilized to reinnervate specific target muscles to create additional&#xD;
           prosthetic control sites after proximal limb amputation. These nerve transfers offer&#xD;
           intuitive control of distal prostheses because the reinnervated muscles are controlled&#xD;
           by the same nerves that once innervated the amputated limb. Signals created by the&#xD;
           residual nerves are amplified by the recipient muscles, which are captured by surface&#xD;
           electrodes and transduced to the distal prosthesis. TMR procedures have been performed&#xD;
           on more than 40 patients to date. Limitations of this technique, however, include the&#xD;
           finite number of available electromyographic signal sites due to anatomic constraints&#xD;
           and issues with long-term signal fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interfaces (RPNI): RPNI offers an alternative version of&#xD;
           an innervated biological interface. An RPNI is a surgical construct that consists of a&#xD;
           non-vascularized segment of muscle that is coapted to a distal motor or sensory nerve&#xD;
           ending. Unlike TMR, the RPNI muscle is not recruited from an otherwise normally&#xD;
           innervated proximal muscle; instead, it is constructed as a free graft from&#xD;
           orthotopically sourced donor tissue. The muscle segment is gradually reinnervated by the&#xD;
           redirected nerve ending, which then promotes volitional activation of the muscle segment&#xD;
           when triggered by the central nervous system. As in TMR, intuitive control occurs&#xD;
           because the reinnervated muscles are controlled by the same nerves that once innervated&#xD;
           the amputated limb. Unlike TMR, however, there are no limitations on anatomic sites and&#xD;
           there does not appear to be problems with long-term signal fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While both TMR and RPNIs have demonstrated promise in offering improved functionality to&#xD;
      patients who have already undergone amputation, neither technique has been incorporated into&#xD;
      a fundamental redesign of the way in which amputations are performed in the first place; in&#xD;
      all cases of clinical implementation of TMR or RPNIs reported to date in the literature,&#xD;
      these techniques have been employed to further optimize the functionality of patients who&#xD;
      have already experienced limb loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale and Potential Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical protocol proposes an iteration of the RPNI model, with the intent of&#xD;
      incorporating these surgical constructs into the design of lower limb amputations at the time&#xD;
      of limb sacrifice. Given the success of this technique to date, the investigators believe&#xD;
      that incorporation of innervated muscle segments into residual limb design has the potential&#xD;
      to provide lower limb amputees with a biological interface for unprecedented prosthetic motor&#xD;
      control that is not only high resolution but also highly intuitive and capable of restoring&#xD;
      limb proprioception. In addition, it is anticipated that allowing amputees to have greater&#xD;
      control of advanced prostheses may offer the potential to normalize gait kinematics, thereby&#xD;
      correcting alterations in energy expenditure that have been previously reported. Such&#xD;
      measures hold the promise of optimizing the functional and overall health of lower limb&#xD;
      amputees, thereby reducing the morbidity currently associated with the amputee status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this research protocol is that we will be able to redesign the manner in&#xD;
      which lower limb amputations are performed so as to include biological actuators that will&#xD;
      enable the successful employment of next generation lower extremity prostheses. The specific&#xD;
      aims of the project are as follows:&#xD;

        2. To measure the degree of volitional motor activation and excursion achievable in the&#xD;
           residual limb constructs, and to determine the optimal configuration and design of such&#xD;
           constructs&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To describe the extent of proprioceptive and other sensory feedback achievable through&#xD;
           the employment of these modified surgical techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To validate the functional and somatosensory superiority of the proposed amputation&#xD;
           technique over standard approaches to BKA and AKA&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To develop a modified acute postoperative rehabilitation strategy suited to this new&#xD;
           surgical approach&#xD;
