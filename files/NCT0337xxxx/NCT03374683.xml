  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children's risky play is associated with a variety of positive developmental, physical and&#xD;
      mental health outcomes, including greater physical activity, self-confidence and risk&#xD;
      management skills. Children's opportunities for risky play have eroded over time, limited by&#xD;
      parents' fears and beliefs about risk, particularly among mothers. We have developed a&#xD;
      digital and in-person workshop version of a tool to reframe parents' perceptions of risk. We&#xD;
      examined whether the tool increased mothers' tolerance for risky play and influenced&#xD;
      parenting behaviour change, in the short and long term, and whether these changes were&#xD;
      greater than those in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted a single-blind (researchers and outcome assessors) randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      and recruited a total of 410 mothers of children aged 6-12 years. The risk reframing (RR)&#xD;
      digital tool is designed for a one-time visit and includes three chapters of self-reflection&#xD;
      and experiential learning tasks. The RR in-person tool is a 45-90 minute facilitated workshop&#xD;
      in which participants were guided through discussions of the same tasks contained within the&#xD;
      digital tool. The control condition consisted of reading the Position Statement on Active&#xD;
      Outdoor Play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome was increased tolerance of risk in play, as measured by the Tolerance of Risk&#xD;
      in Play Scale. Secondary outcome was self-reported attainment of a behaviour change goal that&#xD;
      participants had set for themselves. We tested the hypothesis that there would be differences&#xD;
      between the experimental and control groups with respect to tolerance of risk in play and&#xD;
      goal attainment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study used 3-group parallel randomized controlled trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were recruited through advertising on social media, distributing notices through&#xD;
      our networks, snowball sampling, and posting notices in community centres. The aim was to&#xD;
      obtain complete data on 375 participants. Interested participants completed a questionnaire&#xD;
      in REDCap electronic data capture tool hosted at British Columbia Children's Hospital&#xD;
      Research Institute to answer eligibility questions and provide informed consent. Enrolled&#xD;
      participants received a link to the baseline questionnaire package to be completed in REDcap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants were deemed eligible for the study, they were allocated to one of the three&#xD;
      conditions: 1) Control group; 2) RR digital tool; and 3) RR in-person workshop. Participants&#xD;
      in Condition 1 were provided with a link to the Position Statement on Active Outdoor Play,&#xD;
      which included information on research and recommendations for action. Participants in&#xD;
      Condition 2 were provided with a link to the RR digital tool to complete at their leisure.&#xD;
      Participants in Condition 3, were scheduled to attend the RR in-person workshop. The&#xD;
      randomization schedule was generated beforehand in sealedenvelop.com using blocks of size 3,&#xD;
      6, and 9. The list was then transferred to REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Honoraria were paid at each time point as compensation for participation. Participants&#xD;
      attending in-person RR workshops were provided with an additional honorarium to compensate&#xD;
      them for any expenses incurred in attending, such as travel or childcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants had an equal likelihood of assignment to each condition (33%). The nature of the&#xD;
      intervention did not permit participant blinding but they were informed of their allocated&#xD;
      treatment after completing the baseline questionnaires. The in-person workshop facilitator&#xD;
      could not be blinded to allocation as the other two arms did not have a facilitator.&#xD;
      Likewise, research staff who coordinated in-person workshop schedules could not be blinded to&#xD;
      the allocation of the in-person workshop. However, allocations were concealed to the&#xD;
      researchers at participant assignment and data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants completed a questionnaire package at three time points: Baseline, 1-week&#xD;
      post-intervention, and 3-months post-intervention. Survey data were collected and managed&#xD;
      using REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypotheses were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mothers completing the RR digital tool will have a significantly greater increase of&#xD;
           tolerance for risk in play than mothers in the control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mothers completing the RR in-person workshop will have a significantly greater increase&#xD;
           of tolerance for risk in play than mothers in the control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A greater proportion of mothers completing the RR digital tool will attain their&#xD;
           behaviour change goal, than mothers in the control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A greater proportion of mothers completing the RR in-person workshop will attain their&#xD;
           behaviour change goal than mothers in the control condition.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Tolerance of Risk in Play Scale (TRiPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week-post-intervention, 3-month-post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure was increase in the total score on the Tolerance for Risk in Play Scale (TRiPS), a 31-item measure examining adults' tolerance of risk during children's play. This analysis was conducted using mirt package in R software (Chalmers, 2012). Rasch analysis of the baseline data resulted in dropping one item (&quot;Do you allow this child to play-fight, testing who is strongest?&quot;) due to local dependence. Theta standardized scores from the Rasch analysis of the final 30-item TRiPS total scale ranged from -3.372 to 1.975, with a mean of 0.000 (SD 0.974). A higher standardized score indicates higher tolerance of risky outdoor play.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported Behaviour Change</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week-post-intervention, 3-month-post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome measure was self-reported behavior change, measured by participants' self-reported progress on attaining the goal they set for themselves within the risk reframing intervention. At each follow-up, participants were reminded of their goal (by asking &quot;at the beginning of the study, you set a goal for yourself regarding something you wanted to change to give your child more opportunities for risky play. Have you made progress toward this goal?&quot;) and asked &quot;Did you accomplish your goal?&quot; with &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; response options. For the purpose of our analyses the category of &quot;Yes&quot; is an indication of behaviour change while the category of &quot;No&quot; is an indication of no behaviour change.</description>

The Position Statement includes recommendations for parents, educators, health professionals, administrators and various level of governments to address the barriers to children's outdoor play. It addresses common misconceptions and encourages that danger be differentiated from risk and outdoor play and fun be valued as much as safety (ParticipACTION Canada, 2015; Tremblay et al., 2015).</description>

          <title>Risk Reframing (RR) Digital Tool</title>
          <description>RR Digital Tool: Participants proceed through three chapters in the tool: https://outsideplay.ca. Chapter 1: most important attributes they want for their child; their child's favourite play activities; their own childhood play activities; how their child's and their own play activities compare.&#xD;
Chapter 2: imagining themselves in three video segments where they must decide whether they allow their child to climb a tree, walk home from school, and use box cutters to build a fort. They reflect on their barriers and things that helped them let go.&#xD;
Chapter 3: revisiting the most important attributes they want for their child and whether there is anything they want to change, setting a realistic goal, outlining steps for attaining that goal, and setting start date.</description>

          <title>RR In-Person Workshop</title>
          <description>RR In-Person Workshop: Participants engage in a facilitator guided discussion of the same tasks as the RR digital tool. Participants are taken through each task using PowerPoint slides that include the videos from the digital tool. The facilitator guide contains detailed guidance on discussion for each component and length of time to be dedicated to each slide. Participants are provided with a paper booklet to complete that mimics the online tasks.</description>

          <title>Exposure to risky play information</title>
          <description>Participants were asked in the socio-demographic questionnaire, if they had been exposed to any information on risky play in the context of children's outdoor play. This was to understand if participants had been primed or tainted by any previous knowledge or training on children's outdoor risky play before participating in our study. The question reads, 'In the last month, have you seen any information on risky play?', which can be answered 'yes' or 'no'.</description>

          <description>Participants were asked in the socio-demographic questionnaire, if their child had any disability or long-term health problem that could limit her/his normal physical outdoor risky play. This was to understand if participants' risk tolerance in children's play were influenced by their child's disability or long-term health conditions. The question reads, 'Does your child suffer from a disability or long-term health problem that limits her/his normal activities?', which can be answered 'yes' or 'no'.</description>

        <title>Change in Tolerance of Risk in Play Scale (TRiPS)</title>
        <description>The primary outcome measure was increase in the total score on the Tolerance for Risk in Play Scale (TRiPS), a 31-item measure examining adults' tolerance of risk during children's play. This analysis was conducted using mirt package in R software (Chalmers, 2012). Rasch analysis of the baseline data resulted in dropping one item (&quot;Do you allow this child to play-fight, testing who is strongest?&quot;) due to local dependence. Theta standardized scores from the Rasch analysis of the final 30-item TRiPS total scale ranged from -3.372 to 1.975, with a mean of 0.000 (SD 0.974). A higher standardized score indicates higher tolerance of risky outdoor play.</description>

The Position Statement includes recommendations for parents, educators, health professionals, administrators and various level of governments to address the barriers to children's outdoor play. It addresses common misconceptions and encourages that danger be differentiated from risk and outdoor play and fun be valued as much as safety (ParticipACTION, 2015; Tremblay et al., 2015).</description>

          <title>Risk Reframing (RR) Digital Tool</title>
          <description>RR Digital Tool: Participants proceed through three chapters in the tool: https://outsideplay.ca. Chapter 1: most important attributes they want for their child; their child's favourite play activities; their own childhood play activities; how their child's and their own play activities compare.&#xD;
Chapter 2: imagining themselves in three video segments where they must decide whether they allow their child to climb a tree, walk home from school, and use box cutters to build a fort. They reflect on their barriers and things that helped them let go.&#xD;
Chapter 3: revisiting the most important attributes they want for their child and whether there is anything they want to change, setting a realistic goal, outlining steps for attaining that goal, and setting start date.</description>

Participants are taken through each task using PowerPoint slides that include the videos from the digital tool. The facilitator guide contains detailed guidance on discussion for each component and length of time to be dedicated to each slide. Participants are provided with a paper booklet to complete that mimics the online tasks.</description>

          <title>Position Statement on Active Outdoor Play</title>
          <description>Position Statement Active Outdoor Play: The position statement summarizes the issues and research regarding children's access to outdoor play and provides recommendations for various stakeholders. It states that &quot;access to active play in nature and outdoors - with its risks - is essential for healthy child development&quot; and recommends increasing children's opportunities for self-directed play in all settings. The Position Statement includes recommendations for parents, educators, health professionals, administrators and various level of governments to address the barriers to children's outdoor play. It addresses common misconceptions and encourages that danger be differentiated from risk and outdoor play and fun be valued as much as safety (ParticipACTION, 2015; Tremblay et al., 2015).</description>
