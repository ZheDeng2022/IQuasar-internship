  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in women with advanced (stage IIIa-IV) ovarian cancer of the&#xD;
      histologic subtype high grade serous carcinoma (HGSOC) who are going through a diagnostic&#xD;
      laparoscopy. They will recieve treatment with a study agent for 10-14 days before surgery.&#xD;
      They will be allocated to different study groups according to the diagnostic evaluation&#xD;
      performed as standard of care at the department. The study is randomized and unblinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary investigational agents are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Metformin tablets, 850 mg x 2 orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acetylsalicylic acid tablets, 160 mg x1 orally&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Olaparib capsules, 300 mg x 2 orally&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Letrozol tablets, 2.5 mg x 1 orally&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The women who agree to participate in the study prior to the laparoscopic evaluation, will be&#xD;
      allocated to different study groups according to the diagnostic evaluation performed as&#xD;
      standard of care at the department. During inclusion in the first study cohort, the olaparib&#xD;
      cohort (n=32), an additional 16 women are randomized as controls and will not receive neither&#xD;
      any study drug nor placebo. The study is unblinded. There will not be randomized controls&#xD;
      into the other study cohorts, as the control group collected will be utilized as controls for&#xD;
      all study agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women in Arm I will be included in the WOO trial, and will be treated with the study&#xD;
      agent for 10-14 days prior to tumor reductive surgery, starting the day of laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery (+1 day). The treatment will be discontinued at the time of tumor reductive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently fourmore agents are evaluated as of particular interest, as well as feasible to&#xD;
      introduce, in the WOO study set up: metformin, acetylsalicylic acid, olaparib, and letrozol.&#xD;
      The first agent listed in the protocol, metformin, will be given to 32 consequtive women, and&#xD;
      drug related analyses will thereafter be performed. The next 32 women included in the study&#xD;
      will receive the next agent on the list, acetylsalicylic acid, while analyses for the&#xD;
      metformin group is ongoing, and after the acetylsalicylic acid study group has been included&#xD;
      the next agent on the list is introduced. Should any of the included women be non-eligable to&#xD;
      receive one study drug, they will either receive the next agent on the list of the four study&#xD;
      drugs, if eligable, or be included as control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women in Arm II who agree to participate in the study will not receive the study&#xD;
      medication, but standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy until having decreased tumor load&#xD;
      radiologically estimated and scheduled for optimal debulking procedure according to standard&#xD;
      treatment of this group of patients. Samples from these women will be used as control in the&#xD;
      translational part of the where we aim to identify potential molecular pathway(s) and cell&#xD;
      type(s) that may be responsible for suboptimal debulking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the cancer-directed surgical procedure in participants in both Arms additional tissue&#xD;
      samples from matching sites, preferably from tissues removed as part of the operation, as&#xD;
      well as blood and urine samples, are obtained for comparative analysis. By use of the&#xD;
      collected samples we can evaluate the clinical and molecular impact of the study agents among&#xD;
      those triaged to primary cytoreductive surgery. Promising therapeutic targets identified&#xD;
      might later be explored separately in one of the consequtive treatment study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the debulking surgery all women will follow the recommended standard of care, including&#xD;
      chemotherapy and consolidating bevacisumab where indicated.&#xD;
