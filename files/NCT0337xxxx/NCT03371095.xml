  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic vasculitis of arterial and venous vessels of any size,&#xD;
      involving young patients (from 15 to 45 years). BD significantly increases morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Therapeutic management of BD depends on the clinical presentation and organ&#xD;
      involved. Although colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and topical treatments&#xD;
      are often sufficient for mucocutaneous and joint involvement, more aggressive approach with&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agents is warranted for severe manifestations. Early recognition and&#xD;
      vigorous use of immunosuppressives with high dose steroids have changed the prognosis of&#xD;
      patients with severe BD. BD is a severe systemic vasculitis leading to blindness in up to 20%&#xD;
      at 4 years and a 5-year mortality rate of 15% in patients with major vessel or neurological&#xD;
      involvement. Cyclophosphamide has been used for life-threatening BD for 40 years. However,&#xD;
      the outcome of severe complications of BD is poor. The European League Against Rheumatism&#xD;
      (EULAR) recommendation for the management of BD advocated cyclophosphamide plus&#xD;
      glucocorticoids for life-threatening manifestations (i.e neurological and/or major vessel&#xD;
      involvement). TNFa antagonists have been used with success in severe and/or resistant cases.&#xD;
      In addition, the incidence of blindness in BD has been dramatically reduced in the recent&#xD;
      years with the use of anti-TNF. However, there is no firm evidence or randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials directly addressing the best induction immunosuppressive therapy in severe BD&#xD;
      manifestations. The investigators therefore aimed to assess the best induction therapy in&#xD;
      severe and difficult to treat BD patients. The investigators hypothesize that up to 70% of&#xD;
      the patients with life-threatening manifestations of BD receiving these compounds [anti-TNFa&#xD;
      or cyclophosphamide] will achieve a complete remission of BD at 6 months and with less than&#xD;
      0.1 mg/kg/day of prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ITAC, is the first randomized prospective, head to head study, comparing infliximab, to&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide in severe manifestations of BD. There is no firm evidence or randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials directly addressing the best induction immunosuppressive therapy in severe&#xD;
      BD. Cyclophosphamide failed to demonstrate sustainable remission over 70 % of life&#xD;
      threatening BD cases. There is little published information on use of immunosuppressants&#xD;
      other than cyclophosphamide for severe BD. TNFa antagonists have been used with success in&#xD;
      severe and/or resistant cases. TNFa expression correlates with BD activity and other&#xD;
      immunological data provide a strong rationale for targeting BD with biologics. Despite a&#xD;
      strong rationale, these compounds are not yet approved in BD, which guarantees the innovative&#xD;
      nature of this study that aims selecting or dropping any arm when evidence of efficacy&#xD;
      already exists.&#xD;

                  objective neurological symptoms that were associated with neuroimaging (CNS&#xD;
                  and/or medullar MRI) findings suggestive of BD-related CNS involvement.&#xD;
                  Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings showing aseptic inflammation may be&#xD;
                  associated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chest X-ray results (postero-anterior and lateral) within 12 weeks prior to inclusion&#xD;

             hormonal methods used for two or more cycles prior to Inclusion (e.g., oral&#xD;
             contraceptive pills, contraceptive patch, or contraceptive vaginal ring), barrier&#xD;
             methods (e.g., contraceptive sponge, diaphragm used in conjunction with contraceptive&#xD;
             foam or jelly, or condom used in conjunction with contraceptive foam or jelly),&#xD;
             intrauterine methods (IUD), sterilization (e.g., tubal ligation or a monogamous&#xD;
             relationship with a vasectomized partner), and abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A potential subject with a positive interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) (e.g.,&#xD;
             QuantiFERON®-TB Gold or T-spot TB® Test) or a positive tuberculin skin test (≤6&#xD;
             months) is eligible if her/his chest X-ray does not show evidence suggestive of active&#xD;
             tuberculosis (TB) disease and there are no clinical signs and symptoms of pulmonary&#xD;
