  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well olaparib works in treating patients with urothelial&#xD;
      cancer with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-repair defects that has spread to other places in the&#xD;
      body (advanced or metastatic) and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. PARPs&#xD;
      are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP&#xD;
      from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of olaparib in two cohorts of patients with metastatic/advanced&#xD;
      urothelial carcinoma (UC) pre-selected by DNA-repair defects as measured by overall response&#xD;
      rate (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the effect of therapy on progression free survival (PFS). II. To describe the&#xD;
      effect of therapy on overall survival (OS). III. To describe the safety/tolerability and&#xD;
      drug-related toxicities of olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To follow patients without the pre-selected DNA-repair defects for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the proportion of patients with DNA-repair pathway-mutated genes in&#xD;
      metastatic UC (patient cohort referred for screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate levels of baseline circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with survival in untreated&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore tumor-mutational profiles in metastatic tumor biopsies, saliva &quot;normal&quot; DNA,&#xD;
      changes in tumor or peripheral immune characteristics, or tumor associated somatic mutation&#xD;
      load in blood DNA in response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore changes in plasma cytokines and correlate with clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To correlate levels of circulating endothelial cells with clinical outcome. VI. To&#xD;
      correlate levels of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To correlate peripheral immune and DNA damage response transcriptional signatures with&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To determine the effectiveness of using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify&#xD;
      DNA-repair pathway gene defects in tumor samples and circulating DNA and identify patients&#xD;
      with UC suitable for PARP inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To determine the expression of Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) in tumor versus (vs.) stroma cells,&#xD;
      and the potential tumor heterogeneity based on SLFN11 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients that have cancer-associated DNA-repair gene mutations receive olaparib&#xD;
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients that do not have cancer-associated DNA-repair gene mutations undergo&#xD;
      blood sample collection at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, every 2 months for&#xD;
      1 year, then every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;

             antibodies is required)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;= 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on&#xD;
             the use of olaparib in patients &lt; 18 years of age, children are excluded from this&#xD;
             study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to tolerate oral medications and not have gastrointestinal&#xD;
             illnesses that would preclude absorption of olaparib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-clinical data indicate that olaparib adversely affects embryofetal survival and&#xD;
             development. Therefore, women of child-bearing potential and their partners should&#xD;

             participation and for at least one (1) month after the last dose of olaparib. Male&#xD;
             study participants should avoid fathering a child or donating sperm during the study&#xD;
             and for three (3) months after the last dose of olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
                  abortifacient effects. Because there is a potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
                  nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with olaparib, breastfeeding&#xD;
                  should be discontinued if the mother is treated with olaparib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Amenorrheic for 1 year or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatments&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior treatment with olaparib or any other PARP inhibitor&#xD;
             (PARPi)&#xD;

             2) with the exception of alopecia, caused by previous cancer therapy&#xD;

             clinical trials or treatment during screening to determine eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
             A scan to confirm the absence of brain metastases is not required. Patients with&#xD;
             spinal cord compression unless considered to have received definitive treatment for&#xD;
             this and evidence of clinically stable disease for 28 days&#xD;

             CYP3A are ineligible. A washout period prior to starting olaparib for patients on&#xD;
             CYP3A inhibitors is 2 weeks; and the required washout period for CYP3A inducers is 5&#xD;
             weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital and 3 weeks for other agents&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to&#xD;
                  regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference texts such as the&#xD;
                  Physicians' Desk Reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent&#xD;
                  procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other&#xD;
                  agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient&#xD;
                  is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because olaparib is a PARP inhibitor agent&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects&#xD;
&#xD;

               -  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
                  requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study&#xD;
             drug administration or that may interfere with the interpretation of study results&#xD;
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;

             lymphomas (without bone marrow involvement) curatively treated with no evidence of&#xD;
             disease for &gt;= 5 years. Patients with a history of localized triple negative breast&#xD;
             cancer or localized resected prostate cancer may be eligible, provided they completed&#xD;
             their adjuvant chemotherapy more than three years prior to registration, and that the&#xD;
             patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease&#xD;
