  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective cohort study of patients receiving standard-care radiotherapy is paramount to a&#xD;
      better understanding of radiation effects and longterm outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of establishing infrastructure to&#xD;
      systematically collect clinical data, patient-reported outcomes, and imaging data from daily&#xD;
      radiotherapy practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to provide a control cohort for comparative effectiveness research&#xD;
      of investigational interventions through a cmRCT design; compare imaging features with&#xD;
      clinical outcomes; understand dose-effect relationships; quantify imaging quality metrics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of an effort to develop infrastructure that will support systematic&#xD;
      collection of data from daily radiotherapy practice. At the core, PERA is a large&#xD;
      observational cohort study, serving as a multiple cohort randomized trial and image banking&#xD;
      facility. It includes consent for the collection of imaging data, patient-reported outcomes,&#xD;
      and broad randomization for studies according to the innovative cohort multiple randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial design (cmRCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basis of this design is a prospective cohort of participants receiving care as usual, who&#xD;
      give informed consent for cohort participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can furthermore be asked for informed consent to be randomized in future RCTs&#xD;
      conducted within the cohort. Participants are informed that they will be offered an&#xD;
      experimental intervention if they are randomly selected. They are also informed that they&#xD;
      otherwise might serve as controls without being notified and that their data can be used in a&#xD;
      trial context. For each participant in the cohort, PROs are captured at baseline and at&#xD;
      regular intervals during follow-up. Within this cohort, multiple RCTs can be conducted. The&#xD;
      design is especially attractive for clinical research areas with rapid evolution of&#xD;
      technology, and for highly desired or expensive interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage, at entry into the cohort, all potential participants are asked for their&#xD;
      informed consent to participate in a cohort study and broad consent to be either randomly&#xD;
      selected to be approached for experimental interventions or to serve as control without&#xD;
      further notice during participation in the cohort. In a second stage, at the initiation of an&#xD;
      RCT within the cohort, informed consent to receive the intervention is then only sought in&#xD;
      those randomly selected for the intervention arm. At the third stage, after completion of&#xD;
      each RCT, all cohort participants receive aggregate disclosure of trial results.&#xD;
