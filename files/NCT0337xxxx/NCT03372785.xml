  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      (PCI) on cardiac function in multi-vessel disease patients with concurrent chronic total&#xD;
      occlusion (CTO) lesion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recruited CTO patients will be devided into two groups: those undergoing PCI of only the&#xD;
      non-CTO artery (non-CTO PCI group), and those undergoing PCI of the non-CTO artery&#xD;
      concurrently with the CTO artery (CTO-PCI group). The primary outcome assessed will be the&#xD;
      change in cardiac function evaluated via CMR at a 12-month of follow-up appointment, which&#xD;
      will be compared to a baseline measurement. Secondary outcomes include occurrence of major&#xD;
      cardiac events, CMR-assessed myocardial viability in the CTO-supplied territory, and quality&#xD;
      of life assessed by Seattle angina questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire 9 and&#xD;
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 after 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
