  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, open-label dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting side effects of ibrutinib (560 or 840 or 420 mg daily&#xD;
      oral dose), given in combination with trastuzumab administered through the vein, in patients&#xD;
      with HER2-amplified Metastatic Breast Cancer that has gotten worse after prior therapy with&#xD;
      ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is approved by the FDA for patients with HER2-positive&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer (MBC) previously treated with a taxane and trastuzumab, and is&#xD;
      currently listed as the preferred second-line therapy in the NCCN guidelines (NCCN 2014).&#xD;
      While the benefit of continued HER2 inhibition has been conclusively established for disease&#xD;
      that has progressed on a trastuzumab-containing regimen, there are currently no data&#xD;
      regarding the efficacy of HER2- targeted therapies following progression on T-DM1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the population of T-DM1-treated patients steadily growing, clinical trials are needed to&#xD;
      investigate novel therapies in this setting,to meet the medical need for effective,&#xD;
      evidence-based therapies for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oral small-molecule Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib has also&#xD;
      demonstrated the ability to inhibit erythroblastosis virus oncogene B (ErbB)/HER receptor&#xD;
      family kinases in preclinical studies at clinically relevant concentrations, with an&#xD;
      equivalent or greater potency than other HER2-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with&#xD;
      demonstrated activity in HER2-positive MBC, including lapatinib, neratinib, and afatinib. Of&#xD;
      note, in preclinical HER2-positive cell model systems the growth inhibitory ability of&#xD;
      ibrutinib was substantially greater in HER2-amplified breast cancer cells versus those that&#xD;
      simply overexpressed the HER2 protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ibrutinib is currently approved for use in patients with Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)&#xD;
      or Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and has an established safety record from clinical trials in&#xD;
      these patient populations. Thus there is a reasonable rationale to investigate ibrutinib in&#xD;
      patients with HER2- amplified MBC, in the setting of T-DM1-pretreated disease. Previous&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that combined targeting of HER2 with multiple HER2-directed agents&#xD;
      is more effective that single agent therapy and therefore this study will explore the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of ibrutinib in combination with trastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I/II, open-label, unblinded, nonrandomized, standard 3+3 dose-escalation&#xD;
      study designed to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities&#xD;
      (DLT) of ibrutinib (560 or 840 or 420 mg QD) given orally in combination with trastuzumab (8&#xD;
      mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg q3w) administered intravenously (IV) in patients with&#xD;
      HER2-amplified MBC that has progressed on prior therapy with ado-trastuzumab emtansine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the recommended phase II dose of ibrutinib plus trastuzumab has been determined (no more&#xD;
      than 1 of 6 patients with dose-limiting toxicity) in the required 6 to 18 patients over the 3&#xD;
      possible dose levels, additional patients will be enrolled on the phase II part of the study&#xD;
      at the recommended phase II dose of ibrutinib plus trastuzumab, for a maximum of 51 patients&#xD;
      total.&#xD;
