  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of GD2-CART01, a CAR T cell&#xD;
      treatment targeting GD2 in paediatric or young adult patients with High Risk and/or&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory Neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small exploratory cohort of patients with GD2-positive tumors other than Neuroblastoma has&#xD;
      also been included.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 phases, a Phase I or dose escalation phase and a Phase II or&#xD;
      expansion phase. Paediatric or young adult patients with relapsed High Risk and/or&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory Neuroblastoma will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the phase I portion of the study, a small cohort of patients with&#xD;
      GD2-positive tumors other than Neuroblastoma has also been included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis in order to harvest T cells, which will be&#xD;
      manufactured to obtain the autologous CAR T product GD2-CART01, a GD2-targeting CAR T&#xD;
      product. Briefly, the patients will be treated with a lymphodepleting regimen containing&#xD;
      conventional chemotherapic agents and subsequently will receive a single infusion of&#xD;
      GD2-CART01. Moreover, the product contains a suicide gene safety switch (namely inducible&#xD;
      Caspase 9): in case of relevant toxicities, the patient will receive the dimerizing agent in&#xD;
      order to activate the apoptotic pathway in the infused T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After infusion of CAR T cells, the patients will enter a 5-year active follow-up period.&#xD;
