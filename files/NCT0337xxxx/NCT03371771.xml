  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In response to large numbers of senior center clients who suffer untreated depression and the&#xD;
      dearth of geriatric mental health providers, the investigators have simplified a Behavioral&#xD;
      Activation intervention to match the skill set of age-matched lay volunteers available to&#xD;
      senior centers (Volunteer BA). This R34 proposes developmental work on delivering Volunteer&#xD;
      BA in senior centers, so as to arrive to a sustainable intervention with standardized&#xD;
      procedures. The investigators follow with a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing&#xD;
      the comparative impact of Volunteer BA versus MSW-provided BA on increased client activity&#xD;
      and reduced depressive symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Senior centers provide social, health, nutritional, and recreational services to older&#xD;
      adults. Ten percent of older adults in these settings experience clinically significant&#xD;
      depression. Although many aging services now screen for depressive symptoms, an IOM report&#xD;
      indicates that the number of geriatric mental health providers nationally is insufficient.&#xD;
      Further complicating treatment delivery is the reluctance of depressed elders to accept a&#xD;
      mental health referral or pursue treatment. It has been proposed that lay workers may be able&#xD;
      to offer psychosocial interventions for geriatric mental health disorders. Lay&#xD;
      volunteer-delivered interventions may improve depression outcomes, may do so by engaging the&#xD;
      same target variables as professionally-delivered interventions, and may be both more cost&#xD;
      effective and acceptable to seniors. Limitations include uncertainties about training and&#xD;
      supervision needs, reliable methods to assure intervention fidelity and patient safety, and&#xD;
      comparability of outcomes to those attained by professionally- delivered interventions.&#xD;
      Building on senior centers' volunteer programs, this proposal utilizes senior volunteers to&#xD;
      meet the mental health needs of depressed urban clients. To this end, the investigators&#xD;
      simplified Behavioral Activation (BA) to match the skill set of lay senior volunteers&#xD;
      (Volunteer BA). The investigators chose BA because it is an effective treatment for late-life&#xD;
      depression, can be administered by paraprofessionals, and its primary mechanism (target) of&#xD;
      action has been validated by efficacy studies. Based on preliminary data, the investigators&#xD;
      aim to test the feasibility and acceptability of Volunteer BA for an underserved and&#xD;
      difficult to engage population. The investigators propose further developmental work on the&#xD;
      delivery of Volunteer BA in senior centers, so as to arrive at a sustainable intervention&#xD;
      with standardized procedures. The investigators propose a small RCT testing the impact of&#xD;
      Volunteer BA versus MSW-delivered standard BA on increased client activity (the target) and&#xD;
      reduced depressive symptoms (clinical outcome). The Volunteer BA delivery model: 1. Makes use&#xD;
      of existing volunteer resources; 2. has potential for being an acceptable and sustainable&#xD;
      intervention; and 3. is expected to engage BA targets. However, its capacity to yield&#xD;
      comparable outcomes to MSW-delivered BA is yet to be determined.&#xD;
