  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to evaluate if internet- delivered cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), based on&#xD;
      exposure principles and behavioral activation, improves QoL and symptom burden in patients&#xD;
      with symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) compared to treatment as usual. The study will&#xD;
      include 120 patients with symptomatic AF despite optimal medical treatment in accordance with&#xD;
      current guidelines.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)&#xD;
      affecting 3% of the population. AF is associated with poor quality of life (QoL) and large&#xD;
      costs for society. In a considerable proportion of patients, AF symptoms (e.g., palpitations,&#xD;
      fatigue, and chest pain) are not alleviated by current medical or interventional treatments.&#xD;
      Psychological factors can worsen AF symptoms, and anxiety and depression are common among AF&#xD;
      patients. Symptom preoccupation and avoidance of social and physical activities are likely to&#xD;
      play important roles in the development of anxiety, depression, disability and healthcare&#xD;
      utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to evaluate if CBT, based on behavioral activation and exposure principles,&#xD;
      improves wellbeing and QoL in symptomatic AF patients more than a wait list offered treatment&#xD;
      as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: A randomized controlled trial. Participants are randomized to internet-delivered CBT&#xD;
      for 10 weeks (N=60) or to treatment as usual (N=60). The internet-delivered CBT-program will&#xD;
      last for 10 weeks and include weekly therapist support, consisting of online messages and&#xD;
      telephone calls. Patients on the treatment as usual wait list will be provided standardized&#xD;
      written information about basic self-management in AF. The treatment as usual wait list will&#xD;
      be crossed over to treatment 3 months after the treatment group has completed treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The CBT treatment lasts for 10 weeks and includes the following: Education on the role of anxiety on cardiac function and the effects of symptom preoccupation and avoidance QoL and depression in AF, creating a vicious cycle; exposure to physical sensations that are similar to AF symptoms (e.g.,palpitations due to physical activity or stress) to reduce fear of these symptoms; exposure to situations or activities previously avoided and abolishment of behaviors that aim to control symptoms; and behavioral activation aiming to increase social and physical activity and reduce depressive symptoms. Therapist support is provided at least once weekly through the platform developed for the purpose. Therapists are trained CBT-psychologists.</description>
