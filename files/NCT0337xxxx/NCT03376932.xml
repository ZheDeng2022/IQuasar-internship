  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common, chronic respiratory disease affecting 1-18 percent of the population. It&#xD;
      is accepted that much of the uncontrolled asthma is due to poor adherence and asthma outcomes&#xD;
      in such cases may improve simply by increasing adherence to available treatments.&#xD;
      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has developed a sensor, which clips on to the ELLIPTA® dry powder&#xD;
      inhaler (DPI). This will inform subjects if/when they have taken their medication that is in&#xD;
      the ELLIPTA inhaler, as well as other information, including: asthma management strategies,&#xD;
      tracking of symptoms, asthma triggers, medication reminders and daily asthma forecasts. The&#xD;
      sensors, application (app), and provider portal that provide data are subsequently described&#xD;
      as the CIS. The combination of once-daily FF/UMEC/VI with the CIS will improve the disease&#xD;
      management and adherence. Thus, this study is designed to study the effectiveness and&#xD;
      adherence of single inhaler triple therapy (SITT) of FF/UMEC/VI with the CIS as compared to&#xD;
      multiple inhaler triple therapy (MITT) of the combination of FP/SAL plus TIO without CIS in&#xD;
      subjects with inadequately controlled asthma. The study randomization will be stratified by&#xD;
      pre-study inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) dosage strength (mid- or high-dose). Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either FF/UMEC/VI delivered via the ELLIPTA DPI with the&#xD;
      CIS or FP/SAL delivered via the DISKUS® DPI (with sensor only) plus TIO delivered via the&#xD;
      RESPIMAT inhaler (without sensor). The maximum study duration will be approximately 29 weeks,&#xD;
      which comprised of prescreen/ screening/ randomization period of up to 4 weeks, 24-week&#xD;
      treatment period and a 1-week follow-up period. Approximately 1006 subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized in the study. ELLIPTA and DISKUS are registered trademarks of GlaxoSmithKline&#xD;
      (GSK) group of companies.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of subjects who have an asthma control test (ACT) total score of &gt;=20</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ACT is a self-administered tool to identify subjects with poorly controlled asthma. It is a 5-item questionnaire measuring the frequency of shortness of breath, general asthma symptoms, use of rescue medications, the effect of asthma on daily functioning, and overall assessment of asthma control. The response options for all these questions consist of a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (all the time or not controlled at all for symptoms/activities) to 5 (not at all or completely controlled).</description>

    <measure>Annualized rate of moderate and/or severe asthma exacerbations</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Annualized rate of moderate/severe asthma exacerbations will be compared to evaluate the effectiveness of FF/UMEC/VI with CIS on improving asthma control compared with FP/SAL+TIO after 24 weeks of treatment. Moderate asthma exacerbation is defined as deterioration in asthma symptoms, deterioration in lung function, or increased rescue bronchodilator use lasting for at least 2 days or more. Severe asthma exacerbation is defined as the deterioration of asthma requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids, or an increase from a stable maintenance dose, for at least 3 days or an inpatient hospitalization or emergency department visit due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of subjects who have a decrease from Baseline of &gt;=4 in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ is designed to measure quality of life in subjects with diseases of airway obstruction, measuring symptoms, impact, and activity. It is a well-established instrument, comprising 50 questions to be self-completed by the subject. Higher scores indicate worse health status, and a change of 4 points is considered a clinically relevant change.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of ELLIPTA versus DISKUS doses taken as prescribed over the 24-week treatment period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of ELLIPTA and DISKUS doses taken will be collected using clip on sensors attached to the inhalers. The sensors will record the precise time and date when the mouthpiece cover of the inhalers has been opened and closed. Adherence is defined as the percentage of ELLIPTA and DISKUS doses taken as prescribed over the study treatment period as determined by the maintenance sensor records of date and time (within a 24-hour time period/window).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 on treatment is defined as the mean FEV1 value obtained prior to the last dose of investigational product.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects with serious adverse events (SAEs) including hospitalizations for asthma</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 29 weeks from screening</time_frame>
    <description>Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect or any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment will be categorized as an SAE. Number of subjects with incidences and type of SAEs including hospitalizations for asthma will be evaluated.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have their own Android or iPhone operating system (IOS) mobile device&#xD;
             (example given [e.g.] smart phone or tablet) and a data package suitable for the&#xD;
             installation and running of the app and sending and receiving data. Data used by the&#xD;
             CIS is approximately 1 megabyte (MB) per month as a maximum; this is less data than a&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing and able to download the app on their personal mobile device&#xD;
             and keep it turned on for the duration of the study. This will also require Bluetooth&#xD;
             to be turned on for duration of the study. Subjects will also have to turn on mobile&#xD;
             data for the app for the duration of study; unless travelling and when extra data&#xD;
             roaming costs could be incurred.&#xD;

             therapy (with a stable total daily dose of ICS of &gt;250 microgram per day [mcg/day] FP,&#xD;
             or equivalent) for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. Dosing regimen (once or twice&#xD;
             daily to equal the total daily dose) should be restricted to the current local product&#xD;
             labels/treatment guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with inadequately controlled asthma (ACT total score &lt;20) despite ICS/LABA&#xD;

             who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance during the treatment period and for at&#xD;
             least 5 days after the last dose of study treatment. The Investigator is responsible&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with active uncontrolled psychiatric disease, intellectual deficiency, poor&#xD;
             motivation or other conditions that will limit the validity of informed consent to&#xD;
