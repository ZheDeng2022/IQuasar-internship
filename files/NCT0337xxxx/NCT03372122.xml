  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of removal of spores and dirt from the&#xD;
      skin using a single cloth bath against a cloth bath with extra rinse step, to establish&#xD;
      whether the extra rinse stage will lead to the removal of a higher level of spores and dirt.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the ability of two test materials to&#xD;
      remove Clostridium difficile (ATCC #700057) spores with a tripartite soil load from subjects'&#xD;
      forearms. For this study, removal of Clostridium difficile and the associated organic soil&#xD;
      load will be used as an indicator of potential removal efficacy for difficult-to-remove&#xD;
      microorganisms and associated organic matter from human skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All test materials are currently marketed products&#xD;
