      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given together&#xD;
      with brentuximab vedotin in treating patients with T-cell lymphomas that have come back or do&#xD;
      not respond to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as brentuximab vedotin, may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving&#xD;
      brentuximab vedotin and lenalidomide may work better in treating patients with T-cell&#xD;
      lymphomas.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of brentuximab&#xD;
      vedotin in combination with lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/ refractory cutaneous&#xD;
      T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess safety and tolerability of brentuximab vedotin in combination with lenalidomide in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed/ refractory CTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate the rate of objective global response that lasts at least 4 months (ORR4) ,&#xD;
      complete response (CR) rate, progression-free survival (PFS) of brentuximab vedotin in&#xD;
      combination with lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/ refractory CTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate the rate and duration of clinically meaningful reduction in pruritus (CMRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Correlate response to baseline CD30 levels in tissue samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate the response endpoints incorporating Lugano response criteria for patients with&#xD;
      PET+ disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Explore temporal gene expression profile in skin/ blood samples that may predict response&#xD;
      to combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and&#xD;
      lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up&#xD;
      to 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then up to 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
