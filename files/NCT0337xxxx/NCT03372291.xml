  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the impact of a psychological intervention mobile&#xD;
      application (app) on the quality of life, mood, and symptoms of patients with acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a new diagnosis of AML often confront a sudden and life-threatening diagnosis,&#xD;
      requiring an immediate disruption of their life and an urgent 4-6 week hospitalization to&#xD;
      initiate intensive chemotherapy. During this hospitalization, they endure substantial&#xD;
      physical symptoms due to the side-effects of intensive chemotherapy, which negatively impacts&#xD;
      their quality of life (QOL). Patients with AML also experience significant psychological&#xD;
      distress as they struggle with the abrupt onset of illness, uncertainty regarding their&#xD;
      prognosis, physical and social isolation during their hospitalization, and complete loss of&#xD;
      independence. The study doctors want to know if the use of a mobile application (app) focused&#xD;
      on helping patients cope with the diagnosis and treatment can reduce the distressing symptoms&#xD;
      and improve the their quality of life and care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this research study is see if a mobile app is feasible to use for&#xD;
      patients with new diagnosis of AML and is acceptable to them. The study will also compare two&#xD;
      types of care - standard leukemia care and standard leukemia care with the mobile app to see&#xD;
      which is better for improving the experience of patients newly diagnosed with AML undergoing&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether using the mobile app that is&#xD;
      focused on educating patients about leukemia and how to cope with its treatment can improve&#xD;
      the physical and psychological symptoms that patients experience during hospitalization for&#xD;
      their leukemia care. Using this research, the study doctors hope to find out the best way to&#xD;
      help patients cope with their diagnosis and treatment for acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use questionnaires to measure patient's quality of life, physical symptoms,&#xD;
      mood, and the participant sense of control over their situation. Study questionnaires will be&#xD;
      completed in the hospital or clinic with assistance provided as needed. The participants will&#xD;
      also have the option of completing these questionnaires remotely through a secure web link or&#xD;
      through a mailed paper copy&#xD;

    <description>Psychological intervention consist of four components&#xD;
Supportive psychotherapy interventions to help patients deal with the initial shock of diagnosis, cope with the loss of independence and abrupt life disruptions, and provide validation and reassurance;&#xD;
Psychoeducation to manage expectations and enhance preparedness for extended hospitalization and mobilize social supports;&#xD;
Psychosocial skill-building to promote effective coping strategies and facilitate acceptance while living with uncertainty;&#xD;
Self-care to promote positive health behaviors and enhance patients' sense of control especially as they transition from the hospital to outpatient care.&#xD;
The psychological intervention will consist of five sessions (20-25 minutes each) that patients will start during their first week of admission for intensive chemotherapy and continue weekly for five weeks after diagnosis</description>
