    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot trial studies how well fractional carbon dioxide (CO2) laser therapy&#xD;
      works in minimizing genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) in gynecological cancer&#xD;
      survivors. Fractional CO2 laser therapy may reduce symptoms of GSM in survivors of&#xD;
      gynecologic cancers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To conduct a pilot trial to estimate the proportion of gynecologic cancer patients with&#xD;
      vaginal dryness or dyspareunia, who will have an improvement in their symptoms with vaginal&#xD;
      laser therapy compared to sham treatment based on the Vaginal Assessment Scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate toxicity associated with vaginal laser therapy in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine how many women with the defined patient eligibility will complete all&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the feasibility of the crossover design for potential use in a phase III&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine improvement in objective findings of vaginal atrophy with vaginal laser&#xD;
      therapy versus sham treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine improvement in sexual function as measured by Female Sexual Function Index&#xD;
      (FSFI), Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS), and scales for sexual satisfaction and&#xD;
      behavior with vaginal laser therapy versus sham treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine improvement in urinary symptoms of urogenital atrophy with vaginal laser&#xD;
      therapy versus sham treatment using the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To demonstrate satisfaction with vaginal fractional CO2 laser therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized in to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo fractional CO2 laser therapy at 3 time points 30 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo sham laser therapy at 3 time points 30 days apart. Patients may then&#xD;
      crossover to Arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 month.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by the Vaginal Assessment Scale (VAS). Will be summarized and compared between the treatment arms using a two-sample t-test or a Wilcoxon rank sum test, with a two-sided alternative for each. Will also analyze this endpoint graphically by plotting the VAS scores through time by treatment arm. Additionally, will correlate the scores from the VAS with other validated measures using a Spearman's correlation coefficient in an exploratory manner.</description>
