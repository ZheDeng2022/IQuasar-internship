    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if patients undergoing a laparoscopic surgery for removal&#xD;
      of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer following neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      (neoadjuvant- chemotherapy given before surgery) is feasible, safe, and provides similar&#xD;
      outcomes as compared to undergoing a large abdominal incision. Minimally invasive, or&#xD;
      laparoscopic, surgery is a type of surgery where only small incisions are made on the abdomen&#xD;
      and surgical instruments are placed through these incisions to perform the surgery. This type&#xD;
      of surgery has been shown to improve outcomes in many types of surgery, including in&#xD;
      gynecologic cancer surgery. Specifically, researchers know that patients who have minimally&#xD;
      invasive surgery have less pain after surgery, can go home quicker from the hospital, healing&#xD;
      time is more rapid, and potentially this can translate into returning to chemotherapy sooner.&#xD;
      Specifically, in ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer, minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgery has not been used as much because these cancers can have tumors all throughout the&#xD;
      inside of the abdomen (i.e. wide tumor burden) and located in areas that are sometimes not&#xD;
      easily reachable with laparoscopic instruments. However, the reason patients receive&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy is to shrink the tumor/s to make the surgery less extensive and the&#xD;
      recovery easier. It is unknown if minimally invasive surgery can be used in this setting and&#xD;
      by studying this, the study team will be able to determine if patient outcomes are improved&#xD;
      by implementing (using) this surgical technique.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to implement, evaluate, and further investigate the role of&#xD;
      minimally invasive surgery in patients undergoing interval debulking following neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospectively evaluate the feasibility and safety of the minimally invasive interval&#xD;
      debulking approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify the patient population for which the minimally invasive interval debulking&#xD;
           approach will offer comparable, if not improved, outcomes as the laparotomic interval&#xD;
           debulking technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Validate previously identified preoperative imaging computed tomography (CT) criteria&#xD;
           and CA-125 values to predict optimal cytoreduction in laparotomic primary cytoreductive&#xD;
           surgery and apply it towards the prediction of optimal cytoreduction (≤ 1 cm residual&#xD;
           disease) following minimally invasive interval debulking surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Validate the previously identified laparoscopic scoring system for primary cytoreductive&#xD;
           surgery and apply it towards the prediction of optimal cytoreduction (≤ 1 cm residual&#xD;
           disease) following minimally invasive interval debulking surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Monitor the number of hospital days in the first 30 days postoperatively (length of stay&#xD;
           after interval debulking including any days of readmission)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluate the oncologic safety as it relates to time to return to chemotherapy in&#xD;
           patients who undergo laparoscopic minimally invasive interval debulking surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Evaluate the complications as assessed by incidence of a composite of major&#xD;
           complications and a second composite of minor complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This will be a prospective pilot study to address feasibility and safety to&#xD;
      identify a patient population amenable to this surgical approach. This will allow for the&#xD;
      future trial to include randomization&#xD;

    <description>The patient will initially undergo a diagnostic laparoscopy by a minimally invasive approach and entry method. The decision of which approach and entry to perform will be dictated by the primary surgeon of record's preference and their assessment of pre-operative patient factors. Once the primary surgeon determines the areas of macroscopic disease, he/she will make an assessment as to the need to convert to a laparotomy or continue laparoscopically. At the completion of the procedure, it will be noted whether an optimal cytoreduction (≤ 1 cm residual disease) or a sub-optimal cytoreduction (&gt;1 cm residual disease) was performed.</description>
