  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study type is a prospective observational cohort study of children undergoing&#xD;
      adenotonsillectomy (T&amp;A). The study will recruit the annual caseload of children undergoing&#xD;
      T&amp;A at the Montreal Children's Hospital, QC, Canada; aiming for 200 children. There are no&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the severity and duration of postoperative pain&#xD;
      after T&amp;A and to link the severity of this pain with the severity of sleep disordered&#xD;
      breathing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adenotonsillectomy (T&amp;A) is one or the most common surgeries performed in children. Even&#xD;
      though T&amp;A is considered a painful surgery, it is often scheduled as a day surgery and&#xD;
      parents manage the postoperative pain at home. Historically, the home analgesic following&#xD;
      adenotonsillectomy consisted of a combination of acetaminophen and codeine. In June 2013,&#xD;
      Health Canada no longer recommended the use of codeine in children less than 12 years of age.&#xD;
      Thus in current practice the discharge analgesic is a combination of ibuprofen, acetaminophen&#xD;
      and oral rescue morphine. This shift in practice has occurred globally as well as in our&#xD;
      institution without evaluating the impact on analgesia at home following T&amp;A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The published literature reports that as many as 50% of children managed with the&#xD;
      acetaminophen/codeine regimen visit a primary care physician for the management of&#xD;
      pain/infection following T&amp;A and a high proportion of these children are prescribed an&#xD;
      opioid. This practice is of concern for the following reasons. Sleep disordered breathing&#xD;
      (SDB) is the most common indication for T&amp;A in children. In some children the sleep&#xD;
      disturbance meets the diagnostic criteria for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). A subset of&#xD;
      children, with severe OSA are more sensitive to both the analgesic and respiratory effects of&#xD;
      opioids. In these children, an age-appropriate dose of opioids may result in an overdose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain will be measured in hospital and at home with validated pain scores. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure is the Parents' Postoperative Pain Measure (PPPM), a valildated, established metric,&#xD;
      with good construct and content validity, for the repeated evaluation of pain following&#xD;
      surgery in the home environment. Parents will be asked to record the both the pain scores,&#xD;
      twice daily for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary outcome measure will be the self report of pain from the children. Two validated&#xD;
      pain scales will be used. For pre-verbal children, the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and&#xD;
      Consolability (FLACC) pain scale will be used. This 0-10 scale has shown good reliability,&#xD;
      validity and relevance in clinical practice for children's less than 4 years of age for&#xD;
      post-operative pain. For older children the modified modified Faces Pain Scale (FPS-R) will&#xD;
      be used. The 0-10 metric score is validated and reliable for children aged 4 - 16 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measure Time Frame Parents will be asked to record the PPPM and either the FLACC or&#xD;
      the FPS-R, twice daily for 14 days in a pain diary. The change in pain scores over 14 days&#xD;
      will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively the severity of the SDB will be assessed, with the Snoring, Trouble Breathing,&#xD;
      UnRefreshed (STBUR) questionnaire; a 5-item questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) To determine the severity and duration of postoperative pain after adenotonsillectomy&#xD;
      (T&amp;A) and to correlate the pain scores with the STBUR.&#xD;
