                  the subject practices true abstinence* from heterosexual contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be&#xD;

                  days prior to starting CC-92480, during the study therapy (including during dose&#xD;
                  interruptions), and for 28 days after discontinuation of study therapy.&#xD;

        Note: A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche&#xD;
        at some point and, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or 3) has&#xD;
        not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out&#xD;
        childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time&#xD;
        in the preceding 24 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male subjects must:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Practice true abstinence* (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to use&#xD;
             of a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing&#xD;
             potential while participating in the study (even during dose interruptions) and for at&#xD;
             least 3 months following CC-92480 discontinuation in accordance with the PPP provided&#xD;
             to the subject at the time of informed consent, even if he has undergone a successful&#xD;
             vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             * True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
             lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
             post-ovulation methods) and coitus interruptus (withdrawal) are not acceptable methods&#xD;
             of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Males must agree to refrain from donating sperm while on CC-92480 for 90 days after&#xD;
             its discontinuation. Females must agree to refrain from donating ova while on CC-92480&#xD;
             for 28 days after its discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All subjects must agree to refrain from donating blood while on CC-92480 and for 28&#xD;
