    <textblock>
      This is a sporozoite-challenge clinical study with the primary aim of assessing the safety&#xD;
      and feasibility of controlled human P. vivax malaria infection in two healthy volunteers. The&#xD;
      investigators will also assess the growth of and the immune response to P. vivax infection,&#xD;
      and assess the induction of sexual gametocytaemia post-CHMI via the natural route of malaria&#xD;
      infection (mosquito bite). A secondary objective is to develop a blood inoculum of P.&#xD;
      vivax-infected blood for future testing of candidate vaccines.&#xD;

      This is a sporozoite-challenge clinical study with the primary aim of assessing the safety&#xD;
      and feasibility of controlled human P. vivax malaria infection in two healthy volunteers. The&#xD;
      investigators will also assess the growth of and the immune response to P. vivax infection,&#xD;
      and assess the induction of sexual gametocytaemia post-CHMI via the natural route of malaria&#xD;
      infection (mosquito bite). A secondary objective is to develop a blood inoculum of P.&#xD;
      vivax-infected blood for future testing of candidate vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two healthy, malaria-naïve adults aged between 18 and 50 years will be recruited at the&#xD;
      CCVTM, Oxford. CHMI by sporozoites will be delivered by mosquito bite at Imperial College,&#xD;
      London, and follow-up during the post-challenge period will be at the CCVTM in Oxford.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two volunteers will have blood taken at regular intervals post-CHMI to assess the immune&#xD;
      response to primary P. vivax infection, and also the gametocytaemia following P. vivax&#xD;
      infection, and the volunteers will be monitored closely until the volunteers meet the&#xD;
      criteria for treatment. Up to 250 mL (half a unit) of blood will be taken just prior to&#xD;
      treatment from the two successfully infected volunteers (as determined by measurement of the&#xD;
      parasitaemia) and frozen down for future use in blood-stage CHMI trials. The volunteers will&#xD;
      be treated with a standard 60-hour course of oral artemether-lumefantrine (Riamet) followed&#xD;
      by a 2-week course of partially-observed oral Primaquine for radical cure of P. vivax&#xD;
      hypnozoites. The volunteers will be followed up for 3 months in the clinic and email&#xD;
      follow-up will continue out to 5 years to monitor for clinical relapse.&#xD;

    <description>Two healthy human volunteers are exposed to the bites of five infectious mosquitoes per participant (by placing their forearms over the pot containing mosquitoes) for 5-10 minutes. Fed mosquitoes (as indicated by the presence of a blood meal in the abdomen) are individually dissected and assessed for sporozoite load (graded 0 to +4; a gland rating of +2 or more, representing 10 or more observed sporozoites, qualifies as being infectious). If, by this method the volunteer is found to have been inoculated by less than five infected mosquitoes, further mosquitoes are allowed to feed on the volunteer until a total of 5 appropriately infected mosquitoes have fed. The bite-challenge procedure continues until the subject has been bitten by 5 infectious mosquitoes.</description>

                  are required to use an effective form of contraception during the course of the&#xD;

                  of the study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Testing for HIV, HTLV, hepatitis B and C and syphilis will be performed at screening and&#xD;
        then repeated 1 week prior to CHMI (day C-7) to ensure no new acquisition of infection&#xD;
        prior to blood donation. Other infections will be screened for if the volunteer has&#xD;
        recently travelled to an area where they may have been exposed to a blood-borne infection&#xD;
        that could theoretically be transmitted to another healthy volunteer during a future&#xD;
        blood-stage challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Exclusion criteria on day of CHMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following constitute absolute contraindications to CHMI:&#xD;
