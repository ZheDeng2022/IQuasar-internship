  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pterygium is characterized by encroachment of a ﬂeshy fibrovascular tissue from the bulbar&#xD;
      conjunctiva on to the cornea. Although previously thought to be a solely degenerative&#xD;
      disease, a new evidence has demonstrated the role of cell proliferation and inflammation in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of pterygium , and also by the clinical data that steroids are beneﬁcial in&#xD;
      halting progression of impending recurrent pterygium . Many techniques have been developed&#xD;
      for pterygium surgery over time. The simple method of removing the head and body of pterygium&#xD;
      and leaving the sclera uncovered, the so-called bare-sclera technique, has been associated&#xD;
      with high recurrence rates of 32-88% . To reduce the recurrence rate after pterygium surgery&#xD;
      with a bare-sclera technique, various adjunctive modalities have been used such as chemical&#xD;
      agents including mitomycin C , 5-ﬂuorouracil . Furthermore, when removal of pterygium is&#xD;
      accompanied with a graft, such as conjunctival autograft or amniotic membrane transplantation&#xD;
      , lower recurrence rates have been achieved . However, it remains unclear why the bare sclera&#xD;
      technique has poorer outcome with higher recurrence rate than other procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the factors that may have a role in the outcome of pterygium surgery is postoperative&#xD;
      conjunctival inflammation , treatment of which has been demonstrated to improve the ﬁnal&#xD;
      outcome . It has been shown that persistent conjunctival inflammation around the surgical&#xD;
      site after pterygium surgery is present in 31-84% of cases with amniotic membrane&#xD;
      transplantation, and in 15% of eyes with conjunctival autograft . However, the rate of&#xD;
      conjunctival inflammation after pterygium surgery with a bare-sclera technique has not been&#xD;
      reported in literature . Also, it has been suggested that higher recurrence rate after&#xD;
      pterygium with amniotic membrane transplantation compared with conjunctival autograft may be&#xD;
      due to higher rate of postoperative conjunctival inflammation . Therefore, it may be&#xD;
      speculated that higher recurrence rate after pterygium surgery with a bare-sclera technique&#xD;
      is partly due to higher rate of postoperative conjunctival inflammation .&#xD;

    <description>it is a grade to follow up the recurrence of pterygium which classifies pterygium excision outcome from grades 1 to 4:&#xD;
Grade 1 : indicates a normal appearance of the operated site .&#xD;
Grade 2 : indicates the presence of fine episcleral vessels in the excised area, extending to the limbus but without any fibrous tissue .&#xD;
Grade 3 : indicates fibrovascular tissue in the excised area, reaching to the limbus but not invading the cornea and significant conjunctival recurrence .&#xD;
Grade 4: indicates a true corneal recurrence with fibrovascular tissue invading the cornea.</description>
