      A stillbirth describes when a baby dies after 24 weeks of pregnancy and before being born. In&#xD;
      the UK there are roughly 9 stillbirths every day. Normally, before a stillbirth occurs&#xD;
      changes such as a slower heart rate and reduced movement take place. Fetal monitoring&#xD;
      attempts to detect these changes so that babies can be delivered before they become severely&#xD;
      ill. If a baby could be monitored continuously then these changes could be detected earlier.&#xD;
      However, current forms of fetal monitoring, such as ultrasound, cannot be used for long&#xD;
      periods of time and do not significantly reduce stillbirth rates. The Monica AN24 device is a&#xD;
      continuous monitor which records the baby's heart rhythm using sensors placed on the mother's&#xD;
      abdomen. As this is a new device there is little evidence about how well it works. In this&#xD;
      project women will be asked how they feel about the device after wearing it. Doctors and&#xD;
      midwives will also be asked about their views of the device. The effect of the mother's&#xD;
      movement and the age of the baby on how well the Monica AN24 can record the baby's heart&#xD;
      rhythm will also be assessed.&#xD;

      In the United Kingdom (UK) stillbirth is defined as the death of a fetus before birth and&#xD;
      after 24 weeks gestation. The incidence of stillbirth in the UK was 4.6 per 1000 in 2014. The&#xD;
      annual rate of reduction was 1.4%, a rate considerably lower than other high income&#xD;
      countries, such as Poland (4.5%) and Netherlands (6.8%), demonstrating that more can be done&#xD;
      to reduce stillbirth rates in the UK. Stillbirths are often preceded by a series of adaptive&#xD;
      changes, including changes in fetal heart rate (FHR) and reduced fetal movement. Fetal&#xD;
      monitoring serves, in part, to identify these changes so that appropriate intervention can be&#xD;
      initiated and adverse outcomes prevented. However, currently used forms of fetal monitoring,&#xD;
      including Doppler ultrasound and cardiotocography, cannot provide an objective, longitudinal&#xD;
      view of fetal wellbeing and do not significantly reduce stillbirth rates. A continuous fetal&#xD;
      monitor could identify signs of fetal compromise earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study found that 45.1% of surveyed clinicians thought that a continuous fetal&#xD;
      monitor would be beneficial to their practice, although 81.7% also expressed concerns about&#xD;
      the utility and clinical implementation of such a device. The Monica AN24 monitor is a novel&#xD;
      continuous fetal monitoring device which records the fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) via&#xD;
      trans-abdominal electrodes. Monica AN24 has been shown to have good recording quality though&#xD;
      one study reported an association between recording quality and gestational age. The effect&#xD;
      of the device on maternal anxiety is not known. All studies assessing acceptability of the&#xD;
      device to women have focused on the intrapartum period or during induction of labor.&#xD;
      Consequently, a prospective observational cohort study is needed to assess the acceptability&#xD;
      of the Monica AN24 device in the context of antenatal care, as is further exploration of&#xD;
      factors affecting recording quality of the Monica AN24 device.&#xD;
