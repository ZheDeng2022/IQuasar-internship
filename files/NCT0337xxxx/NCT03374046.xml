  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the impact of apneic oxygenation on the time to&#xD;
      desaturation in pediatric patients treated in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize pediatric patients will have an increase in time to desaturation&#xD;
      with apneic oxygenation when compared to standard practice in the PICU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxygen (O2) desaturation is one of the risks of intubation, especially in critically ill&#xD;
      children with comorbidities, increased O2 consumption and decreased O2 delivery. Desaturation&#xD;
      places patients at greater risk for dysrhythmia, hemodynamic instability, hypoxic brain&#xD;
      injury, and death. As shown in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, once oxyhemoglobin&#xD;
      (PaO2) saturations drop to ~ 90%, there is an increased risk for precipitous desaturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many may believe there would be no gas exchange during apnea, alveoli continue to&#xD;
      take up oxygen even without diaphragmatic movements or lung expansion. As such, the&#xD;
      administration of oxygen during intubation (when a patient is apneic) has not been a standard&#xD;
      practice until recently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies in adults have shown an increase in the time to desaturation when they are&#xD;
      given concurrent oxygen administration during an intubation attempt. This use of oxygen&#xD;
      during intubation is referred to as apneic oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of this work, apneic oxygenation has become standard practice in many emergency&#xD;
      departments, even with pediatric patients. Yet, in pediatric hospital units, including&#xD;
      intensive care, this is not the standard practice and no pediatric studies have been&#xD;
      published on this subject to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study unit apneic oxygenation is not standard during intubation. The investigators&#xD;
      would like to evaluate its use as it has shown benefits in prior research published on&#xD;
      adults. Most patients in the PICU are already on a source of oxygen administration prior to&#xD;
      intubation, this source of oxygen is usually removed during the intubation attempt, when the&#xD;
      patient is apneic and not breathing on his/her own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuing oxygen administration during the apneic period, would be a minimal to no risk&#xD;
      intervention and has only shown a benefit during the apneic period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a decision is made for intubation, the subject will be randomized into one of two&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control (standard practice)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Apneic oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Subjects will be stratified by age (0 - 2 years and &gt;2 - 17), randomized in&#xD;
      blocks of 10 until the final sample size is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all subjects, the study protocol will determine only the provision of supplemental oxygen&#xD;
      during intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decisions regarding the intubation approach, pre-oxygenation, patient positioning,&#xD;
      medications used, ventilation strategy, and choice of equipment will be made by the clinical&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the nature of the study intervention, clinicians and study personnel will be aware&#xD;
      of study group assignments after randomization.&#xD;
