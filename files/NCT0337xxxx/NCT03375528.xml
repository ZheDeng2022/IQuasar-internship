  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If intimal growth is such that the initial lumen is narrowed significantly, distal blood flow&#xD;
      is restricted and chronic tissue ischemia results. This occurs in native coronary arteries&#xD;
      and during restenosis after coronary angioplasty or failure of some coronary vein grafts.&#xD;
      Stent implantation has become the principal revascularization technique for coronary artery&#xD;
      disease. But, in-stent restenosis (ISR) by neointimal hyperplasia persists as a significant&#xD;
      limitation of this procedure in the era of drug eluting stent (DES). Coronary intervention&#xD;
      might induce an inflammatory response by arterial wall damage, release of inflammatory and&#xD;
      chemoattractant factors resulting in leukocyte and platelet activation. Then, Migration and&#xD;
      proliferation of neointimal smooth muscle cells together with the deposition of extracellular&#xD;
      matrix might lead to the development of ISR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a key role in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      restenosis by controlling extracellular matrix degradation and the release of&#xD;
      matrix-degrading MMPs, including MMP -2 and MMP-9, which facilitate intimal remodeling after&#xD;
      angioplasty. Previous studies showed that increased levels of MMPs in coronary arteries&#xD;
      undergoing percutaneous intervention may be associated with vascular remodeling and&#xD;
      restenosis by promoting migration of vascular smooth muscle cells. Recently, Gregory et al.&#xD;
      demonstrated that elevated serum activities of MMP-2 and -9 are associated with dramatically&#xD;
      increased restenosis rates after PCI with implantation of DES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with DESs, determination of MMP levels might be useful for identification of&#xD;
      patients who are at high risk for ISR. However, not much is known about the relationship&#xD;
      between MMPs and neointimal hyperplasia in patients with DES. In this study, the serum&#xD;
      activity of MMP-2 and 9 were investigated in patients who had undergone follow-up coronary&#xD;
      angiography with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), which performed at 9 months post-DES&#xD;
      implantation. Our aim was to evaluate if individual or combined levels of MMPs were&#xD;
      associated with increased neointimal hyperplasia volume, that is, to evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship, correlation between the levels of MMPs and neointimal hyperplasia volume.&#xD;

      Materials and methods Subjects (patients) Patients derived from a population of patients&#xD;
      referred to 12 months follow-up coronary angiography for ischemic heart disease who are&#xD;
      enable to be performed IVUS will be enrolled in the present trial, between Dec 2017 and Dec&#xD;
      2018. The study was an all comers design involving consecutive enrollment of patients with&#xD;
      stable angina or acute coronary syndrome who had at least 1 coronary lesion (defined as a&#xD;
      stenosis of &gt;50%) suitable for stent implantation 9 months before. The follow-up coronary&#xD;
      angiography was performed according to standard techniques by experienced interventionalists&#xD;
      only. In-stent restenosis was defined as a diameter stenosis ≥50% of the vessel reference&#xD;
      diameter by visual assessment at the site of the lesion treated with the stent observed in ≥1&#xD;
      multiple projections. The single most severe view was used to categorize the pattern of&#xD;
      restenosis as proposed by Mehran et al for classification of in-stent restenotic lesions.&#xD;
      Detailed demographic details including anthropometric measurements, cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors and medication use were recorded for the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiographic analysis (QCA-analysis) The off-line quantitative coronary angiographic analysis&#xD;
      was performed with an automated edge-detection system (QCA-CMS Version 6.0, Medis, Medical&#xD;
      Imaging Systems, Leiden, the Netherlands). The contrast-filled, non-tapered catheter tip was&#xD;
      used for calibration. The reference diameter was measured by interpolation. Minimal lumen&#xD;
      diameter (before and after PCI) and diameter stenosis (before and after PCI) were measured&#xD;
      within the stent and within the 5-mm proximal and distal edges of the stent. Furthermore, we&#xD;
      measured vessel size, lesion length, and length of stented segment. All analyses were&#xD;
      performed by the same investigator that was blinded to all laboratory results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVUS imaging and analysis IVUS imaging was performed after intracoronary administration of&#xD;
      0.2 mg nitroglycerin, using a motorized transducer pullback (0.5 mm/s) and a commercial&#xD;
      scanner (Boston Scientific/SCIMED, Minneapolis, MN) consisting of a rotating 40-MHz&#xD;
      transducer within a 3.2 Fr imaging sheath. The decision to perform IVUS was at the operator's&#xD;
      discretion. All IVUS data were assessed off-line by experienced professionals unaware of the&#xD;
      allocated stent type or clinical information. Using computerized planimetry (EchoPlaque 2.7,&#xD;
      Indec Systems, Mountain View, CA), stent and reference segments were assessed every 1 mm.&#xD;
      In-stent measurements were obtained every 1 mm and included EEM, stent, intra-stent lumen,&#xD;
      peristent plaque+media (EEM minus stent), and IH (stent minus intra-stent lumen) areas and&#xD;
      volumes. Percent IH was defined as IH divided by stent. All volumes were calculated using the&#xD;
      Simpson rule and then normalized by stent length (normalized volume).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples Blood samples were taken under fasting conditions directly before follow-up&#xD;
      angiography. Arterial blood was drawn from the coronary arteries into serum separator tubes&#xD;
      and samples serums were allowed to clot for 30 min before centrifugation at 1,000 g for 10&#xD;
      minutes and stored at -70°C until use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory measurement Endogenous MMP-2 and MMP-9 were measured in serum using a standardized&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; R&amp;D systems). This system measures the endogenous&#xD;
      activity of the specific MMPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was based on the null hypothesis that MMP-2 and/or -9 activity showed&#xD;
      no correlation with neointimal hyperplasia volume. Using the Lachin formula, sample size&#xD;
      calculations were performed to show the expected correlation coefficient (r) more than 0.40&#xD;
      between both group, two-sided alpha 0.05 and 80% statistical power. Finally, 47 patients were&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables are expressed as mean±SD. Categorical variables are summarized as counts&#xD;
      and percentages and were compared by the chi-square or by Fisher exact test. Serum levels of&#xD;
      MMPs were compared by Student t test or by Mann-Whitney U test. Pearson's correlation was&#xD;
      used to correlate MMP levels with neointimal hyperplasia volume. Multiple logistic regression&#xD;
      was used to evaluate the interaction between variables and MMPs in correlation with&#xD;
      neointimal hyperplasia volume and in-stent restenosis. A stepwise entry procedure was applied&#xD;
      to identify significant or suggestive (p &lt; 0.1) confounders of either patient group or MMP&#xD;
      level. Odds ratios were expressed with 95% confidence intervals. A p-value of less than 0.05&#xD;
      was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed with the&#xD;
      statistical software package SPSS version 12.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois). The authors&#xD;
      had full access to the data and take responsibility for its integrity. All authors have read&#xD;
      and agree to the manuscript as written.&#xD;
