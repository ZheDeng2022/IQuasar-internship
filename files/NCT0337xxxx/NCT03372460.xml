  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of combining non-invasive brain stimulation, called&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), with virtual reality exposure as a treatment&#xD;
      for Veterans with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Investigators will test&#xD;
      whether this intervention improves PTSD symptoms and improves quality of life. Results from&#xD;
      this study may be used to develop a new non-medication approach to treating chronic PTSD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is highly prevalent in Veterans and is associated with significant psychiatric and&#xD;
      medical comorbidity, as well as poor quality of life. Despite its prevalence and impact, the&#xD;
      success of currently available treatments is mixed, highlighting the need for novel&#xD;
      approaches that aim to reduce symptoms and improve outcomes. Prior research has demonstrated&#xD;
      that reduced activity in a part of the brain, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), is&#xD;
      associated with an inability to regulate fear responses, preventing the generation of safety&#xD;
      memories and allowing PTSD symptoms to persist. Targeting the VMPFC with non-invasive&#xD;
      electrical brain stimulation may therefore alleviate these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a type of non-invasive brain stimulation&#xD;
      that may enhance the likelihood of neuronal activity in the VMPFC. In doing so, tDCS prepares&#xD;
      the brain to respond to external stimuli and to facilitate learning and memory. Because&#xD;
      therapeutic success from exposure to trauma-related content - as used in exposure-based&#xD;
      therapy for PTSD - is thought to be based on an adaptive learning process, applying tDCS in&#xD;
      combination with exposure to trauma cues may effectively boost exposure-based learning. To do&#xD;
      this, investigators at the Providence VA Medical Center will use a standardized virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR) setting to deliver trauma-related content. The virtual reality setting involves&#xD;
      three, 8-minute driving scenarios, which consist of VR stimuli (sights, sounds, smells, etc.)&#xD;
      often encountered in combat training and in theater.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized to receive six sessions of either active tDCS plus&#xD;
      virtual reality (tDCS+VR) or sham tDCS+VR. Clinical and self-report assessments will be&#xD;
      completed at baseline, midpoint, and endpoint, as well as 1 and 3 months following the final&#xD;
      tDCS+VR session. Participants will also undergo a MRI before and after completion of all six&#xD;
      tDCS+VR sessions to assess change over time. Additionally, MRI data will be used for&#xD;
      electrical field modeling to predict treatment response based on individually obtained&#xD;
      electrical field values in PTSD relevant neural circuitry. Participants may also choose to&#xD;
      participate in an optional pre-tDCS+VR session EEG and an optional 1-month follow-up MRI.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Average 2.5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD. Items are rated on how much the symptom bothered the respondent in the past month (0 = &quot;not at all bothered by&quot; to 4 = &quot;extremely bothered &quot;). A total symptom severity score (range: 0-80) can be obtained by summing the scores for each of the 20 items, with higher scores indicating more severe PTSD symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Average 2.5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 16-item QLESQ (short form) evaluates quality of life and other areas of change related to functioning outside of symptom domains (e.g., physical health, mood, leisure time activities, social relationships, etc.). Items are rated on how satisfied the respondent has been in the past week (1 = &quot;very poor&quot; to 5 = &quot;very good &quot;). A total raw score (range: 14-70). The raw total score is transformed into a percentage maximum possible score using the following formula: (raw total score minimum score)/(maximum possible raw score minimum score). Higher outcomes indicate better quality of life, greater enjoyment, and satisfaction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychophysiology (Skin Conductance Reactivity; SCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Average 2.5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Psychophysiology will include skin conductance reactivity to specific trauma context virtual reality (VR) cues presented in the VR scenario. SCR to VR events will be measured by the phasic responses that occur after the presentation of discreet VR events. SCR will be compared from baseline to endpoint, to correlate these measures and evaluate changes attributable to active tDCS+VR compared to sham.</description>
