  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible to treat an infection with a&#xD;
      cell-based immunotherapy (therapy that uses the patient's own immune system to treat the&#xD;
      infection). This treatment is called adoptive T cell therapy. Another purpose is to learn&#xD;
      about the side effects and toxicities of adoptive T cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adoptive T cell therapy is an investigational (experimental) therapy that works by using the&#xD;
      blood of a donor that has immunity against the virus. The donor cells are collected and then&#xD;
      the cells, called T cells, that are capable of defending against the virus are selected out.&#xD;
      These selected T cells are then infused back into the patient, to try to give the immune&#xD;
      system the ability to fight the infection. Adoptive T cell therapy is experimental because it&#xD;
      is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;

      Brief Background/Rationale: This study seeks to determine the feasibility of using antigen&#xD;
      specific T cells isolated with the CliniMACS® Cytokine Capture System (CCS) for the treatment&#xD;
      of adenovirus infections occurring after allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation&#xD;
      (HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine the feasibility of the treatment of opportunistic adenovirus&#xD;
      infection after HSCT with adenovirus-specific, antigen-selected T cells, using the CliniMACS®&#xD;
      Prodigy System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety profile of the infusion of virus - specific, antigen selected T&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the toxicities related to infusion of virus - specific, antigen selected T&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the rate of eradication of opportunistic adenovirus infection after&#xD;
           treatment with virus-specific, antigen-selected T cells using the CliniMACS® Prodigy&#xD;
           System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study will include a single treatment cohort including subjects who have&#xD;
      failed to respond, are intolerant or have contraindications to antiviral agents used for&#xD;
      treatment of Human Adenovirus (HAdV) (ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled in a staggered pattern to ensure safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient 1 will be enrolled and observed for 30 days after infusion of virus specific T&#xD;
           cells before enrollment of a subsequent patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient 2 will be enrolled ≥ 30 days after treatment of patient 1 and will be observed&#xD;
           for 30 days before enrollment of a subsequent patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subsequent patients will be enrolled in 6 cohorts of 3 subjects each. A safety period&#xD;
           between cohorts of 30 days (between treatment of the last subject of one cohort and the&#xD;
           first subject of the subsequent cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Staggered enrollment of patients with an observation period of 30 days after&#xD;
      infusion. Safety monitoring points planned after patient No. 5 and No. 11&#xD;

    <description>Virus-specific, antigen selected cells will be obtained using the CliniMACS® Prodigy System. The donor will be screened for their ability to produce an IFN-gamma- secretion response to HAdV by testing the donor's mononuclear cells with the Miltenyi Rapid Cytokine Inspector kit. Donors with appropriate IFN-gamma secretion response will undergo a steady state leukapheresis. The investigational product (IP) will be generated using the CCS-IFN enrichment program with an approximate duration time of 15 hours. IP will be suspended in 0.9 normal saline + 2.5% albumin and distributed for infusion and infused within 4 hours as a bolus on day 0.&#xD;
Subjects will receive virus-specific, antigen selected T cells within a targeted range of 1 x 10^3- 2 x 10^5 per kg of recipient weight.</description>
