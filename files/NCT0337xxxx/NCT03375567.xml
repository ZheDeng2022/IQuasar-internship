  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the detection rate of residual/refractory&#xD;
      disease based on standard bone marrow biopsy versus guided myeloma lesion biopsy after&#xD;
      induction therapy with carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone regimen.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (CRD) combination therapy is generally associated&#xD;
      with high response rates. The expectation is that induction therapy with CRD will result in&#xD;
      responses within the myeloma lesions. Extrapolating from the published experience on standard&#xD;
      bone marrow response rates with CRD regimen, it is predicted that guided biopsy of myeloma&#xD;
      lesions will reveal VGPR/CR/nearCR rate up to 50%. Further, it can be hypothesized that&#xD;
      myeloma lesion biopsy will increase the detection rate of residual/refractory disease by&#xD;
      about 20%, as compared with standard bone marrow evaluation. Thus, it is expected that&#xD;
      myeloma lesion biopsy response rate may be discordant from the standard bone marrow response&#xD;
      rate. The identification of patients with large residual disease burden in the myeloma&#xD;
      lesions will indicate the need for further salvage therapy. Based on this, it is expected&#xD;
      that advanced imaging with guided myeloma lesion biopsy will result in significantly improved&#xD;
      response assessment strategy after induction therapy, and will allow better selection of&#xD;
      patients prior to autologous stem cell transplant.&#xD;
