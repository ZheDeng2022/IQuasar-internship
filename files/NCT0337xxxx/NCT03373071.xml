  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this phase I study is to evaluate the safety and to establish the&#xD;
      recommended dose of CD19-CART01 infused in pediatric patients affected by relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      B-ALL or NHL with measurable Bone Marrow (BM) involvement. The phase II extension is aimed at&#xD;
      testing the efficacy of the treatment at the optimal dose defined in the phase I.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 phases, a Phase I or dose escalation phase and a Phase II or&#xD;
      expansion phase. Paediatric/young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B cell ALL will&#xD;
      be enrolled. Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis in order to harvest T cells, which&#xD;
      is the starting material for the manufacture. Autologous CAR T product directed against&#xD;
      CD19-expressing tumor cells (CD19-CART01) will be produced and, after a lymphodepletion with&#xD;
      conventional chemoterapic agents, the patient will receive CD19-CART01 intravenously. The&#xD;
      construct contains also the suicide gene safety switch &quot;inducible Caspase 9&quot;; therefore, in&#xD;
      case of relevant toxicities, the patient will receive the dimerizing agent in order to induce&#xD;
      the apoptosis of the cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the treatment, the patients will then enter a 36-month follow-up period.&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. There is no time restriction with respect to prior intrathecal chemotherapy,&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Patients who relapse while receiving standard ALL maintenance chemotherapy will&#xD;
                  not be required to have a waiting period before entry onto this study provided&#xD;
                  that they meet all other eligibility criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Subjects receiving steroid therapy at physiologic replacement doses only are&#xD;
                  allowed provided that there has been no increase in dose for at least 2 weeks&#xD;
