  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain contributes to declining health and function in older adults; effects that are&#xD;
      intensified by obesity and sedentary (sitting) behavior. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      develop and test a novel, patient-centered intervention to reduce pain and improve physical&#xD;
      function in older, obese adults. The study will utilize a combination of telephone based&#xD;
      coaching and smartphone tools to deliver this novel intervention to decrease both body weight&#xD;
      and sitting behavior. The long-term goals of this project are to test the efficacy of the&#xD;
      intervention and to develop it as a tool for clinicians to provide outside-of-clinic&#xD;
      patient-centered support for overweight/obese older adults with chronic pain.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain has emerged as an urgent age-related health issue that significantly effects&#xD;
      physical functioning and quality of life, with the unfavorable effects worsened by both&#xD;
      obesity and sedentary behavior. The annual cost of pain in the United States is nearly 30%&#xD;
      higher than the combined costs of cancer and diabetes. In 2016, the NIH called for a National&#xD;
      Pain Strategy to: 1) expand non-pharmacological treatment options in older adults, who are&#xD;
      particularly susceptible to the side effects of opioid and other pain medications; 2) develop&#xD;
      accessible treatments that are tailored to individuals; and 3) increase the development of&#xD;
      self-management programs for chronic pain. The purpose of this R-21 is to develop and test&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, patient-centered intervention to reduce chronic&#xD;
      pain and improve physical functioning in older adults, leveraging the combination of&#xD;
      telecoaching and individually-adaptive mHealth tools to decrease both body mass and sedentary&#xD;
      behavior. A pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted to provide initial evidence&#xD;
      for effect sizes (pain and physical function) associated with the proposed intervention, and&#xD;
      to estimate the sample size needed for a full scale randomized controlled trial design that&#xD;
      compares the effects of the intervention versus usual care on pain ratings and physical&#xD;
      function in overweight/obese older adults with chronic pain.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in PROMIS Pain Intensity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Intensity Scale tasks participants with rating how much they hurt on a scale of 1 (had no pain) to 5 (very severe). Final scores are given as T-scores, with higher scores representing worse intensity. PROMIS scores are a t-score representing relationships with an estimated population average collected on a general US sample of adults as well as clinical samples. On this t distribution, 50 represents the population average with a standard deviation of 10. Thus, a score of 55 represents a score that is a half-standard deviation about the US national average, and a 40 represents a score that is 1 standard deviation below the national average. Scores were computed using the HealthMeasures.org scoring service as recommended for PROMIS measures.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PROMIS Pain Interference Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Interference Scale captures the impact of pain on valued areas of an individual's life (e.g., how much did pain interfere with your day to day activities) on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). Final scores are given as T-scores, with higher scores representing worse interference. PROMIS scores are a t-score representing relationships with an estimated population average collected on a general US sample of adults as well as clinical samples. On this t distribution, 50 represents the population average with a standard deviation of 10. Thus, a score of 55 represents a score that is a half-standard deviation about the US national average, and a 40 represents a score that is 1 standard deviation below the national average. Scores were computed using the HealthMeasures.org scoring service as recommended for PROMIS measures.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Short Physical Performance Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test of lower-extremity function consists of 4-m walk at usual pace, a timed repeated chair stand, and 3 increasingly difficult standing balance tests. Each measure is assigned a categorical score ranging from 0 (inability to complete the test) to 4 (best performance) resulting in a final score of 0-12. Higher scores denotes better outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activity Minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Activity Minutes will be assessed using ActivPal activity monitors (PAL Technologies Ltd, Glasgow, UK) worn at the thigh for 7 consecutive days. We will assess (a) number of daily minutes spent in light-intensity physical activity as reported by the ActivPal (range: 0-1440, more minutes of light activity are favorable); (b) number of daily minutes spent in moderate-intensity physical activity as reported by the ActivPal (range: 0-1440, more minutes of moderate activity are favorable).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>Transitions will be assessed using ActivPal activity monitors (PAL Technologies Ltd, Glasgow, UK) worn at the thigh for 7 consecutive days. We will assess number of daily transitions from sitting to non-sitting behavior, captured via the ActivPal inclinometer (range: 0 - infinity; a higher number of transitions are favorable).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Five participants were assigned to an usability testing period. For the duration of this period, intervention staff kept detailed notation of software and usability challenges, and iterations were made according to information gathered from this period. Notably, these iterations do not affect the overarching structure of the intervention, but will ensure all components of the program are maximally usability for the older adult with chronic pain.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change in PROMIS Pain Intensity Scale</title>
        <description>The Pain Intensity Scale tasks participants with rating how much they hurt on a scale of 1 (had no pain) to 5 (very severe). Final scores are given as T-scores, with higher scores representing worse intensity. PROMIS scores are a t-score representing relationships with an estimated population average collected on a general US sample of adults as well as clinical samples. On this t distribution, 50 represents the population average with a standard deviation of 10. Thus, a score of 55 represents a score that is a half-standard deviation about the US national average, and a 40 represents a score that is 1 standard deviation below the national average. Scores were computed using the HealthMeasures.org scoring service as recommended for PROMIS measures.</description>

MORPH: Participants will engage in 12 weekly group coaching sessions discussion behavioral approaches to pain management, weight loss, and daily physical activity. The first three sessions (i.e., weeks 1 - 3) will occur in-person, and the remaining 9 will take place via telephone. All intervention participants will receive access to an activity monitor, smart scale, and smartphone app that aims to provide support for daily physical activity and weight loss.</description>
