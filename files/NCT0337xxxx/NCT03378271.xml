  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the accuracy of two commercial glucose monitoring systems in&#xD;
      patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and renal impairment, including patients with or&#xD;
      without dialysis. Patients treatment experience will even be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and Flash glucose monitoring (FGM) are tools today mainly&#xD;
      used in the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes. Both glucose monitors are&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissue sensors, which provide a tissue fluid glucose measurement every 1 to 5&#xD;
      minutes. The real-time glucose sensor trend data can help patients with diabetes better&#xD;
      manage their insulin needs with meals and exercise. The following glucose monitoring systems&#xD;
      are two of the most current sensor technologies available for clinical use the Dexcom G5&#xD;
      (Dexcom Corporation), and the FGM (Abbot Freestyle Libre).&#xD;
&#xD;
      High glucose levels in patients with type 1 or 2-diabetes lead to increased risks of micro-&#xD;
      and macrovascular complications, while low glucose levels may lead to unconsciousness.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is important for patients to manage glucose levels as close to normal (4-7&#xD;
      mmol/l) as possible. This is generally performed by appropriate dosage of different insulins,&#xD;
      calculated from the preprandial glucose level, carbohydrate intake, and physical activity. In&#xD;
      spite of careful dosage, glucose levels often become too low or too high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGM is a novel tool to detect low and high glucose levels, and it is capable of sounding an&#xD;
      alarm for low and high glucose levels. CGM has been available in clinical practice in Sweden&#xD;
      for approximately 5 years. FGM is as CGM also a novel tool to detect low and high glucose&#xD;
      levels, but is not capable of sounding an alarm for low and high glucose levels. FGM has been&#xD;
      available in clinical practice in Sweden since late 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since both CGM and FGM measure the glucose level by a sensor in subcutaneous tissue, there is&#xD;
      uncertainty in the estimation of blood glucose levels. The accuracy of a certain CGM or FGM&#xD;
      system can be assessed by comparing the glucose levels estimated by the glucose monitors with&#xD;
      measured glucose levels in capillary blood samples. To our knowledge there are no studies&#xD;
      comparing the accuracy of the Dexcom G5 sensor with the Freestyle Libre sensor. In the&#xD;
      current study, we will compare the accuracy and treatment experience of these two glucose&#xD;
      monitoring sensors available on the market for clinical use in patients with type 1 or 2&#xD;
      diabetes and renal impairment with an eGFR&lt;30 ml/min both in and not in dialysis.&#xD;

    <description>each patient will have a CGM and a FGM, subcutaneous glucose sensors, the data will be compared to the time-matched reference blood glucose measurements.&#xD;
Each ambulatory patient will sample capillary blood with the HemoCue meter and measure the concentration of glucose minimum 3 times per day for 14 days. The concentration of finger-stick capillary blood glucose will be measured using the self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) hemocue meter in their daily living. The subjects will record SMBG, in a written diary. Subjects will dose insulin according to their routine methods throughout the 14 day study</description>
