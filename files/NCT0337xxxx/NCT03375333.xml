    <textblock>
      This study explores how Point of Care Ultrasound (POC-US) is used in general practice in&#xD;
      Denmark and how it affects the diagnostic process and treatment of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty general practitioners (GPs) will register information each time they use POC-US during&#xD;
      a one month period. The information will include indications and frequencies of the performed&#xD;
      POC-US examinations, change in tentative diagnosis, plan, and treatment before and after the&#xD;
      use of POC-US in relation to confidence in the tentative diagnosis, findings and quality of&#xD;
      the POC-US examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study without any intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study aiming to describe: How general practitioners use&#xD;
      POC-US in their daily practice, how POC-US influences the diagnostic process, and how POC-US&#xD;
      affects the treatment of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Use of POC-US will be explored through indication, frequency, time consumption,&#xD;
      modification, and findings in order to describe:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which organs the GPs scan, when using POC-US?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which tentative diagnoses entail the use of POC-US?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If GPs intend to rule-in/rule-out or explore, when using POC-US?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How often the GPs use POC-US?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How often are the GPs able to produce POC-US pictures of relevant structures?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How much time POC-US adds to the consultation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How often a difference in what the GP intends to scan and what POC-US is actually used&#xD;
           for occurs (modification of the performed POC-US)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How often POC-US leads to a specific finding?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influences of the diagnostic process will be explored through change in the tentative&#xD;
      diagnosis and change in the GP's confidence in the tentative diagnosis. The aim is to&#xD;
      describe:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If POC-US changes the patient's tentative diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If POC-US increases the GP's confidence in the tentative diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The relationship between the GP's expression of confidence and change in the number of&#xD;
           tentative diagnoses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The relationship between change from symptom diagnoses to disease diagnoses and the GP's&#xD;
           expression of confidence in the tentative diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The relationship between specific organs scanned and the GP's expression of confidence&#xD;
           in the tentative diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects on the treatment of patients will be explored through changes in the plan or&#xD;
      treatment for the patient. The aim is to describe:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If POC-US changes the GP's plan for the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If POC-US changes the treatment for the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The relationship between findings and change in the plan or treatment for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place in 20 different general practices in Denmark where the GPs use&#xD;
      POC-US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no intervention in this study since the GPs are already using POC-US in their&#xD;
      examination of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are around 75 GPs in Denmark, who use POC-US. Of those 20 GPs will be included in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that the GPs will use POC-US 2-3 times a day, and assuming a participation&#xD;
      rate of 80%, there will be 640-960 US scan during the study period of one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating GPs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GPs using POC-US will be recruited through the continuous medical educations small-groups&#xD;
      program, US networks, conferences, through teaching sessions, and through contacts via the&#xD;
      Danish general practice research units. Interested GPs will be asked to register and answer a&#xD;
      questionnaire including background information concerning demography,education and use of&#xD;
      ultrasound. The participating GPs will be selected randomly among these registrations after&#xD;
      considering in-and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each time the participating GP use POC-US, he/she will ask the patient for informed consent.&#xD;
      No restrictions are made regarding age or gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Base-line assessment of GPs&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GPs' technical skills will be evaluated at baseline using a standardized protocol&#xD;
      (OSAUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registration tool will be developed as a questionnaire to be used before and after the GP&#xD;
      uses POC-US in the consultation. The questionnaire will include a time log to ensure the&#xD;
      before and after registration. Several pilot tests will be performed both in the research&#xD;
      group and with GPs using POC-US in order to ensure comprehension, feasibility and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GPs will be asked to access a questionnaire in the online database SurveyXact each time&#xD;
      they use their ultrasound device during their daily work. The GPs can access the&#xD;
      questionnaire on their mobile phone, iPad or computer, using a unique link (respondent link)&#xD;
      allocated each participating GP. A key file, connecting each participating GP with the&#xD;
      respondent link in Surveyxact (link), will be safely stored at the Research Unit for General&#xD;
      Practice in Aalborg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GPs will give each patient a unique ID-number A Key file connecting this ID-number and&#xD;
      the patients CPR-number (Danish national social security number) will be safely stored at the&#xD;
      GP's clinic.&#xD;

      After the consultation, patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire about their&#xD;
      experience with POC-US in the consultation. (This questionnaire will be described in detail&#xD;
      in a separate protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GPs will be asked to save patient information on the included patients (Key file) in&#xD;
      order to identify the patient for an additional follow-up after six months (described in a&#xD;
      separate protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used. A prospective statistical analysis plan will be uploaded&#xD;
      to clinical trials before datacollection begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research ethics approval&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency and the Committee of Multipractice&#xD;
      Studies in General Practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the study is an observational study and does not include any intervention, approval by&#xD;
      the Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics have been exempted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol amendments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be declared and all editions and changes of the protocol will be saved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For further information a full protocol is uploaded to clinical trials.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2018</time_frame>
    <description>The GP's indication for using POC-US will be described through the frequencies of the GP's intention to rule-in/ rule-out or explore when using POC-US and through frequencies of the tentative diagnoses that entail the use of POC-US.&#xD;
POC-US frequency is calculated as the number of consultations with POC-US (numerator) relative to all GP face-to-face consultations (denominator) during the study period. The frequency of each POC-US examination (numerator) will be compared to all types of POC-US scans (denominator).&#xD;
The GPs will measure the time used for the POC-US examination. By the before and after registration of the organs intended to scan and the organ actually scanned, the extent of modification of POC-US to include e.g. opportunistic screening, can be estimated.&#xD;
The findings in POC-US are measured through the categorical variables: Certain positive findings, uncertain positive findings, certain negative findings, uncertain negative findings, and incidental findings.</description>

    <measure>How POC-US influences the diagnostic process</measure>
    <time_frame>2018</time_frame>
    <description>The GPs are asked to declare the tentative diagnoses as one main tentative diagnosis and other possible diagnoses before the use of POC-US. After the use of POC-US the GPs will be shown their &quot;Before-US&quot; tentative diagnoses and asked if these diagnoses have changed. If the diagnoses have changed, they will be asked to specify this.&#xD;
The tentative diagnoses are registered as ICPC-2 codes in the questionnaire. The GPs are asked to register any change in their confidence in the tentative diagnoses after the use of POC-US by choosing one of the following variables on an ordinal scale: Increased confidence, more confident, unchanged confidence, less confident, reduced confidence.&#xD;
To test the reliability of the GPs' declaration of confidence, we will examine if an increased confidence is correlated to specific organs scanned (Q2.2), a reduction in the total number of diagnoses (Q1.3, Q1.4, Q2.6 and Q2.7), or a change from symptom diagnosis to disease diagnosis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>How POC-US affects the treatment of the patients:</measure>
    <time_frame>2018</time_frame>
    <description>The GPs register their plan for the patient by choosing one or more of the following categorical variables before using POC-US: Acute admission to hospital, subacute referral to hospital, normal referral to hospital, subacute referral to specialist, normal referral to specialist, referral for radiology, other referral e.g. to physiotherapist, follow-up in the clinic, no plan for follow-up, other.&#xD;
After using POC-US the GP is shown the &quot;before POC-US plan for the patient&quot; and asked if this plan has changed. If the plan has changed, the GP is asked to specify.&#xD;
The GPs register their initiated treatment before POC-US by choosing one or more of the following categorical variables: Referral for treatment in the secondary sector, medication, other treatment, no treatment, other. After using POC-US the GP is shown the &quot;before POC-US planned treatment for the patient&quot; and asked if this planned treatment has changed. If the planned treatment has changed, the GP is asked to specify.</description>
