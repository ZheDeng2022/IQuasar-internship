    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the patient satisfaction with voiding assessment&#xD;
      remotely after removal of Foley catheter at home by the patient or her caregiver compared to&#xD;
      removal at the office by a healthcare provider in patients who have been diagnosed to have&#xD;
      voiding difficulty after pelvic reconstructive surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While in the hospital, all women who undergo surgery for pelvic organ prolapse and/or urinary&#xD;
      incontinence will have a voiding trial to evaluate whether their bladder is working as it&#xD;
      should. A voiding trial is when you are asked to urinate when you feel the desire to do so,&#xD;
      sometimes, a physician may fill your bladder with water prior to removing the Foley catheter.&#xD;
      This allows the physician to know exactly how much is left in your bladder. This evaluation&#xD;
      will occur in the recovery room for subjects who have a same-day procedure. Those who are&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital will have the voiding trial before their discharge typically on&#xD;
      postoperative day 1. Those who fail the voiding trial will be diagnosed with urinary&#xD;
      retention (bladder not working as well as we expect) and will be discharged home with a Foley&#xD;
      catheter. If you agree to participate you will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:&#xD;
      Subjects in the one group will remove their indwelling Foley catheter at home and will have a&#xD;
      voiding assessment done over the telephone based on their self-reported force of urinary&#xD;
      stream. The other group will follow up in the Uro/Gynecology office for Foley catheter&#xD;
      removal and voiding trial. Which group you are assigned to will be random. You have an equal&#xD;
      chance to be assigned to either group. It is important to note that outside of the study,&#xD;
      physicians choose to manage patients one of these two ways. Removal of the Foley catheter at&#xD;
      home is not experimental, and often done in these situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups of women will be given instructions on urinary catheter and bag (where the urine&#xD;
      drains into) management. Prior to discharge, every subject from the home removal group as&#xD;
      well as their significant other/caregiver/family member if applicable will receive a&#xD;
      standardized education session and written and illustrated instructions on Foley catheter&#xD;
      removal. This teaching will be done by an experienced and qualified nurse. You will be&#xD;
      provided with the syringe for catheter removal, urine collection pan, and a diary to record&#xD;
      their voiding quality and quantity. Both groups of women will have the catheter removal in 2&#xD;
      days. This will have to be delayed up to 4 days due to weekends if the procedure is performed&#xD;
      on a Thursday or Friday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the home removal group, you and your significant other/caregiver/family member will be&#xD;
      instructed to remove the Foley catheter at the pre-set date prior to 8 am. The research nurse&#xD;
      or Uro/Gynecology (uro/Gyn) office nurse will contact contact 4 hours after removal. Voiding&#xD;
      function will be evaluated by your self reported Force of Stream (FOS). This means the force&#xD;
      that urine is expelled from your body compared to normal. A report of FOS of at least 5 on a&#xD;
      0-10 has been shown to be a safe and effective method of assessing voiding function.&#xD;
      Additionally, volume of each void will be measured by you and reported to the research nurse&#xD;
      and/or the UroGyn office nurse. If there is evidence of voiding difficulty as indicated by a&#xD;
      FOS below 5/10, the research and/or UroGyn nurse will instruct you to follow up in the office&#xD;
      immediately for clean intermittent self-catheterization (CISC) teaching. This means inserting&#xD;
      a small, thin plastic tube in your urethra (opening of the body where urine is expelled). If&#xD;
      your voiding pattern qualifies as adequate, you will not require an office visit for voiding&#xD;
      assessment. However, you will be instructed to contact the office if you feel full after&#xD;
      voiding, are voiding less than 2 ounces or 50 mL each time and more often than every 30&#xD;
      minutes, or feel pressure and discomfort in their lower abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the other group will return to the office in 2-4 days and will undergo a voiding&#xD;
      trial via retrograde fill with 10 ounces (300 mL) of normal saline or until your bladder&#xD;
      capacity is reached. This means that a catheter will be inserted in your urethra and normal&#xD;
      saline will be put in your bladder via a large syringe that acts as a funnel. You would be&#xD;
      considered to have failed the voiding trial and be taught clean intermittent&#xD;
      self-catheterization if you do not void 5 ounces (150 mL) within an hour or you become too&#xD;
      uncomfortable with the bladder fullness, and your postvoid residual volume is greater than&#xD;
      150 mL. The residual volume is determined by a portable ultrasound like machine via an&#xD;
      external probe which is scanned over your lower pelvic area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the routine 2 - 4 week post-operative visit, both groups will receive a 5 question survey&#xD;
      asking about your experience with removal of the Foley catheter.&#xD;
