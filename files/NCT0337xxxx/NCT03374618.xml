  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSC) is a systemic disease characterized by limited or diffuse cutaneous&#xD;
      sclerosis, microangiopathy, overproduction of autoantibodies and variable organ damage due to&#xD;
      vasculopathy and/or fibrosis. The loss of self-tolerance is believed to be caused by the&#xD;
      dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immune systems and may involve reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species (ROS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neutrophils are potent producers of ROS and may play a role in endothelial cells and&#xD;
      fibrobasts dysfunction, as in autoantibodies generation. However, their role in SSC&#xD;
      pathogenesis remains to be determined. Recent studies discovered abnormal regulation of&#xD;
      neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in other auto-immune diseases such as systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus (SLE). NETs are web-like structures composed of chromatin backbones and&#xD;
      granular molecules. They are released by activated neutrophils through a process called&#xD;
      &quot;NETosis&quot;. Nets were first described in 2004 as a novel host defense mechanism to trap and&#xD;
      kill foreign pathogens. Recent evidence shows that NETs also participate in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesis that this phenomenon could be dysregulated in SSC as in SLE and could play a&#xD;
      prominent role in the induction of autoimmunity, as well as in the induction and perpetuation&#xD;
      of organ damages.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the role of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in&#xD;
      systemic sclerosis as well as to evaluate the correlation between NETs production and NETs&#xD;
      composition and the different complications and phenotypes observed in SSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 SSC patients, 30 SLE patients and 60 healthy subjects will be recruited. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected to obtain plasma, serum and polynuclear neutrophils by negative selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The main aim of the study is to evaluate the quantity of NETs induced by serum from SSc&#xD;
           patients on neutrophils from either healthy or SSC patients in vitro. The quantity of&#xD;
           NETs produced by different populations of neutrophils in contact with sera from SSC will&#xD;
           be compared with those produced by the same different populations of neutrophils in&#xD;
           contact with sera from SLE, and healthy subjects (two control populations).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Other objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the composition of the NETs produced by different populations of&#xD;
                neutrophils exposed to serum from SSC, SLE and healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To correlate the quantity and the composition of NETS with clinical phenotype in&#xD;
                SSc&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the role of serum cytokines in Nets production in SSC.&#xD;
