  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hearing is the ability to perceive sounds through the ear. If the transmission of sound is&#xD;
      defective, the person suffers some degree of hearing loss. Cochlear Implants (CI) provide&#xD;
      partial hearing by stimulating auditory nerve cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the functionality of the CI is facilitated by several analysis tools, such&#xD;
      as the clinical calibration software. This offers the possibility of measuring electrical&#xD;
      impedances in the cochlea. The electrical impedance is the opposition to the current flow&#xD;
      between two electrodes. It is composed of two main elements: resistance and reactance. The&#xD;
      impedances in a cochlear implant are not stable over time. The value is minimal immediately&#xD;
      after surgery, and increases progressively in the first 2 to 3 weeks after the procedure due&#xD;
      to the immune response of the organism against a foreign body and the trauma of the array&#xD;
      insertion. Several authors have suggested the use of topical or intravenous corticosteroids&#xD;
      to decrease intracochlear fibrosis. The use of Dexamethasone could have a protective effect&#xD;
      by reducing the initial inflammatory response, apoptosis, and delayed fibrosis, which could&#xD;
      impact the impedance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited evidence on the effect of intra-surgical topical corticosteroids on the&#xD;
      impedance of the cochlear implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the impact of topical dexamethasone on the&#xD;
      electrical impedance of the cochlear implant, with special attention to the analysis of the&#xD;
      capacitive component. It will be carried out through an experimental, prospective, randomized&#xD;
      and double-blind study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To determine whether the use of topical dexamethasone in a single dose applied in&#xD;
      the tympanic cavity (middle ear) during cochlear implant surgery modifies the capacitive&#xD;
      component of the electrical impedance of the electrodes in the cochlea before the activation&#xD;
      of the cochlear implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods A phase 3 clinical trial will be conducted. The design is a parallel,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled and double-blind experimental study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected impact The use of local dexamethasone during cochlear implant surgery would decrease&#xD;
      the inflammatory response, improving postoperative impedances.&#xD;

      Hypothesis The use of topical dexamethasone in a single dose applied to the tympanic cavity&#xD;
      during cochlear implant surgery modifies the capacitive component of the electrical impedance&#xD;
      of the electrodes in the cochlea during the first days of the postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      goals Primary objective To assess whether the use of topical dexamethasone in a single dose&#xD;
      applied to the tympanic cavity (middle ear) during cochlear implant surgery, prior to the&#xD;
      insertion of the electrode array in the cochlea modifies the capacitive component of the&#xD;
      electrical impedance of the cochlear implant. electrodes in the cochlea before activation of&#xD;
      the cochlear implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives To assess the safety and efficacy of the use of topical dexamethasone in&#xD;
      a single dose in the middle ear cavity during cochlear implant surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the capacitive component of the electrical impedance of the electrodes in the&#xD;
      cochlea on a daily basis, from the day of surgery until the day of switching on, in two&#xD;
      groups of patients: experimental and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods Design Phase 3 clinical trial design is an experimental parallel,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled, double blind assess the effect of the use of topical corticosteroids&#xD;
      on the electrical impedance of the electrodes in the cochlea after surgery will be performed&#xD;
      of cochlear implant surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients diagnosed with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss unilateral or&#xD;
      bilateral that its pathogenesis and pathophysiology are considered candidates for cochlear&#xD;
      implantation, will be evaluated as routine in our service, imaging, audiological and&#xD;
      psychological studies. Accomplished and accepted the nomination for the placement of one or&#xD;
      two cochlear implants will be offered the opportunity to participate in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be selected and those who accept the invitation to participate, the study will&#xD;
      be randomly divided into two groups, an experimental group and a placebo group. Randomization&#xD;
      was performed in balanced way with a 1: 1 ratio between the branches. The randomisation list&#xD;
      will be in blocks of variable size between 2 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will proceed as usual to the cochlear implant surgery, using the same anesthetic&#xD;
      technique, surgical approach and surgical procedure in any cochlear implant surgery.&#xD;
      Technique worldwide known and accepted as &quot;minimally traumatic cochlear implant surgery&quot; (see&#xD;
      section definitions below) is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two study groups are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Dexamethasone(DEX):topical administration of dexamethasone (20 mg / ml) in the eardrum&#xD;
      of the middle ear through the back tympanostomy, single dose during cochlear implant surgery,&#xD;
      prior to inserting the array of electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Placebo / Solution Physiological(SF):topical administration of isotonic sterile&#xD;
      physiological solution in the eardrum of the middle ear through the back tympanostomy,single&#xD;
      dose during cochlear implant surgery, prior to insertion of the array of electrodes .&#xD;
&#xD;
      After inserting the electrode array into the cochlea, proceed as usual measurements of the&#xD;
      electrical responses Intraoperative routine and supplemented with the closure and local&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the date of the surgical procedure and until the final activation of the implant&#xD;
      (usually 30 days), you will be asked the patient or family, you make two daily measurements&#xD;
      of the impedances of the electrodes, for which he was trained during the hospitalization the&#xD;
      day of surgery, the use of a simple software to be distributed for this purpose (CIDC -see&#xD;
      later-). The software installed on the computer from the patient can communicate through the&#xD;
      common communication interface Cochlear POD (used in clinical practice for starting and&#xD;
      calibration of the cochlear implant by the audiologist) and a speech processor Cochlear&#xD;
      Freedom (delivered consignment for the study) the implanted device (receiver-stimulator) in&#xD;
      patient surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this software data electrode impedance will be obtained twice a day, in different&#xD;
      configurations stimulation and measurement, and will be sent automatically via Internet to a&#xD;
      remote server managed by the authors of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative controls on floor and then not differ outpatient than usual for these&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blind:blind will be maintained for this study the researcher, the patient, evaluation of&#xD;
      results and analysts. The only not blind will be who prepares the medication from pharmacy.&#xD;
      Electrical impedance measurements are automatic and blind although objective measurements are&#xD;
      discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blind opening procedure:opening blind held immediately in the event of occurrence of an intra&#xD;
      or postoperative complication (eg intraoperative hemodynamic alteration, uncontrollable&#xD;
      bleeding, infection, fever, allergic reaction, wound dehiscence). Similarly, the blind will&#xD;
      be opened for the group of principal investigators, always after completing the stage of&#xD;
      implementation of the protocol in patients in question, and each not less than 2 months and&#xD;
      the sole purpose of making a partial analysis the results that may involve changing the&#xD;
      acquisition parameters of samples for a better interpretation of the results and to fulfill&#xD;
      the main objective stipulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place work Patients will be evaluated at the Department of Otolaryngology, Hospital Italiano&#xD;
      de Buenos Aires as usual in this type of evaluation. Surgery is carried out in the central&#xD;
      operating room of the hospital by any of the three surgeons otologists privileges for these&#xD;
      procedures and not differ from the usual surgical technique for cochlear implantation. THe&#xD;
      postsurgical controls will be performed in the same service by the same professionals.&#xD;
      Measurements of proposals impedances are performed for the oun paciente or his parents, using&#xD;
      the same technique and the same equipment used by Audiologists in visits calibration cochlear&#xD;
      implants, with help of software designed by researchers specifically for this purpose. The&#xD;
      data will be transferred remotely through a security protocol to a fund administered by the&#xD;
      principal investigators (cloud) server. Further analysis of the data, evaluation of the&#xD;
      results and conclusions of the work will be performed by the principal investigators of this&#xD;
      protocol in the field of Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population All cochlear implant candidates who meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion&#xD;
      criteria patients and to accept participation in the protocol will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: If a patient is candidate for bilateral cochlear implant or for the duration of the&#xD;
      study is candidate for reimplantation each ear will be considered separately. In this case&#xD;
      each ear will be randomized separately following the same procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions Gusher:outpour of perilinfa before the surgical opening of the inner ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimally traumatic cochlear implant surgery:surgical procedure for placing an electronic&#xD;
      implantable device to partially restore hearing function in patients diagnosed with severe&#xD;
      sensorineural hearing loss to profound unilateral or bilateral that do not respond to other&#xD;
      forms of hearing rehabilitation and meet medical, audiological, radiological and&#xD;
      psychological criteria for cochlear implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimally traumatic surgical technique consisting placing the receiver-stimulator implant&#xD;
      beneath the skin on the temporo-parietal region and an array of electrodes that must be&#xD;
      positioned in the scala tympani of the cochlea, not generating any damage to structures level&#xD;
      the outer and middle ear (tympanic membrane, middle ear bones) as well as minimum damage to&#xD;
      the delicate microstructures inner ear, avoiding maneuvers abrupt opening of the inner ear,&#xD;
      suction labyrinthine liquid inlet bone powder or blood the cochlea, and allowing the&#xD;
      introduction of the electrode array into the cochlea very slowly, in the direction with&#xD;
      better orientation and parallel basal turn the scala tympani.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, the procedure is performed under general anesthesia through a small incision,&#xD;
      extending from the tip of the mastoid to temporo-parietal region. It said incision includes&#xD;
      the skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle and periosteum in the same line. A small&#xD;
      postero-superior subperiosteal pocket where it will be hosted the receiver-stimulator implant&#xD;
      is then generated; for which bone cutter in a small bowl of about 2 cm in diameter. Then a&#xD;
      simple mastoidectomy is performed, exposing and preserving the anvil and the approach is&#xD;
      completed with a posterior tympanotomy or approach to facial recess under monitoring of the&#xD;
      facial nerve and preserving the structure. Ideally it identifies and preserves cord tympani&#xD;
      nerve (anterior posterior limit of the tympanostomy). Through the latter the tympanic box is&#xD;
      displayed and the round window niche (anatomical repair in relation to the scala tympani of&#xD;
      the cochlea) is identified. Careful hemostasis is performed and the mucosa of the margins of&#xD;
      the round window DeCola. Usually at this point is necessary and milling at low speed gently&#xD;
      and above upper lip of said recess to allow better visualization of the round window membrane&#xD;
      (eardrum side). At this point,is necessary for a thorough washing of entire surgical area in&#xD;
      order to clear debris or blood bone powder. Then isotonic saline (SF group) or dexamethasone&#xD;
      (DEX group) in the tympanic cavity through the posterior tympanotomy, taking special care to&#xD;
      the round window membrane is completely submerged in the liquid instill. The implantable&#xD;
      device (cochlear implant) is then placed and secured by a suture. At this time it will&#xD;
      proceed to the delicate opening of the membranous labyrinth, either through the round window&#xD;
      itself, through a small anterior and lower extension thereof or through a cochleostomy&#xD;
      (anterior and inferior bone milling margins the round window), performing the endosteal and&#xD;
      carefully opening the membranous labyrinth, with special emphasis on not allow entry of bone&#xD;
      dust or blood, as well as preventing aspiration of labyrinthine fluid (perilymph). It shall&#xD;
      then be slow and progressive introduction of the array of electrodes, with the technique&#xD;
      described by the manufacturer as the electrode toused, CI512, CI522 and CI532, progressing&#xD;
      the array in the right direction (tangential to the direction of the scala tympani at level&#xD;
      of the basal turn of the cochlea) until the entire array of electrodes is positioned within&#xD;
      the cochlea. To be completed by sealing the edges of the round window with a small piece of&#xD;
      muscle, bone powder level back tympanostomy and finally rearranged the remaining wires in the&#xD;
      mastoid cavity, avoiding excessive mobilization, fixing them with a piece of gel foam inside&#xD;
      it. The layered closure, periosteum, muscle-fatty cellular and skin absorbable suture is&#xD;
      completed. A local flat cure furacinada gauze and a bandage is made. He shall carry out the&#xD;
      routine tests and neural response telemetry. End of the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Patients admitted with diagnosis of severe sensorineural hearing loss or&#xD;
      profound unilateral or bilateral that are evaluated and meet the criteria for candidacy for&#xD;
      cochlear implant and comply turn all the inclusion criteria and none of exclusion, will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accepted this, a randomized double blind study where the pharmacy is responsible for&#xD;
      randomizing treatment among participants proposed subjects. Each of these activities will be&#xD;
      properly recorded in writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then they are subjected to usual for placement cochlear implant according the technique of&#xD;
      minimally traumatic cochlear implant surgery and used worldwide spread surgery. Reached the&#xD;
      operating time in which the round window is displayed (reference anatomical structure of the&#xD;
      inner ear and where (or margins) cochlear implant is usually introduced) will proceed as&#xD;
      follows, identical in both groups Experimental (DEX) topical dexamethasone (Decadron shock&#xD;
      are placed® laboratory Sidus)in concentration of 20mg / ml in single dose in the eardrum of&#xD;
      the middle ear through posterior tympanostomy during cochlear implant surgery, taking special&#xD;
      care that the membrane round window is completely submerged in the liquid, prior to insertion&#xD;
      of the array of electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo group (SF):&#xD;
&#xD;
      physiologic solution is placed isotonic sterile single dose in the eardrum of the middle ear&#xD;
      through posterior tympanostomy during cochlear implant surgery, taking special care that the&#xD;
      membrane of the round window is completely submerged in the liquid, prior to insertion of the&#xD;
      array of electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacy Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires will be responsible for providing the drug and&#xD;
      placebo. It handle it, receiving, contabilizándola, storing and delivering relieving against&#xD;
      medical prescription. It will ensure that it is used solely for the purposes of the study.&#xD;
      Each of the activities will be recorded in writing. Pharmacy Hospital Italiano de Buenos&#xD;
      Aires (HIBA) is the only non blind study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgical procedure, the patient remain hospitalized 24 hours as usual in this type&#xD;
      of procedure. Finally cures and weekly inspections shall be made during the first month until&#xD;
      activation of the implantable device and continue audiological rehabilitation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the day of surgery including, until day programmed for activating the implant, all&#xD;
      patients enrolled the study (2 intervening groups) made identically and by themselves or by&#xD;
      the help of a relative or guardian, measurements daily (morning and evening) of the&#xD;
      impedances of the electrodes of the implant with the CIDC software (available free the day of&#xD;
      surgery) and the communication interface POD through a speech processor Cochlear Freedom&#xD;
      delivered on consignment during tests for such end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of the measurements of each patient will be sent automatically and as soon as&#xD;
      become available internet connection, from the patient's own computer to a remote server&#xD;
      (cloud) administered by researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study ends on the final activation of cochlear implant (approximately 30 days after&#xD;
      surgery), at which the implant is permanently connected by the audiologist to your speech&#xD;
      processor and the items delivered on consignment for the study will be returned (POD&#xD;
      communication interface and speech processor Cochlear Freedom).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling and sample calculation All patients who meet the inclusion criteria and no exclusion&#xD;
      to participate in the study and these will be distributed in a randomized into one of two&#xD;
      treatment arms will be invited. Monitoring each patient shall be performed within 30 days; it&#xD;
      coincides with the usual postoperative controls first week and first postoperative month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cochlea with fibrosis exhibit electrical impedance at about 20 KQ compared to a normal&#xD;
      cochlea at the day of implant activation (approximately 30 days) 7 KQ with a common standard&#xD;
      deviation of 1,481KΩ. To test the null hypothesis that the impedance is equal in patients who&#xD;
      were administered steroids and those not were applied, with a power of 80% and an alpha of 5%&#xD;
      to test two tailed required 10 patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the sample size reached 4980 capacitance values are obtained per patient (20 patients,&#xD;
      with 22 electrodes each evaluated in four sequences impedances, with two daily measurements&#xD;
      for 30 days). This sample size achieved in 10 patients per group is sufficient for the&#xD;
      purpose of describing the behavior of the capacitive impedance component with and without&#xD;
      corticosteroid over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample calculation was performed using STATA 14.0 software and Power and Precision&#xD;
      version 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation of the clinical&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol is conducted in two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: Validation &quot;in silico&quot; software to measure impedances. In order to obtain the&#xD;
      samples needed to analyze and meet the objectives in this protocol, it is required perform in&#xD;
      the patient impedances measurements through the implanted recent device. This is done&#xD;
      conventionally in the clinic, by transient connecting a measuring coil which is coupled to&#xD;
      implantable device, and through communication interface is integrated to a computer (in the&#xD;
      same way that the audiologist makes calibrations sessions on and calibration). By suitable&#xD;
      software, measurements can be obtained. However, given the cumbersome and likely poor&#xD;
      adhesion to it if you consider that the patient must attend twice a day to treating facility&#xD;
      during the first postoperative to make the necessary measurements month, the group of leading&#xD;
      researchers this protocol devised and developed their own software that allows a safe,&#xD;
      outpatient basis, and the patient's home, taking measurements by himself. In turn, the&#xD;
      software in question should allow to measure with the stipulated parameters and the set&#xD;
      sequences. The software, called &quot;Cochlear Implant Data Collector (CIDC)&quot; was developed&#xD;
      specifically for the realization of this work (and possibly future) and validated by the&#xD;
      authors. It is intended to be distributed for free, and installed on the computer from the&#xD;
      patient to make measurements. Details thereof, its operation, validation and security are&#xD;
      further described in Annex 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Patient inclusion. Surgery. Impedance measurement Inclusion of patients:Patients who&#xD;
      are candidates for cochlear implantation unilateral or bilateral and that meet the selection&#xD;
      criteria (see inclusion / exclusion). They explained the protocol and will be asked sign&#xD;
      informed consent. It will notify the Hospital Italiano central pharmacy to incorporate the&#xD;
      patient randomization and drug preparation / matching placebo for the day of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure will proceed to the cochlear implant surgery according the conventionally&#xD;
      accepted worldwide and known as classic description minimally traumatic cochlear implant&#xD;
      surgery (see definitions section). As soon as the access to the tympanic cavity is achieved&#xD;
      through the posterior tympanostomy and have identified the round window, proceed according&#xD;
      the group randomized to placement or otherwise of the corresponding substance, instilling it&#xD;
      directly through the posterior tympanotomy, to completely fill the tympanic cavity, taking&#xD;
      special care that the secondary eardrum round window is immersed therein. Then continue with&#xD;
      the milling of the bowl to the receiver-stimulator, a cochlear implant is placed in the bed,&#xD;
      and slowly and continuously inserting the array of electrodes, either round window round&#xD;
      window extended or cochleostomy in ramp will tympanic, according surgeon preference and&#xD;
      judgment to meet the primary objective of minimally invasive approach controlling the&#xD;
      insertion time in seconds. Finally closing the surgery is completed until completion. It&#xD;
      shall then be measuring impedances and neural response as is customary in this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements using Software &quot;Cochlear Implant Data Collector&quot;:out to bring the proposed&#xD;
      objective of this study analysis was designed and validated &quot;CIDC&quot; software (see Appendix 3),&#xD;
      whereby the patient perform every 12 hs about measurements of the impedances of the&#xD;
      electrodes in the sequence routine and established for this purpose in the software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequences stimulation and measurement are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence1:this sequence involves the monopolar stimulation of each of the 22 intracochlear&#xD;
      electrodes as cathode, with the two extracochlear electrodes reference: &quot;Monopolar 1 + 2&quot;&#xD;
      (MP1 + 2) Mode (anode). During each stimulation was recorded by measuring the voltage&#xD;
      obtained from the same electrode stimulated and reference electrodes in the 14 available time&#xD;
      slots by the chipset cic4 implant. Thus 308 samples will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence2:Mode &quot;common ground&quot; (CG): this sequence involves stimulation of each of the&#xD;
      individual electrodes 22 as cathode, with reference (anode) to the rest of the array of&#xD;
      electrodes. During each stimulation was recorded by measuring the voltage obtained between&#xD;
      the same electrode and the remaining stimulated intracochlear electrodes in the 14 available&#xD;
      time slots by the chipset cic4 implant. Thus 308 samples will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence3:Mode &quot;3 points&quot; (3P): intracochlear electrodes will be stimulated sequentially from&#xD;
      1 to 20 inclusive using the following logic: cathode electrode = 'n'; anode electrode = 'n +&#xD;
      2'. Voltage between electrodes nn + 1 is recorded simultaneously at the 14 available time&#xD;
      slots by the chipset cic4 implant. Thus 280 samples will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence4:Mode &quot;4 points&quot; (4P): intracochlear electrodes stimulate sequentially 1 to 19&#xD;
      inclusive using the following logic: cathode electrode = 'n'; anode electrode = 'n + 3'. The&#xD;
      voltage between electrodes n + 1 and n + 2 in the 14 available time slots by the chipset&#xD;
      implant cic4 be recorded simultaneously. Thus 266 samples will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each sequence described above is used as stimulation parameters constant the following&#xD;
      values:&#xD;
&#xD;
      current level: 80 units of current (corresponding the data sheet chipset cic4 to 74.21 uA)&#xD;
      Time between phases: 8 mS Period: 333.4 mS Pulse width : two sequences, 25 and 50 mS&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the sequences described above are made using two different pulse widths predetermined&#xD;
      stimulation 25 and 50 mS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To make these measurements, the company Cochlear LTD or his representative in the country&#xD;
      (Tecnosalud SA) provided no cost, a Freedom ™ and an interface POD to connect to computer&#xD;
      from the patient, where it install the software processor with a single executable&#xD;
      distributed the day of surgery in a pendrive with the appropriate language (Spanish, English,&#xD;
      German, Portuguese). All devices will be provided on loan for development work and will be&#xD;
      returned to medical team on the day,date on which end data by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measured by the software and the context information values (especially the parameters&#xD;
      used for each individual measurement and time) are stored in a local database. From the time&#xD;
      the application performs periodic attempts to export the data to a database located on a&#xD;
      server in the cloud. This database is capable of centralizing measurements unlimited&#xD;
      patients. The server is managed and maintained by the principal investigators of this&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The analysis will be performed by protocol and by intention to treat.&#xD;
      The analysis unit be each patient into one of two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis of quantitative variables with mean and standard deviation or median and&#xD;
      interquartile range as observed distribution is expressed. Categorical variables are&#xD;
      expressed in proportion to confidence interval for the ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of corticosteroid (dexamethasone) on the variable impedance and capacitance&#xD;
      results with generalized equation estimated (GEE) measured. The natural grouping of the&#xD;
      individual measurements and the times (panel data) are considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 14.0 software. They are considered&#xD;
      statistically significant lower probability to 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical management and neglect each patient autonomy be respected to discontinue treatment&#xD;
      at any time by communicating to researchers.If the medical staff, researchers or the patient&#xD;
      believe that the individual is at risk because the trial, the same will be withdrawn from the&#xD;
      study and will explain the reasons why that decision is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events Adverse events were collected for each control and each time the patient&#xD;
      contact the investigator. They are classified according the scale described by Dindo&#xD;
      complications and Clavien in 2004 [24,25].Complications are described as deviations from&#xD;
      normal postoperative, not including the consequences inherent the procedure itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications grades are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 0: no complications Grade I: Any deviation from the normal postoperative course that&#xD;
      does not require pharmacological, surgical or endoscopic treatment and does not require&#xD;
      radiological interventions. It included in this level using antinauseants, antipyretics,&#xD;
      analgesics, diuretics, electrolytes and physiotherapy, as well as drainage of wound&#xD;
      infections &quot;bedside&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade II: Requires pharmacological treatment with drugs not included in the grade, including&#xD;
      transfusions and parenteral nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade III: require surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIa:without general IIIb: anesthesia:general anesthesia Grade IV: life-threatening&#xD;
      complication requiring handling unit closed. IVa: Dysfunction of a single body IVb:&#xD;
      multiorgan dysfunction Grade V: patient death Damage or complications While complications or&#xD;
      damage caused by single topical application of dexamethasone on the round window in single&#xD;
      dose during surgery cochlear implant or performing in routine and systematic measurements of&#xD;
      the impedances of the electrodes with the proposals and designed in the CIDC software as well&#xD;
      as the procedure carried out for measuring them is estimated at zero or extremely rare&#xD;
      sequences, the costs of any complications or damages related to procedures or treatments of&#xD;
      the study will be funded by the Department of Otolaryngology, Hospital Italiano de Buenos&#xD;
      Aires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations This protocol is drawn and carried in accordance with current national&#xD;
      and international standards: Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical Association,&#xD;
      Disposition ANMAT 6770/10 and the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice ICH E6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial protocol, the patient information and informed consent forms will be submitted to&#xD;
      evaluation committee of research projects Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires (HIBA) (CEPI) for&#xD;
      possible approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cases, the participation of the study is voluntary and certified by the process of&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The right to opt be respected at all times in the studio without implying in any way any&#xD;
      discrimination, differential treatment or abuse without mediate any implication in the&#xD;
      treatment of the patient's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient wishing leave the research protocol will be automatically removed from the&#xD;
      protocol and not considered for the interpretation of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic evaluation, surgical procedure, as well as the type, make and model of implantable&#xD;
      device used not differ in any way or manner to what is practiced or used routinely in our&#xD;
      institution regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collected will be treated confidentially and anonymously. Only authorized personnel&#xD;
      can access records of study according to the current legal regulation: National Personal&#xD;
      Information Protection Law No. 25,326 (Law of Habeas Data).&#xD;
