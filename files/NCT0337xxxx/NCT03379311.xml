             calculated from all daily ACS questionnaires completed during the screening period&#xD;
             (minimum of 14 daily ACS questionnaires must be completed). Total ACS score is the sum&#xD;
             of itching, light sensitivity, eye pain, foreign body sensation, and watering symptom&#xD;
             scores (and excludes atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and allergic rhinitis&#xD;
             scores).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of topical corticosteroid and/or systemic corticosteroid use for the treatment&#xD;
             of allergic conjunctivitis (AKC, VKC, or PAC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Stable dose(s) of allowed AKC, VKC, or PAC medication(s) during the 14 days prior to&#xD;
             Day 1; and commitment to remaining on the same dose(s) of AKC, VKC, or PAC&#xD;
             medication(s) for the entire duration of study participation (unless dose modification&#xD;
             is due to unforeseen medical necessity) per Section 8.1 and Section 8.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing and able to comply with the study procedures and visit schedule, including&#xD;
             follow-up visits&#xD;

          7. Negative Screening ova and parasite test&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female patients must be either post-menopausal for at least 1 year with FSH level &gt;40&#xD;
             mIU/mL at Screening or surgically sterile (tubal ligation, hysterectomy or bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy) for at least 3 months, or if of child-bearing potential, have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test and agree to use dual methods of contraception, or abstain from sexual&#xD;
             activity from Screening until the end of the study, or for 120 days following the last&#xD;
             dose of study drug, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly&#xD;
        effective method of contraception from Screening until the end of the study or for 120 days&#xD;
        following the last dose of study drug, whichever is longer. All fertile men with female&#xD;
        partners of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact the Investigator&#xD;

             *Topical corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis, corticosteroid nasal sprays for&#xD;
             rhinitis, and inhaled corticosteroids for allergic asthma are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Vaccination with live attenuated vaccines within 30 days prior to initiation of&#xD;
             treatment in the study, during the treatment period, or vaccination expected within 5&#xD;
