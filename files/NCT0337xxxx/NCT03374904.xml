  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to implement a Video Feedback (VF) intervention to enhance&#xD;
      Parental Reflective Function in primary caregivers of inpatient psychiatric children. Because&#xD;
      there is no published research using VF with parents of children with severe psychopathology&#xD;
      and in hospitalized context, this study is a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will include a qualitative and quantitative study; it will take place in a&#xD;
      public hospital in Valparaíso, Chile. In the qualitative study, participants will be six&#xD;
      primary caregivers who received the intervention and three stakeholders from Child Unit. For&#xD;
      caregivers a semi-structured interview will be applied to know subjective experience gained&#xD;
      by intervention regarding the perceived satisfaction. For health professional also a&#xD;
      semi-structured interview will be applied to collect information pertinent to the feasibility&#xD;
      of performing such intervention. The information obtained from the interviews will be&#xD;
      analyzed with Grounded Theory model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative study will be conducted amongst all tutors of children aged between 6 and 14&#xD;
      hospitalized in a child psychiatry ward between August 2017 and December 2018. The expected&#xD;
      sample size is 30 subjects in total; 10 for the control group and 20 for the experimental&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A four module of Video Intervention Therapy (VIT) was designed, each module includes a (video&#xD;
      recorded) play session and a group VF session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the caregivers at the beginning of the intervention will include a&#xD;
      psychosocial questionnaire, GHQ-12 , Five Minutes Speech Sample (FMSS) where RF will be&#xD;
      codified, Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnosis - Structure Questionnaire (OPD.SQ). The&#xD;
      Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire will be applied to children, in addition to the&#xD;
      Children Global Assessment Scale, (CGAS). After every VF session a new FMSS, GHQ-12 and CGAS&#xD;
      will be made. A follow-up will be performed three months after the beginning of the&#xD;
      intervention with FMSS, GHQ-12 for caregivers and SDQ and CGAS for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine Effect Size and Intra Class Correlation, the results will be analyzed using a&#xD;
      multiple linear regression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the challenges when a child is hospitalized is working with the family, there is an&#xD;
      enormous evidence relating family factors with onset of psychopathology and pour outcomes in&#xD;
      children. Usually treatment includes parental support or family therapy, but most parents&#xD;
      attend to few sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mentalization is defined as the capacity to understand and interpret one's own behavior and&#xD;
      those of others as an expression of mental states, such as feelings, thoughts, fantasies,&#xD;
      beliefs and desires. Reflective function (RF) is the operational definition of mentalization.&#xD;
      Parental mentalizing is considered to have important implications for the development of&#xD;
      self-regulation in Children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video assisted therapy has demonstrated to be a powerful tool in promoting change in&#xD;
      parent-child relationships with few sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess a short program aimed at improving Parental Reflective Function (PRF) during the&#xD;
      hospitalization of children and early adolescents admitted to a psychiatric unit, a&#xD;
      randomized pilot psychotherapeutic intervention using video feedback has been designed as a&#xD;
      clinical trial. There is ample evidence of the usefulness of video feedback to increase&#xD;
      sensitivity and PRF in children up to 5 years, but in older children the evidence is limited.&#xD;
      There are no known published randomized clinical trials using video feedback in parents of&#xD;
      children admitted for psychiatric reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A VF therapy like this will allow implementing a short and economic intervention, which has&#xD;
      been used in older children and in parents with mental health problems, as is expected in&#xD;
      parents of inpatient psychiatric children. This research also will contribute to explore how&#xD;
      PRF relates to children psychopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a psychotherapeutic intervention using&#xD;
           video feedback in order to improve the PRF in primary caregivers of children and&#xD;
           adolescents hospitalized in public inpatient unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To provide data to estimate the parameters required to design a definitive Randomized&#xD;
           Control Trial with a psychotherapeutic intervention using VF in order to improve the PRF&#xD;
           in primary caregivers of children and adolescents hospitalized in public inpatient unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method This project was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Valparaíso-San Antonio Health&#xD;
      Service The research has the support of the head of the Child Psychiatry Unit and the&#xD;
      Director of the Psychiatric Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants The research will take place in a public child/adolescent psychiatry ward in&#xD;
      Valparaíso in &quot;Hospital Psiquiátrico del Salvador&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the qualitative study, participants will be a minimum of six primary caregivers of&#xD;
      children hospitalized in a psychiatric ward receiving intervention between the ages of 6 and&#xD;
      14, as well as three key players (a therapist, a nurse and chief psychiatrist of the Special&#xD;
      Care Unit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative study will be conducted amongst all tutors of children hospitalized in a&#xD;
      child psychiatry ward between August 2017 and December 2018. The sample will be all parents&#xD;
      and/or caregivers that meet the inclusion criteria and wish to participate. The expected&#xD;
      sample size is 30 subjects in total; 10 for the control group and 20 for the experimental&#xD;
      group. If by December 2018 the total sample has not been met, more subjects will be recruited&#xD;
      in order to achieve the sample size. A clinical essay having 30 subjects has been proposed&#xD;
      because an intervention of these characteristics has not been performed in Chile; so the&#xD;
      impact of the effect must first be estimated in order to assess the feasibility for a future&#xD;
      multi-centric clinical trail. This is the reason behind piloting the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative study. Two semi-structured interview scripts will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One script aims to gain full grasp of the subjective experience gained by intervention&#xD;
           participants regarding the perceived workshop satisfaction and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second script will be aimed at key institutional information holders, aiming to&#xD;
           collect information pertinent to the feasibility of performing such an intervention.&#xD;
           Questions will focus on analyzing the necessary resources needed and impact the workshop&#xD;
           may have in the functioning of the child psychiatric ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews will be performed by physicians undergoing a psychiatrist specialization&#xD;
      and/or a psychologist who is not participating in the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the onset of hospitalization, all caregivers meeting inclusion criteria must provide an&#xD;
      informed consent form in order to participate in the study. Children must provide an informed&#xD;
      approval after caregivers have provided their consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All caregivers that participate in the study will receive an array of instruments upon&#xD;
      entering, subsequently randomized between the control groups and those intervened. If any&#xD;
      mental health problem is detected in caregivers it will be made a referral for her or him to&#xD;
      get special support according to the problem detected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups of caregivers along with their child receive the same regular care and treatments&#xD;
      they would normally receive from a inpatient unit. Since both groups will be subject to a&#xD;
      larger intervention, the aim of a future randomized control trial will be to objectify how&#xD;
      much VF boosts the improvement of PRF during a child's psychiatric hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Interventions will be performed by the principal investigator and by a child&#xD;
      clinical psychologist, both trained and supervised in Video Intervention Therapy (VIT). VIT&#xD;
      is a technique for performing Video Feedback where behavior-oriented interventions and&#xD;
      representational therapy elements are used. This provides a six-step video analysis&#xD;
      framework. The video may be filmed at different settings, the only requirement being a visual&#xD;
      interaction of the child with his parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A four module intervention was designed for this study, each module includes a play session&#xD;
      and a VF session. The play session has a workshop format, it has a duration of 45 to 60&#xD;
      minutes, where the caregiver(s) plays freely with the child. During the play session, a five&#xD;
      to ten minute video sessions of the dyads will be made. The therapeutic team will then pick&#xD;
      approximately 1 minute long excerpts to display in the VF sessions. The VF sessions will&#xD;
      occur during the same week and these could be group sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Study The information obtained from the interviews will be analyzed with Grounded&#xD;
      Theory model, obtained open codify data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis the ATLAS.TI Software will be used, enabling managing and processing text&#xD;
      data groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A descriptive statistic will be performed to compare the control group and the&#xD;
           intervened group regarding clinical and sociodemographic variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. It will be also presenting descriptive statistic on eligibility rate, recruitment rate,&#xD;
           and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine Effect Size and Intra Class Correlation results will be analyzed using a&#xD;
           multiple linear regression, multi level model with randomized and fixed interception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data will be analyzed using STATA 14.&#xD;
