  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, basic research conducted in adults has revealed that fear extinction, or the&#xD;
      weakening of a learned fear response, may be best explained by principles of &quot;inhibitory&#xD;
      learning.&quot; New guidelines for the clinical practice of exposure therapy for anxiety disorders&#xD;
      have arisen from research on inhibitory learning, but these guidelines have not yet been&#xD;
      empirically tested in youth with anxiety disorders. The overall goal of this research is to&#xD;
      investigate the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of conducting exposure therapy for&#xD;
      anxiety disorders in youth according to clinical guidelines developed from basic research on&#xD;
      inhibitory learning principles, using a pilot randomized controlled trial design.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exposure therapy-which involves repeatedly exposing individuals to feared situations to&#xD;
      change their fear responses to and beliefs about those situations--has been a mainstay of&#xD;
      treatments for anxiety disorders since it was developed in the 1950s. Today, exposure therapy&#xD;
      is the most commonly-occurring treatment technique included in well-supported treatments for&#xD;
      anxiety disorders, and meta-analyses have indicated that exposure is more strongly associated&#xD;
      with treatment gains in anxious youth compared to non-behavioral interventions. Despite its&#xD;
      effectiveness, approximately 40% of anxious youth fail to achieve clinically significant&#xD;
      benefit from exposure therapy. This indicates that further research is needed regarding&#xD;
      strategies for optimizing exposure therapy so that it is effective for a greater proportion&#xD;
      of youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is clearly a need to optimize exposure therapy for youth, but at the same time very&#xD;
      little empirical data exists regarding how exposure works or the best way to conduct&#xD;
      exposures. Common wisdom about exposure, based on emotional processing theory, dictates that&#xD;
      exposure works by breaking and eliminating conditioned fear responses through a process&#xD;
      called habituation. This viewpoint dictates that exposure should be conducted until&#xD;
      habituation occurs (i.e., until a physiological fear response reduces by at least 50%), and&#xD;
      that habituation both during and between exposure sessions is necessary for improvement. As&#xD;
      exposure therapy has evolved, other common practices have emerged that lack clear evidence&#xD;
      supporting their efficacy. For example, it is common clinical practice to encourage youth to&#xD;
      challenge their thoughts about a feared situation before and during an exposure (i.e.,&#xD;
      cognitive restructuring), even though clear evidence does not exist to support this practice.&#xD;
      Additionally, it is common for clinicians to create a &quot;fear ladder&quot; or &quot;hierarchy&quot; with&#xD;
      patients before beginning exposures. This hierarchy typically takes the form of a&#xD;
      rank-ordered list of exposures or feared stimuli from least to most difficult, and clinicians&#xD;
      move up this list systematically from the easiest to most difficult items during treatment.&#xD;
      Again, there is little clear evidence to support this practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recent research on fear extinction indicates that exposure therapy does not cause threat&#xD;
      associations to disappear but rather leads to the formation of non-threat (i.e., inhibitory)&#xD;
      associations that compete with and weaken older threat associations. The goal of exposure&#xD;
      therapy, according to this model, is to strengthen these non-threat associations and weaken&#xD;
      threat associations. Research on inhibitory learning has turned many of the long-standing&#xD;
      exposure practices discussed in the previous paragraph on their head by providing new&#xD;
      guidelines for optimizing exposure therapy. Many of these new guidelines differ significantly&#xD;
      from common clinical practices and are designed to maximize learning of inhibitory&#xD;
      associations. These guidelines are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Design exposures that maximally violate a patient's expectations about how bad an&#xD;
           outcome would be or how often it will occur. In clinical practice, an exposure that&#xD;
           maximally violates expectancies is one that is terminated not when fear habituates or&#xD;
           reduces by a certain amount (e.g., &quot;What is your fear rating?&quot;) but rather when the&#xD;
           patient's expectancy of a bad outcome is significantly reduced. (e.g., &quot;What do you&#xD;
           think the chances are that X will happen?).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do not instruct patients to change their thinking about a feared situation before or&#xD;
           during and exposure. The principle of maximum violation of expectancies dictates that&#xD;
           participants should not be encouraged to use cognitive reappraisal (e.g., strategies for&#xD;
           thinking more realistically or accurately) during an exposure, as such strategies reduce&#xD;
           the expectation that a negative outcome will occur and thus prevent maximum violation of&#xD;
           expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Introduce variability of stimuli into exposure tasks by moving up and down a fear ladder&#xD;
           randomly. Inhibitory learning theory suggests that clinicians should frequently vary the&#xD;
           difficulty of exposure to stimuli to create a consistently high level of emotion, which&#xD;
           has been associated with superior extinction learning. This guideline means that,&#xD;
           instead of moving up a fear hierarchy or ladder in a systematic way from least to most&#xD;
           difficult over time, and moving on to more difficult items after habituation to easier&#xD;
           ones has occurred, clinicians should design exposures that will allow patients to&#xD;
           achieve variable but generally high levels of fear or anxiety over the full course of an&#xD;
           exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators plan to test these clinical practice guidelines derived from&#xD;
      inhibitory learning against standard exposure practice. A few studies have empirically tested&#xD;
      these and/or other clinical practice guidelines established based on inhibitory learning in&#xD;
      clinical adult samples. However, no known studies have yet empirically tested the efficacy of&#xD;
      an inhibitory learning approach to exposure therapy in youth with anxiety or other emotional&#xD;
      disorders, nor have any known studies tested the acceptability or feasibility of such an&#xD;
      approach. Therefore, in this study the investigators propose to conduct a small-scale, pilot&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the feasibility, acceptability, and relative&#xD;
      efficacy of applying an inhibitory learning approach to exposure in youth. Up to 20 youth&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of two groups-standard exposure (SE) or exposure conducting&#xD;
      according to inhibitory learning principles (E + IL). Given the small n for this study, the&#xD;
      primary goal will be to assess feasibility and acceptability of an inhibitory learning&#xD;
      approach to exposure, while establishing the efficacy of this approach relative to SE is&#xD;
      exploratory. This study, along with planned larger-scale RCTs to follow, will help to inform&#xD;
      clinical care guidelines for best practice of exposure therapy with anxious youth.&#xD;
