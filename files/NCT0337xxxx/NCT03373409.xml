  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy male and female volunteers without asthma will be recruited to enroll in a single&#xD;
      dose 3-way crossover study of the safety and pharmacokinetics of albuterol when administered&#xD;
      using the Halix (TM) albuterol unit dose disposable dry powder inhaler (DPI) and the&#xD;
      albuterol HFA (hydrofluoroalkane) MDI inhaler.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to compare the safety of albuterol in a dry powder inhaler (DPI) and&#xD;
      albuterol in an HFA metered dose inhaler (MDI) after single albuterol doses of 90mcg and&#xD;
      180mcg delivered by the DPI and 180mcg delivered by the MDI. Another study objective is to&#xD;
      compare the pharmacokinetics (metabolism) of albuterol with the two inhalers in all subjects&#xD;
      treated. To participate in the study, subjects must provide written informed consent, washout&#xD;
      any prohibited medications and pass all the screening criteria. Once this is done, there will&#xD;
      be 3 treatment visits for each subject. At each of these visits, the subject will inhale from&#xD;
      either the DPI or the MDI. Assignment of subjects to one of six (6) unique sequences of&#xD;
      treatment will be according to a randomized scheme. The subject will inhale albuterol either&#xD;
      once from the DPI (90mcg), twice from the DPI (180mcg) and twice from the MDI (180mcg).&#xD;
      Following inhalation of the study drug, there will be a series of assessments taken at times&#xD;
      postdose with spirometry (FEV1) measured up to 2 hours postdose, vital signs measured up to&#xD;
      10 hours post dose, ECGs obtained up to 5 hours postdose, blood taken to measure potassium&#xD;
      and glucose up to 6 hours postdose, and blood for pharmacokinetic evaluation obtained up to&#xD;
      10 hours postdose. A washout period of 60 to 192 hours will separate each of the 3 treatment&#xD;
      visits. Following these visits, there will be a study concluding visit 3 to 10 days later.&#xD;
