      genes in body fluids of both plasma and nasopharyngeal brush together for screening of early&#xD;

      1. Background: Treatment failure can occur at distant sites which have no effective cure yet.&#xD;
      Early local residual or recurrent NPC are salvageable with over 50% 5-year survival rate. It&#xD;
      is however difficult for clinical detection of early residual or recurrent NPC after&#xD;
      radiotherapy by nasoendoscopy in the heavily irradiated nasopharynx with severe&#xD;
      nasopharyngitis and inflammatory swelling and crusting changes. Radiologic imaging and&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal biopsy have their role, but they are invasive, expensive and cannot be&#xD;
      repeated often as routine follow-up screening method. Unfortunately, 50% local recurrences&#xD;
      are in advanced rT3-4 stage and 28% local recurrences are not salvageable. Therefore,&#xD;
      detection of the early stage residual/recurrent NPC that are missed by our conventional&#xD;
      clinical follow-up is important for successful salvage treatment. Non-invasive, inexpensive&#xD;
      and repeatable sampling of blood and nasopharyngeal brush/swab for molecular detection of NPC&#xD;
      is our research focus for future improvement of treatment result of local failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two potential molecular markers of detection of minimal residual/recurrent NPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EBV DNA is a molecular marker for NPC. We have reported that only 61% patients with&#xD;
           local recurrence undergoing nasopharyngectomy had positive plasma EBV DNA. The&#xD;
           sensitivity was lower in local recurrence compared with same stage in pretreatment NPC,&#xD;
           86% T1 versus 38% rT1. EBV DNA in nasopharyngeal brush has been reported to be 96%&#xD;
           sensitive and 96% specific for NPC before treatment. EBV DNA in nasopharyngeal swab was&#xD;
           reported to disappear after radiotherapy and re-appear with mucosal local recurrence&#xD;
           with 100 % sensitivity and 98% specificity in a small case study of 11 patients with&#xD;
           local recurrences, the results demonstrate its potential detection of local recurrences&#xD;
           that are missed by our conventional follow-up. It however needs further prospective&#xD;
           longitudinal study for verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methylation of the CG rich promoter region of many tumor suppressor genes have been&#xD;
           found to be a common genetic abnormality in NPC, but not in normal nasopharynx. We have&#xD;
           shown that methylated promoter DNA are detectable in peripheral blood and nasopharyngeal&#xD;
           swab of NPC patients, but rarely in normal controls. By using combination of 3&#xD;
           methylated genes in plasma, we have found 38% sensitive for detection of local&#xD;
           recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Study objective To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the combination of EBV and&#xD;
      methylation marker genes in body fluids of both plasma and nasopharyngeal brush together for&#xD;
      screening of early salvageable local residual and recurrent NPC that are missed by&#xD;
      conventional clinical follow-up protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Hypothesis tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients in remission without residual or recurrent tumor after treatment should have&#xD;
           persistently negative or very low background level of markers in both nasopharyngeal&#xD;
           brush and plasma on follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with residual or recurrent local or nodal tumors have either persistently high&#xD;
           level of markers beyond 8th week or initial disappearance/reduction to very low&#xD;
           background level followed by reappearance/increasing level of markers again on&#xD;
           follow-up. The temporal change in quantity of markers is important to reflect the tumor&#xD;
           load of residual and recurrent NPC before clinical presentation. We hypothesize that&#xD;
           these pattern will be observed in those patients with residual/recurrent NPC at their&#xD;
           early salvageable stages before clinical presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Methodology of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Before treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Nasopharyngeal brush of tumor is collected under endoscopic guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. NPC biopsy specimen is then collected for histologic section and also freshly&#xD;
                frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in -80C freezer for subsequent study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. 20ml EDTA blood is also collected for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The EBV DNA and methylation markers will be screened in the tumor, nasopharyngeal&#xD;
                brush and blood by using methylation specific quantitative PCR method. The&#xD;
                laboratory protocols have been reported from our previous publications on EBV DNA&#xD;
                and methylation studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Post-treatment reassessment of residual NPC&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Based on our published results on the study of time of remission of residual NPC&#xD;
                after treatment, we have our routine follow-up protocol to perform endoscopic&#xD;
                assessment and random biopsy of the nasopharynx at post-treatment 8th week for&#xD;
                evaluation of residual NPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. At the time of endoscopy at 8th week, nasopharyngeal brush and 20 ml of blood will&#xD;
                be collected for study of biomarkers. The EBV and specific methylation markers of&#xD;
                the patient selected from patient's tumor biopsy findings will be used for each&#xD;
                individual patient to screen residual NPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Of those patients who have positive biopsy at 8th week, repeat biopsy will be done&#xD;
                at 10th week. If the biopsy is still positive at 10th week, salvage treatment of&#xD;
                either re-irradiation or nasopharyngectomy as appropriate will be arranged. If the&#xD;
                repeat biopsy at 10th week becomes negative, the patient will be reassessed in 4&#xD;
                weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Of those patients with negative findings of both biomarkers and biopsy at 8th week,&#xD;
                the patient will be followed-up according to schedule monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Of those patients who have positive biomarkers but negative biopsy at 8th week,&#xD;
                further nasopharyngeal biopsies will be performed at 10th week to maker sure there&#xD;
                is no missing of local residual NPC from the previous biopsy at 8th week.&#xD;
                Radiologic imaging will also be performed at this time. The nasopharyngeal brush&#xD;
                and blood tests will also be repeated to keep track of the temporal change with&#xD;
                time. Patients who have positive biopsy at 10th week will be given appropriate&#xD;
                salvage treatment of radiotherapy or surgery, and these patients are benefited by&#xD;
                the molecular screening. Patients who have persistently negative biopsy at 10th&#xD;
                week will be followed up according to schedule, and if they have no recurrence at&#xD;
                follow-up, these patients have false positive molecular surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subsequent follow-up for detection of recurrent NPC&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. A patient who has negative post-treatment nasopharyngeal biopsy at 8th/10th week&#xD;
                will be followed up every month in first year, every 2 months in second year and&#xD;
                every 3 months in third - fifth year for total 5 years. It is expected that 11% of&#xD;
                them in fact will subsequently develop local recurrence. It is our routine protocol&#xD;
                to perform nasoendoscopy to examine the nasopharynx during each follow-up. If there&#xD;
                is no suspicious lesion seen in the nasopharynx, biopsy will not be done and the&#xD;
                patient will be rescheduled for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Nasopharyngeal biopsy will be taken if suspicious lesion is seen during follow-up&#xD;
                endoscopy. If the biopsy is proven to be recurrence, the patient will be managed&#xD;
                accordingly. If the biopsy is negative, the patient will be rescheduled for regular&#xD;
                follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Nasopharyngeal brush and 20 ml of blood will be collected at follow-up every 2&#xD;
                months for 1st and 2nd year and every 3 months in 3rd to 5th year for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The EBV and specific methylation markers of the patient selected from patient's&#xD;
                tumor biopsy findings will be reassessed for each individual patient to screen&#xD;
                local recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. If a patient has negative nasoendoscopic finding and negative molecular biomarker&#xD;
                findings in both plasma and nasopharyngeal brush, the patient will be regularly&#xD;
                followed up as scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. If a patient has negative nasoendoscopic finding, but a positive molecular marker&#xD;
                result is found in at least one of the body fluids or marker, the patient will be&#xD;
                thoroughly reassessed for recurrence that are missed during routine clinical&#xD;
                follow-up. The patient will have PET/CT/MRI imaging and random multiple&#xD;
                nasopharyngeal biopsies to assess for possible local recurrence. Since a positive&#xD;
                plasma finding may be due to nodal or distant metastasis, other sites of recurrence&#xD;
                or new cancer will be investigated as judged necessary clinically. If the&#xD;
                nasopharyngeal biopsy is positive or other site of recurrence is found, the patient&#xD;
                will be managed by salvage treatment accordingly as appropriate. These patients are&#xD;
                benefited by the molecular surveillance with true positive result. If the search&#xD;
                for recurrence are all negative, the patient will be rescheduled for regular&#xD;
                follow-up, and if the patient is proven no recurrence on further follow-up, the&#xD;
                molecular surveillance is considered false positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. End point of follow-up Post-treatment 5 years follow-up status will be our end point of&#xD;
           study for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Number of patients recruited and recruitment criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 130-150 new NPC patients annually in Queen Mary Hospital. We plan to recruit 350&#xD;
      patients for the longitudinal study starting from January 2006. The patients recruited should&#xD;
      be medically fit for curative radiotherapy without distant metastasis before treatment. A&#xD;
      total of 350 patients are expected to be recruited in 2008. Of these 350 patients, we expect&#xD;
      to see about 35 patients who are found to have no residual local tumor with imaging and&#xD;
      biopsy assessment at 8th week after radiotherapy with conventional follow-up, but&#xD;
      subsequently develop isolated local recurrence within 5 years of follow-up. We would be able&#xD;
      to know how many of these local recurrence will be benefited by early detection with&#xD;
      molecular surveillance, their stage of recurrence and treatment outcome. Of these 350&#xD;
      patients, we expect to have about 20 patients with nodal recurrence.&#xD;
