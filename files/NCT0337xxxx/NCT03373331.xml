  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current project will examine the impact of an emotional processing intervention on&#xD;
      emotional processing abilities in a sample of 50 persons with moderate to severe TBI. Outcome&#xD;
      will be assessed across 3 domains. We will document changes resulting from treatment: (1) in&#xD;
      emotional processing tasks (2) in other areas of function including QOL, social functioning,&#xD;
      mood and cognition that are also likely to be impacted (3) in brain structure and function.&#xD;
      The examination of efficacy in the above three areas will further our knowledge of emotional&#xD;
      processing deficits in TBI and more importantly, identify an effective means of treating such&#xD;
      deficits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emotional processing deficits have a significant negative impact on the lives of persons with&#xD;
      TBI. There is emerging research indicating that, in addition to cognitive and behavioral&#xD;
      impairments, social and emotional difficulties following TBI are common and are related to&#xD;
      significant problems in social relationships, poor social participation, impaired empathy,&#xD;
      and a high degree of caregiver stress. Emotional processing is a critical component of social&#xD;
      cognition, including the abilities to both identify and discriminate basic universal&#xD;
      emotions. The stability of emotional processing deficits following TBI indicates that these&#xD;
      impairments likely impact individuals with TBI consistently across the lifespan, and do not&#xD;
      appear to resolve with time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of the trial are to (a) Evaluate the effectiveness of an emotional processing&#xD;
      intervention to improve performance on tests of emotional processing in individuals with TBI,&#xD;
      (b) Evaluate the improvement of secondary outcomes of psychological, cognitive, and&#xD;
      functional abilities following the emotional processing intervention in individuals with TBI,&#xD;
      (c) To examine differences in brain activation patterns during emotional processing following&#xD;
      treatment in individuals with TBI, BOLD activation in the experimental group will be compared&#xD;
      to BOLD patterns of the control group during performance of the QFDT, a facial affect&#xD;
      recognition task.&#xD;
