      The main reason for RelevarEM project is the creation of a registry based on a web platform&#xD;
      to facilitate the collection of epidemiological data of multiple sclerosis patients from&#xD;
      multiple sources in Argentina. The platform will provide the data in a global way that will&#xD;
      show the frequency and distribution of the disease in our environment at low cost.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic degenerative disease of autoimmune etiology that affects&#xD;
      young adults between 18 and 35 years of age, being the first cause of physical disability of&#xD;
      non-traumatic origin in several countries of the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS is characterized histopathologically by the presence of inflammatory plaques in the white&#xD;
      matter associated with the presence of axonal damage. Clinically, four evolutionary courses&#xD;
      can be distinguished from the disease: a form in which inflammatory outbreaks occur that&#xD;
      affect the brain and that the patient refers to as relapses and remissions (RRMS). This form,&#xD;
      in most cases and after years of evolution, enters a sustained progression of the disability&#xD;
      known as secondary progressive phase (SPMS) being another clinical form of the disease. In a&#xD;
      smaller percentage of patients, the disease may have a progressive course from the beginning&#xD;
      with the presence of some interposed outbreaks, a form known as progressive with relapses&#xD;
      (PRMS), and finally the fourth form of presentation of the disease may be manifest with&#xD;
      progression of disability from the outset without originating outbreaks in the course of the&#xD;
      same known as primary progressive form (PPMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      South America is a low-middle risk area for MS with a reported prevalence of between 1.48 and&#xD;
      36 cases per 100,000 population. The cause of observed differences in disease frequency&#xD;
      between Europe and North America relative to South America is unknown to date. It is&#xD;
      suggested that genetic predisposition would mainly contribute to the geographical variation&#xD;
      in the prevalence of MS; however, this factor alone can not explain the overall differences&#xD;
      in risk between populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency and distribution of this condition has been described in several parts of the&#xD;
      world, but it is still necessary to identify it more precisely in the countries and regions&#xD;
      of South America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main reason for RelevarEM project is the creation of a registry based on a web platform&#xD;
      to facilitate the collection of epidemiological data of MS patients from multiple sources in&#xD;
      Argentina. The platform will provide the data in a global way that will show the frequency&#xD;
      and distribution of the disease in our environment at low cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to mention that the data to be collected are part of the data of the daily&#xD;
      clinical practice without implying for the patient or the doctor additional work as well as&#xD;
      unnecessary procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary objective The creation of a national registry system for MS patients with&#xD;
      retrospective and prospective survey of epidemiological, diagnostic, prognostic, treatment,&#xD;
      follow-up and survival data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The project aims to be a strictly observational longitudinal record, which will&#xD;
      follow the results of the usual clinical practice for patients with MS. There will be no&#xD;
      experimental interventions in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Any patient diagnosed with MS can be entered into the registry. In order to reduce&#xD;
      the possibility of bias in the selection, it is sought to include all the patients with MS&#xD;
      that are in follow-up or so considered by each participant or researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for MS according to validated criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who do not meet the criteria of MS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who decide not to participate in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The registry behaves as a cohort study, with sample capture of prevalent cases and&#xD;
      consecutive incident cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Sample Two consecutive strategies are proposed for the inclusion of the&#xD;
      largest random sample of prevalent cases and all incident cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient is identified and consented to participate, the requested data will be&#xD;
      entered into a collection platform specifically designed for this purpose. The platform on&#xD;
      which the registry will be used will be a web platform with restricted access by user and&#xD;
      password specific to each researcher. The registers entered will be displayed only by the&#xD;
      investigator (personal register) and once the same one wishes, it will be able to share the&#xD;
      registry with the global base (central registry) to carry out global communications. When&#xD;
      sharing the registry, it will be anonymised and only data related to the demographics and&#xD;
      clinic will be accessible, and patient data such as name, surname will not be visible to&#xD;
      analysts if it is loaded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables to be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables to be analyzed to evaluate the objectives of the project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic: age, sex, place of residence at the time of onset of the disease and at the&#xD;
           time of entry to the registry&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Administrative: type of current medical coverage&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Baseline characteristics: Comorbidities, year of diagnosis, complementary studies made&#xD;
           for that diagnosis and treatment used for comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Disease activity prior to admission to the registry: date and number of previous&#xD;
           relapses and location of relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Clinical presentation: characteristics of the first symptom, functional system affected,&#xD;
           recovery of that first symptom, systems affected, recovery of that first relapse and&#xD;
           findings of resonance (performed with the first clinical episode).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6- Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) 7. Initial therapy used. 8. Clinical and&#xD;
      radiological activity during follow-up: presence of new relapses during clinical follow-up&#xD;
      and / or new MRI lesions and EDSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Specific treatment changes for the disease during follow-up 10. Reasons for change of&#xD;
      treatment 11. Evolution to secondary progressive forms of the disease 12. Safety issues&#xD;
      during follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan This is an open-ended Registry, and sample size is not based on&#xD;
      statistical considerations. A descriptive analysis is the main objective of the registry&#xD;
      regarding demographic, clinical aspects, disease activity and safety issues at registry entry&#xD;
      and during the follow up. Statistical analyses will be performed on clinical parameters such&#xD;
      as relapse and disability outcomes, included in the minimum dataset. Analyses may also be&#xD;
      performed on other parameters included in the uploaded datasets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data protection The regulatory requirements and protection of personal data must be completed&#xD;
      according to the regulations corresponding to each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each researcher in the registry should explain in detail to each potential participant the&#xD;
      record consists of and should provide the possibility to ask questions that will be answered&#xD;
      in a timely manner. Every patient who wishes to participate in the registry must consent,&#xD;
      according to each regulation, authorizing that their information, codified and anonymized, be&#xD;
      shared with other records for analysis and communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An institutional ethics committee must approve the registration or declare that it is exempt&#xD;
      from the need for approval as well as its informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be uploaded by the principal investigators of each participating center. The&#xD;
      different variables to be collected will be obtained from the daily clinical practice of each&#xD;
      professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Confidentiality As mentioned in the previous point, the patient's name, address, date&#xD;
      of birth, or telephone number will only be left in the personal registry and at the moment of&#xD;
      sharing the registration to the central registry will not be entered. The records will then&#xD;
      be identified by a unique code generated by the initials of the investigator and the&#xD;
      registration number of that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all times, the protection of the patient's identity and data will be observed in&#xD;
      accordance with the legal regulations in force national law of protection of personal data&#xD;
      25.326 (Habeas Data), in accordance with the international legislation on registration of&#xD;
      diseases and protection of personal data and private, according to the 18th World Medical&#xD;
      Assembly of Helsinki (1964) when applicable. The right to non-participation in the registry&#xD;
      will be respected at all times without this implying in any case any type of discrimination,&#xD;
      differential treatment or mistreatment towards the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion of registration If, at any point in time, the patient or the investigator decides&#xD;
      to withdraw the registration of certain patients from the central registry, they may be&#xD;
      excluded from future submissions of information to the central registry. The information&#xD;
      previously incorporated in the decision to withdraw the registration of the central registry&#xD;
      will remain in the same. In case the investigator wants to withdraw its participation in the&#xD;
      registry, it should be notified one month in advance to the scientific advisory committee.&#xD;
      The information previously uploaded to the central registry will be removed from the analysis&#xD;
      as well as future communications.&#xD;
