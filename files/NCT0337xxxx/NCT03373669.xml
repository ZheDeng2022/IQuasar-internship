  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholera is a life-threatening disease if prompt actions are not taken. The most recent&#xD;
      estimates of the global burden of cholera estimate that there are more than 1.3 billion&#xD;
      people at risk. Of which, 2.86 million (range: 1.3-4.0 million) will contract cholera and&#xD;
      95,000 (21,000-143,000) will die each year. A safe, effective, and affordable killed&#xD;
      whole-cell oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is now being used widely to prevent cholera in areas at&#xD;
      risk. This regimen demonstrated 65% efficacy retained for at least 3 years and even up to 5&#xD;
      years in an endemic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this project is to determine changes in the vibriocidal geometric mean&#xD;
      titers (GMT) in subjects who receive the second dose of oral cholera vaccine (OCV) at&#xD;
      different intervals: 2 weeks, or 6 months following the first dose of vaccine. Secondary aims&#xD;
      include a) vibriocidal antibody response rates in subjects who receive OCV at 2 weeks or 6&#xD;
      months following the first dose of vaccine, b) age specific serum vibriocidal GMTs following&#xD;
      the second dose among participants given the second dose of OCV at intervals of 2 weeks or 6&#xD;
      months following the first dose of vaccine, c) GMT and antibody response rates of&#xD;
      Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-lipopolysaccharide (anti-LPS) as&#xD;
      measured by ELISA following the second dose among participants given the second dose of OCV&#xD;
      at intervals of 2 weeks or 6 months following the first dose of vaccine. Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that the vibriocidal GMT following the second dose, when given after 6 months will not be&#xD;
      inferior to the response when the second dose is given according to the standard interval of&#xD;
      two weeks.&#xD;

      Cholera is a life-threatening disease if prompt actions are not taken. The most recent&#xD;
      estimates of the global burden of cholera estimate that there are more than 1.3 billion&#xD;
      people at risk. Of which, 2.86 million (range: 1.3-4.0 million) will contract cholera and&#xD;
      95,000 (21,000-143,000) will die each year. A safe, effective, and affordable killed&#xD;
      whole-cell oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is now being used widely to prevent cholera in areas at&#xD;
      risk. This regimen demonstrated 65% efficacy retained for at least 3 years and even up to 5&#xD;
      years in an endemic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described in the package insert, the standard dosing schedule of the OCV is two doses with&#xD;
      the second dose given 2 weeks after the first. In several campaigns, it was felt to&#xD;
      appropriate to give a single dose to twice as many people and to give the second dose at a&#xD;
      later time when this was logistically possible. In fact, modelling of the impact of OCV&#xD;
      during an outbreak finds that when the vaccine supply is limited (as it is currently), more&#xD;
      cases are prevented if a single dose strategy is used since a single dose can be provided to&#xD;
      twice as many people. Even if the efficacy is a bit lower, the number of cases prevented will&#xD;
      be higher. Even the individual person in this situation will be better off if more of his&#xD;
      neighbors also receive vaccine since he benefits from the herd protection when more people&#xD;
      are vaccinated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single dose strategy was used during an outbreak in Zambia in 2015-16, but this first dose&#xD;
      was then followed up with a second dose after 6 to 8 months. I was also used in Haiti in&#xD;
      2016-17 following the hurricane. While the delayed second dose strategy has been used and&#xD;
      will likely continue to be used during outbreaks or during humanitarian crises, there is no&#xD;
      feasible way to assess the relative effectiveness against clinical cholera comparing a&#xD;
      two-week interval with a delayed second dose strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While clinical effectiveness trials are not feasible, serological responses comparing&#xD;
      different dose intervals are possible. One such study found that vibriocidal titers were&#xD;
      similar if the second dose was given either 2 week or 4 weeks after the first , but studies&#xD;
      have not been done with longer dose intervals, as was used in Zambia and Haiti.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will determine if giving the second dose of the OCV using a longer&#xD;
      interval will result in a response to the second dose that is not inferior, or perhaps even&#xD;
      results in a more prolonged elevated vibriocidal titre. From an immunological standpoint,&#xD;
      there could be advantages to a longer dose interval if this resulted in a true booster&#xD;
      response which sustained high titre of antibody. While acknowledging that the vibriocidal&#xD;
      titer is not an established correlate of protection, it is the best correlate of the immune&#xD;
      response following vaccination. It seems logical that a sustained high titer is likely to be&#xD;
      more effective. Unfortunately, the clinical trials comparing the 2 week and 4 week interval&#xD;
      with Shanchol only examined the serum titers shortly after the dosing (about 2 weeks).&#xD;
      Follow-up serum samples were not obtained to discern how these dose intervals compared in&#xD;
      terms of duration of elevated serum titres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have found that children &lt;5 years of age are less well protected than older&#xD;
      individuals even though their serum antibody response rates (take rates) were similar to the&#xD;
      older subjects when the serum was collected about two weeks after the vaccine doses were&#xD;
      administered. These immunogenicity studies have not, however, examined antibody titers when&#xD;
      blood samples were obtained after a longer time interval. Therefore, it is not known if the&#xD;
      antibody titers decline at the same rate as older subjects. It could be that GMT titers are&#xD;
      lower or that titers fall more rapidly in the young children, and a different dosing interval&#xD;
      could maintain higher titres. To compare antibody responses in different age groups, we plan&#xD;
      to stratify groups into age 1-4, 5-14, and 15 years and older.&#xD;
