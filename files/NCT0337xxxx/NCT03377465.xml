      A stroke is the second cause of deaths after heart attack, one of the most important causes&#xD;
      of malfunction as far as adults are concerned and the second as for the frequency cause of&#xD;
      dementia. In spite of a possibility of the therapy of stroke ( tissue plasminogen activator)&#xD;
      and recognized most of risk factors there is expected that incidence rate on stroke connected&#xD;
      with ageing of the society will be growing. It will cause medical and social consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many of potential causes of cardiac strokes, which are not entirely examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More over many cryptogenic strokes are presumed to have an embolic etiology, and the frequent&#xD;
      cause of these kind of strokes at young age is probably the mechanism of paradoxical embolism&#xD;
      through patent foramen ovale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As far as the investigators are concerned, at present there is lack of any recommendations&#xD;
      for these scientific hypothesis.&#xD;

      A stroke is the second cause of deaths after heart attack, one of the most important causes&#xD;
      of malfunction as far as adults are concerned and the second as for the frequency cause of&#xD;
      dementia. In spite of a possibility of the therapy of stroke ( tissue plasminogen activator)&#xD;
      and recognized most of risk factors there is expected that incidence rate on stroke connected&#xD;
      with ageing of the society will be growing. It will cause medical and social consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk factors of stroke can be divided into alterable and not alterable. Importantly, the&#xD;
      not alterable factors are: age, sex, race and genetic factors. After the age of 55 the risk&#xD;
      of stroke grows twice in every decade of life. Moreover, it was alleged that incidence rate&#xD;
      on stroke is more frequent at women than at men. At the black race the incidence rate on&#xD;
      stroke is twice more frequent than at white race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Well- known are also genetic syndromes connected with strokes like s. MELAS or CADASIL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Well- known alterable factors are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  coronary disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  atrial fibrillation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hypercholesterolemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nicotinism&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood clotting disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  alcoholism&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TIA (transient ischemic attack) or previous former stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  asymptomatic stenosis of internal carotid artery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiogenic stroke is a stroke caused by embolic material, which was created in cardiac&#xD;
      cavities or on cardiac valves. They comprised 11% of all strokes and 25% of ischemic strokes.&#xD;
      Additionally, among patients over 80 years old cardiac causes are responsible for even 40% of&#xD;
      all ischemic strokes and half of cardiogenic strokes is caused of atrial fibrillation. Among&#xD;
      young people (below 45 years old) about 50% of strokes are cardiogenic and are connected with&#xD;
      paradoxical embolism at patients with patent foramen ovale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, cardiac- brain embolism is a result of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  structural defect of cavities and valves of heart&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  disturbances of movability of walls of the heart and function of endocardium which leads&#xD;
           to increased risk of the risk of parietal thrombus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cardiac insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many of potential causes of cardiac strokes, which are not entirely examined as for&#xD;
      example:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  small pockets of intra- atrial septum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  structures in dextral atrium like Eustachian valve or Chiari network&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  there is also a theory that even enlargement of left atrium may be the cause of brain&#xD;
           stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  aneurysm of intra- atrial septum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As far as the investigators are concerned, at present there is lack of any recommendations&#xD;
      for these scientific hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available data suggest that in the comparison with atherosclerosis and lacunar strokes&#xD;
      cardiogenic strokes characterize with high mortality ranging of 27%. Also the risk of relapse&#xD;
      is higher than in strokes of other etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, unfortunately, in spite of wide diagnostics at about 25-30% of patients with&#xD;
      ischemic stroke the cause is unknown. This kind of stroke is called cryptogenic stroke or&#xD;
      stroke with undefined etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They constitute almost half of all ischemic stroke at young patients (below 55 years old).&#xD;
      Many cryptogenic strokes are presumed to have an embolic etiology, and the frequent cause of&#xD;
      these kind of strokes at young age is probably the mechanism of paradoxical embolism through&#xD;
      patent foramen ovale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conclude, currently there aren't researches defining recommendations for long- lasting&#xD;
      treatment patients with rare causes of strokes.&#xD;
