      Objective: to compare different therapies employing acupuncture needles, silicon pellets and&#xD;
      kinesiotherapy in breast cancer patients to taxane chemotherapy cycles. Methods:The present&#xD;
      study will be carried out at the Oncomastology outpatient clinic of the UNIFESP (Federal&#xD;
      University of São Paulo) Gynecology Department's Discipline of Mastology - Escola Paulista de&#xD;
      Medicina (EPM) and the Oncology Clinic Associated Center of Oncology, located at Rua Gabriel&#xD;
      Monteiro da Silva, 454. randomized clinical trial will be conducted to define the treatment.&#xD;
      Patients will be allocated into three groups (Group A: Stiper, Group B: Acupuncture, Group C:&#xD;
      Kinesiotherapy and Group D After treatment ) who will receive treatment once a week for eight&#xD;
      consecutive weeks. Group - S-observation.124 patients will be randomized in one of the three&#xD;
      groups, after having signed the Free and Informed Consent Form and agreed to participate in&#xD;
      the project, will respond to the evaluation form and will be submitted to physical&#xD;
      examination. Patients will be evaluated in the first and tenth sessions.&#xD;

      Medicina (EPM) and Clínica de Oncologistas Associados Centro Integrado de Oncologia, located&#xD;
      at Rua Gabriel Monteiro da Silva, 454. Patients will consecutively be selected by order of&#xD;
      entry in the chemotherapy recorded in the log and randomized in one of three intervention&#xD;
      groups. Complying with all the research's ethical aspects, the following procedures will&#xD;
      apply: 1st clarify the study's objectives;2nd sign the Term of Free and Informed Consent,&#xD;
      signed in two ways, as one stays with the patient; 3rd espond to the evaluation form in the&#xD;
      following items: socioeconomic aspects, main complaint, family history, personal history,&#xD;
      surgical data, pathological anatomy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, sensitivity&#xD;
      and perimetry;4 th physical exams. Completed the FACT-TAXANE questionnaire. Patients will be&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A computer program will produce a randomization list, which will generate random sequences for the three groups and will be recorded and placed in sealed, opaque, non-translucent and sequentially numbered envelopes. This intervention should be done by someone else and not by the principal investigator. These envelopes will be opened after the consent of the patient to participate in the research and only then will the researcher know as well as the patient the group that she will be allocated. 124 envelopes were available where 31 would contain code that allocates the patients in group A, 31 in group B, 31 in group C or 31 group Follow Up .No Intervention Group - S 'Class wait '. This was done in order to avoid influences such as the therapist's or patient's preferences related to the intervention.</intervention_model_description>
