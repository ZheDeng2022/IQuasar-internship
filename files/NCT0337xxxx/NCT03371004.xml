  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      4-Demethyl-4-cholesteryloxycarbonylpenclomedine (DM-CHOC-PEN) is a polychlorinated pyridyl&#xD;
      cholesterol carbonate that is lipophilic, electrically neural, crosses the blood brain&#xD;
      barrier (BBB), ability to localize in intracranial tumor tissue, lacks neurotoxicity and not&#xD;
      transported out of the brain via Pgp (p-glycoprotein) (1). DM-CHOC-PEN has completed Phase&#xD;
      I/II trials in humans with primary and secondary tumors involving the brain with success.&#xD;
      Complete remissions in both primary astrocytoma and metastatic lung and leukemia&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is open for adult subjects with advanced cancer - brain involvement is required.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this Phase I oncology clinical trial will be to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      use of 4-demethyl-4-cholesteryloxycarbonylpenclomedine (DM-CHOC-PEN) plus radiation, as&#xD;
      anticancer therapy for adults with advanced cancer involving the central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DM-CHOC-PEN is a polychlorinated pyridine cholesteryloxycarbonate that crosses the blood&#xD;
      brain barrier (BBB), accumulates in CNS tumor tissue in humans and has produced objective&#xD;
      responses, with acceptable/reversible hepatic toxicities (in patients with prior liver&#xD;
      disease) and no evidence of hematological, renal, neuro-toxicities with improved quality of&#xD;
      life and overall survival in adult Phase I/II clinical trials - IND - 68,876.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug recently received Orphan Drug designation for NSCLC involving the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA supports the proposed Phase I clinical trial designed to identify safety, toxicities&#xD;
      and an acceptable MTD of the drug in combination with radiation in adult cancers subjects&#xD;
      with CNS involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Almost 700,000 people in the US are living with tumors involving the CNS or spinal nervous&#xD;
      system (SNS) tumors. Trends in CNS tumors have sharply increased since 1989 for individuals&#xD;
      with a history of cancer, who appeared to have 'beaten the odds', only to have a reoccurrence&#xD;
      from cancer involving the CNS after years of remission; the most common types of cancer in&#xD;
      AYA individuals are - from lung, breast, melanoma, and sarcoma malignancies. This group of&#xD;
      individuals deserves special attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A critical component in designing an agent that will cross the protective blood brain barrier&#xD;
      (BBB) is that the agent must be readily transported intracerebrally, does not produce local&#xD;
      irritation/neurotoxicity and is not recycled back into the general circulation. After IV&#xD;
      administration DM-CHOC-PEN readily penetrates the BBB, is not a substrate for the transporter&#xD;
      protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and has shown anticancer activity in CNS tumors. The effective&#xD;
      transport of DM-CHOC-PEN into CNS tumors in adults without neurotoxic behavioral alterations&#xD;
      and associated events supports the drug's use in combination with radiation in the treatment&#xD;
      of CNS tumors. The observed responses noted in adults with metastatic cancers involving the&#xD;
      CNS and cerebellum treated with DM-CHOC-PEN is encouraging. Thus, the drug's unique&#xD;
      properties and lack of toxicities noted in the adult studies merits the Phase I trial&#xD;
      proposed here in combination with radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of this Phase I study will be to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conduct a Phase I clinical trial with DM-CHOC-PEN plus radiation in adults with advanced&#xD;
           cancers involving the central nervous system to document toxicities, define an&#xD;
           acceptable maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and identify anticancer activity for the binary&#xD;
           treatment DM-CHOC-PEN plus radiation. All data will be communicated through an e-RAP&#xD;
           program. This will be accomplished through IND - 68.876.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Studying the pharmacokinetic/dynamic profiles of DM-CHOC-PEN and metabolites in adults&#xD;
           after being treated with DM-CHOC-PEN and radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analyze data and prepare a Phase II clinical trial or a Designation Orphan Drug&#xD;
           application for FDA review.&#xD;
