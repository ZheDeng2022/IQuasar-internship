  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digital communication media like video-interaction (cf. Skype) are increasingly being adopted&#xD;
      in institutional environments like hospitals for physician-patient interactions. We may&#xD;
      expect that the use of a digital medium affects these interactions in various ways and on&#xD;
      various levels. In video-interaction, eye contact for example is impossible due to the&#xD;
      position of the camera, which implies interactional behavior through gaze is impaired. This&#xD;
      may influence who speaks when, if and how the participants avoid/ solve misunderstandings,&#xD;
      etcetera. This project makes headway in our understanding of the impact of new communication&#xD;
      media on the role of language-in-use as a rich semiotic system, specifically in institutional&#xD;
      interaction. This type of contextualized research reveals which communicative aspects users&#xD;
      consider important, how they manage their institutional relationship through them and how&#xD;
      they go about solving communication problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project compares the interaction of physicians and patients in video-mediated&#xD;
      consultations to their traditional, face-to-face counterparts on both the verbal and the&#xD;
      nonverbal (gaze) level. The affordances of video-consultations with relevance to&#xD;
      institutional goals and identities are analyzed through a comparison with the interaction in&#xD;
      face-to-face consultations. The approach used is Conversation Analysis, which involves&#xD;
      finding patterns on both the verbal and non-verbal level (in sequences, turn design,&#xD;
      preference, etc.) in order to answer the question what goals and tasks the participants&#xD;
      achieve and what dilemma's or problems they aim to solve in their talk. This study will&#xD;
      provide insights in the limitations and advantages of both channels of communication. Best&#xD;
      practices will be generated and outcomes of the analyses will be used to develop reco&#xD;

      Research questions This project as a whole aims to understand the affordances of&#xD;
      video-consultations. The general research question is: What are the interactional affordances&#xD;
      of video-consultations compared to traditional consultations with respect to the goals and&#xD;
      tasks the participants achieve and the dilemma's or problems the participants (aim to) solve&#xD;
      in their talk?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology The project involves a comparison of face-to-face and video-mediated&#xD;
      consultations through the lens of affordances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Baseline parameters, the Big Five survey, and details on experience and affinity with&#xD;
      video consultation and (social) media use are obtained by means of a questionnaire. The&#xD;
      patients are offered video-consultation as an option, so all video-consultation data involve&#xD;
      patients with a certain level of openness and willingness towards the medium. The first set&#xD;
      of data will consist of the recordings of 25 face-to-face and 25 videoconsultations of&#xD;
      physicians with patients who have had a cancer resection, were discharged from the hospital&#xD;
      and have a follow-up 'visit' in which the pathology results of the resection are reported.&#xD;
      The reason for using video consultations for this group is that the patients would optimally&#xD;
      benefit from not having to travel to the hospital, because the patients recently underwent&#xD;
      surgery and are still recovering. These consultations solely consist of talk (no physical&#xD;
      examination), so video consultation is possible here. Other medical departments have already&#xD;
      implemented video consultations for similar reasons. All surgeons are in a similar stage of&#xD;
      their career and the patients are recorded only once during follow-up consultation after&#xD;
      surgery. The video-consultations are conducted through &quot;Facetalk&quot;, video-interaction&#xD;
      software. The physicians are trained to use this software and do about 3 to 4&#xD;
      videoconsultations per week. The face-to-face consultations are recorded with two camera's.&#xD;
      The video-interaction data consist of recordings of the physician's screen during the&#xD;
      consultation and a video-recording of the physician in the physical environment (sitting at a&#xD;
      desk), capturing the physician's body and head movement to and away from the&#xD;
      video-interaction screen (e.g., towards a second computer screen with the patient's file).&#xD;
      The main applicant is already acquainted with the setting through the observation of&#xD;
      video-consultations from within the physician's office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the video-recordings, brief surveys will be conducted with patients and&#xD;
      physicians after the consultation to measure satisfaction with the consultation. Informed&#xD;
      consent for the study and related education will be sought from both the patients and the&#xD;
      surgeons. The participants will also be asked for permission to archive the videorecordings&#xD;
      for future research on authentic communication. The recordings will be stored in a safe at&#xD;
      the Centre for Language Studies, Radboud University. Single episodes will be saved&#xD;
      occasionally on the researchers' computer for the benefit of the study (data session). These&#xD;
      episodes will be removed again as soon as possible. The participants will be anonymized in&#xD;
      the transcripts and any publication and conference presentation that may follow from this&#xD;
      study. Anonymization is achieved through functionalities in Windows Movie Maker (drawing&#xD;
      effect) and Audacity (tone adaptation). Rendering participant unrecognizable means that the&#xD;
      audience (of a presentation/ readers of an article) would not be able to recognize&#xD;
      participants without prior knowledge of the hospital, the department etc. These adaptations&#xD;
      do not affect the value of the material because non-verbal behavior (head shakes, gestures)&#xD;
      and the talk are still understandable in combination. It is acceptable and common in the&#xD;
      academic domain that recordings shown at conferences and in publications are anonymized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the patient is resigned from the hospital after surgery, the surgeon will ask the&#xD;
      patient whether the patient prefers a f2f or video consultation. Then, the patient will be&#xD;
      asked by the doctor whether the patient gives permission to be approached for participation&#xD;
      in the study. If yes, the patient information will be mailed to the patient to read and&#xD;
      consider at home. Permission (including signature) can be e-mailed to the researcher or given&#xD;
      to the doctor in person prior to the consultation. After that, the doctor will also give&#xD;
      permission and sign. It is possible at any time for the participants to withdraw from the&#xD;
      study and have the video consultation interrupted. To withdraw from the study they should&#xD;
      e-mail the main researcher of the project. This is explained in the patient information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method The analysis will be qualitative (micoanalytic) and iterative. The main method is&#xD;
      multimodal conversation analysis. Conversation analysis has a long tradition of research&#xD;
      based on the rendition of talk and interaction in terms of written transcripts of the audible&#xD;
      cues. The video mediated and face-to-face interactions will be compared. This means that&#xD;
      phenomena observed in the video-mediated consultations will be compared to equivalent actions&#xD;
      and practices in the face-to-face consultations, both verbal and non-verbal. Relevant&#xD;
      phenomena are likely to be the opening of the conversation (checking the technology), the&#xD;
      design of questions (use of more lexical tokens than deixis), particular gestures, specific&#xD;
      repair sequences due to technical trouble etc.). The analysis will be descriptive and will&#xD;
      result in recommendations for doing videoconsulting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All talk will be transcribed according to CA conventions . Software like ELAN may be used for&#xD;
      the synchronization of multiple video data and for the annotation of (fragments of) the video&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
