  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To improve the efficacy of immunotherapy for cancer, recent studies focused on specific&#xD;
      targets to redirect the immune network toward eradicating a variety of tumors and&#xD;
      ameliorating the self-destructive process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinically relevant immune escape mechanism in melanoma is the activation of the Programmed&#xD;
      cell Death-1 (PD-1) receptor on infiltrating T cells. By blocking PD-1 receptors with&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), T-cells are unaffected by the PD-L1 expressed on&#xD;
      tumor cells and the patients T cells are free to respond to melanoma antigens and attack&#xD;
      tumor cells. So the objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of a&#xD;
      combined therapy Nivolumab and adoptive T cell therapy in metastatic melanoma patients.&#xD;
