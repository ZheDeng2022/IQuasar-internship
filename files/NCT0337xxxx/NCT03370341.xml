      This study investigates whether Introspective Accuracy (IA) can be improved in individuals&#xD;
      with schizophrenia by stimulating the brain via transcranial Direct Current Stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self-awareness is markedly impaired in severe mental illness including schizophrenia and&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder. This impairment spans awareness of symptoms as well as deficits in&#xD;
      the estimation of abilities and capabilities, which we refer to as introspective accuracy&#xD;
      (IA). Recent work has provided evidence of IA deficits in schizophrenia spectrum disorders,&#xD;
      specifically in the abilities to retrospectively judge everyday functioning and&#xD;
      neurocognitive impairment, as well as the ability to make correct real-time judgments of&#xD;
      performance on neurocognitive tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a form of noninvasive neurostimulation&#xD;
      which has been proposed as a therapeutic procedure in numerous psychiatric disorders. TDCS in&#xD;
      healthy adults has been demonstrated to improve cognitive and memory performance, and in&#xD;
      schizophrenia, tDCS has been found to improve emotion recognition ability. TDCS thus appears&#xD;
      to be a promising therapeutic technique that may be useful for improving IA. This study will&#xD;
      compare IA performance in individuals with schizophrenia across two conditions: active anodal&#xD;
      tDCS and sham tDCS.&#xD;
