    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the side effects and how well fulvestrant and&#xD;
      palbociclib with or without copanlisib work in treating patients with hormone receptor&#xD;
      positive, HER2 negative, stage IV breast cancer. Fulvestrant, palbociclib, and copanlisib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety profile of fulvestrant + palbociclib + copanlisib (FPC) and&#xD;
      determine the recommended phase II treatment dose (RPTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if FPC is superior to fulvestrant + palbociclib (FP) using progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) as an endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the objective response rate (ORR = partial response [PR] + complete response&#xD;
      [CR]) and clinical benefit rate (CBR = PR + CR + stable disease [SD] &gt;= 6 months) of FPC&#xD;
      versus (vs.) FP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the median PFS between FPC and FP arms in the following subgroups: tumor&#xD;
      PIK3CA/PTEN altered (PIK3CA mutation or PTEN mutation/PTEN loss) and tumor PIK3CA/PTEN not&#xD;
      altered (wild type PIK3CA and PTEN and without PTEN loss).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate copanlisib pharmacokinetics (PK) when administered in combination with FP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the median PFS in the following molecularly defined subgroups treated with&#xD;
      either FPC or FP: tumor PIK3CA mutation vs. not, tumor PTEN mutation/PTEN loss vs. not,&#xD;
      circulating tumor (ct) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) PIK3CA mutation vs. not, ctDNA PI3K/PTEN&#xD;
      mutation vs. not, and ctDNA ESR1 mutation vs. not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate ctDNA mutations at baseline and over time for response predictors at&#xD;
      baseline, and clonal evolution associated with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess resistance mechanisms to FP and FPC at baseline and at disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To examine the molecular effects of FP and FPC on tumor and circulating markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) on days 1 and 15 of course 1 and day&#xD;
      1 of subsequent courses, palbociclib orally (PO) on days 1-21, and copanlisib intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive fulvestrant IM on days 1 and 15 of course 1 and day 1 of subsequent&#xD;
      courses and palbociclib PO on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 5 years.&#xD;
