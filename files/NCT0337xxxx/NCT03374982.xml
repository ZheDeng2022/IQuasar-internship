      Title: Effect of the DentalVibe injection system on pain during local anesthesia injections&#xD;
      in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to compare self-reported pain scale measurements using&#xD;
      the Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale from an experimental group (local anesthesia injection&#xD;
      with DentalVibe system) and a control group (traditional local anesthesia injection with&#xD;
      DentalVibe system turned off) in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: Children age 5-11 years old who require local anesthesia for bilateral dental&#xD;
      treatment at University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) pediatric dental clinic. Children&#xD;
      must understand and speak English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions and evaluations: Each patient will have two separate restorative appointments&#xD;
      where the DentalVibe will be used during local anesthetic injections. One appointment the&#xD;
      DentalVibe will be turned on and one appointment the DentalVibe will be turned off. After&#xD;
      each injection the child will be shown the Wong Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale and asked to&#xD;
      pick a face associated with their level of hurt during the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: All children will be followed up with any necessary recommended dental treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 50 children between the ages of 5-11 years will participate in this randomized,&#xD;
      controlled, split-mouth study. There will be no gender restrictions used in this study.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from a continuous sample of patient seen at the UNMC pediatric&#xD;
      dental clinic and will be selected based on their need for dental treatment. Each child will&#xD;
      have 2 separate dental appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent will be obtained from parent or guardian prior to first restorative&#xD;
      appointment. Verbal consent will be obtained prior to second restorative appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Marshall will be the provider for every patient. The same dental assistant will be used&#xD;
      for each appointment. All treatment will be completed in the same private quiet room. Both&#xD;
      Dr. Marshall and the dental assistant will wear the same color scrubs and black lab jackets&#xD;
      during all appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One appointment patient will receive local anesthetic dental injection with the DentalVibe&#xD;
      turned on and at one appointment the child will receive local anesthetic dental injection&#xD;
      with the DentalVibe off. Used strictly as a check/lip retractor. The child will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned via a random number generator to either the DentalVibe on or off during the initial&#xD;
      appointment. During the DentalVibe turned on appointment, the DentalVibe will be introduced&#xD;
      to each child to make him/her familiar with the vibration sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive 5 mins of O2, then nitrous oxide (N2O) will be titrated up to&#xD;
      50%N2O/50%O2. When appointment is complete the child will receive 5 mins of 100% O2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At both restorative appointment a cotton tip applicator with 20% Benzocaine topical&#xD;
      anesthetic gel (Patterson) will be administered for 1 min. 2% Lidocaine HCl with&#xD;
      1:100,000epinepherine (Patterson Dental) will the be deposited using a medium-length (0.4mm)&#xD;
      with 27-gauge short needles. Local anesthetic injections will be referred to as &quot;sleepy&#xD;
      juice.&quot; Buccal and lingual infiltration will perform on the maxilla. Mandibular blocks will&#xD;
      be performed on the mandible. One cartridge of local anesthetic will be used at each&#xD;
      appointment. After administration, patient will be shown the Wong Baker FACES pain rating&#xD;
      scale and asked to rate the amount of discomfort experienced during the injection by pointing&#xD;
      to the face or number. The following manuscript will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Each face represents a person who has no hurt, or some hurt, or a lot of hurt.&quot; &quot;Face 0&#xD;
      doesn't hurt at all. Face 2 hurts just a little bit. Face 4 hurts a little bit more. Face 6&#xD;
      hurts even more. Face 8 hurts a whole lot. Face 10 hurts as much as you can imagine, although&#xD;
      you don't have to be crying to have this worst pain.&quot; &quot;Touch the face of the hurt you felt&#xD;
      when I gave you the sleepy juice.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      After child has rated pain Dr. Marshall will continue with restorative treatment. The same&#xD;
      process will be followed at the second appointment. Appointments will be scheduled 3-4 weeks&#xD;
      apart.&#xD;
