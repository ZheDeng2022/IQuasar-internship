  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, multi-arm, open-label, randomized, three-period, crossover&#xD;
      study to evaluate the drug-drug interaction, pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of a&#xD;
      single dose of SPR741 combined with each of 3 different partner antibiotics (ceftazidime or&#xD;
      piperacillin/tazobactam or aztreonam) in healthy volunteers. Participants will be&#xD;
      administered single doses of SPR741 alone, a single dose of SPR741 in combination with 1 of 3&#xD;
      different partner antibiotics, and the partner antibiotic alone in a randomized sequence.&#xD;
      Twenty-seven (27) adult male and female normal healthy participants 18 to 55 years of age are&#xD;
      planned to participate in the study. Women of childbearing potential will not be eligible to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;

      to 55 years of age are planned to participate in the study. Women of childbearing potential&#xD;
      will not be eligible to participate. The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, a&#xD;
      treatment phase, and a follow-up phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3 treatment arms will be enrolled and dosed in parallel or in a staggered manner, as&#xD;
      needed for scheduling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in the study will be monitored for safety after administration of the last&#xD;
      dose of investigational product.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy adult males and/or females (of non-childbearing potential), 18 to 55 years of&#xD;
             age (inclusive) at the time of screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. BMI ≥ 18.5 and ≤ 29.9 (kg/m2) and weight between 55.0 and 100.0 kg (inclusive);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Medically healthy without clinically significant abnormalities at the screening visit&#xD;
             or Day -1, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Physical examination, vital signs. Vital signs include temperature, heart rate,&#xD;
                  respiratory rate, and blood pressure;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Triplicate ECGs taken at least 1 minute apart with QTcF interval duration less&#xD;
                  than 450 msec obtained as an average from the triplicate screening and pre-dose&#xD;
                  Day 1 ECGs after at least 5 min in a semi-supine quiet rest;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Hemoglobin/hematocrit, white blood cell (WBC) count, and platelet count equal to&#xD;
                  or greater than the lower limit of normal range of the reference laboratory;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Creatinine, BUN, ALT and AST equal to or less than the upper limit of normal for&#xD;
                  the reference laboratory; results of all other clinical chemistry and urine&#xD;
                  analytes without any clinically significant abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Discussion between the PI and the Medical Monitor (MM) is encouraged regarding the&#xD;
             potential significance of any laboratory value that is outside of the normal range&#xD;
             during the pre-dose period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Be non-smokers (including tobacco, e-cigarettes or marijuana) for at least 1 month&#xD;
             prior to participation in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willing and able to provide written informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Be willing and able to comply with all study assessments and adhere to the protocol&#xD;
             schedule;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have suitable venous access for drug administration and blood sampling;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. If female, be of non-childbearing potential (e.g. post-menopausal as demonstrated by&#xD;
             FSH or surgical sterilization i.e., tubal ligation or hysterectomy). Provision of&#xD;
             documentation is not required for female sterilization, verbal confirmation is&#xD;
             adequate;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. If male, a willingness not to donate sperm and if engaging in sexual intercourse with&#xD;
             a female partner who could become pregnant, a willingness to use a condom in addition&#xD;
             to having the female partner use a highly effective method of birth control (such as&#xD;
             an intrauterine device, diaphragm, oral contraceptives, injectable progesterone,&#xD;
             subdermal implants, or a tubal ligation). This criterion applies to males (and/or&#xD;
             female partners) who are surgically sterile and must be followed from the time of&#xD;
             first study drug administration until 90 days after the final administration of study&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History or presence of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal,&#xD;
             hematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic or neurological&#xD;
             disease, including any acute illness or surgery within the past 3 months determined by&#xD;

          2. History of known or suspected Clostridium difficile infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of seizure disorders;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Positive urine drug/alcohol testing at screening or check-in (Day -1);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Positive testing for HIV, HBsAg or HCV;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of substance abuse or alcohol abuse (defined as those who consume more than 14&#xD;
             units of alcohol per week, and where this consumption is spread over less than 3 days,&#xD;
             or those who regularly (weekly) consumed excessive amounts of alcohol (&gt;8 units for&#xD;
             men and &gt;6 units for women in one consumption, excessive amounts as defined by the UK&#xD;
             National Office of Statistics) within the previous 5 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Use of any prescription medication or any over-the-counter medication, herbal&#xD;
             products, vitamins, diet aids or hormone supplements within 7 days prior to&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Documented hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis to any medication;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Donation of blood or plasma within 30 days prior to randomisation, or loss of whole&#xD;
             blood of more than 500 mL within 30 days prior to randomisation, or receipt of a blood&#xD;
             transfusion within 1 year of study enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participation in a New Chemical Entity clinical study within the previous 3 months or&#xD;
             a marketed drug clinical study within the 30 days before the first dose of IMP.&#xD;
             (Washout period between studies is defined as the period of time elapsed between the&#xD;
             last dose of the previous study and the first dose of the next study).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any other condition or prior therapy, which, in the opinion of the PI, would make the&#xD;
             volunteer unsuitable for this study, including unable to cooperate fully with the&#xD;
             requirements of the study protocol or likely to be non-compliant with any study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
