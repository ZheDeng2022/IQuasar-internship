  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 40% of patients presenting with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection&#xD;
      (ABSSSI) to the Barnes-Jewish Hospital (BJH) emergency department (ED) are admitted for&#xD;
      intravenous antibiotics. There is growing evidence to suggest that many hospital admissions&#xD;
      for uncomplicated ABSSSI due to Gram-positive bacteria could be avoided with an alternative&#xD;
      treatment strategy employing newer long-acting antibiotics. Coupled with close outpatient&#xD;
      follow-up, such an alternative hospital avoidance strategy has the potential to improve&#xD;
      quality and value of care for patients with uncomplicated ABSSSI and optimize use of limited&#xD;
      inpatient healthcare resources.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to establish the feasibility and acceptability of an alternative treatment&#xD;
      strategy for uncomplicated acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) in the&#xD;
      Barnes Jewish Hospital (BJH) Emergency Department (ED) focusing on hospital admission&#xD;
      avoidance using single-dose, long-acting antimicrobial therapy complemented by close&#xD;
      follow-up in the ambulatory setting. The extended half-life of these new antimicrobials&#xD;
      (dalbavancin, oritavancin) allows for an effective treatment course of &gt;7 days with a single&#xD;
      dose, which is the accepted duration for which ABSSSI is usually treated with daily doses of&#xD;
      other intravenous or oral antimicrobials. The investigators believe that such an approach&#xD;
      will conserve hospital resources by reducing admissions for uncomplicated ABSSSI while&#xD;
      delivering comparable if not superior care for this disease, allowing optimal utilization of&#xD;
      BJH inpatient beds for other serious medical conditions requiring inpatient care. The&#xD;
      investigators believe this novel alternative approach will allow hospitals such as BJH to&#xD;
      more cost-effectively and efficiently manage ABSSSI patients. This study will reduce the&#xD;
      number of &gt;2 midnight observation admissions to BJH for ABSSSI, thereby improving inpatient&#xD;
      capacity to care for patients requiring &gt;2 midnight hospital inpatient admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing patients treated with&#xD;
      a single-dose of intravenous dalbavancin (an antibiotic that has been FDA-approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of ABSSSI and is currently being used in clinical practice in the U.S.) and&#xD;
      discharged home from the ED with close ambulatory care follow-up in clinic vs. patients&#xD;
      treated with &quot;usual care&quot; (hospital admission for multiple doses of intravenous vancomycin or&#xD;
      other antibiotic directed towards Gram-positive bacteria). Clinical outcomes, healthcare&#xD;
      utilization, hospital costs, and patient satisfaction will be evaluated.&#xD;
