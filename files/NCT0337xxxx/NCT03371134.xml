  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deficits in skeletal muscle function exist during aging and muscular dystrophy, and&#xD;
      suboptimal function has been related to factors such as atrophy, excessive inflammation and&#xD;
      fibrosis. Sarcopenia is the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function. It is now&#xD;
      recognised as a major clinical problem for older people and research in the area is expanding&#xD;
      exponentially. This interest stems from the fact that sarcopenia is both common and&#xD;
      associated with serious health consequences in terms of frailty, disability, morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. The age-related loss of human skeletal muscle mass is due to a decrease in&#xD;
      myofibre size and number with the loss of both fast and slow type myofibres, although the&#xD;
      loss of fast myofibres tends to start earlier, at ∼70 years. Many factors influence the&#xD;
      decrease in muscle mass. A significant contributor is an anabolic resistance of older&#xD;
      skeletal muscle to protein nutrition as seen during immobilisation which can be ameliorated&#xD;
      at least in part by resistance exercise and dietary supplementation. Other intensive areas of&#xD;
      research are related to the loss of innervation and oxidative damage. Moreover, ineffective&#xD;
      muscle regeneration underlies each condition and has been attributed to a deficit in myogenic&#xD;
      potential of resident stem cells or satellite cells. It is now widely accepted that satellite&#xD;
      cells, and generally adult stem cells, are normally quiescent and tend to reside in hypoxic&#xD;
      areas of the tissue to preserve their undifferentiated state. To govern these processes,&#xD;
      cells have developed a very complex machinery that is mainly regulated by a group of&#xD;
      transcription factors known as hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). In particular, several&#xD;
      observations support the idea that oxygen deprivation and HIF-1a may play a key role during&#xD;
      ischemia to activate the regeneration process, which, after an initial hypoxic insult, needs&#xD;
      to proceed under normoxia. On these bases, in this study we will investigate the role of&#xD;
      HIF-1a in skeletal atrophy during aging.&#xD;

&#xD;
      In particular, we will isolate satellite cells from muscular biopsies harvested from old&#xD;
      sarcopenic patients and from young patients. The, we will measure HIF-1a levels and we will&#xD;
      compare them.&#xD;
