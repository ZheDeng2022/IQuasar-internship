      This is a study comparing the effects of ICS containing treatments in patients with chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a real world setting, using the UK Clinical Practice&#xD;
      Research Datalink (CPRD) linked with Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). The main outcome to&#xD;
      be assessed is exacerbation rates.&#xD;

      Background/Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), standard maintenance inhaler&#xD;
      treatments consist of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long acting bronchodilators&#xD;
      (principal classes include long-acting beta-2-agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic&#xD;
      antagonists (LAMAs)). Clinical trials indicate that adding ICS to treatment combinations may&#xD;
      provide rapid and sustained improvements (1). However, ICS may be associated with adverse&#xD;
      effects, notably pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for real-world effectiveness data regarding COPD treatment in order to&#xD;
      demonstrate that improvements in lung function translate into reductions in exacerbations,&#xD;
      hospitalizations or morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Hypotheses: We hypothesize that ICS containing treatment regimens (including&#xD;
      triple therapy - ICS/LABA/LAMA) are more effective at preventing AECOPD than non-ICS&#xD;
      containing regimens. The main objective is to assess the impact of ICS therapy on&#xD;
      exacerbation outcomes in a COPD population and identify which patient subgroups may achieve&#xD;
      the greatest benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Cohort study examining comparative effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Source(s): Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD, Hospital Episode Statistics&#xD;
      (HES) and Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients ≥40 years-old, with a validated diagnosis of COPD registered&#xD;
      between the 1st of January 2006 and the 29 February 2016. Eligible patients must have a&#xD;
      smoking history, data recorded at least 12 months prior to the study index date and have&#xD;
      Up-To-Standard (UTS) data as defined by CPRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure(s): ICS containing (LAMA/LABA/ICS and LABA/ICS) regimens and non-ICS containing&#xD;
      regimens (LABA/LAMA, LAMA monotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome(s): Exacerbationsmof COPD, defined using a published algorithm, both GP treated and&#xD;
      hospitalised(2), hospitalised pneumonias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Estimations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-sample log-rank test for power indicated that a total of n=2,858 patients (1,429&#xD;
      patients per group) will be required to detect a 15% risk reduction for exacerbation in the&#xD;
      triple therapy population compared to the dual-therapy group (comparison which requires the&#xD;
      maximum number of patients). This is based on a 60% annual hazard rate for exacerbation in&#xD;
      the dual-therapy population and a 51% annual hazard rate for exacerbation in the triple&#xD;
      therapy group; assuming power of 90%, alpha=0.05, and a conservative accrual period of one&#xD;
      year and a minimum follow-up time of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize patients according&#xD;
      to baseline demographic, clinical and treatment factors and to study treatment patterns&#xD;
      during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical statistics will estimate time to exacerbation events per treatment type during the&#xD;
      follow-up period. These statistics will include extended Cox regression models, marginal&#xD;
      structural models (MSM) and inverse probability weighting (IPW).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses will assess follow-up time in incremental periods in order to examine&#xD;
      the impact of drug type and drug changes over time. We will also analyse associations between&#xD;
      demographic and clinical factors and treatment received.&#xD;

        We will include all patients ≥40 years-old, with a validated diagnosis of COPD (29)&#xD;
        recorded between the 1st of January 2006 and 29 Feb 2016 and incident use of one of the&#xD;
        therapies under investigation during the study period. Eligible patients must have a&#xD;
        smoking history, data recorded at least 12 months prior to the study index date and have up&#xD;
        to standard (UTS) data as defined by CPRD (Appendix A lists Read codes for identification&#xD;
        and characterization of the COPD population).&#xD;
&#xD;
        The COPD definition has been validated in the CPRD against a reference standard of&#xD;
        physician review of patient notes by the Imperial College research team. These definitions&#xD;
        have high Positive Predictive Value (PPV) &amp;gt;85%, and will be used in this analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All eligible CPRD GOLD patients will be included in the descriptive analysis, regardless of&#xD;
        their eligibility for data linkage to HES, ONS and IMD data. The follow-up and analytical&#xD;
        statistics will only be applied to patients eligible for linkage.&#xD;
