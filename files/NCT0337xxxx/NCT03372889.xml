  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to compare caregiver satisfaction and efficacy between two modes of&#xD;
      patient education materials (PEMs): media based and print based. The caregivers of patient's&#xD;
      who undergo ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) reconstruction surgery and receive an On-Q&#xD;
      Catheter pain block receive both a hand-out (print based PEM) and watch a short video&#xD;
      (media-based PEM) describing how to care for their child's On-Q Catheter at home. Upon&#xD;
      enrollment into the study, caregivers are randomly assigned to either first view the hand-out&#xD;
      or the video, then complete a 10 questions standardized assessment of information that was&#xD;
      presented in the PEMs. Caregivers are called the next day to assess caregiver satisfaction&#xD;
      with the PEMs, which mode of PEM was more helpful to them, and how comfortable they felt&#xD;
      managing their child's pain pump at home.&#xD;

      The present study aims to compare the efficacy and caregiver satisfaction between two modes&#xD;
      of patient education materials (PEMs): media based and print based. The PEMs are designed to&#xD;
      education caregivers on how to manage their child's On-Q catheter pain block at home. After&#xD;
      caregivers have enrolled in the study and have been randomized to an education group, study&#xD;
      interventions take place in the private family waiting room. Immediately after viewing their&#xD;
      assigned PEM, the caregiver completes a 10 question standardized assessment, formatted as a&#xD;
      multiple-choice quiz, of their understanding and knowledge of the information conveyed in&#xD;
      both modes of PEM. The following day, caregivers are contacted by phone call to answer a&#xD;
      number of questions to assess their satisfaction with the PEMs they received, the mode of PEM&#xD;
      they preferred, and how comfortable they felt managing their child's pain pump at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All information is stored in a secure database (REDCap).&#xD;
