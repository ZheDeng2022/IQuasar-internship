      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) attacks the immune system. Scientists have created a&#xD;
      gene that could be transferred to the cells of people with HIV. The gene should tell the&#xD;
      cells to make an antibody called VRC07. This antibody fights HIV. The VRC07 gene is packaged&#xD;
      into a man-made version of a virus called AAV8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if AAV8-VRC07 is safe. To study if it causes cells to produce the VRC07 antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 65 who are HIV infected but in general good health and have been taking the&#xD;
      same HIV medicine for at least 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened in a different protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the study product on day 1. It will be injected one or more times in&#xD;
      the upper arm or thigh using a needle. Participants weight will be measured to calculate the&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women may have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 7 days after getting the study product, participants will check their temperature with a&#xD;
      thermometer. They will note any symptoms in an electronic or paper diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have study visits. At each one, they will have a physical exam and medical&#xD;
      history. They will have blood drawn and may have saliva collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visit schedule will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 12 weeks: 1 visit a week&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the next 12 weeks: 1 visit every other week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then about 1 visit a month&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 1 year in the study: a visit every 6 months for the next 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study participation is 5 years.&#xD;

      Design: This is a Phase I study of the safety and tolerability of AAV8-VRC07&#xD;
      (VRC-HIVAAV070-00-GT) expressing VRC07 human monoclonal antibody with broad HIV-1&#xD;
      neutralizing activity in HIV-1 infected adults. It is a dose-escalation study to examine&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of VRC07 expression following intramuscular (IM) administration of&#xD;
      AAV8-VRC07 in subjects on anti-retroviral therapy (ARV). The hypotheses are: 1) AAV8-VRC07&#xD;
      will be safe for human administration and will not elicit hypersensitivity or anti-drug&#xD;
      antibody (ADA) to VRC07; and 2) intramuscular delivery of AAV8-VRC07 will result in&#xD;
      production of biologically active VRC07 antibody at a concentration in serum that is&#xD;
      measurable and safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description: AAV8-VRC07 was developed by VRC, NIAID, NIH, and manufactured by the Clinical&#xD;
      Vector Core, Center for Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics, The Children s Hospital of&#xD;
      Philadelphia (CHOP), Philadelphia, PA. It is composed of an AAV8 recombinant vector&#xD;
      expressing genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the VRC07 monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
      AAV8-VRC07 will be supplied at 2.84x1013 vg/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: HIV-1 infected adult volunteers (18 to 65 years old) on a stable antiretroviral&#xD;
      regimen for more than or equal to 3 months, with controlled viremia, under the care of a&#xD;
      physician, and without additional clinically significant medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: There are 3 dose escalation groups. Sequentially enrolled subjects will be&#xD;
      assigned to the dosage level being evaluated at the time of enrollment. All injections will&#xD;
      be administered intramuscularly (IM) by needle and syringe. Cumulative safety data will be&#xD;
      reviewed weekly by a Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) that includes an Independent Safety&#xD;
      Monitor (ISM) while injections are being administered. Safety, including reactogenicity and&#xD;
      unsolicited AEs, laboratory findings, pharmacokinetics, and VRC07 antibody levels in blood&#xD;
      will be assessed after the injection and summarized for an interim analysis at 4 weeks post&#xD;
      injection. The second subject in each dose group will be injected after the 4 weeks safety&#xD;
      assessment for the first subject. Decisions regarding dose escalation and subject enrollments&#xD;
      will be based on safety data and the VRC07 concentration in blood at 4 weeks after product&#xD;
      administration. The pharmacokinetics of VRC07 at each dose level will be evaluated to&#xD;
      determine the dose that would result in antibody production that achieves at least 50 mcg/mL&#xD;
      VRC07 concentration in serum at 4 weeks post injection with a target set point of more than&#xD;
      or equal to 5 mcg/mL at 12 weeks post injection.&#xD;
