  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation oncology study of APX3330 in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1/redox factor-1 (APE1/Ref-1) is a protein that regulates&#xD;
      multiple transcription factors involved in cancer cell signaling and APX3330 is a highly&#xD;
      selective inhibitor of APE1/Ref-1 redox function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anti-tumor effect of APX330 has been demonstrated in a variety of preclinical models and&#xD;
      the human safety profile of APX3330 was established in prior clinical studies. Apexian&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals is developing APX3330 as an orally administered anti-cancer agent targeting&#xD;
      the APE1/Ref-1 protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APX_CLN_0011 is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation oncology study in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors. The study primary objective is to determine the&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 study dose of APX3330. Secondary objectives include assessment of APX3330&#xD;
      safety, anti-tumor activity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile.&#xD;

    <description>APX3330 will be supplied as 60 and 120 mg orally administered tablets. Patients will receive a fixed dose of APX3330 twice daily (i.e., bid) each day of a 21-day cycle. The starting dose of APX3330 will be a daily dose of 240 mg (i.e., 120 mg/dose bid). Doses will be increased until identification of a maximum tolerated dose or bio-effective dose, whichever is lower.</description>
