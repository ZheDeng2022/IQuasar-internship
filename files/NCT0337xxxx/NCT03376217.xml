      The overall aim of the study is to learn whether utilization of Health Surveillance&#xD;
      Assistants (HSAs) for delivery of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnant&#xD;
      women (IPTp) can increase coverage of three or more IPTp doses compared to IPTp delivery only&#xD;
      at antenatal clinics (ANC), while at the same time improve or maintain ANC attendance. This&#xD;
      will be a cluster randomized trial, including a total of 20 health facilities (HF) which will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to either the intervention (10) or non-intervention group (10); all HSAs&#xD;
      affiliated with a HF will be in the same group.&#xD;

      Project Background WHO recommends the use of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy&#xD;
      (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to prevent the adverse effects of malaria in&#xD;
      pregnancy. In 2012, in an effort to boost uptake, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated&#xD;
      its policy promoting initiation of IPTp-SP as early as possible during the second trimester&#xD;
      and at every scheduled antenatal clinic (ANC) visit thereafter, as long as the visits were at&#xD;
      least one month apart. Despite this recommendation, progress has been slow, and no&#xD;
      sub-Saharan African country has achieved the 85% coverage target set by the President's&#xD;
      Malaria Initiative (PMI). Malawi was the first country to adopt IPTp-SP, and though it had&#xD;
      early gains, these have remained stagnant. Coverage of 2 doses of IPTp-SP was 42.9% in 2004&#xD;
      (DHS), 53.8% in 2010 (DHS), and remained only 63% as of 2014 (MIS), despite the fact that&#xD;
      &gt;95% of women make 2 or more visits to the ANC, with 44% making four or more visits, and&#xD;
      despite the fact that the median gestational age at the first visit is 5.6 months. Clearly, a&#xD;
      novel approach to ensure earlier presentation at ANC and increase IPTp delivery is needed to&#xD;
      boost coverage to the 85% target. Community delivery of IPTp has been suggested as a means to&#xD;
      improve coverage, however, there is concern that this could also lead to reduced antenatal&#xD;
      care (ANC) visits. Thus, it is relevant to assess whether there is a benefit of community&#xD;
      delivery of IPTp-SP under the current policy advocating IPTp at each ANC visit, whether this&#xD;
      approach is feasible, both from the standpoint of service delivery as well as data&#xD;
      collection, and ensure that there is no adverse effect on ANC attendance prior to large scale&#xD;
      roll-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims Broad objective: The overall aim of the study is to learn whether utilization of&#xD;
      Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) for delivery of intermittent preventive treatment of&#xD;
      malaria in pregnant women (IPTp) can increase coverage of three or more IPTp doses compared&#xD;
      to IPTp delivery only at antenatal clinics (ANC), while at the same time improve or maintain&#xD;
      ANC attendance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the effect of community-based IPTp delivery by HSAs compared with&#xD;
           facility-based IPTp delivery on IPTp coverage (including 1, 2, 3, and 4 doses) and ANC&#xD;
           coverage (including 1, 2, 3, and 4 visits) Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Document the level of service delivery by HSAs&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess women's knowledge of HSAs and attitudes about receiving IPTp from a HSA&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the feasibility of scaling-up community delivery of IPTp from the perspective of&#xD;
           health facility staff, and HSAs..&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assess the acceptability of community delivery of IPTp from health facility staff, HSAs,&#xD;
           and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assess the factors which may affect the scale-up of community delivery of IPTp from the&#xD;
           perspective of health facility staff, HSAs, and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Assess incremental costs of community-based IPTp delivery compared to HF based IPTp&#xD;
           delivery from both provider and household perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Study design: This will be a cluster randomized trial, including a total of 20&#xD;
      health facilities (HF) which will be randomly assigned to either the intervention (10) or&#xD;
      non-intervention group (10); all HSAs affiliated with a HF will be in the same group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use baseline and end line cross sectional household surveys, midline and&#xD;
      post-intervention in-depth interviews with health facility staff and HSAs, pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention in-depth interviews with women, and focus group discussions with HSAs to&#xD;
      achieve the objectives.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All pregnant women residing in study catchment area are eligible to receive SP from&#xD;
             HSAs, with the exception of HIV positive women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To be included in the women's question portion of the baseline and end line household&#xD;
             surveys, women must be between the ages of 16-49 years, have been pregnant/delivered&#xD;
             in the previous 12 months, consent to participation, and will be eligible for&#xD;
             inclusion in surveys regardless of where the woman gave birth (i.e., whether at home&#xD;
             or in facility). All pregnant/recently pregnant women will be included in the cross&#xD;
             sectional survey, but the sample size is calculated in order to identify those who&#xD;
             have completed pregnancies in the past 12 months. There were be a very short subset of&#xD;
             demographic and knowledge questions which will be asked of all households during the&#xD;
             baseline and end line surveys, regardless of whether there are any recently pregnant&#xD;
             women in the household.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Providers:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At each facility we will randomly select one ANC provider who has had at least six&#xD;
             months of work experience&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HSA supervisor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Health facility in-charge&#xD;
&#xD;
        HSAs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • All HSAs working in the study areas will be eligible; we will select at least 36 at&#xD;
        random to be participate in interviews and focus groups discussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women: Women who experienced a delivery in the past 12 months, but are &lt;16 or &gt;49&#xD;
        years will be excluded. Those who last delivered a child over twelve months ago will be&#xD;
        excluded from survey questions specific to recently pregnant women, but may answer&#xD;
        questions related to community perception or general demographics. For qualitative&#xD;
        research, the same criteria will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Health facility providers: Those who have been working in the health service for less than&#xD;
        six months will not be interviewed due to low levels of relevant experience or exposure to&#xD;
        the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HSAs: All HSAs are eligible to participate.&#xD;
