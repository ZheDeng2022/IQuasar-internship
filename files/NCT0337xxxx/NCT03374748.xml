  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study described here applies a variety of statistical methods to develop strategies to&#xD;
      determine meal based dietary patterns within nationally representative food consumption&#xD;
      databases. The work will apply methods such as Principal component analysis, latent class&#xD;
      analysis, basket set analysis, topic models and others to explore methods to accurately&#xD;
      identify meal based dietary patterns for use in personalised nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The work will initially focus on National Food Consumption Data collected within Ireland,&#xD;
      specifically using the National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS), with details of data&#xD;
      collection fully outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within NANS dietary, demographic and phenotypic data was collected from a Nationally&#xD;
      representative sample within Ireland from 2008-10. The fieldwork phase was carried out&#xD;
      between October 2008 and April 2010. Adults aged 18-90 years (740 males, 760 females) were&#xD;
      recruited in the Republic of Ireland. Eligible respondents were adults aged 18 years and over&#xD;
      who were free-living and who were not pregnant or breast feeding. A sample of adults was&#xD;
      randomly selected from a database of names and addresses held by Data Ireland (An Post). An&#xD;
      introductory letter and information leaflet were posted to each person selected from the&#xD;
      database. A researcher called to potential respondents&quot; homes to introduce the survey and&#xD;
      invite participation. If the individual agreed to participate, a consent form was signed and&#xD;
      the survey commenced. If the person was not at home, the researcher called on three more&#xD;
      occasions on different days and at different times, before deeming them ineligible. For&#xD;
      groups that were not highly represented in the database, particularly 18-35 year olds, a&#xD;
      second level of recruitment was introduced. A second database of names and addresses was&#xD;
      compiled through referrals from respondents and participation was invited for those that were&#xD;
      contactable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food intake data collection - A four-day food diary was used to collect food and beverage&#xD;
      intake data. The researcher made three visits to the respondent during the four-day period: a&#xD;
      training visit to demonstrate how to keep the food diary and how to use the weighing scales;&#xD;
      a second visit 24-36 hours into the recording period to review the diary, check for&#xD;
      completeness and clarify details regarding specific food descriptors and quantities; and a&#xD;
      final visit one or two days after the recording period to check the last days and to collect&#xD;
      the diary. Respondents were asked to record detailed information regarding the amount and&#xD;
      types of all foods, beverages and nutritional supplements consumed over the recording period&#xD;
      and where applicable, the cooking methods used, brand names of the foods consumed and details&#xD;
      of recipes. Data were also collected on the time of each eating or drinking occasion, the&#xD;
      respondent's definition of each eating or drinking occasion (e.g. morning snack, lunch) and&#xD;
      the location of the preparation of the meal or snack consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food quantification and coding - A quantification protocol that had been established by the&#xD;
      IUNA (Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance) for the North/South Ireland Food Consumption&#xD;
      Survey (NSIFCS) (Harrington et al., 2001) was updated for the NANS. It is summarised as&#xD;
      follows: (1) Weighed by respondent/manufacturer weights) - A portable food scales (Tanita,&#xD;
      Japan) was given to each respondent. The researcher gave detailed instructions (including a&#xD;
      demonstration) as to how to use the food scales during the training session. This method was&#xD;
      use to quantify 46% of foods and drinks consumed. A further 10% of weights were derived from&#xD;
      manufacturer's weights. To facilitate collection of such data, researchers asked respondents&#xD;
      to collect all packaging of food and beverages consumed in a storage bag provided. (2) Food&#xD;
      Atlas - A photographic food atlas (Nelson et al., 1997) was used to quantify 16% of foods and&#xD;
      beverages consumed. (3) IUNA Weights - Average portion weights that had been ascertained for&#xD;
      certain foods by the IUNA survey team were used. This method was used to quantify 4% of foods&#xD;
      and beverages consumed. (4) Food Portion Sizes - &quot;Food Portion Sizes&quot; (Ministry of&#xD;
      Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, 1997) was used to quantify 11% of foods and beverages&#xD;
      consumed. (5) Household Measures - Measures such as teaspoon, tablespoon, pint etc. were used&#xD;
      to quantify 11% of foods and beverages consumed. (6) Estimated - Food quantities were defined&#xD;
      as estimated if the researcher made an estimate of the amount likely to have been consumed&#xD;
      based on their knowledge of the respondent's general eating habits as observed during the&#xD;
      recording period. This method was used to quantify 2% of foods and beverages consumed.&#xD;
      Nutrient composition of foods and estimation of nutrient intake - Food intake data were&#xD;
      analysed using WISP© (Tinuviel Software, Anglesey, UK). WISP© uses data from McCance and&#xD;
      Widdowson's The Composition of Foods, sixth (Food Standards Agency, 2002) and fifth (Holland&#xD;
      et al., 1995) editions plus all nine supplemental volumes (Holland et al., 1988; Holland et&#xD;
      al., 1989; Holland et al., 1991; Holland et al., 1992; Holland et al., 1993; Chan et al.,&#xD;
      1994; Chan et al., 1995; Chan et al., 1996; Holland et al., 1996) to generate nutrient intake&#xD;
      data. During the NANS, modifications were made to the food composition database to include&#xD;
      recipes of composite dishes, nutritional supplements, generic Irish foods that were commonly&#xD;
      consumed and new foods on the market. All previous modifications to the food composition&#xD;
      database were also checked and updated from current manufacturers&quot; information as necessary.&#xD;
      The above modifications and additions comprise &quot;The Irish Food Composition Database&quot; (Black&#xD;
      et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires - Four questionnaires were completed by the adults in the NANS. These&#xD;
      included: Health and Lifestyle Questionnaire: This questionnaire collected information on the&#xD;
      respondent's socio-demographics, education levels, attitudes to their own diet and weight,&#xD;
      sun exposure and supplement usage. Information on smoking status and alcohol intake was also&#xD;
      collected in this questionnaire. In the case of married/cohabiting couples, the higher social&#xD;
      class and education level was assigned to the respondent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity: Respondents completed a validated physical activity questionnaire (Epic&#xD;
      Physical Activity Questionnaire (EPAQ2)) (Wareham et al. 2002) to assess customary levels of&#xD;
      physical activity. The questionnaire consisted of three sections: activity at home, work and&#xD;
      recreation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food Choice Questionnaire: This questionnaire was designed to find out information on food&#xD;
      choice and the factors that can influence it, fear of eating new or unfamiliar foods and the&#xD;
      respondent's own opinion of their food preparation skills. Evaluation Questionnaire: The&#xD;
      researcher administered this questionnaire at the final visit to identify whether the&#xD;
      respondent's eating habits or physical activity patterns had been usual during the survey&#xD;
      week. Medication usage was also recorded here. Coded questionnaires were entered into the&#xD;
      customised Q-Builder software package (Tinuviel Software, Anglesey, UK). A dual data entry&#xD;
      method was used to enter questionnaires to ensure correct data entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry - Anthropometric measurements were taken by the researcher in the respondents&quot;&#xD;
      homes. Weight, height, waist and hip circumference and measures of body composition were&#xD;
      recorded. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1cm using the Leicester portable height&#xD;
      measure (Chasmores Ltd, UK) with the respondent's head positioned in the Frankfurt Plane.&#xD;
      Waist circumference was measured in duplicate using a non-stretch tape measure and taken at&#xD;
      the naked site where possible. Waist circumference was measured at the midpoint to the&#xD;
      nearest 0.1cm between the iliac crest (top of hip) and the bottom of the rib cage (10th rib).&#xD;
      Hip circumference was measured in duplicate to the nearest 0.1cm using a non-stretch tape&#xD;
      measure. This measurement was taken over light clothing at the widest part of the buttocks at&#xD;
      the level of the greater trochanter (bony prominence of the thigh bone). Weight and body&#xD;
      composition were measured in duplicate using a Tanita body composition analyzer BC-420MA&#xD;
      (Tanita Ltd, GB) to the nearest 0.1kg. Respondents were weighed after having voided, wearing&#xD;
      light clothing and without shoes. Defining overweight and obesity in adults Body Mass Index&#xD;
      (BMI) was used to indirectly assess adiposity and was calculated as weight (kg) divided by&#xD;
      height squared (m2). The World Health Organisation (WHO) BMI cut-off points were used to&#xD;
      estimate levels of underweight (&lt;18.5kg/m2), normal weight (18.5-24.9kg/m2), overweight&#xD;
      (25.0-29.9kg/m2) and obese (≥30 kg/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Pressure - Blood pressure was measured in triplicate from the right arm where possible,&#xD;
      leaving five minutes between each measurement. The measurement was taken with the respondent&#xD;
      sitting on a well-supported chair, with feet placed firmly on the floor. Prior to the&#xD;
      measurement, respondents were asked to sit quietly without talking or laughing for at least&#xD;
      five minutes. Respondents were asked to remove tight clothing from their upper arm and to&#xD;
      rest their arm such that the antecubital fossa (triangular cavity of the elbow joint) was at&#xD;
      the level of the heart, palm facing upwards. Measurements were taken in accordance with the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions for the OMRON M6 Comfort blood pressure monitor, with&#xD;
      fieldworkers having received training in taking the measurement prior to fieldwork.&#xD;
      Respondents were asked whether they had had anything to eat or drink (besides water) or&#xD;
      whether they had smoked in the 30 minutes prior to the measurement. This information was&#xD;
      recorded by the fieldworker. Respondents were informed of blood pressure readings that&#xD;
      consistently fell outside of the normal ranges and advised to visit their health nurse or&#xD;
      general practitioner for another reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and Urine Collection and Analysis - Participants were asked to provide a blood sample,&#xD;
      fasting where possible, and a first void morning urine sample. The samples were collected by&#xD;
      a qualified nurse at designated centres within the survey area or in the respondent's home if&#xD;
      the respondent could not travel. In total, five tubes (45mls) of blood were collected from&#xD;
      respondents and where appropriate, inverted gently to ensure thorough mixing with&#xD;
      anti-coagulant. Of these, four were kept chilled and transported to the lab for further&#xD;
      processing and storage, while the fifth was kept at room temperature for full blood count&#xD;
      analysis. The blood tubes collected were: 3 x serum tubes (total 26ml); 2 x&#xD;
      ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes (total 13ml); 1 x lithium heparin tube (6ml). A&#xD;
      50ml first void urine sample was also collected. Respondents were provided with a sterile&#xD;
      collection tube to collect the urine sample on the final survey visit. They were also&#xD;
      provided with an ice pack and asked to keep the sample chilled until they met with the nurse.&#xD;
      Samples were kept on ice during transport to the lab for further processing. A blood&#xD;
      collection form was completed in which the following was recorded: date and time of blood&#xD;
      collection, whether the respondent was fasting or not and any irregularities during blood&#xD;
      collection. Written consent to take a blood and urine sample was obtained along with consent&#xD;
      for the survey at the initial visit. Blood and urine samples were collected for the analysis&#xD;
      of a number of markers of nutritional status and metabolic health. In line with good ethical&#xD;
      practice, all samples were anonymised prior to analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity and accelerometer - A triaxial accelerometer (Actigraph GT1M, ActiGraph,&#xD;
      LLC) was worn for the four days of the survey period. It was worn on the waist and reported&#xD;
      acceleration using a proprietary unit - &quot;counts&quot;. An accelerometer diary was also used to&#xD;
      track activities that are poorly recorded by accelerometers such as cycling and swimming and&#xD;
      to record when the accelerometer was removed e.g. for sleeping/showering.&#xD;
