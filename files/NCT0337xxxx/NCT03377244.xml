  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to pilot test a weight-loss intervention for Marshallese adults, referred&#xD;
      to throughout as Healthy Bodies Healthy Souls (HBHS). The HBHS intervention includes the&#xD;
      Wholeness, Oneness, Righteousness, Deliverance Diabetes Prevention Program Lifestyle&#xD;
      Intervention (WORD DPP) implemented at the individual level, with the additional enhancement&#xD;
      of working with Marshallese churches to implement church-level changes to support the&#xD;
      individual behavioral intervention of the WORD DPP. We will then compare changes in outcomes&#xD;
      with participants in the churches who were exposed to the policy changes but did not&#xD;
      participate in the WORD DPP, and with those enrolled in a separate DPP trial who participated&#xD;
      in the WORD DPP but were not exposed to church-level policy changes.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disparities in type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes, and obesity among the Marshallese and Pacific&#xD;
      Islanders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study focuses on the Marshallese living in Arkansas. The Marshallese are a Pacific&#xD;
      Islander population experiencing significant health disparities, with some of the highest&#xD;
      documented rates of type 2 diabetes of any population group in the world. Our review of&#xD;
      local, national, and international data sources found estimates of diabetes in the&#xD;
      Marshallese population (in the US and the Republic of the Marshall Islands) ranging from 20%&#xD;
      to 50%, compared to 8% for the US population and 4% worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While national prevalence data are limited, 23.7% of Pacific Islanders surveyed by the&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2010 reported a diagnosis of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes - more than all other racial/ethnic groups. Our preliminary research, which included&#xD;
      health screenings with the Marshallese community in Northwest Arkansas (n = 401), documented&#xD;
      extremely high incidence of diabetes (38.2%) and pre-diabetes (32.4%). Our pilot data also&#xD;
      revealed similar disparities in obesity, one of the strongest risk factors for diabetes; 90%&#xD;
      of Marshallese participants were classified as overweight or obese. Further compounding these&#xD;
      significant disparities, Pacific Islanders living in the US are less likely than other&#xD;
      racial/ethnic groups to receive preventive or diagnostic treatment or diabetes education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study addresses an urgent need for interventions to reduce obesity and diabetes&#xD;
      disparities in the Marshallese community and will employ a culturally appropriate, multilevel&#xD;
      approach. The scientific premise of our study includes four main points. First, the&#xD;
      Marshallese in Arkansas suffer from a significant and disproportionate burden of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and lack access to effective prevention and treatment due to a dearth of research&#xD;
      with Pacific Islanders.Second, the association between weight gain and risk for type 2&#xD;
      diabetes is strong. Overweight/obesity is considered the strongest modifiable risk factor for&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, and even a modest reduction in weight (5-10%) is clinically meaningful.&#xD;
      Third, research demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-level lifestyle interventions in&#xD;
      reducing weight and the onset and impact of diabetes. Fourth, to be effective among Pacific&#xD;
      Islanders, interventions must be developed to address influences at multiple levels and&#xD;
      should be culturally adapted to incorporate Pacific Islanders' worldviews and cultural&#xD;
      values. Prior research indicates the importance of using a Community Based Participatory&#xD;
      Research (CBPR) approach to understand and integrate cultural nuances during the cultural&#xD;
      adaptation process and implementation of multilevel interventions. A CBPR approach is also&#xD;
      essential to conducting ethical, valid health research in populations whose health beliefs&#xD;
      and behaviors have been shaped by historical trauma. Finally, churches are primary social&#xD;
      institutions of Pacific Islander health. Faith-based interventions are effective at improving&#xD;
      behavioral and anthropometric outcomes within collectivistic communities and therefore hold&#xD;
      great promise for Marshallese and other Pacific Islanders.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Eating Habits Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change in eating habits self-efficacy from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). This self-report measure assessed participants' self-efficacy related to their ability to make healthy eating decisions in the face of real or perceived barriers (e.g. while at social events, while watching TV, etc.). This 7-item measure was adapted from items in the original Weight Efficacy Life-Style Questionnaire by Clark et al (1991) (reference provided in the References in the Protocol Section). Each of the 7 items are measured via 3 response options (&quot;Yes/Completely Sure&quot;=2; &quot;Maybe/Not Sure&quot;=1; and &quot;No/Not Sure at All&quot;=0), giving a possible range of scores of 0-14, with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy for making healthy eating decisions in spite of barriers.</description>

    <description>Change in physical activity self-efficacy from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). This self-report measure assessed participants' self-efficacy for exercising in the face of real or perceived barriers (e.g., bad weather, exercising alone, etc.). This 9-item measure was adapted from the Self-Efficacy for Exercise Scale by Resnick &amp; Jenkins (2000) and Resnick et al (2004) (references provided in the References in the Protocol Section). Each of the 9 items are measured via 3 response options (&quot;Yes/Completely Sure&quot;=2; &quot;Maybe/Not Sure&quot;=1; and &quot;No/Not Sure at All&quot;=0), giving a possible range of scores of 0-18, with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy for exercising despite barriers.</description>

    <measure>Change in Percentage of Participants Engaging in Sufficient Levels of Physical Activity Over the Past Month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change in percentage of participants engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity (PA) from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). This self-report measure assessed participants' frequency of engaging in both moderate and vigorous levels of physical activity over the past month with two items. Both items used a 4-point response scale: 1) Rarely or Never; 2) Once a week; 3) 2-4 times a week; and 4) More than 4 times a week. Each 4-point scale for moderate PA and vigorous PA was weighted: 0=Rarely or Never; 1=Once a week; 2=2-4 times a week; and 4=More than 4 times a week. The weights were then summed and dichotomized as follows: ≥4 = sufficient PA and &lt;4 = insufficient PA. Items were adapted to include relevant cultural examples of physical activity from the DASH 2 Brief Physical Activity Questionnaire (link to original items provided in the References in the Protocol Section).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change in participants' sugar-sweetened beverage consumption from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). This self-report measure assessed participants' sugar-sweetened beverage consumption over the past 30 days using two questions from 'Module 14: Sugar Sweetened Beverages' of the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Participants could respond in number of times per day, per week, or per month. Responses for each question were converted to number of times per day (i.e., self-reported times per week divided by 7 or self-reported times per month divided by 30), resulting in two measures: number times soda was consumed per day and number of times sugar-sweetened fruit drinks, sweet tea, and sports drinks were consumed per day. Per BRFSS guidelines, these two measures were added together to create a total daily SSB consumption rate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fruit and Vegetable Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change in participants' fruit and vegetable consumption from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). This self-report measure assessed participants' fruit and vegetable consumption over the past three months using three questions adapted from: Shannon et al (1997) (reference provided in the References in the Protocol Section). Each of the three items was scored as Often=2; Sometimes=1; Never=0. Items were summed to create a scale score, giving a possible range of scores of 0-6, with higher scores indicating more frequent consumption of fruit and vegetables.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Family Support for Exercise and Dietary Habits</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change in perceived family support for exercise and dietary habits from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). This self-report measure was adapted to examine changes in perceived family support for engaging in healthy exercise and dietary habits. This measure consists of a 6-item scale adapted from: Gruber (2008) (reference provided in the References in the Protocol Section). Each of the 6 items are measured via 3 response options (&quot;Often&quot;=2; &quot;Sometimes&quot;=1; and &quot;Never&quot;=0), giving a possible range of scores of 0-12, with higher scores indicating higher perceived family support for exercising and eating healthier.</description>

          <description>Participants in the HBHS arm received the Wholeness, Oneness, Righteousness, Deliverance Diabetes Prevention Program Lifestyle Intervention (WORD DPP) with the addition of church-level policy changes to support the individual behavioral intervention of the WORD DPP. The WORD DPP is a faith-based diabetes prevention curriculum that teaches participants to connect faith and health to have a healthy weight, eat healthy, and be physically active. The WORD DPP-LI includes 16 modules that are intended to be delivered over a 24 week period, each module approximately 90 minutes in length. Church-level changes to support healthier behaviors include improvements in food purchasing and preparation for events, physical activity programs, and increased congregational engagement in health promotion activities.&#xD;

          <title>Change in Physical Activity Self-Efficacy</title>
          <description>Change in physical activity self-efficacy from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). This self-report measure assessed participants' self-efficacy for exercising in the face of real or perceived barriers (e.g., bad weather, exercising alone, etc.). This 9-item measure was adapted from the Self-Efficacy for Exercise Scale by Resnick &amp; Jenkins (2000) and Resnick et al (2004) (references provided in the References in the Protocol Section). Each of the 9 items are measured via 3 response options (&quot;Yes/Completely Sure&quot;=2; &quot;Maybe/Not Sure&quot;=1; and &quot;No/Not Sure at All&quot;=0), giving a possible range of scores of 0-18, with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy for exercising despite barriers.</description>

This self-report measure assessed participants' frequency of engaging in both moderate and vigorous levels of physical activity over the past month with two items. Both items used a 4-point response scale: 1) Rarely or Never; 2) Once a week; 3) 2-4 times a week; and 4) More than 4 times a week. Each 4-point scale for moderate PA and vigorous PA was weighted: 0=Rarely or Never; 1=Once a week; 2=2-4 times a week; and 4=More than 4 times a week. The weights were then summed and dichotomized as follows: ≥4 = sufficient PA and &lt;4 = insufficient PA. Items were adapted to include relevant cultural examples of physical activity from the DASH 2 Brief Physical Activity Questionnaire (link to original items provided in the References in the Protocol Section).</description>

This self-report measure assessed participants' sugar-sweetened beverage consumption over the past 30 days using two questions from 'Module 14: Sugar Sweetened Beverages' of the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Participants could respond in number of times per day, per week, or per month. Responses for each question were converted to number of times per day (i.e., self-reported times per week divided by 7 or self-reported times per month divided by 30), resulting in two measures: number times soda was consumed per day and number of times sugar-sweetened fruit drinks, sweet tea, and sports drinks were consumed per day. Per BRFSS guidelines, these two measures were added together to create a total daily SSB consumption rate.</description>

          <title>Change in Fruit and Vegetable Consumption</title>
          <description>Change in participants' fruit and vegetable consumption from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). This self-report measure assessed participants' fruit and vegetable consumption over the past three months using three questions adapted from: Shannon et al (1997) (reference provided in the References in the Protocol Section). Each of the three items was scored as Often=2; Sometimes=1; Never=0. Items were summed to create a scale score, giving a possible range of scores of 0-6, with higher scores indicating more frequent consumption of fruit and vegetables.</description>
