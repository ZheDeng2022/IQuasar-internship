    <textblock>
      After Ethics Committee approval of the University of Liège and written informed consent, 90&#xD;
      ASA 1-2 patients aged 18-65 years and scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study. Exclusion criteria are body mass index (BMI) above 35; meeting&#xD;
      criteria for difficult ventilation and/or intubation, such as oropharyngeal pathology or&#xD;
      facial or cervical abnormalities; and risk for aspiration or previous gastric surgery.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly allocated 1:1:1 (30 patients/group) by the method of sealed&#xD;
      envelopes to left low paratracheal esophageal compression (LPEC), cricoid pressure (CP), or&#xD;
      no pressure intervention (Control). Neck circumference will be measured. No premedication&#xD;
      will be given prior to the study interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Ultrasound assessment of the esophagus at the left lower paratracheal level&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal examinations will be conducted by ultrasound with the patient supine and head in&#xD;
      neutral position. Feasibility of imaging and compressing the esophagus approximately 2-3 cm&#xD;
      above the clavicle was assessed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A linear ultrasound probe (Applio XG iStyle Toshiba with a 14-7 Mhz) was positioned in a&#xD;
      transverse (axial) orientation over the left paratracheal area (Figure 1(A)), 2-3 cm above&#xD;
      the clavicle. The position of the esophagus in relation to the trachea (left, right or not&#xD;
      seen) will be recorded. Once the esophagus will be identified, the antero-posterior diameter&#xD;
      (mm) will be measured and compared before and after applying an estimated pressure of 30 N&#xD;
      (as described below) or until a bony contact will be established with the transducer.&#xD;
      Esophageal compression will be re-assessed using a paramedian sagittal plane between the&#xD;
      trachea and the sternocleidomastoid muscle with the esophagus in sagittal plane. The&#xD;
      antero-posterior diameter (mm) measurements will be repeated before and after applying&#xD;
      pressure with the transducer. Three consecutive measures for each probe position were&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Assessment of the presence of gastric (antral) air With the patients in supine&#xD;
      position, a curvilinear transducer (Applio XG iStyle Toshiba with an 8-5 MHz) will be placed&#xD;
      on the epigastrium in a paramedian sagittal orientation to identify the antrum. 9 The&#xD;
      cross-sectional area of the antrum was measured at the level where both the aorta and upper&#xD;
      mesenteric artery were visible. Three consecutive measures were taken (a) before the&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia and (b) after 3 min of PPV via face mask. The presence of gastric air&#xD;
      insufflation is defined as an increase in cross-sectional area and/or presence of artifacts&#xD;
      in the antrum (comet tail, posterior acoustic shadow). 9 These assessments will be performed&#xD;
      by a sonographer, blinded to group allocation by a surgical drape placed between the thorax&#xD;
      and the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure maneuvers Two anesthesiology residents, not informed of the study outcome&#xD;
      measurements, will be trained to apply sustained pressure of 30 ± 5 N using an electronic&#xD;
      dynamometer (MicroFET2; Hoogan Industries, West Jordan, Utah), until 10 consecutive maneuvers&#xD;
      will be measured successfully (30 ± 5 N). For cricoid pressure, the cartilage will be&#xD;
      compressed with the thumb and index fingers toward the vertebral bodies (Sellick). For LPEC,&#xD;
      the thumb will be placed over the base of the neck on the left side of the trachea 2-3 cm&#xD;
      above the clavicle and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle (Figure 1(B)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASA monitoring will be applied, and anesthesia will be induced with propofol 2.5 mg/kg&#xD;
      administered over 45 sec. Remifentanil will be administered with an infusion pump (2 to 3&#xD;
      μg/kg over 60 sec during induction, followed by continuous infusion of 0.05μg /kg/min). After&#xD;
      general anesthesia will be induced, PPV was accomplished with a face-mask in pressure-control&#xD;
      mode while maintaining a positive inspiratory pressure of 25 cm H2O, (Zeus ventilator,&#xD;
      Dräger, Lübeck, Germany). The ventilator settings will be 100% oxygen, I:E ratio 1:2, 15&#xD;
      breaths/min, no positive end-expiratory pressure. Adequacy of ventilation will be documented&#xD;
      by chest raise and capnography. Antral measurements will be taken after 3 min of face-mask&#xD;
      ventilation by a sonographer blinded to group assignment. Thereafter, the management of&#xD;
      anesthesia care will be continued as per institutional standards.&#xD;
