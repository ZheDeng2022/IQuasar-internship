      Probiotics are &quot;live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, can confer&#xD;
      health benefits on the host&quot;. Probiotics, which beneficially affect the host by improving the&#xD;
      intestinal microbial balance, may affect the immune response, thus boosting the body system&#xD;
      to combat against diseases. While numerous microorganisms that may confer health benefits to&#xD;
      the host, the most widely studied probiotics are from the Lactobacillus genera. For the past&#xD;
      few decades, probiotics have been studied extensively for their beneficial effects mainly on&#xD;
      the host's guts. Recently, probiotics are studied for their promising potentials along the&#xD;
      gut-brain-axis. The 'gut-brain-axis' is a bidirectional communication system, dynamic for&#xD;
      maintaining homeostasis. Many studies show that certain strains of Lactobacillus improved&#xD;
      human's health such as reducing the occurrence of diarrhea caused by rotavirus infections,&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment, chemotherapy, or lactose intolerance, reduced irritable bowel syndrome&#xD;
      symptoms and treating atopic diseases. Lactobacillus have also gained increasing evidences as&#xD;
      an effective therapy in preventing respiratory tract infections such as sinusitis, bronchitis&#xD;
      and pneumonia. While the precise mechanisms of using Lactobacillus in management of&#xD;
      respiratory infections are largely unknown, speculations include: Lactobacillus compete&#xD;
      against pathogens; increase the barrier function in respiratory epithelium; immunostimulatory&#xD;
      effects by enhancing cellular immunity with increased activity of natural killer cells and&#xD;
      macrophages in airways. Lactobacilli, as one of the largest genera for probiotic&#xD;
      microorganisms have been researched to alleviate stress, anxiety and/or depression disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactobacillus plantarum DR7 was isolated from fresh cow's milk in Penang, Malaysia. In-vitro&#xD;
      evaluation has shown that this putative probiotic strain adhere to the criteria of probiotic&#xD;
      characteristics; a) resistant towards acid and bile conditions of the upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract, b) does not possess antibiotic resistance as per requirement of the European Food&#xD;
      Safety Authority (EFSA), c) able to adhere to mucin, d) has antioxidant properties, e) able&#xD;
      to utilize prebiotics such as fructooligosaccharide (FOS), inulin and galactooligosaccharide&#xD;
      (GOS), e) has a carbon metabolism profile adhering to the general patterns of lactobacilli,&#xD;
      and f) possess antimicrobial properties against gastrointestinal pathogens. In-vivo&#xD;
      evaluation using rats shown that this putative probiotic strain has gut protection&#xD;
      properties; a) modulation of gastrointestinal microbial profile via suppressing gut pathogen&#xD;
      populations and increasing the population of lactobacilli, b) decreasing pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines in the plasma, and c) reducing&#xD;
      inflammation in the lower intestines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these indicated that Lactobacillus plantarum DR7 has the potential to be an effective&#xD;
      probiotic strain that modulate gut health and immunity. In addition, due to the alleviation&#xD;
      of gastrointestinal stress, this strain may be beneficial along the gut-brain-axis to promote&#xD;
      brain health as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactobacillus plantarum DR7 and placebo are produced under GMP and HALAL certified&#xD;
      manufacturing facility. Probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum DR7 appears as light yellow powder.&#xD;
      Sachets are stored away from direct sunlight and in below 30C according to the storage&#xD;
      condition recommendations of the manufacturer. Each dose was supplied in an aluminium sachet&#xD;
      and all sachets are identical in taste and appearance. Probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum DR7&#xD;
      does not contain any porcine or bovine ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product contains Lactobacillus plantarum DR7 and maltodextrin as excipient while placebo&#xD;
      contains only maltodextrin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 124 healthy adults from age 18 -60 years old will be recruited for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

          -  Male or female subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18-60 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to commit throughout the experiment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have moderate stress and beyond, as per determined by PSS test&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Type-1 diabetes (one of the main metabolite of Lactobacillus is acetic acid. Acetic&#xD;
             acid has been reported to affect lipid metabolism in the liver and fat digestion in&#xD;
             the pancreas in animal studies, and has been applied in obesity studies)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Long term medication due to certain severe illness (certain medications may interfere&#xD;
             with the survivability of Lactobacillus in the gut, for example the interactions&#xD;
             between probiotics and warfarin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV/AIDS (there has been no substantial data on the detrimental effects of probiotics&#xD;
             on AIDS patients. However, AIDS patient may be immune-compromised in the sense of&#xD;
             &quot;leaky gut&quot; that may lead to bacterial translocation, including translocation of&#xD;
             Lactobacillus outside the gut environment, into the blood stream)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (there has been no substantial&#xD;
             data on the detrimental effects of probiotics on G6PD deficiency people. However,&#xD;
             certain strains of probiotics have been reported to benefit RBC irregularity disorders&#xD;
             such as spur cells formation. One of the main mechanisms, involve the alteration of&#xD;
             RBC membrane. Although this is a benefit, we are unsure of the effects on G6PD&#xD;
             deficiency people, with weaker RBC).&#xD;
