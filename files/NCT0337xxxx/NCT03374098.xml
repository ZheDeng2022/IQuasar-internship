  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot program will assess whether an enhanced PCMH model with more intensive management&#xD;
      and intervention can improve chronic disease patient outcomes, improve healthcare delivery,&#xD;
      and reduce healthcare costs. Participants in this program are current patients at Leland&#xD;
      Medical Clinic and are either enrolled, or eligible to enroll, in Mississippi's Medicaid&#xD;
      program. This pilot program will test the effectiveness of high-quality interventions&#xD;
      comprising of: (1) an educational intervention focusing on chronic disease management and (2)&#xD;
      home visits by a trained community outreach worker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot program will evaluate both process measures and outcome measures. Examples of&#xD;
      process measures include, but are not limited to, the number of patients enrolled in each&#xD;
      intervention group, the number of educational classes attended by a unique patient, and the&#xD;
      number of home visits a unique patient receives. Examples of outcomes measures include, but&#xD;
      are not limited to, change in patient HbA1C levels, change in patient LDL/HDL levels, change&#xD;
      in patient blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) levels, and a comparison of patient cost&#xD;
      data (total expenditure, expenditures by other major categories like hospital, pharmacy,&#xD;
      etc.) After baseline measurements, patient clinical values will be acquired every 3 months&#xD;
      for the duration of their engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot project has three specific goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal 1: Improve healthcare delivery for chronic disease patients enrolled in Mississippi&#xD;
      Medicaid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal 2: Improve clinical outcomes for chronic disease patients enrolled in Mississippi&#xD;
      Medicaid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal 3: Reduce Mississippi Medicaid costs for chronic disease patients enrolled in this pilot&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

      Research Protocol including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research project is to test whether an enhanced PCMH model with more&#xD;
      intensive management and intervention can improve patient outcomes and reduce costs related&#xD;
      to chronic disease conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leland Medical Clinic patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ages 18+&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medicaid beneficiaries or are Medicaid eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of diabetes and at least one other chronic condition, and an A1c value of 7.5&#xD;
           or above&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leland Medical Clinic patient records will be reviewed to identify potentially eligible&#xD;
      patients and a flag will be put on their record for them to be approached at their next&#xD;
      office visit for screening, or they could be actively contacted by the clinic by mail or&#xD;
      phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once identified as meeting inclusion criteria, patients will be randomized into two additive&#xD;
      intervention groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Education&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Education + Home Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions are additive because if a patient is randomized into group 1, the patient&#xD;
      will receive clinical care plus the educational intervention. Meanwhile, if a patient is&#xD;
      randomized into group 2, the patient will receive clinical care, education and home&#xD;
      visitation. All patients will receive the same level of clinical care regardless of which&#xD;
      intervention group patients are randomly assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first intervention category is an educational program which will be a 10-week series of&#xD;
      classes with patients meeting once per week. Led by an interdisciplinary team, including&#xD;
      dietitians, nurses, health educators, and community members. Topics of this intervention will&#xD;
      include disease self-management support, healthy eating, cooking, exercise, and mental&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second intervention category is comprised of education and home visits. A trained&#xD;
      community health worker will conduct home visits to assist patients with social, economic and&#xD;
      behavioral problems by referring patients, where appropriate, to: domestic violence services,&#xD;
      employment placement, benefit enrollment, community action agencies (bill pay, utilities),&#xD;
      ACA enrollment, homeless shelters, and housing authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient's clinical outcomes will be measured at the Leland Medical Clinic during regular&#xD;
      visits. For example, diabetes patients' HbA1C, LDL/HDL, systolic and diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure, and BMI levels will be recorded every 3 months. Patient satisfaction will also be&#xD;
      recorded assessed using the SF-12 patient satisfaction survey, which will be administered&#xD;
      every clinical visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject population will comprise of Leland Medical Clinic's:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diabetes patients, age 18+ with an A1c of 7.5 or above who are enrolled in Mississippi&#xD;
           Medicaid; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diabetes patients, age 18+ with an A1c of 7.5 or above who are eligible for Mississippi&#xD;
           Medicaid enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leland Medical Clinic's electronic patient records will be reviewed to identify potentially&#xD;
      eligible patients. Potentially eligible patients will be contacted by a study staff member,&#xD;
      who will confirm eligibility, consent, and randomize them to one of three intervention&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Length of research procedure and time commitment required of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of this pilot program will be approximately two years. The time length will&#xD;
      largely depend upon the speed of recruitment (identifying, consenting, and randomizing). The&#xD;
      time commitment required of patients will depend on which intervention group(s) a patient may&#xD;
      be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient is randomized to the education-only intervention group, a patient will meet for&#xD;
      10 weeks for once per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient is randomized to the education plus home visitation intervention group, the&#xD;
      patient will meet for the time commitments required for the education intervention (10 weeks&#xD;
      for once per week) and participate in at least 10 weeks of home visits (the actual number of&#xD;
      required home visits will depend on the needs of the patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will primarily take place in Leland Medical Clinic regardless of intervention&#xD;
      group. For patients enrolled in the home visitation intervention group, part of the&#xD;
      intervention could occur within patients' homes or agreed upon locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of a power analysis, a minimum of 90 patients or 45 per intervention&#xD;
      group will be randomly assigned to an intervention group. Using patient clinical data,&#xD;
      patient outcomes will be assessed every 3 months for a total of a year after a baseline&#xD;
      measurement which will occur after group randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To statistically analyze these outcomes, differences-in-differences regression models will be&#xD;
      performed with HbA1c, cholesterol levels (HDL/LDL), blood pressure levels (systolic,&#xD;
      diastolic), and patient Body-Mass Index (BMI) as the outcome variables and using patient age,&#xD;
      gender, race, and ethnicity as control variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of who will gather the data and how they are/will be trained:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leland Medical Clinic will employ a dietitian and at least one home visitation community&#xD;
      health worker. The dietitian and community health worker will collect individual patient&#xD;
      process measures covering data pertinent to health education classes and the number of home&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measurements, such as HbA1c, will be collected by clinic staff at Leland Medical&#xD;
      Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sources of funding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding for this project is awarded annually by the Mississippi Division of Medicaid as&#xD;
      approved by the Mississippi State Legislature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to the subject or to others:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leland Medical Clinic patients will benefit from this pilot program through enrollment in&#xD;
      high-quality health interventions for managing chronic diseases. Patients living with chronic&#xD;
      diseases will have an increased likelihood to receive chronic disease self-management&#xD;
      education and case management. Patients will have an increased likelihood to be treated&#xD;
      earlier and with appropriate care, which will improve patient health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks -&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Describe the possible risks, discomforts, and inconvenience to the subjects and the&#xD;
      precautions that will be taken to minimize them (include physical, psychological and social&#xD;
      risks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are minimal physical, psychological, or social risks to the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Describe appropriate controls, screenings methods, follow-up procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leland Medical Clinic has installed data security protocols which includes controlling data&#xD;
      access and password security. Leland Medical Clinic staff have completed background checks on&#xD;
      all project team members. Project team were also trained in HIPAA procedures and compliance.&#xD;
      This training will be repeated during the first quarter of each calendar year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Describe what constitutes termination from the study before its completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may be terminated from the study if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. They die prior to the study's completion;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Their participation causes a concern of a threat of physical or psychological threat to&#xD;
           themselves, other study subjects, and/or study team members;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. They choose to opt-out of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Describe how confidentiality will be maintained including confidentiality of data&#xD;
                collection and who will have access to the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leland Medical Clinic staff members and associated research members complete HIPAA/Privacy&#xD;
      training annually. The clinic executes Confidentiality Agreements with its employees and has&#xD;
      established controls regarding the use of Protected Health Information (PHI) maintained&#xD;
      within all Information Systems which includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disallowing the disclosure of information/PHI to unauthorized persons without the&#xD;
           appropriate consent of the information/PHI owner except as permitted under applicable&#xD;
           DHA policy and/or Federal or State law;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Limiting access to the information/PHI contained in, or obtained from, Information&#xD;
           Systems to authorized users;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protect Information/PHI against accidental or unauthorized access, modifications,&#xD;
           disclosures, or destruction through unauthorized access to any passwords, user&#xD;
           identifications, or other information that may be used to access Information Systems,&#xD;
           whether those systems belong to DHA or to private parties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, Leland Medical Clinic and DHA-affiliated researchers are governed by a Data Use&#xD;
      Agreement (DUA) with the Mississippi Division of Medicaid. Data is transferred in a HIPAA&#xD;
      compliant, secure environment. Access to the data is limited to health care professionals who&#xD;
      have a relationship with the subjects, members of Leland Medical Clinic's project team and&#xD;
      the project evaluators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent is not required as HIPAA permits disclosure as long as Leland Medical Clinic and&#xD;
      DHA-affiliated researchers will be sharing patient data with only those health care&#xD;
      professionals that also have a relationship with the individual who is the subject of the&#xD;
      PHI. Further, the MS Medicaid Notice of Privacy Practices and the application form for&#xD;
      Medicaid and CHIP authorize providers to share information with each other. Thus, the DHA can&#xD;
      use an &quot;opt out&quot; approach to consent. HIPAA section 164.5220 allows us to share data unless&#xD;
      the Medicaid beneficiary asks and the clinic agrees to stop sharing information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although not required for this project as explained above, upon initial engagement, patients&#xD;
      will be provided an enrollment form to review and sign. This form will explain to patients&#xD;
      what is required of them and patients will be advised of how they may opt out of the program.&#xD;
