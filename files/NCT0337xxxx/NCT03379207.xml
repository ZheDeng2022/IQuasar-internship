    <textblock>
      Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.&#xD;
      Despite recent improvement in acute management (specifically for administration of&#xD;
      antibiotics) many severe presentations of pneumonia worsen, progressing to Acute Respiratory&#xD;
      Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a clinical entity with 40% hospital mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysregulation of immune response is thought to be largely implicated in severe pneumonia&#xD;
      progressing to ARDS. Notably, experimental studies have recently suggested the implication of&#xD;
      non-conventional T lymphocytes and innate cells in this immunopathology. However, no data are&#xD;
      available in Humans in clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore the role of non-conventional T cells in pneumonia and ARDS, in&#xD;
      participants. For this purpose, 100 participants admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of CAP will be included, and 50 &quot;control&quot; participants with no pneumonia nor shock.&#xD;
      Presence and functionality of non-conventional T cells and innate cells will be explored&#xD;
      using flow-cytometry and ex-vivo stimulation, alongside with cytokines productions. These&#xD;
      analyses are conducted in the blood, and, for invasively ventilated participants, in tracheal&#xD;
      aspirates or broncho-alveolar fluids if available. For each participants included, the&#xD;
      analyses are conducted at different time-points during ICU stay: inclusion, day 3, day 8 and&#xD;
      day 15. Moreover, participants with ARDS, for whom a post-ICU follow-up program is normally&#xD;
      established after discharge, will have blood analysis from blood samples taken during the&#xD;
      follow-up visit up to 8 months after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunophenotypage and functionality of non-conventional T cells and innate cells will be&#xD;
      compared to clinical parameters and their evolution, between &quot;CAP&quot; participants and &quot;Control&quot;&#xD;
      participants&quot;, and for each participants, according to the different time-point of analysis,&#xD;
      in order to better understand dynamic of innate immunity during pneumonia and ARDS.&#xD;

      - Clinical and scientific background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite&#xD;
      recent improvement in acute management (specifically for administration of antibiotics),&#xD;
      severe pneumonia can worsen and ultimately progressing to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome&#xD;
      (ARDS), a clinical entity with an inacceptable 40% hospital mortality. From a&#xD;
      pathophysiological point of view, ARDS is characterized by a deregulation of pulmonary&#xD;
      inflammation initially triggered by the local aggression, which is, in two-third of the&#xD;
      cases, a pneumonia. Alteration of tissue repair is another major characteristic of this&#xD;
      entity. So far, the scientific knowledge on this pathophysiology did not translate into&#xD;
      specific therapy that could modulate efficiently the inflammatory response and to control the&#xD;
      progression from pneumonia to ARDS, and/or to improve tissue repair. Thus, a complete&#xD;
      reconsideration of the pathophysiological mechanisms is mandatory. Recent progresses in&#xD;
      mucosal biology and innate immunity give interesting new opportunities. Specifically,&#xD;
      recently discovered unconventional T cells have shown to be major actors in shaping and&#xD;
      modulating early immune responses in the lung mucosa during microbial aggressions and for&#xD;
      secondary tissue repair. However, these evidences are limited to pre-clinical models. In many&#xD;
      other human diseases (oncology, immune diseases), these sub-populations are already being&#xD;
      explored as potential targets for immune therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to explore potential implications of unconventional T cells during&#xD;
      human severe pneumonia and ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This translational study will complement experimental approaches currently undertaken in the&#xD;
      laboratory exploring the role of unconventional T cells in murine models of severe pneumonia&#xD;
      and ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective single-center study including participants admitted in Intensive Care&#xD;
      Department of the university hospital of Tours for community-acquired pneumonia. Given the&#xD;
      exploratory nature of the study, we designed a &quot;control&quot; group of participants admitted to&#xD;
      ICU without evident signs of pneumonia and shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants: 300 for &quot;pneumonia&quot; group, and 50 for &quot;control&quot; group&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Interventions and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected at inclusion, day 3, 8 and 15 during patient's stay in ICU.&#xD;
      For mechanically ventilated participants, tracheal aspirates will be also collected at the&#xD;
      same timing. If available, broncho-alveolar lavages will be also collected. If ARDS or&#xD;
      Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) are subsequently diagnosed, supplemental blood and&#xD;
      tracheal aspirates samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples and airway fluid samples will be treated to perform flow cytometry analysis for&#xD;
      immunophenotypage (cellular content). In some cases, intra-cellular staining will be&#xD;
      performed to assess cytokine production and/or transcription factor expression. Functions of&#xD;
      unconventional T cells will also be performed after ex vivo stimulation on purified&#xD;
      population (cell sorting). Cytokine level sand transcriptomic analyses will also be performed&#xD;
      on blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical characteristics (including respiratory parameters, blood gas, organ dysfunctions,&#xD;
      survival at day 28 and day 90) will also be collected. Thus, frequency, activation status and&#xD;
      functions of unconventional T cells will be dynamically analyzed in regard of clinical&#xD;
      evolution within-individuals and across pneumonia vs control groups. A particular focus will&#xD;
      be made on respiratory parameters (ventilation mode, and for participants with ARDS, P/F&#xD;
      ratio, driving pressure), organ dysfunctions (as measured by SOFA score), and microbial&#xD;
      documentation of the pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, participants treated for ARDS are usually followed in a post-ICU follow-up clinic&#xD;
      program in the ICU where the research is conducted. Thus, investigators will perform analysis&#xD;
      of the unconventional T cell compartment (blood samples) in the participants firstly enrolled&#xD;
      in the study. This will allow exploration of long-term imprinting on the innate immune&#xD;
      response after the initial trigger.&#xD;
