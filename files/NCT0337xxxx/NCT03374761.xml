    <textblock>
      Families First Home Visiting Program (Families First) is a parenting support program anchored&#xD;
      on children's rights that gives parents clear guidance on child development, parenting, and&#xD;
      positive discipline practices. Families First is an adaptation of the Positive Discipline in&#xD;
      Everyday Parenting (PDEP) Program for the West Java context. This trial aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Families First. This is a pragmatic, delayed-entry, parallel-group,&#xD;
      stratified, cluster-randomized controlled trial in a real-world setting. Twenty rural and&#xD;
      urban villages in the Cianjur district of Indonesia, involving 720 caregivers of children up&#xD;
      to 7 years of age, are randomized to two parallel arms. Villages receive either a parenting&#xD;
      program consisting of 10 group sessions and 4 home visits or the standard community health&#xD;
      and social services. After completion of the trial period, the delayed group is offered the&#xD;
      program. The primary outcome is self-reported frequency of corporal/physical and emotional&#xD;
      punishment. The secondary outcomes are indicators of involved and positive parenting.&#xD;
      Concurrent process evaluation and qualitative research are conducted to identify program&#xD;
      satisfaction and facilitators and barriers to the implementation. Outcome data are collected&#xD;
      immediately after the intervention and six months later. The results will be used to inform a&#xD;
      violence prevention strategy in West Java and possible scale up in of the intervention in&#xD;
      Indonesia.&#xD;

      Aims and objectives The primary objective of this study is to compare, among caregivers of&#xD;
      children aged 0-7 years in Cianjur district, Indonesia, the effectiveness of the Families&#xD;
      First Program in reducing rates of violent discipline episodes in the home in comparison to&#xD;
      rates observed under the standard community health and social service provision. The study&#xD;
      will also identify unintended positive and negative effects of this program; determine&#xD;
      facilitators and barriers to its implementation in this context; and assess facilitators,&#xD;
      mentors, and families' satisfaction with the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site eligibility Data will be collected across 20 villages or clusters that represent the&#xD;
      general population in four sub-districts (Campaka, Ciranjang, Karang tengah, and Naringgul)&#xD;
      in Cianjur district, West Java Province, Indonesia. Selected villages will consist of (a)&#xD;
      rural and urban/peri-urban communities; (b) not been exposed to the Families First Program;&#xD;
      (c) reachable within a 1-hour driving distance of the sub-district office and 1-8 hours&#xD;
      driving distance of the district capital; (d) located at ample distance from other clusters;&#xD;
      and (e) local political leaders provide approval for the intervention and the evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Stratified randomization will be used to select 20 clusters among the eligible&#xD;
      38 study clusters in rural and urban settings in the four sub-districts in a 1:1 ratio for&#xD;
      the intervention and the control arms. Clusters will be randomized to avoid the resentment or&#xD;
      contamination that might occur as a result of delivering the intervention to some families&#xD;
      but not others in the community. Randomization will be done in a Random Allocation Ceremony&#xD;
      led by the research team and attended by the chiefs from all participating villages as well&#xD;
      as staff from the implementing agency. The ceremony will follow a step-by-step lottery and&#xD;
      documentation procedure that includes the use of 20 sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed and&#xD;
      stapled envelopes independently prepared by the lead investigator. Aluminium foil inside the&#xD;
      envelope will render the envelope impermeable to intense light. The ceremony will be&#xD;
      video-recorded. Eligible families will be identified before randomly assigning villages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement strategy The outcome measures for this study are given in the measurement section&#xD;
      of the registration document. The original measurement strategy was to use full measures that&#xD;
      have already been applied in this field. Piloting of the original plan indicated that this&#xD;
      would not be feasible as there were too many items, many of which would not be appropriate or&#xD;
      relevant to the context. Instead, the measurement strategy was to use outcome indicators:&#xD;
      single items; indices by cumulating responses over several related items; or full&#xD;
      measures/subscales with total scores validated using Rasch analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-demographic covariates Socio-demographic characteristics that will be documented&#xD;
      include: a) Child: age, gender, orphanhood status, siblings, physical health, and school&#xD;
      status; (b) Mother/caretaker: age, gender, marital status, education level, physical and&#xD;
      mental health, ethnicity and cultural background, school/employment status; (c) Family:&#xD;
      urban/rural location &amp; type of residence, household structure, family structure, economy, and&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative and process evaluation assessments Linked qualitative methods will be used to&#xD;
      develop and validate data collection measures (pilot) and to add depth and understanding of&#xD;
      process and outcomes. During the randomized trial stages, they will explore caregivers' and&#xD;
      implementers' experiences in the program and how service delivery, socio-economic, cultural,&#xD;
      and other factors may impact the effectiveness and scalability of the intervention.&#xD;
      Qualitative methods (in Bahasa and Sundanese) include semi-structured interviews with&#xD;
      caregivers, implementers (Save the Children/non-governmental organization staff, mentors, and&#xD;
      facilitators) and community leaders; focus group interviews with participating caregivers and&#xD;
      implementers; observation of group sessions; record analysis; and visual methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facilitator's tracking forms will be used to record attendance and level of engagement by&#xD;
      caregivers, as well as the extent to which facilitators followed the program manual. Process&#xD;
      evaluation outcomes will be assessed through checklists to track implementation fidelity,&#xD;
      program exposure/attendance, and a brief program satisfaction questionnaire for caregivers in&#xD;
      intervention sites, facilitators, and mentors post-intervention. Implementer records of&#xD;
      program attendance and fidelity in the delivery of the intervention (as assessed by&#xD;
      observation of sessions by mentors) will also be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and sample size calculation The study is powered to detect a change&#xD;
      considered to be both significant clinically and plausible on the primary outcome. A sample&#xD;
      size of N = 720 families will allow measuring a reduction of 15.2% in parent-reported use of&#xD;
      violent discipline at home from the initial estimated prevalence of 30% (SKTA 2013) with an Î±&#xD;
      level of 0.05 and 90% power, assuming 0.02 intra-class correlation and 80% participation&#xD;
      rate. While each family will likely have more than one child, the outcome concordance across&#xD;
      children is likely to be very high (&gt;0.8) and so the sample size calculation considers the&#xD;
      number of families, recognizing that the unit of analysis will be the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Types of analysis There will be only one analysis when all participants have been randomized.&#xD;
      There will be administrative analyses done to ensure data accuracy on a continual basis. A&#xD;
      baseline table reflecting the demographic profile of the households and caregivers by arm&#xD;
      will be compiled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is frequency of three types of punishment practices in the past month&#xD;
      which will be aggregated into a cumulative rate of number of punishments over days. For&#xD;
      comparative purposes, the primary outcome will be evaluated as any- vs. non-punishment. This&#xD;
      rate will be ascertained for all participants in both trial arms three times. The main&#xD;
      analysis will be logistic regression using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to nest&#xD;
      families within villages to test the main hypothesis related to the superiority of the&#xD;
      program in reducing the rate of physical and emotional punishment over the period of the&#xD;
      study. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, end of intervention, and follow-up (i.e., 6&#xD;
      months after end of intervention). The primary comparison is at the end of the intervention;&#xD;
      comparisons at follow-up are considered exploratory. The superiority of the program will be&#xD;
      tested by including main effects for program and for time along with a program by time&#xD;
      interaction. The linearity of the association with time will be considered to allow for the&#xD;
      possibility of non-linear associations. Variables which reduce variance in the outcome will&#xD;
      be considered for inclusion (sex and position (parent or child) of the reporting family&#xD;
      member, number of children in the family, etc.). Although confounding is not expected to be&#xD;
      an issue due to the randomization, villages will be compared on key factors and any variables&#xD;
      showing large imbalances by randomization group will be added to the model. The investigators&#xD;
      will adopt an intention-to-treat principle to analyze all outcomes and all persons will be&#xD;
      analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized. A secondary analysis will estimate the&#xD;
      impact of the program the other relevant outcomes. Program effects will also be examined&#xD;
      using GEE to adjust for clustering of members within families and families within villages.&#xD;
      Counts will be analyzed with poisson regression, binary outcomes with logistic regression and&#xD;
      continuous scales with linear regression. The investigators will conduct a gender-based&#xD;
      analysis (sex of the child) for exploratory purposes. The investigators will also explore&#xD;
      whether families with more children or children of different age groups, or families with&#xD;
      differently-abled children respond differently to the program. Another sub-group analyses&#xD;
      will explore the impact of the intervention among people in single-headed households,&#xD;
      first-time parents, and teenage parents. Analysis and reporting of the results will follow&#xD;
      the CONSORT guidelines for reporting randomized controlled trials. Preliminary findings will&#xD;
      be shared with the Advisory Committee and interpreted in the context of relevant policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and monitoring Tablet-based questionnaires will be administered orally to&#xD;
      caregivers in their homes. The Census and Survey Processing System (CSPro), a widely-used&#xD;
      public domain software package that allows for collection of data and later uploading to the&#xD;
      secure server, will be used for entering, editing, and tabulating data. An index child will&#xD;
      be randomly selected at the beginning of the baseline interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be monitored for quality, contextual appropriateness, and regulatory&#xD;
      compliance. An independent advisory committee composed of academics and specialists with an&#xD;
      expertise in child protection in Indonesia from government, non-governmental, and donor&#xD;
      agencies will participate in the continuous monitoring of the study. Program implementers&#xD;
      will monitor the intervention through facilitators and mentors' weekly meetings, and local&#xD;
      visits by other program staff. Any adverse events observed by researchers or implementers&#xD;
      will be assessed to decide whether additional investigation or a modification of the&#xD;
      intervention may be indicated.&#xD;
