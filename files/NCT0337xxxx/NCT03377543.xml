  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Goal of this project is to investigate whether increases in inflammation that result from&#xD;
      common patterns of restricting sleep on week nights and catching up on sleep over the weekend&#xD;
      are caused by disruption in the newly discovered inflammatory resolution pathways. These&#xD;
      pathways are crucial in the active termination of the inflammatory response, and their&#xD;
      disruption may contribute to ongoing unresolved inflammation, which has been observed not&#xD;
      only during periods of sleep restriction, but also after recovery sleep has been obtained. If&#xD;
      the hypothesis is true, it is possible that increasing the body's natural production of&#xD;
      endogenous, inflammatory resolution mediators may provide a non-behavioral strategy to limit&#xD;
      the inflammatory consequences in those undergoing periods of sleep restriction with&#xD;
      intermittent recovery sleep.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low-grade or unresolved inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of many human diseases.&#xD;
      Common sleep patterns of restricting sleep during the work week and &quot;catching up&quot; on sleep&#xD;
      over the weekend lead to inflammatory upregulation that does not recover completely after the&#xD;
      weekend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this proposal is to investigate, for the first time, inflammatory resolution&#xD;
      pathways. Inflammatory resolution mediators, such as resolvins, are derived from omega-3 free&#xD;
      fatty acids and actively 'turn-off' inflammation. Based on preliminary data, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that common sleep restriction-recovery patterns disrupt&#xD;
      inflammatory resolution pathways, making it difficult to return to inflammatory homeostasis.&#xD;
      If true, pharmacologically increasing the body's natural production of endogenous&#xD;
      inflammatory resolution mediators may provide a way to reduce the detrimental inflammatory&#xD;
      consequences of common sleep restriction-recovery patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis will be tested using an experimental model that mimics common patterns of&#xD;
      restricting sleep on weekdays and &quot;catching up&quot; on sleep on the weekend. The proposal will&#xD;
      further utilize the unique ability of low-dose aspirin, which - like no other non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug - is able to activate inflammatory resolution pathways. Healthy women&#xD;
      and men between the ages of 18 to 65 years will be tested under three, 11-day in-hospital&#xD;
      stays, during which participants will be exposed to control sleep or common patterns of sleep&#xD;
      restriction-recovery. The three in-hospital stays will be combined with preemptive&#xD;
      administration of low-dose aspirin or a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeting inflammatory resolution pathways could provide a novel, non-behavioral strategy to&#xD;
      mitigate both inflammatory consequences and future disease risks in those undergoing periods&#xD;
      of sleep restriction-recovery patterns - a behavior pattern that is unlikely to be eradicated&#xD;
      in the near future, as changes in sleep are generally difficult to make and to maintain.&#xD;
