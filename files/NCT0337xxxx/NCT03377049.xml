  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a technique using cone beam CT perfusion (CBCTP) imaging with an&#xD;
      acetazolamide challenge as a potential diagnostic tool to detect a defect in cerebral&#xD;
      autoregulation at a time when it has not yet caused clinically apparent signs or symptoms. 30&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled at the University of Wisconsin - Madison and can expect to be&#xD;
      on study for about 2 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acetazolamide or vasodilatory challenge should identify subjects having a abnormal&#xD;
      cerebrovascular reactivity capacity. More specifically, after receiving the drug there will&#xD;
      not be the expected increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in some of the subjects because&#xD;
      they are already suffering from a disturbance in the vasculature's ability to respond to the&#xD;
      signal for vasodilation. The investigators believe the presence of this deficit will be&#xD;
      helpful in identifying patients who are at risk for potential brain ischemia due to this&#xD;
      decreased capacity to autoregulate if/when clinically significant vasospasm occurs. The&#xD;
      investigators predict that acetazolamide-activated regional cerebral blood flow studies will&#xD;
      be more sensitive in the detection of mild cerebral vasospasm and will not just detect&#xD;
      changes in cerebral blood flow as does standard perfusion imaging, but will provide&#xD;
      information regarding changes in cerebrovascular reactivity. Under these circumstances, a&#xD;
      better predictor of those patients at risk of cerebral infarction due to delayed vasospasm&#xD;
      would be delineated. Identifying this &quot;high-risk cohort&quot; prior to the onset of clinically&#xD;
      apparent symptoms would result in the institution of preventative measures such as triple H&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this proposal is to conduct a feasibility study of acetazolamide activated&#xD;
      C-arm cone beam CT perfusion (CBCTP) to determine its application in the prediction of&#xD;
      symptomatic cerebral vasospasm (i.e. ischemia or stroke) in patients with aneurysmal&#xD;
      subarachnoid hemorrhage. The initial plan is to obtain C-arm CBCTP pre- and post-intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of 1g acetazolamide within 24 hours of symptom onset in aneurysmal subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage patients. The hypothesis is that some of these patients that will later develop&#xD;
      clinical vasospasm of a degree sufficient to cause cerebral ischemia. The investigators&#xD;
      believe this cohort of patients will demonstrate altered cerebrovascular reactivity during&#xD;
      the acetazolamide challenge at a time before there is either angiographic evidence of&#xD;
      vasospasm or clinical evidence of abnormal perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus far in the pilot study,10 participants have been enrolled. The investigators have&#xD;
      expanded enrollment to 30 participants. The data collected from research scans have thus far&#xD;
      been reproducible and collected with clinical ease. There have been no complications with&#xD;
      imaging acquisition and there have been no safety concerns for participants. Having so far&#xD;
      achieved the study objectives with the initial 10 participants the protocol has been amended&#xD;
      to allow for the larger cohort of 30 participants. With this larger sample size, the&#xD;
      investigators will not only continue to assess safety and reproducibility, but also will hope&#xD;
      to capture a large number of patients who develop vasospasm in order further assess the&#xD;
      utility of the research study in its application as a screening diagnostic tool to predict&#xD;
      the subsequent occurrence of delayed vasospasm in subjects with an acute aneurysmal&#xD;
      subarachnoid hemorrhage.&#xD;

    <description>Participants entered into the study as a cohort, will because of their participation, undergo only two additional digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) imaging acquisitions. These will be done in conjunction with their standard diagnostic DSA evaluation and consist of two CBCTPs, one before and one after administration of 1 g acetazolamide through a peripheral IV line. Each CBCTP will require administration of 75-100 mL iodinated contrast medium also through an intravenous line. Neither of these imaging studies will be used for clinical decision making, but would be processed and evaluated at later date for a formal analysis of the results. Following completion of diagnostic imaging subjects will receive the usual standard of care for treatment of their ruptured aneurysm i.e. endovascular embolization or open surgical clipping.</description>
