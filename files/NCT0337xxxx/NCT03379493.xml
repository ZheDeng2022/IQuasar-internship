  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, single arm, open-label, single institution, phase I study to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ET190L1 ARTEMIS™ T cells in patients ≥ 18 years&#xD;
      of age with relapsed or refractory CD19+ Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will follow a traditional dose-escalation model to establish the MTD and&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of infused ET190L1 ARTEMIS™ T cells following&#xD;
      lympho-depleting chemotherapy. Two sequential cohorts of patients will be recruited to&#xD;
      fulfill this study, those in the dose escalation cohort (for determination of MTD and RP2D)&#xD;
      and those in the expansion cohort (treated on the RP2D). The study will have concurrent&#xD;
      phases of screening, pre-treatment, treatment, primary follow-up, safety, and survival&#xD;
      follow-up. The total duration of the study involvement for the patient is 15 years. Efficacy&#xD;
      will be assessed until progression and safety will be assessed throughout the full duration&#xD;
      of the study. Twelve to 24 patients will be treated to determine the MTD. Following&#xD;
      determination of the MTD, an expansion cohort consisting of 6 patients per disease subtype&#xD;
      (n= 30) will be recruited.&#xD;
