      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omega-7 fatty acids are found in the oil extracted from certain fish and nuts like macadamia.&#xD;
      Palmitoleic acid is one of the most common omega-7 fatty acids. Many studies suggest that&#xD;
      this oil is good for heart health. Researchers want to find out more about these potential&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how oil enriched with palmitoleic acid (Omega-7 oil) affects metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults at least 18 years old with no known history of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects not allergic to fish oil and fish products&#xD;
&#xD;
      Females that are not pregnant and are not planning a pregnancy during the length of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with questions about their health, medical history, and&#xD;
      medicines they take.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 4 visits over 24 weeks. The visits may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood drawn from a vein in the arm by a needle stick. Sometimes participants will have&#xD;
           to fast before the blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature) taken&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body mass index measured&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index test may be performed. The stiffness of the participant s&#xD;
           arteries will be measured by reading blood pressure in the arms and legs and monitoring&#xD;
           the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional stool samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A short review of participants physical activity and diet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A supply of dietary supplements to take between visits. Participants will take 4 gel&#xD;
           capsules a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a food and exercise journal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation will be provided to subjects that complete the study&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Serum cholesterol is transported by lipoproteins, such as VLDL, LDL and HDL, which vary in&#xD;
      their relationship to cardiovascular disease risk. LDL, for example, is proatherogenic,&#xD;
      whereas HDL is cardio-protective. Palmitoleic acid (cis-C16:1 n-7), an omega-7 fatty acid&#xD;
      with 16 carbons in length with a single double bound in the n-7 position, have been shown in&#xD;
      mice and human to decrease proatherogenic lipoproteins, such as LDL, and reduce&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors. This study will test the hypothesis that palmitoleate&#xD;
      supplementation in humans will favorably alter the lipoprotein lipid profile in regard to&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk. We will also assess other parameters related to lipoprotein&#xD;
      composition and function, as well as other biomarkers related to coagulation and&#xD;
      inflammation, which have previously been shown to be possibly affected by supplementation&#xD;
      with omega-7 fatty acid. In addition, previous animal studies have indicated the palmitoleate&#xD;
      induced satiety and suppressed bodyweight gain, possibly through enhancement of the release&#xD;
      of satiety hormones. In this clinical trial, we, therefore will also examine the effect of&#xD;
      concentrated palmitoleate on satiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical research project is designed as a pilot, randomized, double-blinded, crossover&#xD;
      study that will investigate the effect of concentrated oil enriched with palmitoleate on&#xD;
      lipoprotein metabolism and satiety. Subjects will either receive control olive oil enriched&#xD;
      in oleic acid, a longer-chain monounsaturated fatty acid (cis-C18:1 n-9), or a concentrate&#xD;
      oil supplement produced from pollock fish (rich in palmitoleate) for approximately 8-10&#xD;
      weeks, with a wash out period of 8-10 weeks between the two arms of the study. The study&#xD;
      consists of 4 outpatient visits when laboratory or research samples and CAVI tests will be&#xD;
      performed. A 7-day food diary, pill count, and red cell membrane fatty acid levels will be&#xD;
      monitored to assess compliance. The effect of the supplement on satiety will be assessed at&#xD;
      each visit.&#xD;
