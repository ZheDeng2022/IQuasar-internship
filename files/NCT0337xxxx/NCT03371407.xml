    <textblock>
      Parkinson Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative pathology characterized by the death of&#xD;
      dopaminergic neurons in of the substantia nigra pars compacta. The main clinical symptoms are&#xD;
      akinesia-stiffness-tremor. These motor deficits are due to dysfunction in the network of the&#xD;
      basal ganglia that constitute an ensemble of subcortical nuclei involved in movement control&#xD;
      and motor learning. The implication of the basal ganglia (BG) in movement sequence learning&#xD;
      (i.e. in movement selection processes) has been clearly established. However, their&#xD;
      contribution to adaptation of movement execution remains uncertain. Until recently, the vast&#xD;
      majority of the studies on motor adaptation have focused on one mechanism in particular: an&#xD;
      implicit process through which motor performance is gradually improved on the basis of errors&#xD;
      observed in movement execution, recruiting essentially cerebellar loops. Today, a new line of&#xD;
      research has emerged seeking to identify different mechanisms contributing to motor&#xD;
      adaptation. Specifically, the implication of cognitive strategies and reinforcement learning&#xD;
      mechanisms has been the center of several recent studies, which thus have been emphasizing&#xD;
      the role of the BG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present project is to document the relationship between the behavioral&#xD;
      deficits and the electrophysiological anomalies observed in PD patients in tasks involving&#xD;
      motor adaptation to visual or mechanical perturbations. Recent electrophysiological studies&#xD;
      have revealed anomalies in the oscillatory activity in the BG-cortex loop in PD; namely the&#xD;
      activity in the beta band (~20Hz) presents an excessive synchronization that might contribute&#xD;
      to some behavioral symptoms. Interestingly, recent work has demonstrated that the&#xD;
      synchronization in the BG and their cortical projections is 1) diminished by treatments such&#xD;
      as dopaminergic medication (L-Dopa) or deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus&#xD;
      (NST), and 2) modulated in relation to movement-error processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project,it is planned to to conduct two studies involving each several studies. The&#xD;
      goal of the first study is twofold: first better understand the motor adaptation deficits&#xD;
      specific to different stages of PD disease, and then investigate the influence of the&#xD;
      dopaminergic medication on the latter. In this purpose, the behavioral performance and the&#xD;
      electrophysiological (EEG) activity in PD patients will be examined during the early and more&#xD;
      advanced stages of the pathology, on medication or not (ON or OFF L-Dopa). The specific&#xD;
      interest of this study in the relationship between the beta-band activity and, on one side,&#xD;
      potential deficits in the explicit cognitive strategies recruited in the initial phase of&#xD;
      adaptation and, on the other side, anomalies in reinforcement learning mechanisms implicated&#xD;
      in motor adaptation. A secondary goal will be to interpret the observations in light of&#xD;
      neuroimaging data. The aim of the second study will be to explore oscillatory and&#xD;
      synchronized activities in the BG-cortex loops during motor adaptation to visual or&#xD;
      mechanical perturbations. The recording of NST LFP and EEG will implicated the participation&#xD;
      of implanted PD patients.&#xD;
