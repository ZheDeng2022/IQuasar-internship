  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injuries to the meniscus are common in sport. A meniscectomy is often performed to manage&#xD;
      symptoms associated with the meniscal injury. Following a meniscectomy individuals are highly&#xD;
      likely to develop knee osteoarthritis (OA). Footwear interventions have demonstrated&#xD;
      biomechanical changes during walking and running, in healthy and individuals with&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. With the increased risk of developing OA associated with meniscectomy&#xD;
      patients, understanding biomechanical changes with footwear when compared to healthy&#xD;
      individuals, may provide a conservative approach to delaying or minimising the development of&#xD;
      (OA). There is no current literature assessing the effect footwear has post meniscectomy, so&#xD;
      this is a very novel approach and can yield important results for the management of future&#xD;
      risks. Current evidence supports the use of footwear interventions aiming to minimise OA&#xD;
      progression in older adults during walking. Yet, meniscectomy patients who have sustained an&#xD;
      injury during sport are likely to continue to participate in sport following treatment in&#xD;
      their usual footwear. Further evidence is required to better understand the effect of&#xD;
      footwear interventions during dynamic movements often performed in sport. Previous studies&#xD;
      have assessed customised footwear interventions, however these interventions are not&#xD;
      representative of commercially available interventions that could be widely used by the&#xD;
      general population. Therefore assessing commercially available footwear will give a more&#xD;
      realistic approach to conservative treatment for meniscectomy patients. This project aims to&#xD;
      examine biomechanical differences between commercially available footwear conditions in&#xD;
      healthy individuals and individuals who have had a meniscal injury. Three-dimensional kinetic&#xD;
      and kinematic measures will be assessed during five tasks (walking, running, 90 degrees side&#xD;
      cut, single leg landing, and small knee bend squat), for different footwear conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Injuries to the meniscus are common in sport, often as a result of a traumatic event.&#xD;
      Mitchell et al. (2016) reported 5.1 meniscal injuries per 100 000 athletic exposures, with a&#xD;
      greater proportion reported during competition (11.9 injuries per 100 000 athletic&#xD;
      exposures), compared to practice (2.7 injuries per 100 000 athletic exposures). Rotation&#xD;
      around a planted/ inverted foot has been cited as a common mechanism for meniscal injuries,&#xD;
      followed by landing and jumping movements. The meniscus aids in stabilising the knee, acting&#xD;
      as a shock absorber and transmitting load. Damage to the meniscus is suggest to lead to&#xD;
      altered knee mechanics leading to the initiation or acceleration of osteoarthritis (OA)&#xD;
      development. Prior meniscal tears are commonly reported in OA patients, in addition, reports&#xD;
      suggest 4 to 14 times increased risk of developing OA following a meniscal injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altered knee mechanics have been reported following a meniscal injury, which have been&#xD;
      associated with increased likelihood of developing OA. These changes include reduced contact&#xD;
      area within the joint and increased contact pressure, resulting in reduced ability to&#xD;
      transmit load. Indirect measures of knee loading, such as external knee adductor moments&#xD;
      (EKAM) and knee adduction angular impulses (KAAI), have been associated with increased risk&#xD;
      of developing OA. Knee joint loading is also determined by the coordination of muscle&#xD;
      activity. Greater and longer co-contractions of the medial muscles at the knee have&#xD;
      demonstrated faster development of OA in individuals diagnosed with medial knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meniscectomies are widely used to manage the symptoms associated with meniscus injuries.&#xD;
      Whilst, non-operative therapies have demonstrated improvements in knee pain three years post&#xD;
      intervention. However, following these interventions, alter mechanics of the knee have been&#xD;
      observed. For instance, following a medial meniscectomy, increases in contact area and&#xD;
      pressure at the knee have been observed and suggested to increase the likelihood of&#xD;
      developing OA. Increases in EKAM in meniscectomy patients have been associated with changes&#xD;
      in tibia alignment and GRF lever arm. Non-invasive interventions such as footwear, could&#xD;
      alter biomechanics to lower EKAM and reduce the progression of OA. Following a meniscectomy&#xD;
      procedure, most patients tend to go back to wearing their old trainers. Due to the changes in&#xD;
      the biomechanics of the knee, it can be assumed that they support and cushioning they need&#xD;
      would change too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typical sports movements such as landing and cutting require dynamic control of the knee&#xD;
      which is very under-researched. Muscle strength recovery is also considered to be important&#xD;
      for young individuals after an arthroscopic surgery in order to regain capacity to&#xD;
      participate in sports or other activities as both pre- and post-operative knee extensor&#xD;
      strength have been reported to predict better functional outcome of knee surgery. The&#xD;
      co-contraction between the quadriceps and hamstrings are also important in this as muscle&#xD;
      weakness creates a less stable base. Muscle strength is also essential to control movements&#xD;
      such as stair descent which is essential for everyday living. This is closely linked with&#xD;
      balance and the risk of falling. Having extra support or cushioning in footwear can help aid&#xD;
      this control needed for static and dynamic exercises especially post-surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different footwear interventions have been used in OA patients to reduce knee loading and&#xD;
      pain. Lateral wedges have demonstrated reduced medial knee loading in both affected and&#xD;
      contralateral limbs. In addition, mobility shoes and lateral wedges which provide additional&#xD;
      medial support have been shown to reduce pain in OA patients. However, it is unclear whether&#xD;
      footwear interventions are able to alleviate the risk factors associated with the progression&#xD;
      of OA following a meniscal injury. For effective self-management, post operation the&#xD;
      appropriate footwear is recommended, however there is little evidence to inform what the&#xD;
      appropriate footwear is for patient after surgery or with knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current evidence on footwear interventions on minimising OA development relies on assessment&#xD;
      of linear movements such as walking and running. Yet, it is likely that athletes who sustain&#xD;
      a meniscal injury would return to sport and therefore be required to perform movements that&#xD;
      require a greater demand and muscular control then reported during walking. It is unclear&#xD;
      whether footwear interventions are able to alleviate the risk factors associated with the&#xD;
      progression of OA following a meniscal injury in a younger athletic population. Understanding&#xD;
      knee loading during sport-specific movements and between sports footwear can provide a&#xD;
      greater insight to the risk of OA development for athletic populations. Therefore&#xD;
      understanding the effect of commercially available footwear interventions knee loading during&#xD;
      sport-specific movements could provide a greater insight to the use conservative&#xD;
      interventions to reducing the risk of OA development for athletic populations.&#xD;
