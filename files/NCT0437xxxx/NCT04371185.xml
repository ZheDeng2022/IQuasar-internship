  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized, double-blinded, single-dose, 3-arm parallel, comparative study to&#xD;
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of BAT2206 Injection vs Stelara®&#xD;
      (EU-licensed and US-licensed) in healthy Chinese male subjects. A total of 270 healthy male&#xD;
      subjects are planned to be included and randomized at a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive single&#xD;
      45mg/0.5ml BAT2206 Injection or Stelara® (EU-licensed and US-licensed).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has a screening period of 14 days. PK blood samples will be collected from subjects&#xD;
      to determine the serum concentration of Ustekinumab, thus to evaluate the similarity of the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of the three study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will perform safety evaluation for vital signs, physical examinations,&#xD;
      injection site reaction, ECG, clinical laboratory tests and adverse events throughout the&#xD;
      study. Immunogenicity evaluation (ADA, ADA titration and nAb) will also be evaluated.&#xD;
