  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of COVID -19 in the cancer patient&#xD;
      population. This will be done by looking at the rate of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in&#xD;
      cancer patients receiving cancer therapy, as well as their immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a sub-study of the U-DEPLOY study: UHN Umbrella Trial Defining Coordinated Approach&#xD;
      to Pandemic Trials of COVID-19 and Data Harmonization to Accelerate Discovery. U-DEPLOY helps&#xD;
      to facilitate timely conduct of studies across the University Health Network (UHN) and other&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given increasing community transmission and the possibility of asymptomatic carriage of&#xD;
      virus, it is important to study whether asymptomatic shedders of virus are playing a role in&#xD;
      propagating the pandemic. There is currently little data available regarding cancer patients,&#xD;
      yet, this population may be particularly susceptible to the COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the cancer patient population being at higher risk of COVID-19, no systematic&#xD;
      screening has been established and no biomarkers have been identified to determine which&#xD;
      patient is at higher risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will screen patients on active cancer therapy for COVID-19 as a standard of care&#xD;
      or a research nasopharyngeal test. Blood samples may also be taken to assess any patient&#xD;
      response to the virus and optional saliva samples may also be taken to assess the feasibility&#xD;
      of using patient saliva for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in patients with impaired saliva&#xD;
      production (eg. secondary to cancer treatments such as radiation, chemotherapy, and/or&#xD;
      surgery).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The patient falls under either of the following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Asymptomatic for COVID-19 (as per daily screening at the hospital entrance).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Has symptoms similar to those of COVID-19 (e.g. fever or flu-like symptoms such&#xD;
                  as cough or shortness of breath) that are assessed by the overseeing Investigator&#xD;
                  as being related to disease and unrelated to COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Patients who recovered from previous COVID-19 infection will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patients with fever, or flu-like symptoms assessed by the Investigator to be&#xD;
             related or potentially related to COVID-19 infection will not be eligible.&#xD;
