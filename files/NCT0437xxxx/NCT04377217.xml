  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical diagnosis of Facio-Scapulo-Humeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHMD) requires the&#xD;
      movement of patients to a medical centre and a lengthy examination involving medical&#xD;
      personnel, and may be underestimated in the most moderate cases. Thus, it requires costly and&#xD;
      burdensome logistics both for patients living in remote areas and having to undertake long&#xD;
      and expensive travel, and for clinical staff. This is an obstacle to large-scale diagnosis.&#xD;
      The investigators plan to alleviate these limitations through the use of digital facial&#xD;
      analysis technology that would enable large-scale diagnosis of patients through telemedicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motivated by the reasons described above and by preliminary results, the goal of this project&#xD;
      is to develop methods to automatically detect and monitor the progression of this disease&#xD;
      using computer vision algorithms. In order to do this, the investigators will first build up&#xD;
      a bank of images and videos of patients with moderate to severe FSHMD, patients with other&#xD;
      muscular dystrophies causing facial muscle asymmetry, as well as control subjects without&#xD;
      facial involvement. Each of these subjects will be characterized clinically and genetically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will then develop computer tools using video and audio sensors capable of&#xD;
      detecting facial muscle damage in patients with FSHMD and differentiating them from control&#xD;
      subjects on the one hand and patients with other muscular dystrophies on the other hand. The&#xD;
      investigators wish to use the most recent advances in terms of &quot;deep-learning&quot; and improve&#xD;
      their architecture in order to achieve our objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to this holistic approach, the investigators will study facial recognition&#xD;
      approaches capable of accurately identifying different facial areas on images, as well as the&#xD;
      relevance of different statistical properties of facial dynamics (duration and intensity).&#xD;
      These algorithms will also be useful for monitoring the evolution of facial damage in order&#xD;
      to develop a specific measurement tool that could be used in patient follow-up and in&#xD;
      clinical trials on early stages of the disease.&#xD;
