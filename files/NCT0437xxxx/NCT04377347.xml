  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage, it remains to be investigated if&#xD;
      there is an association between the time from patients call the Emergence Medical&#xD;
      Coordination Center to neurosurgical admission and long-term outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective cohort study with four-year followup. The primary aim is to determine&#xD;
      if the time to neurosurgical admission is associated to labour marked affiliation and&#xD;
      mortality after four years.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Patients that are retired or on social transfer payments the last three months before the&#xD;
        sSAH are excluded from analyses on retirement and labour marked affiliation. However, they&#xD;
        are included in mortality analyses. Also, patients aged 60 years or older are excluded in&#xD;
        analyses of early retirement as reduced work capacity may to a higher degree result in&#xD;
        early voluntary retirement.&#xD;
