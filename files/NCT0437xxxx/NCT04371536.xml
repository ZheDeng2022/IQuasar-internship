  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) affects nearly half a million young children in the United&#xD;
      States. Most children take liquid iron medicine by mouth for at least 3 months. However, some&#xD;
      children take longer to get better with this medicine. This study is trying to compare&#xD;
      different ways of giving iron medicine to young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For young children in the US, the main cause of IDA is nutritional, or not having enough iron&#xD;
      in the foods they eat. This often happens when kids drink too much cow milk and/or not eating&#xD;
      enough foods that have a lot of iron. Iron deficiency is most common in children ages 1 to 4&#xD;
      years of age, during a time that is important for brain development. More severe and&#xD;
      long-lasting IDA is associated with worse brain development outcomes. That is why researchers&#xD;
      want to understand the fastest way for kids with IDA to get better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatment is oral iron medicine for 3 to 6 months. Many children do not take their&#xD;
      iron medicine the full amount of time needed because of side effects like abdominal&#xD;
      discomfort, nausea, constipation, and bad taste. Different factors can contribute to patients&#xD;
      not completing their IDA therapy. Many families do not understand how important it is to&#xD;
      treat IDA or do not have the motivation to continue the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will offer different methods for treating IDA, including a different method to&#xD;
      taking the oral iron therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new method gives oral iron by increasing a family's understanding and motivation.&#xD;
      Another research study that interviewed families of young children with IDA found ways that&#xD;
      helped the patients to continue their therapy. Using that information, a website called&#xD;
      IRONCHILD was created to help motivate parents to get their children to continue the oral&#xD;
      iron medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research studies that compare these different IDA treatment methods in young children are&#xD;
      needed and could have benefits to short-term clinical and long-term brain development.&#xD;
      However, we do not know whether families of young children with IDA will be willing to&#xD;
      participate in this type of study that has different treatment methods (oral iron therapy and&#xD;
      oral iron therapy with a web-based adherence intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn which of the two methods of care will be&#xD;
      the best way for children with iron deficiency anemia to receive therapy.&#xD;

      First, the doctor will confirm that patients are eligible for the study. Patients will&#xD;
      complete the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history including prior hospitalizations, lab results, medications, diet, social&#xD;
           and family history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comprehensive Physical Examination which includes measurement of vital signs,&#xD;
           examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, heart, lungs, abdomen, and skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples: Patients will not have any extra blood draws for this study, as the&#xD;
           investigators will draw the blood during routine blood draws. Investigators will ask to&#xD;
           take a little extra blood (less than half a teaspoon) for research tests. All other&#xD;
           blood draws that patients have while on study will be for routine care and not for&#xD;
           research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be on the study for 12 weeks. Patients will receive dietary counseling on the&#xD;
      amount of cow milk they may have and information sheets on iron-rich foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 different treatments in this study and patients cannot choose which treatment&#xD;
      they receive. Instead, they will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatments. That&#xD;
      means there is a 50-50 chance that patients will receive liquid iron medicine by itself or&#xD;
      that patients will receive liquid iron medicine with access to the website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on which method of care patients are assigned to, they will complete the following&#xD;
      procedures below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Oral Iron Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will receive liquid iron medicine by mouth once per day for 12 weeks. Patients&#xD;
           will first receive this medicine during their first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the Week 4 visit, patients will compete the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood Samples: Patients will not have any extra blood draws (pokes) for this study&#xD;
                as blood for research will be collected during routine blood draws. About less than&#xD;
                half a teaspoon of extra blood will be drawn for research tests. All other blood&#xD;
                draws that patients have while on study will be for routine care and not for&#xD;
                research purposes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Focused Physical Exam which includes measurement of vital signs, examination of the&#xD;
                eyes, mouth, heart, lungs, abdomen, and skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will be asked of any side effects that they may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the Week 8 visit, patients will return to the clinic only to pick up the oral&#xD;
           iron medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the Week 12 visit, patients will complete the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical history including prior hospitalizations, lab results, medications, diet,&#xD;
                social and family history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood Samples: Patients will not have any extra blood draws (pokes) for this study&#xD;
                as blood for research will be collected during routine blood draws. About less than&#xD;
                half a teaspoon of extra blood will be drawn for research tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Focused Physical Exam which includes measurement of vital signs, examination of the&#xD;
                abdomen and skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will be asked of any side effects that they may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Oral Iron Therapy and IRONCHILD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive liquid iron medicine by mouth once per day for 12 weeks. Patients will&#xD;
      receive this medication during their first visit. Patients will also be given access to a&#xD;
      website called IRONCHILD. Patients will be shown the website, including videos, at each&#xD;
      in-clinic visit (Baseline, Week 4, and Week 12). This website was created for patients and&#xD;
      their parent/guardian to help patients learn more about the importance of taking their oral&#xD;
      iron therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will show patients how to use the website. Patients will be given a unique&#xD;
      log-in and password with instructions on how to access the site between visits. There are 3&#xD;
      sessions (one per clinic visit). One session will be completed per visit, and each session&#xD;
      should be about 15 minutes or less. Patients will also be able to access this website from&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Week 4 visit, patients will compete the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Samples: Patients will not have any extra blood draws (pokes) for this study as&#xD;
           blood for research will be collected during routine blood draws. About less than half a&#xD;
           teaspoon of extra blood will be drawn for research tests. All other blood draws that&#xD;
           patients have while on study will be for routine care and not for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Focused Physical Exam which includes measurement of vital signs, examination of the&#xD;
           eyes, mouth, heart, lungs, abdomen, and skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be asked of any side effects that they may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Week 8 Visit, patients will return to the clinic only to pick up their oral iron&#xD;
      medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Week 12 visit, patients will complete the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history including prior hospitalizations, lab results, medications, diet, social&#xD;
           and family history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Samples: Patients will not have any extra blood draws (pokes) for this study as&#xD;
           blood for research will be collected during routine blood draws. About less than half a&#xD;
           teaspoon of extra blood will be drawn for research tests. All other blood draws that&#xD;
           patients have while on study will be for routine care and not for research purposes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Focused Physical Exam which includes measurement of vital signs, examination of the&#xD;
           abdomen and skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be asked of any side effects that they may be having.&#xD;
