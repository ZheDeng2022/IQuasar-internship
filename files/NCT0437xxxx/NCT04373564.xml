  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a postmarketing requirement jointly carried out by four NDA holders (Bayer AG,&#xD;
      Bracco, GE Healthcare and Guerbet) and the CRO IQVIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to create detailed images of the organs and tissue of the human body during&#xD;
      x-ray, CT-scan or MRI investigations, doctors are using contrast media (a kind of dye) which&#xD;
      can be given to patients by injection into a blood vessel or by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers want to find out whether so called gadolinium-based contrast agents&#xD;
      (GBCAs) have an effect on body movement and mental skills when given to participants multiple&#xD;
      times within 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plans to enroll about 2076 participants suffering from a condition for which they&#xD;
      are likely to have at least annually a MRI or another imaging examinations. Only adults up to&#xD;
      65 years will be considered to join this study. During the study duration of 5 years&#xD;
      participants will receive annually a MRI or other imaging tests (such as CT-scan, x-ray) and&#xD;
      will visit the study doctor at least 7 times for physical examinations, laboratory&#xD;
      investigations and tests on body movement and mental skills.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the potential effect of repeated exposure to&#xD;
      either a linear or a macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) on change from&#xD;
      baseline to Year 5 in composite measure of motor and cognitive function among neurologically&#xD;
      normal adults in comparison to a matched non-GBCA- exposed control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives comprise the assessment of the following endpoints in GBCA-exposed&#xD;
      participants as compared to controls a) changes from baseline in composite measure of motor&#xD;
      and cognitive function post-baseline on yearly basis (Years 1 to 4); b) changes from baseline&#xD;
      in each individual test of motor and cognitive function on yearly basis (Years 1 to 5). Total&#xD;
      Gd concentrations in blood and urine samples on yearly basis (Years 1 to 5) and adverse&#xD;
      events will be collected as secondary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of note : The study is considered interventional because of the addition of UE-MRI scans for&#xD;
      all participants, as well as blood sampling and the administration of the motor and cognitive&#xD;
      tests. The GBCA administered as part of the contrast-enhanced MR imaging in the experimental&#xD;
      arms is not the intervention in this study. Neither the protocol nor the investigators assign&#xD;
      patients to a specific GBCA as part of the study, making this part of the study observational&#xD;
      rather than interventional. The participants were already scheduled, prior to study&#xD;
      screening, to undergo CE-MRI as part of their clinical care. The choice of GBCA for the&#xD;
      CE-MRI will be based on medical need and institutional usage of GBCA, independent of study&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
