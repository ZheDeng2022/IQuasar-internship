      In recent decades, medical student interest in a career in mental health appear to be in&#xD;
      decline, possibly due to the perception that the scientific foundation of psychiatry and&#xD;
      psychopharmacology is weaker compared to other fields of medicine.&#xD;

      2008 the nomenclature taskforce was initiated, composed of representatives from five&#xD;

      American College of Neuropsychopharmacology, AsCNP - Asian College of&#xD;
      Neuropsychopharmacology, CINP - International College of Neuropsychopharmacology, IUPHAR -&#xD;
      International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology.2 The result of this effort is the&#xD;
      Neuroscience based Nomenclature (NbN) - a pharmacologically driven nomenclature that focuses&#xD;
      on reflecting current knowledge and on the understanding of the neural system being modified&#xD;

      this research is the first that examine whether putting greater emphasis on neuroscience in&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent decades, medical student interest in a career in mental health appear to be in&#xD;
      decline1. There are multiple factors responsible for the apparent lack of interest in&#xD;
      psychiatry, one of them may be the perception that the scientific foundation of psychiatry&#xD;
      and psychopharmacology is weaker compared to other fields of medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the field of psychopharmacology evolves, the terminology used to describe different&#xD;
      classes of medication becomes increasingly convoluted: at a time when the same agent is used&#xD;
      for the treatment of several different disorders, the nomenclature in use is indication-based&#xD;
      and divided into classes that are disease based - such as Antidepressant, Antipsychotic and&#xD;
      Anxiolytics. These classes, in turn, are divided into subclasses like &quot;Atypical&quot; or &quot;Second&#xD;
      Generation&quot; - terms that give little information regarding the pharmacological properties of&#xD;
      the medication itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This discrepancy between the current naming of psychotropics and the way they are used in&#xD;
      clinical practice is confusing to both the clinician and the patient - and since it fails to&#xD;
      reflect on the current scientific knowledge, may affect the way young medical professionals&#xD;
      perceive the profession of psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to examine ways of improving the current nomenclature in Psychopharmacology, in&#xD;
      2008 the nomenclature taskforce was initiated, composed of representatives from five&#xD;
      international organizations: ECNP - European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, ACNP -&#xD;
      American College of Neuropsychopharmacology, AsCNP - Asian College of&#xD;
      Neuropsychopharmacology, CINP - International College of Neuropsychopharmacology, IUPHAR -&#xD;
      International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology.2 The result of this effort is the&#xD;
      Neuroscience based Nomenclature (NbN) - a pharmacologically driven nomenclature that focuses&#xD;
      on reflecting current knowledge and on the understanding of the neural system being modified&#xD;
      (''pharmacological domain'') and its mode/mechanism of action (''mode of action'')3. The NbN&#xD;
      was widely accepted by both clinicians and leading psychiatric journals4 The need to revise&#xD;
      the teaching methods of psychopharmacology was reviewed over the years, with different&#xD;
      strategies suggested5. To our knowledge, this research is the first that examine whether&#xD;
      putting greater emphasis on neuroscience in the teaching of psychotropics, through the use of&#xD;
      a new terminology, achieve the goal of improving medical students views on psychiatry.&#xD;
