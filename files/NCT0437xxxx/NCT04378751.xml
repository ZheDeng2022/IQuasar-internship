  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, carriers of hereditary genetic mutations have up to an 85% risk of&#xD;
      developing breast cancer compared to 12% in the general population. Overall uptake of genetic&#xD;
      services is generally low, particularly among high-risk African American (AA) women, who&#xD;
      carry a disproportionate burden of breast cancer mortality. Further, although testing close&#xD;
      relatives of individuals who test positive for a pathogenic variant might curtail breast&#xD;
      cancer disparities attributable to hereditary risk, it is unclear how counseled or tested&#xD;
      individuals influence their social and familial networks. Using a randomized control trial&#xD;
      design, the objective of this research project is to test the effectiveness of a culturally&#xD;
      targeted video, previously developed by our research team, on promoting genetic counseling&#xD;
      attendance among AA women determined to be at high risk for breast cancer through cancer&#xD;
      genetic risk assessment in a clinical setting. This study will also test how psychosocial&#xD;
      factors (knowledge, intrinsic motivation, risk perception, and distress) impact the&#xD;
      relationships between intervention exposures (video versus brochure) and compare the impact&#xD;
      of intervention exposures on diffusion of knowledge about genetic counseling through social&#xD;
      network analysis.&#xD;

      Study Design. The investigator will conduct a randomized control trial single-blind control&#xD;
      trial to test the effectiveness of a culturally targeted decision aid video to promote&#xD;
      genetic counseling among African American determined to be high risk for breast cancer&#xD;
      through cancer genetic risk assessment. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive information about genetic counseling using a culturally targeted decision aid video&#xD;
      (treatment group) or a brochure (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Protocol. As part of standard of care, patients will complete a cancer genetic risk&#xD;
      assessment (CGRA) as part of intake on a tablet computer provided by the front desk clinic&#xD;
      staff. CGRA results will be uploaded to the EMR, printed and given to a patient navigator.&#xD;
      The patient navigator will approach patients, give them a recruitment flyer, information&#xD;
      about the study, screen patients and obtain informed consent for women who choose to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Based on computer-generated randomization (equal numbers in each&#xD;
      arm), patients will be randomized to one of two groups to receive: 1) pretest, view decision&#xD;
      aid video, and posttest or 2) pretest, genetic counseling brochure, and posttest. Both arms&#xD;
      will be facilitated by patient navigators. Upon completion of posttest, patient navigators&#xD;
      will ask women if they would like to make an appointment for genetic counseling, contact the&#xD;
      provider for the order if not already in the EMR, make genetic counseling appointments for&#xD;
      women who choose to attend, and monitor and collect follow-up data. All enrolled participants&#xD;
      will receive a phone call at 4 weeks post-intervention to (a) verify counseling attendance&#xD;
      through self-report and EMR extraction if applicable; (b) ask whether the patient was&#xD;
      referred to genetic testing after her genetic counseling if applicable; and (c) ask whether&#xD;
      other family members were referred to genetic services if applicable and (d) determine who in&#xD;
      their social networks, if anyone, the participant told about genetic counseling, and if so,&#xD;
      how this information was shared.&#xD;
