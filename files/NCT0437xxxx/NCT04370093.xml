  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will randomize overweight and obese iuan patients to Pio (45 mg/day,&#xD;
      highest approved dose or placebo), WL (10% of body weight, following the established program&#xD;
      used in the Diabetes Prevention Program), or Pio+WL. Participants will be evaluated at&#xD;
      baseline and after 24 weeks of intervention while on a fixed metabolic diet to exclude the&#xD;
      confounding effects of diet and perspiration. The primary endpoint will be change in upH, and&#xD;
      multiple additional endpoints (serum, urine, imaging) will be assessed.&#xD;

      In IUAN patients, the investigator will compare 1. PPAR activation; 2. weight loss; or 3.&#xD;
      combination; on urine acid-base parameters relevant to UA stone risk. The investigator will&#xD;
      assess the effect of these interventions on fat distribution, insulin sensitivity, and serum&#xD;
      adiponectin, and correlate these changes with urine chemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Weight loss + TZD independently result in durable changes in urine chemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Epidemiology of uric acid nephrolithiasis: Nephrolithiasis is an increasingly&#xD;
      prevalent condition that leads to significant pain1, work productivity loss2, reduced quality&#xD;
      of life3, urinary tract infection4, chronic kidney disease5,6 and end-stage renal disease7.&#xD;
      In the U.S., nephrolithiasis prevalence doubled in the past 30 years to a level similar to&#xD;
      diabetes, and is the most expensive non-malignant urologic condition (2006 U.S. annual cost:&#xD;
      $10 billion)8. Compared with other stone types, uric acid stones recur at a higher rate9,&#xD;
      lead to more CKD10, and comprise a rising fraction of stones11,12 , in part due to the&#xD;
      growing prevalence of obesity and diabetes13-18. The single most important pathogenic factor&#xD;
      in human IUAN is an overly acidic urine, promoting protonation of urate to the insoluble&#xD;
      UA16,19. In previously completed NIH-supported studies, the Investigator identified increased&#xD;
      net acid excretion and blunted ammoniagenesis to be the principal metabolic defects&#xD;
      underlying aciduria in humans IUAN and in rodent models of IUAN risk16,18,20-23. Treatment&#xD;
      has been empirical urinary alkalinization24 which is efficacious but has not changed since&#xD;
      1986. Limitations include frequent dosing25, need for high dose in obese patients26,&#xD;
      medication intolerance27, and need for periodic urine collections disliked by patients.&#xD;
      Therapy that targets the underlying pathophysiologic defect rather than urinary chemistry is&#xD;
      directly needed. The Investigator showed that the thiazolidinedione (TZD) pioglitazone that&#xD;
      activates PPAR, improves systemic and urinary abnormalities in IUAN including impaired&#xD;
      excessive acid excretion and ammoniagenesis, and results in a rise in UpH. TZD treatment of&#xD;
      rodent IUAN model shows similar improvements28. The Investigator may have a therapy targeting&#xD;
      the underlying pathobiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translational potential of our regimen is extremely high and immediate. If combined TZD&#xD;
      and weight loss (Aim) are efficacious in reducing stone risk, one can move straight to a&#xD;
      clinical trial using hard outcomes such as stone events, and stone count by imaging to test&#xD;
      this regimen. None of these maneuvers requires FDA approval to initiate. Patients will then&#xD;
      have instant control of urinary chemistry with empiric alkali therapy (existing therapy), but&#xD;
      also a chance to achieve more lasting improvement with TZD and weight loss, which reverses&#xD;
      the pathophysiology. Separately, adiponectin (APN) receptor agonists are being developed as&#xD;
      potential pharmacological agents for the management of metabolic syndrome complications&#xD;
      including diabetes and dyslipidemia29,30. If approved, such agents could be tested as therapy&#xD;
      for aciduria in the metabolic syndrome if adiponectin mediates the impact of TZD on renal&#xD;
      ammoniagenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UA nephrolithiasis is the clinically palpable sentinel of some complex underlying systemic&#xD;
      pathophysiology; hence the impact of these studies extends beyond UA stones. The Investigator&#xD;
      is examining a novel multi-organ paradigm of increased acid production from the gut that&#xD;
      escapes hepatic metabolism, and ending up as an acid load imposed on the kidney. When&#xD;
      compounded with renal ammoniagenesis defect, this leads to aciduria and UA lithogenesis. The&#xD;
      Investigator will address some fundamental pathobiologic mechanisms of the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. Due to the time and budget limits, the Investigator will concentrate our efforts to&#xD;
      yield informative data; hence the renal focus. Our long-term goal is to use this as a portal&#xD;
      to study multiple aspects of the gut, hepatic, and adipose pathophysiology of the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
