      To date, the investigators lack characterization of, the burden of, and the systemic&#xD;
      progression of disease in ENPP1 deficiency and ABCC6 deficiency from a patient and/or parent&#xD;
      perspective. This study aims to document this characterization, progression as well as the&#xD;
      burden of disease. Link to the study registration-&#xD;

      This will be a comprehensive, cross-sectional study conducted in approximately 60 individuals&#xD;
      (or representative parents of patients) affected by ENPP1 deficiency and the acute form of&#xD;
      ABCC6 deficiency. All study participants will complete the RSVP, PRO tools and upload a proof&#xD;
      of disease form, followed by an interview conducted by a trained interviewer. It is estimated&#xD;
      that each respondent will need up to 60 minutes for the entire process; 20 minutes to&#xD;
      complete the RSVP, PRO tools and to upload proof of diagnosis of ENPP1 deficiency or the&#xD;
      acute form of ABBC6 deficiency, and approximately 40 minutes to complete the interview and&#xD;
      address any follow-up questions if needed.&#xD;

        60 participants across four groups; person or parent/legal guardian affected by ENPP1 (GACI&#xD;
        or ARHR2) or the acute form of ABCC6 def. described below;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute infantile ENPP1 def. (due to the high infant mortality, this group likely to&#xD;
             include parents of affected children, both living and deceased)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute infantile ABCC6 def. (due to the high infant mortality, this group likely to&#xD;
             include parents of affected children, both living and deceased)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progressive pediatric ENPP1 def. who are still growing (note; due to the age of those&#xD;
             who are still growing, this group is likely to include parents of affected children)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult ENPP1 def. who are no longer growing (note: due to the age of those who are no&#xD;
             longer growing, this group is likely to include both patients &gt; age 18 years and&#xD;
             parents of affected children who are &lt; age 18 years or who are unable to answer for&#xD;
