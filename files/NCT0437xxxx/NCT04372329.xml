  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep breathing disorder in the U.S.&#xD;
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy is the most effective treatment for OSA.&#xD;
      However, up to 50% of patients who accept using CPAP therapy fail to adhere to it. This study&#xD;
      will evaluate an information systems (IS)-based solution that sends tailored, motivational,&#xD;
      educational messages and tailored feedback messages to promote CPAP usage among noncompliant&#xD;
      OSA patients. The primary aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of the proposed IS&#xD;
      solution and its effect on fostering the use of CPAP therapy among OSA patients.&#xD;

Next, they will receive weekly feedback messages only (one message per week) notifying participants of their CPAP usage for two weeks (type B), re-introduction of type A for another two weeks, followed by re-introduction of type B for two weeks.</description>
