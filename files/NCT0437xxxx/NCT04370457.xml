    <textblock>
      The MyPal eHealth system coincides with the MyPal intervention. The system will be used&#xD;
      primarily by the patients that participate in the intervention arm of the trial and&#xD;
      secondarily by the participating healthcare professionals (HCP). Patients participating in&#xD;
      the standard arm of the trial won't use the system. Access to the MyPal eHealth system will&#xD;
      be granted to the patients and HCP right after their enrollment in the trial. Patients will&#xD;
      have access to the system continuously for 12 months; HCP will have access to the system&#xD;
      until the end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main modules (software and hardware) of the system are outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MyPal smartphone application (app). This is the interface of the patient to the system.&#xD;
           The MyPal smartphone app is available for smartphones running on the Android and iOS&#xD;
           operating systems and it is installed on the personal smartphone of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Commercial smart wristband. This is a commercial activity tracking device that will be&#xD;
           employed for monitoring the physical activity and the sleep quality of the patient,&#xD;
           provided by the site personnel. Wearable to be worn. Ionicâ„¢ (Fitbit) will be employed by&#xD;
           the trial as the smart wristband.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MyPal web application (app). This is the main interface of the HCP to the system. It is&#xD;
           accessible as a web portal through any modern web browser.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  System backend. This module resides at the backend of the system and it is not directly&#xD;
           accessible by the aforementioned types of users. The system backend interfaces the MyPal&#xD;
           smartphone app and the MyPal web app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief, the intervention revolves around the reporting by the patient of physical and&#xD;
      psycho-emotional symptoms (via the MyPal smartphone app) and the immediate delivery of the&#xD;
      reported symptom-related information to the HCP (via the MyPal web app). Of note, the&#xD;
      reported symptom-related information becomes instantly available to the HCP in the MyPal web&#xD;
      app; however, this does not imply that the HCP is guaranteed to review it at the same time.&#xD;
      The intervention is described in more detailed below, first from the standpoint of the&#xD;
      patient and then from that of the HCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients interact with the MyPal smartphone app in 3 sequential phases. Additionally,&#xD;
      during the enrollment in the study, the patients are handed the commercial smart wristband&#xD;
      and they are instructed to wear it as much as possible (also while sleeping) throughout their&#xD;
      participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registration Phase. This phase is completed the first time the patient uses the MyPal&#xD;
      smartphone app, which take place right after the patient is enrolled in the study. The&#xD;
      mission of this phase is (1) to register the patient into the MyPal system, (2) to initially&#xD;
      set a number of preferences, (3) to collect via self-reporting the baseline assessment of the&#xD;
      patient's physical and psycho-emotional symptom, and (4) to screen for motivational targets&#xD;
      and non-adherence risk. The smartphone app guides the patient throughout the entire&#xD;
      registration process in a wizard-like fashion, where the user has to provide some information&#xD;
      (1)-(2) and complete certain questionnaires (3)-(4). The latter is elaborated in the next&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main usage phase. As soon as the registration phase is completed, the MyPal smartphone app&#xD;
      enters into its main usage phase. This lasts 6 months (Month 0 to Month 6 of the patient's&#xD;
      participation in the study) and, during this time, the patient is given access to a number of&#xD;
      user-initiated functionalities (i.e., functionalities that the user has access to at all&#xD;
      times) and system-initiated ones (i.e., functionalities for which the system decides when&#xD;
      they become available to the user). More specifically, the functionalities of the second&#xD;
      category are initiated via notifications that are presented by the smartphone app to the&#xD;
      user. We can distinguish two main types of notifications, namely the intervention&#xD;
      notifications (i.e., notifications associated with functionalities that are part of the&#xD;
      interventions) and the assessment notifications (i.e., notifications informing the patient&#xD;
      it's time to complete the assessment questionnaires that have been foreseen by the study&#xD;
      protocol). The intervention notification frequency is once every a multiple of 1 week (e.g.,&#xD;
      1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks), depending on the specific system-initiated functionality, while&#xD;
      the intervention notifications are issued once per month. Whenever possible, messages&#xD;
      concerning multiple functionalities are grouped in a single notification, either intervention&#xD;
      notification or mixed one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up usage phase. The follow-up usage phase starts immediately after the completion of&#xD;
      the main usage phase and it also last 6 months (Month 7 to Month 12 of the patient's&#xD;
      participation). This phase is identical to the previous phase (all the previously described&#xD;
      functionalities are available) with a single exception. This is that the smartphone app does&#xD;
      not issue assessment notification monthly; instead it issues only one such notification at&#xD;
      the end of Month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to the case of the patients, the HCP interact with the MyPal web app (i.e., their&#xD;
      interface to the MyPal system) in the same manner throughout their participation in the study&#xD;
      (this is considered to be from the first to the last month of the study). The only exception&#xD;
      to this (main usage) is a short procedure that registers them into the MyPal system; the&#xD;
      registration takes place the first time the HCP accesses the MyPal web app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief, during the main usage of the MyPal web app, the HCP get access to the data that are&#xD;
      collected by (1) the MyPal smartphone app and (2) the commercial smart wristband and stored&#xD;
      in the system backend. The collected data become available to the MyPal web app as soon as&#xD;
      they are stored. At individual level, the HCP is authorized to access only the data of the&#xD;
      patients of the associated clinical center; however, access to aggregated and summarized data&#xD;
      coming from all the patients (descriptive statistics such as min, max, average and&#xD;
      percentiles) will also be provided to all the HCP. In contrast to the notification-heavy&#xD;
      approach that was adopted for the patients, the HCP are not actively notified by the MyPal&#xD;
      system at any point. To compensate for this, the study protocol mandates that the individual&#xD;
      data of the participating patients of a given clinical center are reviewed by the associated&#xD;
      HCP at least once every 72 hours. The data review and any action related to this will be&#xD;
      recorded through the web interface. The absence of notifications means that all&#xD;
      functionalities offered to the HCP are user-initiated.&#xD;
