  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-lead electrocardiography (ECG) technologies and photoplethysmography (PPG) deriving&#xD;
      smartphone apps are gaining interest in the heart rhythm detection space since these apps&#xD;
      have the potential to capture and assess heart rhythms. Proprietary arrhythmia detection&#xD;
      algorithms are proven to be reliable and accurate. However, insights into the readability of&#xD;
      PPG waveforms by human reviewers remain limited. To the investigators' knowledge, there are&#xD;
      no publications available regarding the readability of PPG waveforms by human reviewers. The&#xD;
      objective of the study was to assess the readability of PPG and single-lead ECG analysis by&#xD;
      medical professionals, with respect to the gold-standard 12-lead ECG diagnosis, and&#xD;
      investigate whether additional information positively impacts PPG analysis.&#xD;

      During the study, the readability of PPG and single-lead ECG waveform analysis will be&#xD;
      investigated. The objective of the study is to determine the readability of PPG and&#xD;
      single-lead ECG measurements, with respect to the gold-standard 12-lead ECG, and investigate&#xD;
      whether additional information positively impacts the readability of PPG. Medical&#xD;
      professionals (cardiologists and cardiology residents), blinded for the patients'&#xD;
      characteristics and history, are instructed to separately analyse the following signals,&#xD;
      obtained from 30 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 outputs with PPG waveforms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 outputs with PPG waveforms with tachogram and Poincaré&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 outputs with PPG waveforms with tachogram, Poincaré, and algorithm interpretation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 outputs with single-lead ECG waveforms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 outputs with 12-lead ECG waveforms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants report the results of the qualitative analysis via a digital questionnaire with&#xD;
      multiple-choice questions. Medical professionals classify each rhythm trace as regular&#xD;
      rhythm, one or more ectopic/missed heartbeats, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation,&#xD;
      unreadable, or other. The tachogram, Poincaré, and the algorithm interpretation are&#xD;
      subsequently added to investigate whether the additional information improves the readability&#xD;
      of PPG. Based on the provided answers, the study team will determine the readability of PPG&#xD;
      and single-lead ECG analysis interpretation, with respect to the gold-standard 12-lead ECG&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
