      AIM: The aim of this study was to compare and evaluate the radiographic healing in patients&#xD;
      undergoing apical surgery, using Freeze dried mineralized bone allograft and Platelet-rich&#xD;
      Fibrin. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate radiographic healing after periapical surgery using Freeze&#xD;
      dried mineralized bone allograft. To evaluate radiographic healing after periapical surgery&#xD;
      using Platelet rich Fibrin. To compare the radiographic healing after periapical surgery&#xD;
      using Freeze dried mineralized bone allograft and Platelet rich Fibrin. Method: Patients were&#xD;
      selected(according to the inclusion criteria) and randomly allocated to PRF and Bone Graft&#xD;
      groups.Following apicoectomy PRF gel and FDBA graft were prepared and placed in the osseous&#xD;
      defect followed by placement of PRF membrane for graft stabilization and flap closure.&#xD;
      Radiographic follow up was done at 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th months for evaluation of healing&#xD;
      using Molven Criteria.&#xD;

      The present study will be carried out to compare the post surgical healing of Platelet Rich&#xD;
      Fibrin (PRF) &amp; Mineralised freeze-dried bone allograft (FDBA) in the Department of&#xD;
      Conservative Dentistry &amp; Endodontics at Saraswati Dental College, Lucknow. The study will be&#xD;
      commenced only after due permission and clearance from the Institutional Review Board and&#xD;
      Ethical Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases will be selected according to the inclusion criteria after obtaining informed consent&#xD;
      from the parents. Patients will be diagnosed based on clinical signs &amp; symptoms, intraoral &amp;&#xD;
      radiographic findings. A routine medical history followed by blood investigations will be&#xD;
      part of the surgical protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After meeting the above criteria the patients will be randomly assigned to either PRF group&#xD;
      (Group-A) or Mineralised FDBA group (Group-B) After successful administration of Local&#xD;
      Anaesthesia the surgical procedure will be carried out that will include reflection of a full&#xD;
      thickness mucoperiosteal flap by sulcular incision and two relieving vertical incisions.&#xD;
      Debridement of tissues at the defect site will be done followed by irrigation with sterile&#xD;
      saline solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group-A patients :- 10ml of venous blood will be drawn from the patients by using a 18&#xD;
      gauge needle after selecting a suitable site for venipuncture. Blood will be collected in&#xD;
      tubes without anticoagulant and immediately centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10min which will&#xD;
      result in a fibrin clot containing the platelets located in the middle of the tube, between a&#xD;
      layer of red blood cells at the bottom and acellular plasma at the top. This clot will be&#xD;
      removed from the tube and the attached red blood cells will be scraped off and discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRF will be placed into the defect site and wound closure will be performed using appropriate&#xD;
      sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group-B patients :- Graft material i.e., Mineralised freeze-dried bone allograft (obtained&#xD;
      from Tissue Bank, Tata Memorial Hospital) will be mixed with sterile saline solution,&#xD;
      followed by careful placement into the defect site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The flap will be then re-placed to its original position and sutured with appropriate sutures&#xD;
      to ensure complete soft tissue coverage of the graft site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sutures will be removed after 7 days post-operatively. The cases will be followed up with&#xD;
      clinical and radiographic examination and will be recalled at intervals of 3,6, and 9 months&#xD;
      to assess the periapical area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Any changes in the plan of study will be made as in when necessary following which suitable&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be used to analyse the result.&#xD;
