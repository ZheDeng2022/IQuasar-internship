  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia complicating stroke is very difficult to manage and has a very poor prognosis,&#xD;
      leading to a significantly higher risk of death. Oral opportunistic pathogens have been&#xD;
      reported to be associated with the incidence of pneumonia among non-stroke immunocompromised&#xD;
      subjects. Preliminary studies found that patients with stroke had higher carriage rates of&#xD;
      oral opportunistic pathogens than healthy subjects. Therefore, investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      pneumonia complicating stroke is associated with oral opportunistic pathogens, and hyperbaric&#xD;
      oxygen therapy may reduce the incidence of pneumonia complicating stroke by increasing the&#xD;
      flow of saliva, which can affect the species and relative abundance of oral opportunistic&#xD;
      pathogens. In order to prove this, investigators need to (1) firstly conduct a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to confirm whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy is able to reduce the levels of&#xD;
      plaque, and the incidence of pneumonia complicating stroke at clinical level; (2) secondly&#xD;
      employ metagenomics analysis to compare oral rinse samples and respiratory samples, and to&#xD;
      identify pneumonia-associated &quot;oral opportunistic pathogens group&quot;; (3) finally elucidate how&#xD;
      hyperbaric oxygen therapy influences the species and relative abundance of oral opportunistic&#xD;
      pathogens. This proposed study will provide evidence for the integration of hyperbaric oxygen&#xD;
      therapy as part of interdisciplinary stroke rehabilitation.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The concise health status scale (SF-12) IS used to assess the systemic health-related quality of life in stroke patients. It covers eight different areas: general health (GH), physical functioning (PF), bodily pain (BP), role-physical (RP), mental health (MH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role-emotional (RE). The SF-12 consists of 12 items, and each of them has its own physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) regression coefficients. The response to each item will be multiplied by its PCS regression coefficient and added together with the PCS constant to provide Physical Health summary scores (SF-12 PCS). Mental Health summary scores (SF-12 MCS) will be calculated likewise. The higher the score, the higher the quality of life.</description>
