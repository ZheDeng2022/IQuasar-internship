    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to clinically, radiographically and histologically evaluate&#xD;
      the lateral bone augmentation of the soft porcine cortical lamina (OsteoBiol®) using&#xD;
      equine-derived bone particles (OsteoBiol®)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The xenograft used in this study was the Gen-Os® by OsteoBiol; The soft lamina (OsteoBiol®)&#xD;
      used is a 35x35mm medium curved membrane of porcine origins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fixation system used was the Pro-fix™ Precision Fixation System, consisting of&#xD;
      self-drilling membrane fixation screws of 1.5 mm x 3.0 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen patients (1 male, 14 females) aged between 27 and 64 years old were selected from the&#xD;
      Department of Periodontology of the Faculty of Dentistry, Saint Joseph University Beirut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and radiographic examinations were done prior to any procedure. The edentulous area&#xD;
      was examined to identify the availability of keratinised mucosa and the possibility of&#xD;
      implant placement in the mesio-distal and inter-arch planes. Radiographic examination was&#xD;
      completed using a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan of the affected region, where the&#xD;
      indication for vertical augmentation was selected and excluded from the study. All the&#xD;
      patients were given oral hygiene instructions and prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient received 2g of Amoxicillin one hour prior to surgery. Patients were instructed&#xD;
      to mouthrinse with chlorhexidine 0.12% gluconate mouthwash for 1 minute. Extra-oral&#xD;
      disinfection was made using topical chlorhexidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local and/or regional anaesthesia was obtained using Septanest® (Articaine hydrochloride 4%&#xD;
      with adrenaline 1:100,000) A mid-crestal incision was performed and extended into the sulcus&#xD;
      of the adjacent teeth, if present. At least one vertical releasing incision extending beyond&#xD;
      the muco-gingival junction was made. A muco-periosteal flap of full thickness was raised and&#xD;
      extended buccally, whereas palatally it was reflected to expose 3 mm of bone. Lingually the&#xD;
      flap was elevated until reaching the mylo-hyoid line. Decortication was carried out using a&#xD;
      twist drill with a stop of 3mm of length to ensure a good perfusion of the graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The soft cortical lamina had been soaked in saline sterile water since the beginning of the&#xD;
      surgery in order to achieve good elasticity and easier manipulation. It was then trimmed with&#xD;
      sterile scissors and adapted to the recipient site while making sure it was not in contact&#xD;
      with the surrounding teeth. It was first fixed on the palatal/lingual side. The&#xD;
      cortico-cancellous heterologous bone mix which was previously hydrated in sterile saline for&#xD;
      ten minutes, was placed on the ridge in sufficient quantities and covered by the membrane&#xD;
      while being adapted in the desired shape of the future ridge. The membrane was reclined and&#xD;
      also fixated on the buccal side for better adaptability and immobilization. In order to&#xD;
      ensure a tension free closure, the buccal flap was advanced using a periosteal releasing&#xD;
      incision connecting the vertical incisions thus achieving elasticity of the flap. Precaution&#xD;
      was taken to identify and carefully isolate the mental nerve from the surrounding tissues&#xD;
      when present. The lingual flaps were advanced using a blunt instrument to detach the muscular&#xD;
      insertion of the mylo-hyoid from the lingual flap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once proper elasticity was achieved, horizontal mattress sutures were placed at 4mm from the&#xD;
      incision line using a non-resorbable polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) 4/0 monofilament suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They were followed by single interrupted sutures close to the edges of the flap in order to&#xD;
      create a connective tissue-connective tissue contact, thus creating a barrier to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of membrane exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were instructed to receive an injection of betamethasone dipropionate and&#xD;
      disodium phosphate directly after the surgery and received 2g of Amoxicillin per day for a&#xD;
      total of 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative recommendations were clearly written and given to the patient. Chlorhexidine&#xD;
      was prescribed starting the second day after surgery until suture removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sutures were removed at 14 days, they were left for another 7 days when found necessary to&#xD;
      secure the healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 months from the surgery, a CBCT scan of the grafted area was taken and measures were&#xD;
      made for the choice of the implant diameter and length. In all of the post-operative CBCTs,&#xD;
      implant placement seemed possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the implant placement, local anaesthesia was made, followed by a mid-crestal&#xD;
      incision and occasionally a vertical one, allowing access to the fixation screws for their&#xD;
      removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A biopsy was taken at the site of implant placement using a trephine burr of outer diameter&#xD;
      of 3.5mm and inner diameter of 2.5mm. The trephine and bone were immersed in 10% buffered&#xD;
      formaldehyde and fixated for histology. The implants (Straumann®, Bone Level Cylindrical)&#xD;
      were placed at the corresponding sites of the biopsies, and the choice of a cover or a&#xD;
      healing screw was made depending on the clinical situation and the primary stability of the&#xD;
      implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant insertion torques were noted as indicated on the implant torque wrench. Periapical&#xD;
      radio-graphs were taken, the flap was sutured and the patients received a daily dose of 2g of&#xD;
      Amoxicillin for 7 days and diclofenac potassium inflammatory for pain management. They were&#xD;
      also notified to mouth rinse with Chlorhexidine 0.12% for 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image acquisition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At consultation and six months after the regeneration procedure, patients were scanned with&#xD;
      the Newton VGI CBCT machine. Imaging conditions were: 110 kv tube voltage; 2.2 to 8.30&#xD;
      milliampere (mA) tube current; 15 x 15 cm field of view; and 0.3 mm voxel size. Projection&#xD;
      data were collected with a device rotating 360 degrees around patients over a total&#xD;
      acquisition time of 18 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of images:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scan data were saved in DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format and&#xD;
      image analysis and measurements were performed using the Blue Sky Plan® (Blue Sky Bio, LLC,&#xD;
      Grayslake, IL, USA) which provided axial, coronal and sagittal views through multiplanar&#xD;
      reconstructions of 0.3 mm slices. Axial images were reoriented to occlusal plane when present&#xD;
      or to palatal plane as a horizontal reference. A panoramic curve was created and&#xD;
      cross-sectional images perpendicular to that curve were reconstructed at a 1 mm interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced jaw segmentation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each scan, an advanced jaw segmentation technique was realized using the Blue Sky Plan&#xD;
      software by means of threshold segmentation and contour interpolation. First the region of&#xD;
      interest (corresponding jaw) was selected on the panoramic view. Second, several axial,&#xD;
      coronal and cross-sectional slices equally distributed/chosen by the software were used to&#xD;
      draw the outline of the bone. This created a matrix to the final automatic segmentation step&#xD;
      by the software to finalize the segmentation data and create a 3D model of the jaw. Finally,&#xD;
      the outline of the 3D model was checked and adjusted manually on the 2D slices in all the&#xD;
      planes in cases of over or missing contour. The result was an accurate 3D model of the&#xD;
      corresponding jaw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual implant placement and jaw superimposition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the post-operative CBCT plan, virtual implants were placed in the optimal position&#xD;
      regarding bone and prosthetic reference when present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to compare directly the pre and post-operative models, the pre-operative bone model&#xD;
      was loaded into the post-operative plan an n-point registration technique was used for the&#xD;
      superimposition of the two models. The outline of each model was visible in a unique color&#xD;
      for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A vestibulo-lingual implant centric section perpendicular to the panoramic curve and parallel&#xD;
      to the long axis of the simulated implant was used to make all the measurements as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Horizontal bone width measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each implant site, pre and post-operative horizontal bone width were measured at 4&#xD;
      levels. Bone width was calculated from the distance between the most buccal and most lingual&#xD;
      bone points at each level while being parallel to the simulated implant platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0-T1 and H0-T2: Pre and post-operative horizontal bone width at implant platform level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H2-T1 and H2-T2: Pre and post-operative horizontal bone width at 2mm apically to implant&#xD;
           platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H4-T1 and H4-T2: Pre and post-operative horizontal bone width at 4mm apically to implant&#xD;
           platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vertical bone gain/loss measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each implant site, pre and post-operative vertical bone gain were measured at 3 levels.&#xD;
      Vertical bone gain/loss was calculated from the distance between the most coronal&#xD;
      pre-operative bone points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fixation and inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples were taken at six months after regeneration and were treated with non-demineralized&#xD;
      histology. They were fixed in LILLIE neutral formalin, diluted to 10% in buffered sodium&#xD;
      phosphate pH 7.4. The fixation period lasted 3 weeks. The samples were then rinsed under&#xD;
      running water for 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dehydration of the samples was carried out in alcohol baths of increasing concentrations&#xD;
      for 48 hours, then the clarification, allowing the penetration of methacrylate, in 2&#xD;
      successive xylene baths of 24 hours each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cutting technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blocks were cut under irrigation and at slow speed with an Exact saw (Cutting machine&#xD;
      EXACT-APPARATEBAU Nordersted, Germany), so as to take cuts of at least 80 μm. These cuts were&#xD;
      subsequently reduced in thickness with the Exact abrasion system. The polishing was carried&#xD;
      out with abrasive paper discs of decreasing granulometry making it possible to reduce the&#xD;
      thickness of the cuts automatically to the desired value. The cuts were separated into S&#xD;
      (superficial), M (median) and P (profound) cuts, the superficial ones being the cuts facing&#xD;
      the periosteum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staining:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sections were stained with Giemsa-Paragon and basic fuchsin. Giemsa will give cells and&#xD;
      nuclei the color blue, and Paragon will stain bone in red.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histomorphometry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative observation of the sections was done under a digital microscope (Keyence&#xD;
      digital microscope VHX-6000) with normal and polarized light visualisations. For histological&#xD;
      quantification, an optical microscope was used (Olympus BX 60, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo,&#xD;
      Japan) connected to a digital camera (Olympus E330), along with the software Image J/ Fiji.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was first calibrated by measuring the scale bar present on the image. The image was made&#xD;
      into black and white (Type: 8-bit). The scale was set by measuring the length of the scale&#xD;
      bar in pixels and by setting its known distance in millimetres. It was then set as 'Global'&#xD;
      for all the images with the same scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total area of the concerned section was measured. Then the bone and osteoid volume were&#xD;
      quantified using the Bone Volume Mask and by using the 'wand tool' to select all the black&#xD;
      areas. The percentage of bone and osteoid matrix in each section was consequently calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical package software for social sciences (SPSS for Windows, Chicago, IL, USA,&#xD;
      version 25.0) was performed for statistical analysis of the data. The alpha error was set at&#xD;
      -p-value&lt;0.05. Frequency and percentage were utilized to describe categorical variables. Mean&#xD;
      and standard-deviation were used for continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeated measure analysis of variance with two within-subjects factors (Time: Baseline&#xD;
           and six months; distance: 0mm, 2mm, 4mm, and 6 mm) was performed to compare the mean&#xD;
           bone level within groups. It was followed by univariate analyses and Bonferroni post hoc&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeated measure analysis of variance with one within-subjects factor (distance: 0mm,&#xD;
           2mm, 4mm, and 6 mm) followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests was used to compare the mean&#xD;
           horizontal gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeated measure analysis of variance with one within-subjects factor (level: buccal,&#xD;
           median, lingual) followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests was executed to compare the mean&#xD;
           vertical gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One sample t tests were used to compare the mean vertical gain with a theoretical value&#xD;
           &quot;0'' that supposed the absence of gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Student t tests were performed to compare continuous variables between two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the relationship between&#xD;
           continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare histomorphometric measurements between&#xD;
           different levels.&#xD;
