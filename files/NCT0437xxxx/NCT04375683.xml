  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Philadelphia chromosome (BCR-ABL1, Ph) is the most common genetic abnormality in acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and an independent prognostic risk factor. With the increase of&#xD;
      age, the incidence of patients over 60 years old can reach 50%, whose 5-year overall survival&#xD;
      rate was less than 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the application of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), the prognosis of Ph positive ALL&#xD;
      patients is greatly improved. At present, TKI combined with chemotherapy has become the&#xD;
      first-line treatment recommended in the guideline of Ph positive ALL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, with the use of imatinib, more and more patients develop drug resistant to imatinib.&#xD;
      In addition, the clinical data showed that the MRD negative rate in patients treated with&#xD;
      imatinib combined with hyper CVAD was only 22% three months later, which was far lower than&#xD;
      31% of the second generation TKI and 52% of the third generation TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second generation TKI dasatinib and nilotinib can overcome most imatinib resistant kinase&#xD;
      region mutations. However, patients with severe hemocytopenia, infection or other&#xD;
      complications are often unable to tolerate the standard chemotherapy. In addition, due to the&#xD;
      high cost, some patients can't afford the long-term use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flumatinib is the first approved second generation TKI in China and a derivative of imatinib.&#xD;
      Compared with imatinib, it introduced trifluoromethyl, substituted pyridine ring for benzene&#xD;
      ring, and kept the direction of amide bond, which made the inhibitory effect of flumatinib on&#xD;
      common kinase mutations significantly better than that of imatinib. In addition, compared&#xD;
      with the second-generation TKI recommended in the first line of current guidelines, the&#xD;
      incidence of quality of life related adverse reactions of flumatinib is lower, and no&#xD;
      specific adverse reactions of the second-generation TKI have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll 28 patients with Ph positive ALL. All patients are diagnosed by morphology,&#xD;
      immunology, cytogenetics and molecular biology (MICM). According to subjects' age, we will&#xD;
      divide them into two groups. Subjects aged 60 years or older are received flumatinib and&#xD;
      dose-adjusted VDCP or prednisone regimen. Subjects younger than 60 years are received&#xD;
      flumatinib and hyper-CVAD regimen. MRD are examined on the 8th, 15th and 29th day after&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Then, MRD will be monitored in the third, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, 18th, 21th and&#xD;
      24th months after chemotherapy to evaluate the effect.&#xD;
