  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature babies often need help immediately after birth to open their lungs to air, start&#xD;
      breathing and keep their hearts beating. Opening their lungs can be difficult, and once open&#xD;
      the under-developed lungs of premature babies will often collapse again between each breath.&#xD;
      To prevent this nearly all premature babies receive some form of mechanical respiratory&#xD;
      support to aid breathing. Common to all types of respiratory support is the delivery of a&#xD;
      treatment called positive end-expiratory pressure, or PEEP. PEEP gives air, or a mixture of&#xD;
      air and oxygen, to the lung between each breath to keep the lungs open and stop them&#xD;
      collapsing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, clinicians do not have enough evidence on the right amount, or level, of PEEP to&#xD;
      give at birth. As a result, doctors around the world give different amounts (or levels) of&#xD;
      PEEP to premature babies at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the Investigators will look at 2 different approaches to PEEP to help&#xD;
      premature babies during their first breaths at birth. At the moment, the Investigators do not&#xD;
      know if one is better than the other. One is to give the same PEEP level to the lungs. The&#xD;
      others is to give a high PEEP level at birth when the lungs are hardest to open and then&#xD;
      decrease the PEEP later once the lungs are opened and the baby is breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very premature babies have a risk of long-term lung disease (chronic lung disease). The more&#xD;
      breathing support a premature baby needs, the more likely the risk of developing chronic lung&#xD;
      disease. The Investigators want to find out whether one method of opening the baby's lungs at&#xD;
      birth results in them needing less breathing support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research has been initiated by a group of doctors from Australia, the Netherlands and&#xD;
      the USA, all who look after premature babies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All infants born &lt;29 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) require positive end-expiratory pressure&#xD;
      (PEEP) at birth. PEEP is a simple, feasible and cost-effective therapy to support extremely&#xD;
      preterm infants that is used globally. The effective and safe level of PEEP to use after&#xD;
      preterm birth remains the most important unanswered question in neonatal respiratory&#xD;
      medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will undertake an international multi-centre randomised controlled trial to&#xD;
      address in extremely preterm infants, whether the use of a high, dynamic PEEP level strategy&#xD;
      to support the lung during stabilisation ('resuscitation') at birth, compared to the current&#xD;
      practice of a static PEEP level, will reduce the rate of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia&#xD;
      (BPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will address the following four key knowledge gaps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessing whether individualising (dynamic) PEEP is superior to static PEEP&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The uncertainty regarding applied pressure strategies to support the lung during&#xD;
           stabilisation at birth arising from the lack of a properly powered, well-designed&#xD;
           randomised trial specifically addressing important outcomes for respiratory support in&#xD;
           the Delivery Room&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The optimal PEEP strategy to use&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determining the differential effects of PEEP at different gestational ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the term PEEP refers to the delivery of positive pressure (via a bias flow of&#xD;
      gas) to the lungs during expiration by any method of assisted respiratory support, this&#xD;
      includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Continuous Positive Applied Pressure (CPAP; a method of non-invasive respiratory&#xD;
           support). During CPAP no other type of positive pressure is delivered as the infant&#xD;
           supports tidal ventilation using her/his own spontaneous breathing effort. PEEP during&#xD;
           CPAP has also been called 'continuous distending pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Positive Pressure Ventilation (PPV). During PPV PEEP is delivered between periods of an&#xD;
           applied inflating pressure (PIP) delivered at a clinician-determined rate. PPV can be&#xD;
           delivered via a mask or other non-invasive interface (also termed non-invasive positive&#xD;
           pressure ventilation; NIPPV), or via an endotracheal tube (often termed continuous&#xD;
           mechanical ventilation; CMV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) or high-frequency jet ventilation. These&#xD;
           are modes of invasive PPV in which PIP is delivered at very fast rates (&gt;120 inflations&#xD;
           per minute) and at very small tidal volumes. During HFOV a mean airway pressure is&#xD;
           determined by the clinician which is equivalent to the PEEP during other modes. During&#xD;
           high-frequency jet ventilation the clinician sets a PEEP similar to CMV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As all of these modes of ventilation have a similar goal of applying a pressure to the lung&#xD;
      during expiration (usually to prevent lung collapse) the term PEEP has the same physiological&#xD;
      result despite different methods of application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim of the trial is to establish whether the use of a high, dynamic 8-12 cmH2O&#xD;
      PEEP level ('dynamic') strategy to support the lung during stabilisation at birth, compared&#xD;
      with a static 5-6 cmH2O PEEP level ('static') strategy, increases the rate of survival&#xD;
      without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in extremely preterm infants born &lt;29 weeks' PMA,&#xD;
      and reduces rates of common neonatal morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators hypothesise that in preterm infants born &lt;29 weeks PMA who receive&#xD;
      respiratory support during stabilisation at birth, a high, dynamic PEEP strategy (i.e. PEEP&#xD;
      8-12 cmH2O individualised to clinical need) as compared to a standard, static PEEP of 5-6&#xD;
      cmH2O, will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increase survival without BPD (primary outcome); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduce rates of common neonatal morbidities such as failure of non-invasive respiratory&#xD;
           support in the first 72 hours of life (secondary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is a phase III/IV, two parallel group, non-blinded, 1:1 randomised controlled,&#xD;
      multi-national, multi-centre study comparing dynamic PEEP (dynamic group) with standard PEEP&#xD;
      strategy (static group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will take place in the Delivery Room. The intervention period will be from&#xD;
      the time of birth until 20 minutes of life or transfer from Delivery Room to NICU (whatever&#xD;
      comes first). The follow-up period will extend to 36 weeks PMA (primary endpoint), and 24&#xD;
      months corrected GA to determine important long-term neurodevelopmental and respiratory&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical team within the Delivery Room managing enrolled and randomised infants will not&#xD;
      be masked/blinded to the intervention. Clinicians need to be able to see the PEEP delivery&#xD;
      device to assess efficacy of pressure delivery. The Research Coordinator/Study team at site&#xD;
      will also not be masked/blinded to the intervention, as they will be entering trial data into&#xD;
      the data management system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff based at the central Trial Coordinating Centre (TCC), the Data Coordinating&#xD;
      Centre (DCCe) and the trial statistician will be blinded to assigned treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a total of 906 infants recruited (453 in the Dynamic group, 453 in the Static&#xD;
      group), over 25 recruitment centres across Australia, Europe, the United Kingdom, the Middle&#xD;
      East, Canada and North America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have Regional Coordinating Centres (RCCs) established in the following&#xD;
      jurisdictions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Australia - The Murdoch Children's Research Institute/Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne,&#xD;
           AUS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Netherlands - Amsterdam University Medical Centre, Netherlands, EU&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The United Kingdom - The University of Oxford / National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit&#xD;
           (NPEU), Oxford, UK, and&#xD;
