    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is associated with high morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      The Danish Lung Association estimates that 320,000 Danes live with COPD, of which&#xD;
      approximately 50,000 with severe COPD. In 2017, records showed that 23,979 admissions in&#xD;
      Denmark were related to COPD; of these patients, about 20% were readmitted 2-30 days after&#xD;
      discharge. The main symptom is dyspnea, which is often accompanied by anxiety. Primary&#xD;
      treatment is; oxygen, bronchiolitis, prednisolone, morfin, NIV, and anxiolytics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers at Hvidovre Hospital have developed an oxygen robot that continuously monitors&#xD;
      the patient's SaO2 (oxygen saturation) and automatically administrates the oxygen depending&#xD;
      on it. The preliminary results show that patients with robot-administrated oxygen were within&#xD;
      defined SaO2 range in 85.7% of the time versus 46.6% when oxygen was nurse-administrated. The&#xD;
      research was conducted as a multicentre Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)focusing on&#xD;
      physiological end-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a lack of knowledge about the patient perspective of treatment with the oxygen&#xD;
      robot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To examine the association between robot-administered oxygen and patients' perception of&#xD;
      dyspnoea, including the emotional response in the form of anxiety and depression&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perspective is to be able to provide a holistic response to whether robot administered&#xD;
      oxygen can be a better method of treating and alleviating dyspnoea.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a high prevalence disease and is associated&#xD;
      with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. In 2017, there were 23.979 COPD related&#xD;
      admissions in Denmark, approximately 10% died during hospitalization, while 20% of survivors&#xD;
      were readmitted between day 2-30 after discharge. Patients with COPD often experience long&#xD;
      disease trajectories characterized by a substantial burden of symptoms, impaired functional&#xD;
      status, multiple admissions and thereby reduced quality of life. The cardinal symptom dyspnea&#xD;
      is associated with hypoxemia, anxiety and depression. Evidence shows that depression is a&#xD;
      significant risk factor for disabling dyspnea, while risk of anxiety increases with the&#xD;
      severity of Dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of anxiety and depression is indicated to lie between 10%-55% and 10%-86% in&#xD;
      patients hospitalized with COPD in exacerbation . Patients with COPD have an 85% increased&#xD;
      risk of developing anxiety compared to a matching control group without COPD. The prevalence&#xD;
      of anxiety is 10 times higher among patients with COPD than in the background population and&#xD;
      are strongly associated with the risk of hospitalization, long admissions, readmissions and&#xD;
      death. Anxiety and depression are often treated with benzodiazepines which have a respiratory&#xD;
      suppressive effect. Consumption of benzodiazepines increases disease progression, and studies&#xD;
      have shown that 31.7% of patients with COPD have a benzodiazepine consumption and that 9%&#xD;
      initiate a new benzodiazepine ordination in conjunction with an exacerbation. The evidence&#xD;
      that oxygen prevents disease progression and mortality is consistent, but there is a lack of&#xD;
      knowledge about whether oxygen, can reduce the intensity of dyspnea in patients with COPD. In&#xD;
      the acute phase of an exacerbation the oxygen flow is titrated to achieve a SaO2 between&#xD;
      88-92%. Keeping patients with COPD within the given SaO2 range is essential because too low&#xD;
      SaO2 can induce tissue damage, heart overload and difficulty concentrating, while&#xD;
      hyperoxaemia can inhibit respiration and increase the risk of hypercapnia, acidosis and the&#xD;
      need for ventilatory support in the form of Non-invasive Ventilation (NIV). In clinical&#xD;
      practice, oxygen flow is administered and titrated, via aggregates, by nurses based on point&#xD;
      observations, with the risk of patients being outside optimal SaO2 range, between&#xD;
      observations. To improve practice, a group of researchers at Hvidovre Hospital has developed&#xD;
      an oxygen robot, called O2matic, which continuously monitors the patient's SaO2 and&#xD;
      automatically administrates oxygenflow according to it. O2Matic has been tested in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 2018. Patients admitted with an exacerbation of COPD and&#xD;
      hypoxemia (SaO2 â‰¤ 88%) was included (N = 19). The design was crossover and patients were&#xD;
      allocated to either 4 hours of manual oxygen administration via nurse followed by 4 hours of&#xD;
      oxygen administration via O2Matic, or vice versa. The study showed that patients with O2matic&#xD;
      controlled oxygen administration were within defined SaO2 range in 85.7% of the time versus&#xD;
      46,6% of the time when the oxygen was controlled and administrated by a nurse . These results&#xD;
      are in consensus with a former Canadian study testing an alternative oxygen robot (FreeO2).&#xD;
      The two RCT Studies provide evidence to investigate robot-administered oxygen therapy for&#xD;
      inpatient patients with exacerbation of COPD in a larger multicenter Randomized Controlled&#xD;
      Trail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyspnea is defined as; &quot;A subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consist of&#xD;
      qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity&quot;. The experience of dyspnea is a&#xD;
      product of a physical perception based on signals from the body to the brain followed by the&#xD;
      cognitive processing of these into an emotional experience. Dyspnea is thus an emotional and&#xD;
      sensational experience based on perceptual afferent feedback from various respiratory&#xD;
      receptors. Up to 16 possible mechanisms are involved in the process . Given the above,&#xD;
      dyspnea is a complex symptom, mainly induced by the body's attempts to obtain homeostasis,&#xD;
      when subjected to hypoxemia. Despite this dyspnea is not the same as hypoxemia, as it has not&#xD;
      been clearly demonstrated that reduced hypoxemia, by oxygen therapy also reduces Dyspnea.&#xD;
      However, there are indications in the literature that oxygen therapy can reduce the&#xD;
      experience of dyspnea. A significant barrier to the use of oxygen therapy as an intervention&#xD;
      on fragmentary dyspnea in patients with COPD is the risk of hypercapnia and acidosis. Oxygen&#xD;
      therapy administrated according to saturation in a closedloop-feedback-system by a robot,&#xD;
      could potentially be an intervention to relieve fragmentary dyspnea in patients with COPD.&#xD;
      International guidelines show that dyspnea is not treated consistently nor effectively in the&#xD;
      advanced stages of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioids are one of the most widely used agents in the treatments of dyspnea. Opioids&#xD;
      suppress' respiration and treatment should be balanced to avoid respiratory depression.&#xD;
      Guidelines points out the importance of identifying and graduate the intensity of dyspnea in&#xD;
      clinical practice, without indicating any superior instruments to achieve this. Majority of&#xD;
      instruments developed, describe dyspnea in relation to activity. As COPD progress, dyspnea&#xD;
      intensifies and patients will become more inactive and often live a sedentary life. Few&#xD;
      questionnaires measure the sensory and emotional domains of dyspnea independently of activity&#xD;
      and diagnose. One is the multidimensional Dyspnoea profile (MDP) that has recently been&#xD;
      translated into Danish. In order to reduce symptom burden, length of hospital stay, number of&#xD;
      readmissions and mortality, new knowledge and more effective methods for treating and&#xD;
      alleviating dyspnea and the associated anxiety and depression are needed in patients with&#xD;
      COPD. Studies investigating the effect of oxygen therapy, including time with and degree of&#xD;
      hypoxemia, in hypoxemic patients experiencing dyspnea, anxiety or depression during&#xD;
      hospitalization with acute exacerbation, could not be identified. Because O2matic provides a&#xD;
      new and unique opportunity to reduce and illuminate time with hypoxemia during&#xD;
      hospitalization and patient's subjective experience of the sensory and emotional aspects of&#xD;
      dyspnea can be reported on a validated questionnaire via MDP, researchers now have an option&#xD;
      to investigate if a robot intervention, that reduces time with hypoxemia, has an effect on&#xD;
      dyspnea in patients admitted with a exacerbation of COPD. Furthermore, investigators want to&#xD;
      examine whether this intervention alters the consumption of opioids and benzodiazepines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis. Reduced time with hypoxia, via active differentiated oxygen supply&#xD;
      determined by visible monitored saturation, affects the sensory and emotional response to&#xD;
      dyspnea, anxiety, depression and consumption of medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether there is an association between time with hypoxemia and dyspnea,&#xD;
      described by the Sensory Question (SQ) scale and A2 scale of MDP, in patients admitted with&#xD;
      an exacerbation of COPD and a need for oxygen therapy Secondary hypothesis 1 The intensity of&#xD;
      dyspnea, anxiety, depression and respiratory symptom burden is dependent on time with and&#xD;
      degree of hypoxemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether there is an association between time with-and degree of hypoxemia and&#xD;
      respectively dyspnea, anxiety, depression and symptom burden Secondary hypothesis 2 Reduced&#xD;
      time with-and degree of hypoxemia reduces consumption of anxiolytics expressed in Mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether there is an association between time with-and degree of hypoxemia and&#xD;
      anxiolytics represented as Benzodiazepines, morphine and &quot;Oramorph&quot; drops&#xD;
