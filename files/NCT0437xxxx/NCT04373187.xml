  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, parallel design study to evaluate the PK comparability,&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a single SC dose of 360 mg CC 93538 using two&#xD;
      different drug concentrations, 180 mg/mL and 150 mg/mL, in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of approximately 52 subjects will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive a single&#xD;
      360 mg SC dose of CC-93538 using either 180 mg/mL (1 injection of 2 mL) or 150 mg/mL (2&#xD;
      injections of 1.2 mL each) drug concentrations.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Subject must be male or non-pregnant female, aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 55 years of age at the&#xD;

             screening and Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject must be in good health, as determined by the Investigator on the basis of&#xD;
             medical history, clinical laboratory safety test results, vital signs, 12-lead ECG,&#xD;
             and PE at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Female subjects not of childbearing potential must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Have been surgically sterilized (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; proper&#xD;
                  documentation required) at least 6 months before Screening, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Postmenopausal (defined as 24 consecutive months without menses before Screening,&#xD;
                  with a follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] level in the postmenopausal range&#xD;
                  according to the laboratory used at Screening); FSH to be performed at the&#xD;
                  discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Females of child-bearing potential (FCBP) must agree to practice a highly effective&#xD;
             method of contraception throughout the study and for 5 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             investigational product (IP). FCBP is a female who 1) has achieved menarche at some&#xD;
             point; 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 3) has not&#xD;
             been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out&#xD;
             childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any&#xD;
             time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Acceptable methods of birth control in this study are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Combined hormonal (containing oestrogen and progestogen) contraception, which may&#xD;
                  be oral, intravaginal, or transdermal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation,&#xD;
                  which may be oral, injectable or implantable&#xD;

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone-releasing system&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilateral tubal occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Vasectomised partner&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexual abstinence&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related&#xD;
             assessments/procedures being conducted, and must be able to comply with the&#xD;
             requirements of the study, including the study visit schedule and other protocol&#xD;
             requirements. Must be able to communicate with the Investigator and to understand and&#xD;
             adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has any significant medical history/condition, laboratory abnormality, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has any condition (acute or chronic) including the presence of laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to&#xD;
             participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject was exposed to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days&#xD;
             preceding the first dose administration, or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug,&#xD;
             ifkn own (whichever was longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has previously received CC-93538 treatment (formerly known as RPC4046 and&#xD;

             the opinion of the investigator, would prevent visualization of dermatologic changes&#xD;
             due to study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject has an active parasitic/helminthic infection or suspected parasitic helminthic&#xD;
