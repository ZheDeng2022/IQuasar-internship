    <textblock>
      Grief is an intense emotional reaction to the loss of a loved one. It produces feelings of&#xD;
      regret and longing that usually decrease over time. However, some people have difficulty&#xD;
      adapting to the loss and develop Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multiple-baseline case series study will be conducted to investigate the efficacy and&#xD;
      effectiveness of an Internet delivered cognitive behavior treatments (ICBT) for adult people&#xD;
      diagnosed with prolonged grief disorder (PGD). There will be at least 6 participants. Three&#xD;
      baseline periods will be established (9,12 and 15 days). Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to each of them (two for each condition). During this period, daily evaluations will&#xD;
      be carried out using a mobile app. After the baseline, patients will perform the self-applied&#xD;
      treatment protocol through the internet.&#xD;
