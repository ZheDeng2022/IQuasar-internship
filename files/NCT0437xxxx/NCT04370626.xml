    <textblock>
      This is a unique dual design prospective trial. All PLIs at all sites have the potential to&#xD;
      be included. All injuries can be enrolled in the prospective registry of PLIs. The&#xD;
      investigators have an embedded RCT available for purely ligamentous injuries of the SL&#xD;
      ligament. These patients can be randomized to either SL screw or SL wires. Our goal is to&#xD;
      collect all relevant injury and surgical parameters of the Perilunate spectrum. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to identify each hospital within Canada that normally treats PLIs and to&#xD;
      record injury and demographic information on each PLI that occurs in this country over a two&#xD;
      to three-year period. Our protocol includes scheduled two, five, and 10-year follow-up&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perilunate injuries commonly occur from high-energy sporting or automobile accidents and&#xD;
      require urgent surgical intervention. Although these wrist injuries are commonly encountered&#xD;
      in the population, their complexity often goes unrecognized. In fact, some perilunate&#xD;
      dislocations (PLDs) or perilunate fracture-dislocations (PLFDs) may be missed in spite of&#xD;
      critical clinical and radiographic examination, leading to a delay in treatment. If left&#xD;
      untreated for an extended period of time the outcomes of surgical repair are significantly&#xD;
      compromised. The recovery process is very long, often with poor prognosis (a high incidence&#xD;
      of post-traumatic osteoarthritis and chronic wrist pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early surgical management with the restoration of normal carpal anatomy is the gold standard&#xD;
      for surgical repair of perilunate injuries. Surgical repair may involve an open reduction of&#xD;
      the carpal bones, repair or reconstruction of the ligaments, and internal fixation of the&#xD;
      fractures for PLDs and PLFDs. However, there is a huge variability with respect to approach&#xD;
      and a lot to be desired with respect to outcomes. Open surgical procedures have been reported&#xD;
      to lead to capsular scarring and joint stiffness and further interfere with the tenuous blood&#xD;
      supply to the scaphoid and the torn ligaments. Another treatment options, which may aid in&#xD;
      healing with reduced stiffness, is a combination of fluoroscopy and wrist arthroscopy which&#xD;
      allows for anatomic reduction and fixation of the carpal bones with minimal tissue&#xD;
      dissection. Injury variability and a wide array of surgical strategies make it difficult to&#xD;
      treat and/or make improvements on specific techniques. Given the varied nature of the injury&#xD;
      to this joint and varied outcomes, it is important to categorize the injury characteristics,&#xD;
      the subsequent treatment options and the long-term outcomes of different clinical&#xD;
      interventions. Many different surgical techniques have been advocated with a variety of&#xD;
      reduction and fixation maneuvers, but unfortunately, the literature is sparse. There are&#xD;
      disagreements with respect to volar, dorsal or combined surgical approaches. There is no&#xD;
      consensus on the value of prophylactic carpal tunnel release. Some surgeons advocate direct&#xD;
      ligament repair, while others feel it is unnecessary. A third group advocates for&#xD;
      augmentation of the scapholunate ligament with screws or a graft. While most surgeons use&#xD;
      smooth k-wires to hold the carpal reduction, there is no agreement on direction, number, size&#xD;
      and position of k-wires. Further, there is no agreement on how long these k-wires should be&#xD;
      left in place or on any aspect of rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Globally these injuries have been poorly studied and ideal timing for surgical intervention,&#xD;
      optimal treatment and rehabilitation are unknown. The investigators hope to establish&#xD;
      best-evidence clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of perilunate injuries including&#xD;
      recommendations on the timing of reduction, the timing of surgery, best-practice surgical&#xD;
      techniques and rehabilitation protocols. The C3PO Trial will represent the single largest&#xD;
      prospective dataset ever accrued on perilunate injuries with the support of both Canadian&#xD;
      hand and trauma-fellowshipped trained orthopaedic surgeons and corresponding research&#xD;
      societies. This project has the potential to create a paradigm shift in the way surgeons&#xD;
      think about the perilunate injuries from identification through to prognosis which would be&#xD;
      beneficial to all orthopaedic traumatologists managing these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 3 major nested arms. The investigators have designed a national prospective&#xD;
      registry intended to capture all perilunate injuries suffered in Canada over a 2 year period.&#xD;
      Within this registry, the investigators have an embedded cohort to capture all injuries that&#xD;
      present to registered trial centres. These patients will be consented to the cohort and&#xD;
      subsequently have extensive perioperative data recorded as well as both short and long-term&#xD;
      follow-up (with no modification of treatment). The subset of these patients that suffer&#xD;
      specific complete injury to the SL ligament will then be offered enrollment into the&#xD;
      prospective trial for randomization to either SL screw or SL k-wire(s). All data points are&#xD;
      the same for cohort and RCT arms. All data collection (i.e. relevant demographics, injury&#xD;
      characteristics, surgical and management parameters) will be obtained and managed by a&#xD;
      customized REDCap database housed at the trial coordinating centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, 14 years of age or older, clinically diagnosed with a perilunate injury and&#xD;
      willing to adhere to the study protocol will be included for study participation. They must&#xD;
      be willing and able to attend all recommended post-operative follow-up visits based on the&#xD;
      advice of their surgeon. All participants will complete questionnaires and undergo both&#xD;
      clinical and radiographic evaluations. These evaluations will begin at baseline, continue at&#xD;
      the first post-operative visit, and the following intervals: 3, 6, 12, 24, 60 and 120 months.&#xD;
      Individuals will be excluded if they have cognitive impairment or unable to understand what&#xD;
      participation in this study entails, a known alcohol or drug abuser, or anticipated to be&#xD;
      non-compliant. We, the investigators have powered this study to support the embedded RCT,&#xD;
      with an expected N = 50. The investigators anticipate 50 randomized patients over a 2 year&#xD;
      period with an overall 200 patients entered into the cohort and an additional 200 in the&#xD;
      registry arm.&#xD;
