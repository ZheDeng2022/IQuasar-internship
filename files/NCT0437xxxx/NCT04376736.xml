  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unused clinic visits due to patient no-shows continue to plague American healthcare as a&#xD;
      large source of waste and avoidable constraint on access. The average no-show rate across 105&#xD;
      studies was 23% though with wide variation (4% to 79%). No-show behavior has adverse effects&#xD;
      on patients, providers, and healthcare organizations' operational and financial outcomes.&#xD;
      Patients that miss clinic visits are more likely to need acute care and suffer poor health&#xD;
      outcomes. There have been increasingly sophisticated efforts focused on predicting which&#xD;
      patients are likely to no-show. This can allow for tactful over-booking and/or patient&#xD;
      outreach. At Hopkins, investigators have implemented a novel machine learning based approach&#xD;
      for identifying those patients at high-risk for no-show. Offering home visits for patients&#xD;
      who are most likely to no-show is an appealing strategy to connect medical providers with&#xD;
      patients who need care but are otherwise unlikely to receive it. Yet, it is unclear if this&#xD;
      would be helpful to engage patients in their care, and encourage subsequent attendance, or if&#xD;
      it would encourage future missed appointments, fostering a reliance on possible ongoing home&#xD;
      visits. This study would link existing efforts with no-show prediction to home visits by&#xD;
      internal medicine residents and evaluate its clinical impact. Patients at high-risk for&#xD;
      no-show will be randomized into the control arm where patients will be called to remind&#xD;
      patients of their visits. Those randomized into the intervention arm will be offered a one&#xD;
      time home visit in lieu of their in-person visit to help understand barriers to in-person&#xD;
      care and build rapport. Outcomes evaluated include future in-person show rates and healthcare&#xD;
      cost/utilization&#xD;
