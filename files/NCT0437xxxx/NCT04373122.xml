  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unexpected cardiac arrest is a frequent and devastating event with a high mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity. Half of the patients who survive to ICU admission ultimately die because of&#xD;
      hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. With CPR and advanced life support, blood and oxygen&#xD;
      delivery to heart and brain is preserved until circulation is restored. During CPR, coronary&#xD;
      perfusion pressure is a significant predictor of increased rates of return of spontaneous&#xD;
      circulation (ROSC) and survival to hospital discharge, while cerebral perfusion pressure is&#xD;
      crucial for good neurologic outcome. Existing efforts to reduce mortality and morbidity focus&#xD;
      on rapid recognition of cardiac arrest, initiation of basic and advanced life support (ALS),&#xD;
      and optimization of post-arrest care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clamping the descending aorta during cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should redistribute&#xD;
      the blood flow towards brain and heart. Animal models of continuous balloon occlusion of the&#xD;
      aorta in non-traumatic cardiac arrest have shown meaningful increases in coronary artery&#xD;
      blood flow, coronary artery perfusion pressure and carotid blood flow, leading to improved&#xD;
      rates of ROSC, 48h-survival and neurological function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, occlusion of the aorta using a REBOA catheter in the management of&#xD;
      non-compressible abdominal or pelvic hemorrhage has shown improvements in hemodynamic&#xD;
      profiles and has proved to be feasible in both, clinical and preclinical settings for trauma&#xD;
      patients in hemorrhagic shock. These promising data provide an opportunity to improve outcome&#xD;
      after cardiac arrest in humans too. The investigators have developed a protocol for the&#xD;
      reliable and safe placement of a REBOA-catheter during cardiac arrest in a clinical setting&#xD;
      (see ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03664557).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Damage to heart and brain from lack of oxygen supply occurs during the first minutes&#xD;
      following cardiac arrest. It is therefore crucial to apply any measure to improve efficacy of&#xD;
      CPR early in the course of events and therapy. After proving feasibility in a clinical&#xD;
      setting in the trial mentioned above, the next logical step and specific goal of this study&#xD;
      is to transfer this protocol to the preclinical setting, and to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      temporary endovascular occlusion of the descending aorta on the efficacy of CPR early in the&#xD;
      course of treatment of out-of hospital cardiac arrest by means of an increase in blood&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;

      Unexpected cardiac arrest is a devastating event with a high mortality and morbidity. Half of&#xD;
      the patients who survive to ICU admission ultimately die because of hypoxic-ischemic&#xD;
      encephalopathy (HIE). As outcome after cardiac arrest is depending on time and amount of&#xD;
      oxygen delivery to heart and brain, preserving myocardial and cerebral perfusion in the event&#xD;
      of cardiac arrest by the means of effective cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is of utmost&#xD;
      importance. During CPR Coronary perfusion pressure is a significant predictor of increased&#xD;
      rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival to hospital discharge, while&#xD;
      cerebral perfusion pressure is crucial for good neurologic outcome. The absence of ROSC&#xD;
      despite prolonged high quality and efficient initial basic life support (BLS) followed by&#xD;
      traditional ALS ends finally in neuronal damage and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those patients not qualifying for eCPR or in areas where this highly invasive approach is&#xD;
      not readily available, existing efforts to reduce mortality and morbidity focus on rapid&#xD;
      recognition of cardiac arrest, initiation of basic and advanced life support (ALS), and&#xD;
      optimization of post-arrest care.&#xD;

      patients in hemorrhagic shock. These promising data provide an opportunity to improve outcome&#xD;
      after cardiac arrest in humans too. For an ongoing study evaluating its feasibility, the&#xD;
      investigators have developed a protocol for the reliable and safe placement of a&#xD;
      REBOA-catheter during cardiac arrest in a clinical setting (see ClinicalTrials.gov&#xD;
      Identifier: NCT03664557).&#xD;

      course of treatment of out-of hospital cardiac arrest by means of an increase in blood&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to investigate the effect of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion&#xD;
      of the descending aorta early in the course of cardiac arrest therapy on blood pressure,&#xD;
      cerebral oxygenation and endtidalCO2- Data collection allowing for sample calculation for a&#xD;
      large outcome study&#xD;
