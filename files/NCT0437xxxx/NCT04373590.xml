  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of an antipsychotic medication decision&#xD;
      aid and interpersonal and cognitive factors, such as attachment style and motivation, on&#xD;
      emerging adults' ability to engage in shared decision making regarding their medications.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term occupational, social, and economic outcomes associated with psychosis make it&#xD;
      an urgent public health problem. Coordinated specialty care (CSC) is now the gold standard&#xD;
      for early psychosis, demonstrating positive clinical and functional effects in the&#xD;
      short-term, and longer-term reduced hospitalization rates. These services include an array of&#xD;
      treatment options, including psychotropic medications, individual psychotherapy, family&#xD;
      education, and support, and occupational therapy and supported employment/education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While a shorter period between psychosis onset and receipt of appropriate care is associated&#xD;
      with better outcomes, emerging adults often experience significant delays before receiving&#xD;
      treatment, and a large percentage disengage from services once they are commenced. Decisional&#xD;
      conflict about treatment options (i.e., feeling conflicted about which option to choose) and&#xD;
      interpersonal factors such as attachment style and trust in health providers can contribute&#xD;
      to decision delay and discontinuance of chosen options. Decision support tools (e.g.,&#xD;
      decision aids), have been shown to reduce decisional conflict as well as improve service&#xD;
      engagement. A requisite step in expanding the array of decision support tools available to&#xD;
      emerging adults experiencing early psychosis is to better understand their decision-making&#xD;
      ability, capacity, and motivation to engage in decision making and how these relate to their&#xD;
      engagement in CSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well recognized that individuals who are being prescribed antipsychotic medications&#xD;
      often face decisional conflict about their treatment options. An especially controversial&#xD;
      decision is whether individuals should continue taking medication at the same dose or adjust&#xD;
      the dose whilst monitoring their symptoms. This dilemma is the result of some uncertainty&#xD;
      about the appropriate treatment strategy for long-term management of psychosis. The present&#xD;
      project focuses on evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of the use of a decision aid&#xD;
      for making decisions about antipsychotic medication.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Randomization is accomplished using a HIPAA-compliant, Internet-based randomization service (studyrandomizer.com) using permuted blocks of 5. Patients and the participating psychiatrist are not blinded to the condition assigned to them; however, they are not given any explicit information on the DA. The psychiatrist was provided with the DA and received information about it as the DA is delivered by the psychiatrist for patients who are randomized to receive it. The RA who recruit and administer assessments to participants is not blinded to condition, except at baseline.</masking_description>

    <description>The chosen intervention is a one-page DA developed by the first author, published and fully described elsewhere (Zisman-Ilani et al., 2017; Zisman et al., 2018) for use during the psychiatric consultation to help patients and clinicians discuss relevant treatment options pertaining to antipsychotics such as medication nonadherence and self-tapering. The DA format is a simple one-page table with rows containing frequently asked questions by patients about their treatment options and the benefits, risks, and implications of differing decisions. The columns display the treatment options available for the treatment decision in question: continuing, adjusting, or discontinuing antipsychotic medications.</description>
