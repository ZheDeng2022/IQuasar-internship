  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On average, more than 130 Americans die every day from opioid overdose. Surgeons provide 37%&#xD;
      of all opioid prescriptions in the United states, second only behind pain management&#xD;
      physicians. A recent report found that patients who receive a 5-day supply of opioid&#xD;
      medication have a 10% chance of using opioids 12 months later. Additionally, studies have&#xD;
      shown that many opioid abusers are not the intended recipient, with over half diverting them&#xD;
      from friends and family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rhinoplasty is one of the most common procedures performed by facial plastic surgeons, with&#xD;
      over 215,000 performed in the United States in 2017. Patients undergoing nasal surgery have&#xD;
      been shown to be at significant risk for persistent and prolonged opioid use after filling an&#xD;
      opioid prescription in the perioperative period. Thus, the management of postoperative pain&#xD;
      without contributing to the opioid epidemic is a imperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first three days following nasal surgery are generally associated with considerable pain,&#xD;
      with the highest levels occuring within the initial 24 hours. Published studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated the benefit of non-opioid medications following rhinoplasty, such as pregabalin&#xD;
      and celecoxib. There has also been growing recognition of the benefits of &quot;pre-emptive&#xD;
      analgesia,&quot; such as the use of local anesthesia, which not only helps control pain, but in&#xD;
      turn decreases the anxiety caused by pain and can prevent patient turning to narcotics to&#xD;
      break the cycle. These studies have predominantly focused on the immediate postoperative&#xD;
      period, e.g. the first 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, many surgeons use lidocaine with 1% epinephrine as local anesthesia for&#xD;
      rhinoplasty due to its widespread availability, rapid time to onset, and safety profile.&#xD;
      Several studies have shown the benefit of Marcaine bupivacaine over lidocaine for pain&#xD;
      control and opioid consumption during the first 24 hours after surgery. This is not&#xD;
      surprising, as the half-life of lidocaine is approximately 90 minutes in a healthy&#xD;
      individual, compared to 160 minutes for Marcaine bupivacaine. However, there are no studies&#xD;
      to date that have evaluated the effect that long-acting local anesthesia has on&#xD;
      post-operative opioid consumption past the first 24 hours after surgery. Our study aims to&#xD;
      compare total postoperative opioid use for patients who received lidocaine as local&#xD;
      anesthesia at the time of surgery versus a mixture of lidocaine and Marcaine bupivacaine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The local anesthesia regimen administered prior to surgery is a standard practice for&#xD;
      rhinoplasty procedures. However, there is variation in the kind of anesthetic utilized during&#xD;
      this time. In our practice, we have used different combinations along with epinephrine which&#xD;
      include lidocaine or lidocaine with Marcaine bupivacaine dilutions. Although both are&#xD;
      effective at pre-operative local numbing, investigators have seen less reported pain outcomes&#xD;
      as perceived by the patient feedback. Therefore, investigators aim to identify specifically&#xD;
      the usage of post-operative pain medication with those who had an epinephrine/lidocaine local&#xD;
      anesthetic vs. those who had the epi/lidocaine/bupivacaine combination. Patients will be&#xD;
      informed about the study and consented for participation. They will be randomized&#xD;
      pre-operatively by permuted block assignment to the control treatment (1% lidocaine with&#xD;
      1:100,000 epinephrine) or the study treatment (1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine mixed&#xD;
      1:1 with 0.5% Marcaine bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine) using a predetermined&#xD;
      weight-calculated maximum dosage that would be safe for injection of either anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per standard procedure, the patients will be premedicated with a standardized dose of&#xD;
      versed if determined necessary by anesthesia. Anesthesia will be induced utilizing weight&#xD;
      based dosing of propofol and rocuronium. Intraoperative anesthesia will be maintained&#xD;
      utilizing total intravenous anesthesia (propofol, fentanyl/remifentanyl doses). All patients&#xD;
      will be given antibiotics (weight based dosing, Ancef or Clindamycin) and 8mg of&#xD;
      dexamethasone prior to skin incision. Once anesthesia has been induced, the nose will be&#xD;
      injected with local anesthesia as follows: transcutaneous to the bilateral dorsal nasal and&#xD;
      the angular neurovascular bundles, transcutaneously along the columella and nasal dorsum,&#xD;
      transnasally along the nasal dorsum and ala, the bilateral nasal septum, and the inferior&#xD;
      turbinates with a total dose of 10ml's. Topical decongestion and anesthesia will then be&#xD;
      obtained with 3 x 0.5cm cottonoids soaked with 4% cocaine placed bilaterally. A standard&#xD;
      external rhinoplasty approach will the be performed, and grafting done as necessary. At then&#xD;
      end of the procedure, Doyle nasal septal splints will be placed (Reuter-Bivalves if alar&#xD;
      grafting performed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the immediate post-operative period, pain will be controlled with short acting analgesics&#xD;
      (standardized regimen for all patients to be decided with anesthesia team) while in the acute&#xD;
      care setting and recorded again as per standard of care. Once discharged from acute care, the&#xD;
      patient will be given instructions to control their pain with acetaminophen (1000mg every 8&#xD;
      hours) scheduled during the first 72 hours, then as needed thereafter. They will also be&#xD;
      given a prescription for oxycodone (15 tablets) with instruction to take 5mg every 6 hours as&#xD;
      needed for breakthrough pain. They will be provided a pain diary for the first 24 hours to&#xD;
      record their pain using the Faces scale (ranging 1-10 with 1 being no pain up to 10 being the&#xD;
      worst pain ever experienced) at the 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours marks after discharge from&#xD;
      surgery. Additionally, they will be asked to keep track of how many pain medications&#xD;
      (oxycodone) they took over the first week after surgery. Their pain scores and amount of&#xD;
      medication utilized will be recorded upon their follow up visit to the clinic.&#xD;
