  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A core symptom of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is perceptual distortions for appearance,&#xD;
      which contributes to poor insight and delusionality, limits engagement in treatment, and puts&#xD;
      individuals at risk for relapse. Results from this study will provide a comprehensive&#xD;
      mechanistic model of brain, behavioral, and emotional contributors to abnormal perceptual&#xD;
      processing, as well as how malleable it is with visual modulation techniques. This will lay&#xD;
      the groundwork for next-step translational perceptual retraining approaches.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) misperceive specific aspects of one's own&#xD;
      appearance to be conspicuously flawed or defective, despite these being unnoticeable or&#xD;
      appearing minuscule to others. With convictions of disfigurement and ugliness, individuals&#xD;
      with BDD typically have poor insight or delusional beliefs, obsessive thoughts and compulsive&#xD;
      behaviors, anxiety, and depression. These result in significant difficulties in functioning,&#xD;
      depression, suicide attempts (25%), and psychiatric hospitalization (50%). Despite this,&#xD;
      relatively few studies of the neurobiology, and few treatment studies, have been conducted.&#xD;
      This underscores a critical need for research to identify novel targets for intervention&#xD;
      based on a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms.&#xD;
      Neuropsychological, behavioral, and neurobiological research by investigators have uncovered&#xD;
      mechanisms that may contribute to perceptual distortions, including prominent abnormalities&#xD;
      in visual processing systems. These have contributed to a model of diminished global/holistic&#xD;
      processing and enhanced local/detailed processing, attributed to &quot;bottom-up&quot; and &quot;top-down&quot;&#xD;
      disturbances in perception. Using psychophysical experiments and novel visual modulation&#xD;
      techniques, investigators have probed the brain's visual systems responsible for global and&#xD;
      local processing and found early evidence that they may be modifiable in BDD. These&#xD;
      techniques include a &quot;top-down&quot; attentional modulation and a &quot;bottom-up&quot; perceptual&#xD;
      modulation strategy. Abnormal eye gaze and emotional arousal when viewing faces may further&#xD;
      contribute to abnormal perception. Whether these brain and behavior abnormalities are&#xD;
      directly linked to abnormal perception remains to be understood. Accordingly, this study will&#xD;
      determine a) if abnormalities in neural activation and connectivity in BDD when viewing one's&#xD;
      own appearance are directly associated with abnormalities in perceptual functioning; and b)&#xD;
      if changes in neural activation and connectivity from these visual modulation strategies are&#xD;
      linked to changes in perceptual functioning, thus representing potential biomarkers.&#xD;
      Investigators will also determine how attentional systems, eye gaze behaviors and emotional&#xD;
      arousal interact with brain functioning in visual systems, and with global and local&#xD;
      perceptual functioning. Investigators will enroll participants with BDD, with subclinical&#xD;
      BDD, and healthy controls who will undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging while&#xD;
      viewing photographs of own, and others' faces. Investigators will obtain measures of global&#xD;
      and local visual processing, emotional arousal while participants view own face, and eye gaze&#xD;
      behaviors using eye tracking. To understand the malleability of global/local perception, and&#xD;
      the neural mechanisms of these changes, investigators will determine whether repeated visual&#xD;
      modulation using top-down and bottom-up strategies results in alterations of perceptual&#xD;
      functioning and brain activity/connectivity, and relationships between them. Results will&#xD;
      provide a comprehensive mechanistic model of abnormal visual information processing&#xD;
      underlying the core symptom domain of misperceptions of appearance. This will lay the&#xD;
      groundwork for next-step translational approaches.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>In a force-choice recognition task, participants will view sets of upright target faces followed by 2 upright selection faces, and sets of inverted target faces followed by 2 inverted selection faces. Participants will be instructed to select one of the two faces that is the same as the target face, as quickly and as accurately as possible. The dependent variable is the difference in response times for upright vs. inverted faces.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will obtain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while participants view photographs of one's face. After preprocessing and analysis investigators will be able to determine: a) baseline associations between brain activity and connectivity and global/ local processing (face inversion effect), and b) associations between changes in brain activity and connectivity with changes in global/local processing (face inversion effect)</description>

    <measure>Eye gaze behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use eye-tracking for behavioral assessments related to viewing photos of one's face. The primary dependent variable will be mean fixation duration, defined as the mean time that eye gaze is limited to one area (using k-means clustering) across the total viewing duration. We will use an eye-tracker camera to collect data while individuals view photos of one's face. Each face will be 3.5 sec.</description>

    <measure>Emotional valence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use automated facial emotional recognition software to calculate valence based on the activity of specific facial landmarks automatically read from video capture of participants while viewing one's own face. The data will be collected simultaneously with the eye-tracking data collection while viewing own faces. The dependent variable of emotional is calculated as the mean, across the entire face viewing, of the intensity of positive emotional expressions minus the intensity of the negative expression with the highest intensity.</description>
