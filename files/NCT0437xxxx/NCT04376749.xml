  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of sleep wake cycles is indicative of child's neurocognitive functions.&#xD;
      Caffeine therapy is commonly used in neonatal intensive care units for treatment of apnea of&#xD;
      prematurity (AOP), to reduce mechanical ventilation, and improve the success of extubation.&#xD;
      In addition, it is suggested to be associated with positive long-term outcomes on pulmonary&#xD;
      function and neurodevelopment. However, it is still not clear how caffeine therapy affects&#xD;
      the sleep architecture and neurodevelopment of preterm infants. Furthermore, optimal dosing&#xD;
      and timing of caffeine therapy is controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aimed to evaluate the effects of caffeine therapy on sleep architecture and&#xD;
      neurodevelopment in preterm infants during the first year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective observational case-control study will be conducted. Forty preterm infants aged&#xD;
      between 28 to 34 gestational weeks admitted to the Marmara University Neonatal Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit (NICU) from May 2020 to May 2021 will be included. Infants with neonatal risk factors&#xD;
      for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes will be excluded. Duration, timing and cumulative dosage&#xD;
      of caffeine therapy will be calculated. Follow up outcome for neurodevelopment and sleep&#xD;
      architecture of preterm infants who received caffeine therapy will be compared with those who&#xD;
      did not receive caffeine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep and activity behavior recorded by actigraphy, sleep diary and polysomnography at 6, and&#xD;
      12 months corrected age will be compared to noncaffeine group. Neurodevelopment will be&#xD;
      assessed by neurological examination defined by Hammersmith, Ages and Stages Questionnaire&#xD;
      (ASQ-2), and Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Methylxanthines have been prescribed in preterm infants to treat and prevent Apnea of&#xD;
      Prematurity (AOP), for extubation success, for reduction of incidence of BPD, need for&#xD;
      treatment of PDA, retinopathy of prematurity, IVH, and for neuroprotective effects. Caffeine&#xD;
      is the most common drug of choice. Despite its frequent use there are no standardized&#xD;
      protocols for optimal timing and dosage. It is suggested to have a neuroprotective effect,&#xD;
      and associated with reduction of neurological disabilities, cognitive delay. However, there&#xD;
      are studies which found no difference in poor neurological outcomes compared to control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premature infants have more active sleep compared to term infants, and their sleep patterns&#xD;
      mature gradually. Studies about the effects of caffeine therapy on sleep of premature infants&#xD;
      are few. It is known that sleep is associated with child's neurodevelopmental outcomes.&#xD;
      Identifying the impact of caffeine therapy on sleep will help clinicians to identify and&#xD;
      improve neurodevelopmental problems in this vulnerable study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of caffeine therapy on sleep, activity&#xD;
      patterns and neurodevelopment in preterm infants during the first year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the assumption that each year approximately 20 infants receive neonatal caffeine&#xD;
      therapy in the unit, forty preterm infants aged between 28 to 34 gestational weeks admitted&#xD;
      to the Marmara University Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) from May 2020 to May 2021 will&#xD;
      be included. Duration, timing and cumulative dosage of caffeine therapy will be calculated.&#xD;
      The routine practice of Marmara University NICU protocol is to administer caffeine&#xD;
      prophylaxis to infants born at less than 30 weeks of gestational age and/or infants with less&#xD;
      than 1250 grams gestational weight. Infants born between 30 to 34 weeks of gestational age&#xD;
      who has AOP are treated with caffeine therapy with the commonly prescribed dose of 20 mg/kg&#xD;
      loading, and 5-10 mg/kg/day maintenance. Neonatal caffeine therapy continues until the&#xD;
      infants are 34 weeks corrected gestational age and free of any apnea episodes for at least 7&#xD;
      days. Infants with neonatal risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes such as infants&#xD;
      with perinatal asphyxia, intraventricular hemorrhage grade 3 or higher, retinopathy of&#xD;
      prematurity(ROP) of stage 3 or higher, infants using sedative or anticonvulsant drugs at the&#xD;
      time of data collection will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up outcome for sleep architecture and neurodevelopment of preterm infants who received&#xD;
      caffeine therapy will be compared with those who did not receive caffeine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actigraphy Sleep and activity behavior recorded by sleep diary, actigraphy and&#xD;
      polysomnography at 6, and 12 months corrected age will be compared to noncaffeine group.&#xD;
      Sleep wake patterns will be assessed by Philips Respironics Mini-Mitter Actiwatch-2 for at&#xD;
      least 3 days at home environment and sleep diaries within 5-minute intervals will be filled&#xD;
      out by parents simultaneously. Actigraphy is a validated wristwatch-like device that&#xD;
      distinguishes sleep from wakefulness based on accelerometer measured movement. The actiwatch&#xD;
      weighs 16 grams and will be placed on the infant's left ankle. For actigraphy interpretation,&#xD;
      if the activity count exceeds a predefined threshold value the epoch is scored as wake state.&#xD;
      10 minutes with no movements on autograph will be determined as sleep phase. High frequency&#xD;
      movements with &gt;40 movements in each epoch lasting &gt;10 minutes will be determined as wake&#xD;
      state. According to the frequency of infants' movements, a number of sleep-wake variables&#xD;
      will be calculated for analyses with Philips Actiware 6.1.8 software. Mean total sleep&#xD;
      duration, mean sleep duration during the day, mean sleep duration at night, sleep onset&#xD;
      latency (SOL: time taken to fall asleep after reported lights out), wake after sleep onset&#xD;
      (WASO: number of minutes recorded as wake between sleep onset and sleep offset), longest&#xD;
      consolidated sleep period at night (midnight and 6 am), number of night waking, and sleep&#xD;
      efficiency (TST/ time in bed, reported as percent) will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polysomnography Infants will undergo 3-4 hours polysomnography (Embla Systems N7000) in the&#xD;
      pediatric sleep laboratory. Further validation of the actigraphy will be performed by an&#xD;
      epoch-by-epoch comparison of actigraphy and simultaneous polysomnography data. The following&#xD;
      variables will be monitored: electroencephalography, electromyography, electrocardiography,&#xD;
      heart rate and respiratory rate. Respiration will be monitored with a nasal-cannula- pressure&#xD;
      transducer, thoracic and abdominal inductive plethysmography bands and pulse-oximetry.&#xD;
      Polysomnography will be recorded with Embla RemLogic software. For polysomnography scoring,&#xD;
      recommendations of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine Guidelines-2017 will be followed.&#xD;
      The polysomnography data will be analyzed by an expert physician blinded to the actigraphy&#xD;
      results or the newborn infant's clinical data, except for gestational age and days of life.&#xD;
      Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary objective is to assess neurodevelopment of these infants. Neurodevelopment will&#xD;
      be assessed by neurological examination defined by Hammersmith, Ages and Stages Questionnaire&#xD;
      (ASQ), and Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development at 6, and 12 months corrected age&#xD;
      and will be compared to noncaffeine group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological examination will be performed with Hammersmith Neurological Examination.&#xD;
      Hammersmith Neurological Examination is a quick examination for 3 to 24 months old infants.&#xD;
      It consists of 26 items assessing neurological function in 5 groups: cranial nerve function&#xD;
      (max 15 points), posture (maximum 18 points), movements (maximum 6 points), tone (maximum 24&#xD;
      points) and reflexes and reactions (maximum 15 points). Each subgroup is scored from 0 to 3&#xD;
      points and all scores are summed at the end of the examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ages and Stages Questionnaire helps to evaluate developmental progress in children between&#xD;
      the ages of 1 month and 66 months. Ages and Stages Questionnaire lasts approximately 10-15&#xD;
      minutes and assess the child development in 5 developmental areas: gross motor, fine motor,&#xD;
      communication, problem solving and personal- social. Each area consists of 6 questions and&#xD;
      the questions are answered in 3 simple responses: yes, sometimes or not yet. The&#xD;
      questionnaire is scored with a simple 0, 5- and 10-point scoring system (yes: 10 points,&#xD;
      sometimes: 5 points, not yet: 0 points) in 2-3 minutes by parents and the results are&#xD;
      interpreted according to standardized cutoffs by professionals. Ages and Stages&#xD;
      Questionnaire-2 (ASQ-2) is a parent-friendly developmental scale with 0.86 sensitivity, 0.85&#xD;
      specifity, 0.92 test-retest reliability and 0.93 inter-rater reliability. If the score on any&#xD;
      domain is &lt;2SDs below the cut-off point for the Turkish reference group, the child is defined&#xD;
      as at risk for neurodevelopmental delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition produces three composite&#xD;
      scores: the Cognitive Scale (range 55-145), the Language scale (range 45-155) which has&#xD;
      receptive and expressive communication subtests, and the Motor scale (range 45-155), which&#xD;
      consists of Fine Motor, and Gross Motor subtests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child's scores will be compared to the standardized age norms.&#xD;
