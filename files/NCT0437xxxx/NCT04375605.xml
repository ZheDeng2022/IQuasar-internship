    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, stratified, controlled, open-label study&#xD;
      comparing neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy with FLOT versus FLOT chemotherapy alone für patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced, potentially resectable adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction&#xD;
      (GEJ)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RACE trial seeks to demonstrate superiority of preoperative FLOT induction chemotherapy&#xD;
      followed by preoperative radiochemotherapy and postoperative FLOT chemotherapy over&#xD;
      perioperative FLOT chemotherapy without radiotherapy in patients with adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction undergoing adequate oncological surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups, i.e.&#xD;
      preoperative chemotherapy (Arm A) or preoperative chemotherapy with subsequent preoperative&#xD;
      radiochemotherapy (arm B), both followed by resection and postoperative completion of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Randomization will occur in a 1:1 ratio with stratification by primary tumor&#xD;
      site (Siewert I vs. Siewert II/III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to Arm A (control arm) will be treated with four preoperative cycles of&#xD;
      FLOT. Cycles will be repeated every two weeks. The preoperative chemotherapy duration in Arm&#xD;
      A is eight weeks. Surgical resection will follow 4-6 weeks after day 1 of the last cycle of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy. Postoperative chemotherapy will start 6-12 weeks after surgery and&#xD;
      consists of another four cycles of FLOT every two weeks. The total treatment period is 25-32&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized in Arm B (experimental arm) will be treated with two cycles of FLOT every&#xD;
      two weeks. Radiochemotherapy will start three weeks after day 1 of the second cycle and&#xD;
      consists of oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil plus concurrent radiotherapy given to a&#xD;
      dose of 45 Gy (25 daily fractions with 1.8 Gy) over five weeks. The preoperative treatment&#xD;
      duration is 10 weeks. Surgical resection will follow 4-6 weeks after last treatment with&#xD;
      chemotherapy / radiation. Postoperative chemotherapy will start 6-12 weeks after surgery and&#xD;
      consists of four cycles of FLOT every two weeks. The total treatment period is 26-33 weeks.&#xD;
