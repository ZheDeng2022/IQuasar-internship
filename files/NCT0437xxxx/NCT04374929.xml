  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 12 subjects will be enrolled (up to 8 undergoing an AtaCor Temporary Pacing System&#xD;
      procedure) in order to evaluate initial safety and performance of the AtaCor Temporary Pacing&#xD;
      System when used with three (3) strategies for stabilizing AtaCor Temporary Pacing System&#xD;
      electrical measurements over a two (2) to seven (7) day period. The three treatments are (1)&#xD;
      Negative Pressure Wound Therapy, (2) Anti-Inflammatory Glucocorticoid and (3) increased&#xD;
      electrode spacing. A control arm with no additional treatment is also included. Safety will&#xD;
      be evaluated through analysis of all Adverse Events. Performance will be evaluated through&#xD;
      (1) the incidence of successful StealthTrac Lead placement using the MACH I Delivery Tool,&#xD;
      (2) electrical performance measurements, such as pacing capture thresholds, sensed R-wave&#xD;
      amplitudes, pacing impedance and skeletal muscle stimulation. Appropriate sensing and pacing&#xD;
      capture will be ascertained from ECG Holter Monitor recordings during periods of in-hospital&#xD;
      ambulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled Subjects will have both a market-released transvenous pacing lead and&#xD;
      investigational StealthTrac Temporary Pacing Lead placed and evaluated. Following StealthTrac&#xD;
      Lead insertion, each subject will receive (1) one of three (3) study treatments intended to&#xD;
      stabilize pacing capture thresholds and pacing impedance over time or receive no treatment.&#xD;
      The three treatments are (1) Negative Pressure Wound Therapy, (2) Anti-Inflammatory&#xD;
      Glucocorticoid and (3) increased electrode spacing achieved by the use of two inserted&#xD;
      StealthTrac Leads. During the placement procedure, diagnostic echocardiograms will be&#xD;
      performed to detect any new pericardial effusions. Once inserted, the StealthTrac Lead will&#xD;
      be used to deliver high rate pacing (160 to 220 BPM) in clinically appropriate Subjects, to&#xD;
      demonstrate suitability for use in transcatheter procedures that require brief periods of&#xD;
      temporary pacing. Lead positions will be documented using fluoroscopic images before the&#xD;
      Subject leaves the procedure room. On the following two days after the procedure, electrical&#xD;
      performance will be evaluated in multiple postures and appropriate pacing and sensing will be&#xD;
      confirmed during activity using ECG Holter monitor recordings. Subjects will also be asked&#xD;
      patient-centric questions about their experience with the StealthTrac Lead throughout the&#xD;
      study period. Evaluations will continue for a maximum of seven (7) days after the index&#xD;
      procedure. Prior to StealthTrac Lead removal, an X-Ray will be taken to document the final&#xD;
      lead position. A final follow-up will be performed 25-30 days after removal to identify any&#xD;
      latent adverse events before the Subject exits the study.&#xD;

    <description>â€¢ Methylprednisolone 125 mg administered over 30 minutes beginning at least 30 minutes prior to the incision and StealthTrac Lead insertion procedure. This intravenous dose can be repeated every 8 hours on day one of the insertion from 1-3 doses depending on the patient's ability to take oral medications. It can be administered daily thereafter until the patient is able to take oral dosing. In normal circumstances, post op day 2, commence oral glucocorticoid (see below for recommended oral dosing).&#xD;
Oral (PO) glucocorticoid preparations and dosing:&#xD;
Prednisone 40-60 mg orally daily based on BMI category. BMI categories: Low (&lt;18); Medium (18-30); High (&gt;30). Low and medium are assigned 40 mg daily. High BMI is assigned 60 mg daily dose. This while the StealthTrac lead remains in place.&#xD;
Methylprednisolone 16-32 mg daily based on BMI (low, medium and high) while the StealthTrac Lead remains in place.</description>

    <description>Once the first StealthTrac Lead is placed using the procedure described in the AtaCor Temporary Pacing System Instructions for Use (DOC-10085), load a second StealthTrac Lead into the same MACH I Delivery Tool, unless it was damaged during insertion of the first StealthTrac Lead, in which case a new MACH I Delivery Tool should be used.&#xD;
Insert the second StealthTrac Lead through (1) a different intercostal muscle path within the same intercostal space or (2) within an adjacent intercostal space. Increased electrode spacing is achieved by pacing between the leads.</description>
