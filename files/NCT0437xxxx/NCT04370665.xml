  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial focus on the delivery of Cerezyme® in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients&#xD;
      using MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) induced opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leveraging the preclinical evidence and clinical experience with MRgFUS BBB opening in human&#xD;
      subjects, the investigators propose a phase I open-label study to determine the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of three biweekly delivery of Cerezyme® (an analogue of the human enzyme&#xD;
      beta-glucocerebrosidase) via MRgFUS induced BBB opening to unilateral putamen in PD. The&#xD;
      putamen contains terminals of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra, and is a&#xD;
      critically affected brain region in PD. The primary objective is to determine the feasibility&#xD;
      of repeated MRgFUS BBB opening for Cerezyme delivery in unilateral putamen. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to describe the safety and tolerability of the procedure. Another objective is&#xD;
      to measure changes in PD relevant clinical scores and Cerezyme relevant biomarkers in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, open-labelled study to enroll six (6) patients with Parkinson's disease for three biweekly deliveries of Cerezyme® to the unilateral putamen corresponding to the most affected side using Exablate and Definity®-induced BBB opening. This is a dose escalation study. Each subject will be followed for three months after the final procedure.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>MRgFUS BBB Opening will be determined qualitatively by contrast enhancement in the sonicated putamen on T1-weighted with gadolinium MRI, and quantitatively by the change in intensity relative to contralateral unsonicated putamen immediately after MRgFUS BBBD procedure.</description>
