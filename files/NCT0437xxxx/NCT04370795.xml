  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) is a group of conditions where the immune system&#xD;
      does not work properly. The only cure for most SCIDs is a stem cell transplant (getting cells&#xD;
      from a donor). These transplants can have serious complications. Before the transplant,&#xD;
      people often get high doses of drugs and radiation to prepare the body to accept the cells&#xD;
      from the donor. Researchers want to see if low doses of drugs alone without radiation work&#xD;
      just as well as low doses of drugs with radiation for SCID patients getting stem cell&#xD;
      transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test a set of drugs with or without radiation given before a stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 3-40 who have SCID and who have a stem cell donor - either related or unrelated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the hospital 10 days before transplant. They will undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
      medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      medication review&#xD;
&#xD;
      physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      blood and urine tests (may include a 24-hour urine collection)&#xD;
&#xD;
      heart, lung, and breathing tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      imaging scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      bone marrow sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      nutrition assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      dental exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      eye exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      meeting with a social worker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get a plastic port called a central line. It is a hollow tube that is&#xD;
      placed in the upper chest. It will be used to give medicines and take blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will take chemotherapy drugs. Some will get radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a stem cell transplant. They will get the cells as an infusion through&#xD;
      their central line. They will stay in the hospital for 30 days after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must stay within 1 hour of NIH for 3 months after transplant. During this time,&#xD;
      they will have follow-up visits at NIH at least once a week. Then they will have follow-up&#xD;
      visits once or twice a year for 5-6 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label pilot study of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related and&#xD;
      unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant (also referred to as peripheral&#xD;
      blood stem cell [PBSC] transplant or bone marrow transplant [BMT]) for up to 20 patients with&#xD;
      severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). SCID is most commonly caused by mutations in the&#xD;
      IL2RG gene encoding the interleukin (IL) receptor signaling gamma chain (gamma c); however,&#xD;
      patients with JAK-3 mutations have the same phenotypes and are similarly affected. The study&#xD;
      population is older children (greater than or equal to 3 years of age) and adults (less than&#xD;
      or equal to 40 years of age) who are experiencing deteriorating and/or dysfunctional immunity&#xD;
      and/or any of a constellation of severe or chronic medical problems warranting&#xD;
      transplantation. The study is designed to evaluate whether the use of uniquely designed&#xD;
      transplant conditioning either containing total body irradiation (TBI) or not, along with a&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prevention regimen achieves sufficient engraftment of donor&#xD;
      HSCs to facilitate robust restoration of cellular immunity (T cell/natural killer [NK] cell&#xD;
      number and function) including thymic function, and humoral immunity (B cell number and&#xD;
      function), while at the same time enhancing tolerance of the donor graft in a fashion that&#xD;
      reduces the occurrence of GvHD but not significantly enhancing the risk of post-transplant&#xD;
      viral infection. One target population is SCID patients who received matched sibling or&#xD;
      haploidentical lymphocyte-depleted transplants as infants with little or no myeloid&#xD;
      conditioning, resulting in variable restoration of T cell immunity, but little or no&#xD;
      restoration of NK or B cell immunity. Another target population is SCID patients with partial&#xD;
      production or function of gamma c or JAK3 or SCID patients with clonal somatic reversion of&#xD;
      the mutation in the IL2RG or JAK-3 gene, who have less severe immune deficiency in childhood.&#xD;
      A subset of patients from all of these target SCID populations may experience progressive&#xD;
      deterioration of immune function leading to acute and chronic medical problems that warrant&#xD;
      consideration of allogeneic transplant to restore immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conditioning and GvHD prevention regimens for this HSC transplant protocol are designed&#xD;
      to use mobilized PBSCs or bone marrow (if mobilization is not possible) from either an&#xD;
      HLA-matched related donor (MRD) as first choice or from an HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD)&#xD;
      for those without an appropriate HLA-MRD. If there is no appropriate MRD nor MUD adult donor&#xD;
      available, then an appropriate cord blood from the cord blood registries may be used for&#xD;
      small children SCID recipients. We propose using a busulfan-based, nonmyeloablative&#xD;
      conditioning regimen plus or minus TBI combined with horse anti-thymocyte globulin (h-ATG)&#xD;
      immune suppression conditioning plus post-transplant sirolimus as a tolerance-inducing&#xD;
      immunosuppressant to prevent GvHD.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Pregnant or lactating females.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children: Children 3 years of age and older may enroll on this study because the condition&#xD;
        under study affects children and the study holds the prospect for direct benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant and Lactating Women: Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to risks&#xD;
        associated with the study intervention and the effects of the combination of conditioning&#xD;
        medications (h-ATG, busulfan) and total body irradiation on the developing human fetus,&#xD;
        including potential teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If a study participant or partner of a male subject becomes pregnant or suspects she is&#xD;
        pregnant, the participant should notify the study staff immediately. A female participant&#xD;
        who becomes pregnant will be withdrawn from the study as outlined below. If a female&#xD;
        participant or a partner of a male participant becomes pregnant, the participant will have&#xD;
        contact follow-up with the study team to document the outcome of the pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to the&#xD;
        mother undergoing the study intervention, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
        mother will undergo the study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Decisionally Impaired Adults: Adults who are unable to consent are eligible for enrollment&#xD;
        in this protocol because they still benefit clinically from the study. However, the&#xD;
        participant must have a DPA that can give consent. Similarly, enrolled participants who&#xD;
        lose the ability to provide ongoing consent during study participation may continue in the&#xD;
        study. The risks and benefits of participation for adults unable to consent should be&#xD;
        identical to those described for less vulnerable patients.&#xD;
