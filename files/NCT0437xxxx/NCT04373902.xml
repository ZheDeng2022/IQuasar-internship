  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension is a major determinant of postnatal survival in infants with a&#xD;
      congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). The current care during the perinatal stabilisation&#xD;
      period in infants born with this rare birth defect might contribute to the development of&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension after birth - in particular umbilical cord clamping before lung&#xD;
      aeration. An ovine model of diaphragmatic hernia demonstrated that cord clamping after lung&#xD;
      aeration, called physiological-based cord clamping (PBCC), avoided the initial high pressures&#xD;
      in the lung vasculature while maintaining adequate blood flow, thereby avoiding vascular&#xD;
      remodelling and aggravation of pulmonary hypertension. The investigators aim to investigate&#xD;
      if the implementation of PBCC in the perinatal stabilisation period of infants born with a&#xD;
      CDH could reduce the incidence of pulmonary hypertension in the first 24 hours after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a multicentre, randomised controlled trial in infants with an&#xD;
      isolated CDH. Before birth, infants will be randomised to either PBCC or immediate cord&#xD;
      clamping, stratified by treatment centre and severity of pulmonary hypoplasia on antenatal&#xD;
      ultrasound. For performing PBCC a purpose-designed resuscitation module (the Concord Birth&#xD;
      Trolley) will be used.&#xD;

    <description>In PBCC, the Concord will be placed next to the bed of the mother and all equipment will be checked before the second stage of labour has started. The infant will be placed on the platform of the Concord immediately after birth, avoiding any traction or pressure on the cord and avoiding heat loss by radiation heating. The umbilical cord will not be clamped until the infant is considered respiratory stable, which is defined as the presence of a heart rate &gt;100 bpm and preductal oxygen saturation &gt;85%, while using an fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of &lt;0.5. The minimum and maximum times of cord clamping are three and ten minutes after birth, respectively. Oxytocin administration will be postponed until after cord clamping if there are no obstetric concerns. At any time, the attending neonatologist and obstetrician can decide that PBCC should not be performed or be interrupted. In that case, the infant can be placed on the standard resuscitation table for (further) stabilisation.</description>

    <description>In the immediate cord clamping group, the cord will be clamped immediately after birth. The infant will then be transferred to the standard neonatal resuscitation table. After cord clamping, all infants will be managed according to the standardised neonatal management protocol for infants with a CDH, which is a consensus of current clinical guidelines by the CDH EURO consortium.</description>
