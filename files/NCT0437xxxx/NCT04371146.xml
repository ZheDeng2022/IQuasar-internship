  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approach versus avoidance decisions are at the centre of adaptive behaviour and survival.&#xD;
      These decisions are thought to be guided by the value of the choice options, which are a&#xD;
      function of the magnitude of predicted rewards and punishments. Moreover, the allocation of&#xD;
      attention to choice options is thought to be driven by salience, i.e. the overall importance&#xD;
      of the predicted outcomes. While salience increases with the magnitude of both predicted&#xD;
      rewards and predicted punishments, value increases with reward but decreases with punishment.&#xD;
      In previous research, value and salience have often remained confounded during value-based&#xD;
      decision making. Rodent research suggests that value is associated with dopamine and salience&#xD;
      with norepinephrine. The present study aims at disentangling value from salience processing&#xD;
      during decision-making tasks in healthy subjects by administering dopamine or noradrenaline&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitors. This is done by using a single dose challenge in a randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled between subject's design, administering either methylphenidate (35 mg),&#xD;
      reboxetine (8 mg), or placebo to healthy young participants before they perform tasks tapping&#xD;
      into various aspects of value and salience.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Response time data</measure>
    <time_frame>These tasks take place 1,5 hours after the drug was administered</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators record responses and specifically reaction times during 5 different decision-making tasks.&#xD;
In a value vs salience task, value and salience processing is disentangled during value-based decision-making. Participants either accept or reject compound stimuli that were before associated with monetary outcomes.&#xD;
In a face in the crowd task, participants detect a target face (angry vs happy) in a crowd of opposite face type.&#xD;
During a task on risk and ambiguity decision-making, participants have to decide between safe and lottery options associated with either monetary risk or ambiguity.&#xD;
In an adaptive risk-taking task, participants have to choose between two risky monetary options.&#xD;
In an effort task, participants decide whether they are willing to exert physical effort for monetary reward.&#xD;
Response times are measured in milliseconds from the tasks. The investigators calculate how long participants take to make decisions in each trial.</description>
