  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomised, interventional, double blinded study to compare the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes of thermal vs. pulsed radiofrequency (RF) treatment of the genicular nerves&#xD;
      in patients with painful osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: 60 patients, aged 50 and above, with painful OA of the knee. Interventional&#xD;
      measures: Pulsed or heated RF treatment of the genicular nerves of the involved knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: primary - fraction of patients experiencing improvement of 50% or higher in&#xD;
      their average pain rating during stair climbing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      secondary - improved quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improved functional capacity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  comparison of side effects and adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  change in the consumption of analgesic medications&#xD;

      Pre-intervention assessment Pain intensity during stairs climbing using VAS 1-100 numerical&#xD;
      rating scale. Analgesics consumption. Quality of life using WOMAC questionaires. A physician&#xD;
      will further examine them and will enroll them signing an informed concent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diagnostic block with lidocaine 2% (2ml for each nerve - total volume of 6ml per knee) of 3&#xD;
      genicular nerves (upper medial and lateral and lower medial branches) will be performed,&#xD;
      guided either by ultrasound or by fluoroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to fill in a VAS questionnaire shortly (up to one hour) after&#xD;
      undergoing the diagnostic blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants achieving a relief of &gt;50% in pain intensity during stairs climbing will be&#xD;
      considered to have responded to the diagnostic block and will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruited participants will be randomized into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Heated RF ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pulsed RF ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding Both the patient and the assessing physician will be blinded to the group to which&#xD;
      the patient has been allocated. The physicians performing the treatment will be blinded as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heated RF ablation of the genicular nerves will be performed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the supine position, aseptic preparation of the skin and sterile coverage of the&#xD;
           procedure area will take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After the administration of local anesthesia to the skin with lidocain 2% (1-1.5cc for&#xD;
           each injection site, fluoroscopy guided placement of three 22 gauge 50mm or 100mm&#xD;
           straight RF cannulas in the proximity of 3 of the genicular nerves: 2 on both sides of&#xD;
           the distal femoral shaft-epiphysis border and one on the medial proximal tibial&#xD;
           epiphyseal-shaft border.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sensory stimulation at 50 Hertz will be used to test the proper position of the needle,&#xD;
           expected to generate paresthesia in the distribution of the affected nerve, at a voltage&#xD;
           in the range of 0.3-0.8 Volts. Motor stimulation at 2 Hz will be used to exclude&#xD;
           proximity of the cannula to motor nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 1 ml of 2% lidocaine will be injected into each cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 180 sec 80 degrees heated RF ablation of the nerves will be performed. Needles will be&#xD;
           left in place for additional 420 seconds to match the treatment duration of the pulsed&#xD;
           RF group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Injection of a total amount of 80 mg methylprednisolone and lidocaine 2% 2cc to the 3&#xD;
           intervention sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulsed RF ablation of the genicular nerves will be performed similarly to the heated RF&#xD;
      ablation with the only difference being that the treatment will include a 600 sec of 42&#xD;
      degrees heating of the three-genicular nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding Both the patient the assessing and performing physicians will be blinded to the&#xD;
      group to which the patient has been allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-procedural assessment Participants will be assessed 3 days and 30 days after the&#xD;
      procedure (phone questionnaires) and a clinical follow-up visits in 3 and 6 months after the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Two telephone interviews, in which the patient will report the average severity of pain&#xD;
           on a 1 to 100 numerical rating scale and will fill up a WOMAC questionnaire regarding&#xD;
           the treated knee in the prior 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Two clinic follow-up visit, during which the patients will fill-in a questionnaire of&#xD;
           pain intensity after stairs climbing using VAS 1-100 numerical rating, analgesic&#xD;
           consumption, quality of life measures using the WOMAC questionaire. Questionnaires&#xD;
           filling-in will be aided and supervised by research assistants blinded to the&#xD;
           intervention the participants have received.&#xD;
