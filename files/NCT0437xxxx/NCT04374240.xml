      This is an open label, non-randomised, phase I, sequential group trial which will explore the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of ascending doses of AdNRGM, in combination with CB1954. Five groups&#xD;
      of 3 patients each will be treated with escalating doses of AdNRGM (10^10, 3x10^10, 10^11,&#xD;
      3x10^11, 10^12 vp) followed 2 days later by intravenous CB1954 at a fixed dose (24mg/m^2). To&#xD;
      ensure the coverage of the whole prostate the vector will be delivered by multiple,&#xD;
      template-guided trans-perineal injections using an adaptation of standard prostate&#xD;
      brachytherapy technique. Dose escalation will be dependent on safety and tolerability; at&#xD;
      each dose-level, if dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is seen in one patient, the cohort will be&#xD;
      expanded to a maximum of 6 patients. If DLT is then observed in a second patient at that&#xD;
      dose, no further patients will be recruited and the previous (lower) dose-level will be&#xD;
      defined as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). If DLT is seen in 0/3 or just 1/6 patients, dose&#xD;
      escalation may continue.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Locally relapsed prostate cancer presents an attractive target for gene therapy because the&#xD;
      tumour remains localised to the prostate or to the surrounding tissue for a long phase of the&#xD;
      disease. Also the delivery of gene therapy vectors to the prostate is straightforward using&#xD;
      either ultrasound-guided, trans-rectal injection or adapting methods developed for&#xD;
      brachytherapy, to deliver multiple, template-guided trans-perineal injections to achieve&#xD;
      saturation coverage of the prostate. Several gene therapy and gene-immunotherapy strategies&#xD;
      have been tested in patients with locally relapsed or metastatic prostate cancer, including&#xD;
      Virus Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy (VDEPT), Conditionally Replicating Adenoviruses (CRAds)&#xD;
      and GMCSF based immune stimulation. These treatments were well tolerated and showed some&#xD;
      evidence of anti-tumour activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nitroreductase/CB1954 VDEPT system:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nitroreductase/CB1954 system employs E. coli nitroreductase (NTR) as the prodrug&#xD;
      activating enzyme, and CB1954 as the prodrug to be activated. To exploit this system a an&#xD;
      E1-E3 deleted, replication-defective human adenovirus (Ad5) designated CTL102 which contains&#xD;
      the NTR gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was previously&#xD;
      generated. CTL102 was able to infect cancer cells and to induce NTR expression in vitro, in&#xD;
      addition NTR expressing cells are sensitised to CB1954. Experiments carried out in animal&#xD;
      models demonstrated that NTR expression could be detected in prostate cancer xenografts&#xD;
      injected with CTL102 and that growth of the xenografts was inhibited by intratumoural&#xD;
      injection of CTL102 followed 2 days later by intra peritoneal administration of CB1954.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CB1954 prodrug conversion and clinical development:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CB1954 [5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide] is a weak alkylating agent that is reduced by&#xD;
      the rat nitroreductase enzyme DT diaphorase to a potent, bifunctional alkylating agent&#xD;
      (5-(aziridin-1-yl)-4-hydroxylamino-2-nitrobenzamide) that cross-links DNA and is able to kill&#xD;
      both dividing and non-dividing cells. The human and murine forms of DT diaphorase are&#xD;
      deficient in this reaction. A nitroreductase enzyme encoded by the nfsB gene of E. coli was&#xD;
      found to perform the same reduction 60 to 100-fold faster than the rat DT diaphorase, and&#xD;
      this is the enzyme (NTR) encoded in CTL102 and AdNRGM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase I pharmacokinetic trial of CB1954 defined its maximum tolerated dose (MTD),&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicities and plasma concentration-time profile. Ten cohorts of three patients&#xD;
      each were treated with CB1954 at dose levels of 3mg/m2 to 37.5 mg/m^2. No marrow suppression,&#xD;
      nephrotoxicity or alopecia was observed. Dose limiting toxicities (one grade 4 diarrhoea and&#xD;
      two grade 2 hepatic toxicity) were seen at 37.5 mg/m^2; other toxicities included nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, anorexia and fatigue. Side effects recorded at 24 mg/m^2 were grade 3 nausea and&#xD;
      fatigue, therefore this dose was recommended as the standard dose for future clinical trials.&#xD;
      A clouding of the lens of the eye, also known as cataract, occurred in a few animals given&#xD;
      the CB1954 drug. The Investigators believe this change is highly unlikely to occur in humans&#xD;
      and none of the patients who were treated with this drug in previous clinical trials has&#xD;
      suffered from this complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase I/II clinical trial of CTL102/CB1954 was completed in men with prostate cancer. In&#xD;
      the first stage of the trial 20 patients who were scheduled for radical prostatectomy&#xD;
      received CTL102 alone, via intraprostatic injection, prior to surgery. Objectives of this&#xD;
      part of the study were safety, tolerability and level of NTR expression. Immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      demonstrated NTR staining of the glandular epithelium of the tumour and of the normal&#xD;
      prostate tissue at all dose levels which were used (1x10^10 to 1x10^12 virus particles).&#xD;
      Expression of NTR was found in 30-50% of the prostate specimen slides and appeared to&#xD;
      increase when using higher vector doses or multiple injections, however there was no&#xD;
      statistically significant relationship between virus dose and extent of NTR expression. Gene&#xD;
      therapy was well tolerated, although one patient who received 5x10^10 vp had a DLT (transient&#xD;
      bilirubin increase). The cohort was therefore expanded but no other DLT was observed and dose&#xD;
      escalation could be resumed. (The DLT was subsequently attributed to a post-operative&#xD;
      myocardial infarction.) Other adverse events were transient grade 3 lymphopaenia (3 patients)&#xD;
      and grade 2 hepatic enzymes increase (4 patients). There were no treatment-related serious&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our data show that the intraprostatic injection of CTL102 followed by intravenous CB1954 is&#xD;
      safe and well tolerated11. CTL102 was able to induce NTR expression and the CTL102/CB1954&#xD;
      treatment provided early indications of activity. However, the overall anti-tumour efficacy&#xD;
      of this approach was sub-optimal, with only two patients showing a PSA decrease &gt;50% and&#xD;
      viable tumour cells still present in post-treatment biopsies. It is likely that the&#xD;
      relatively small fraction of tumour cells expressing NTR, and their localised distribution&#xD;
      was responsible for the limited anti-tumour activity of CTL102/CB1954. In order to increase&#xD;
      efficacy the current clinical trial has incorporated two significant improvements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To achieve better distribution of the vector throughout the prostate the vector will be&#xD;
           administered using an adaptation of the technique of prostate brachytherapy, via&#xD;
           multiple template-guided trans-perineal injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To increase efficacy VDEPT with GMCSF based immune stimulation, using an E1,E3-deleted,&#xD;
           replication defective adenovirus (AdNRGM) expressing both NTR and human GMCSF will be&#xD;
           combined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed dose levels for AdNRGM are 10^10, 3x10^10, 10^11, 3x10^11, 10^12 vp while the&#xD;
      prodrug CB1954 will be given at a standard dose of 24 mg/m^2. In vitro experiments allow us&#xD;
      to estimate that 1 x 10^10 vp of AdNRGM is likely to result in production of 5 - 25 µg&#xD;
      GMCSF/24 h. Clinical trials of GMCSF have used single doses of 500 µg, or repeated doses of&#xD;
      up to 250 µg/m^2. The Investigators consider that a starting dose of 1 x 10^10 vp therefore&#xD;
      provides a sufficient safety margin for GMCSF production. The fixed dose or 24 mg/m^2 CB1954&#xD;
      is the dose recommended following an initial dose-escalation trial of CB1954 alone.&#xD;
