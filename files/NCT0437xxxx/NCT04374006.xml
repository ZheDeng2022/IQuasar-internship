      This study aims to evaluating inflammatory and apoptotic activity in rat's endometriosis&#xD;
      lesion treated by Propolis compared to Dienogest&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Propolis has known of having various efficacy. The main benefits are as antimicrobial,&#xD;
      antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and antiapoptotic.Propolis has even been&#xD;
      shown to have an antibacterial effect in vitro, without requiring human immunological&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunological effect of propolis is generated through immune suppression directly and&#xD;
      decreasing cytokine production which stimulates immune process. Although proven to have a&#xD;
      various efficacy, propolis can't be used as a therapeutic drug due to the difficulty of&#xD;
      obtaining standard chemical composition as a requirement to be the drug's substances.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is necessary to have biological composition in each propolis prepartions&#xD;
      written down before comparing the efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti tumor activity by propolis, which has been tested in animal previously, showed that&#xD;
      propolis can inhibit DNA synthesis in tumor cells, induce cell apoptosis and activate&#xD;
      macrophage to produce factors which regulate the function of B, T, as well as NK cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dienogest, is the next choice of progestin drug class. It has high selectivity binding in&#xD;
      progesterone receptors, inhibits cytokine secretion in endometriosis stroma cell and induces&#xD;
      apoptosis in endometriosis cell. Dienogest also has slight inhibitory effect against&#xD;
      estradiol, so it can deminisce the symptoms due to hypoestrogenic such as decresing in bone&#xD;
      mass density.&#xD;

    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The expression of Bax, Bcl-2, ad Caspase 3, IL-1B, PGE2 mRNA was carried out by isolating the RNA samples of endometriosis tissue based on the modified QIAamp RNA Blod Mini Handbook protocol. RNA spectrophotometric measurments and cDNA synthesis were carried out based on the Instruction Manual ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix with gDNA Remover protocol (Toyobo 2017: 2). In real-time PCR examination, the melting temperature (Tm) was determined to perform Quantitative Real-time PCR (Q-PCR) based on the QuantiTech SYBR Green PCR Handbook protocol (Qiagen 2011: 11) using a 3-step cycling cycle. The results were then compared with the standard curve and analyzed</description>

    <measure>Mollecular docking</measure>
    <time_frame>during the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Twenty-three compounds contained in Propolis were tested by screening using rule of 5 (Lipinski's rule), screening results determine which compounds can enter the body and can work in endometriosis tissue. Furthermore, the three-dimensional shape is made of compounds which have passed the first stage. This process was created using the Marvin Sketch program. Furthermore, the compound that has been formed is stored as a ligand with extension pdb (protein data bank). Look for NFĸB receptor proteins, estrogen A, estrogen B, progesterone A and progesterone B in the protein data bank, which will be stored as protein. Ligands and proteins are tested using standard Lamarckian algorithms in the Autodock program. The results obtained are in the form of bond energy (ΔG), where smaller results indicate a higher likelihood of interaction</description>

    <measure>Lession size</measure>
    <time_frame>during the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>In the second laparotomy (before the treatment are given) the investigators take a picture of the lession (as the beginning lession). Then the investigators give the treatment. After the treatment are done, the investigators do the necropsy to take a picture after the treatment was given to compare it with the beginning</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The normality of estrus cycle after the treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>during the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Vaginal discharge of the rat obtained through vaginal lavage was fixed using 90% alcohol solution and stained using Giemsa. The specimen was examined microscopically to determined its estrous cycle</description>

    <measure>Organs morpholgy after the treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>In the necropsy, the investigators take ovarium, uterus, and peritonium to see if there's any change in morphology after the treatment was given</description>
