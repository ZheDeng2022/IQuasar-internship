  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The NHS is facing significant challenges in recruiting and retaining staff,&#xD;
      particularly registered nurses (RNs). Recruiting unregistered staff is often adopted as a&#xD;
      solution to the RN shortage; however recent research found a negative effect of low RN&#xD;
      staffing levels on mortality with no evidence that high levels of assistant staff could&#xD;
      mitigate the increased risk. Economic modelling suggested that increases in skill mix were&#xD;
      potentially cost-effective, but these findings derive from a single NHS hospital Trust with&#xD;
      limited cost and outcome data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives: This project aims to estimate the consequences, costs and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of variation in the size and composition of the staff on hospital wards in&#xD;
      England. In order to provide estimates that are more likely to apply across the NHS, this&#xD;
      study will include at least four hospitals and consider a wider range of outcomes and sources&#xD;
      of costs, including death within 30 days of admission, adverse events such as infections,&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, readmissions and rates of staff sickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This retrospective longitudinal observational study will use routinely collected&#xD;
      data on ward and shift level nurse staffing, and patient outcomes. Data will be derived from&#xD;
      the E-Roster systems, used by hospitals to record all planned and worked shifts. The&#xD;
      investigators will consider all rostered direct care staff. These data will be linked to&#xD;
      patient data derived from the hospital patient administration system (PAS); and other&#xD;
      clinical systems and databases of adverse events (e.g. datix). Relationships between RN and&#xD;
      assistant staffing levels and outcomes will be explored using survival models incorporating&#xD;
      mixed effects. The investigators will use the results of these analyses to model the costs&#xD;
      and consequences of different staffing configurations and to estimate the incremental&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness associated with change. Our study will provide evidence to inform staffing&#xD;
      levels and skill mix planning in the NHS, highlighting potential cost savings, and offering&#xD;
      improved patient safety and reduced adverse staff outcomes.&#xD;

      Note that for this study, &quot;Study start&quot; means the date the first hospital Trust was&#xD;
      recruited. &quot;Primary completion&quot; is the date by which the investigators anticipate data&#xD;
      analysis for the primary outcomes will be complete. &quot;Study completion&quot; is the data by which&#xD;
      investigators anticipate data analysis for secondary outcomes will be complete.&#xD;
