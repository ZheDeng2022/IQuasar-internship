  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      intratumoral T3011 given alone and in combination with intravenous pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, first-in-human study of T3011 given via intratumoral (IT)&#xD;
      injection as a single agent and in combination with IV pembrolizumab in participants with&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The Phase 1 portion of the study is a single agent dose&#xD;
      escalation which will use a 3+3 design to evaluate escalating doses of T3011. Total&#xD;
      enrollment will depend on the toxicities and/or activity observed, with approximately 24&#xD;
      evaluable participants enrolled. Once the RP2D is established Phase 2a Part 1 will enroll&#xD;
      approximately 10 participants with locally recurrent or metastatic melanoma (Arm A) and&#xD;
      approximately 10 participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, excluding metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma (Arm B). During Phase 2a Part 1 the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      of T3011 as a single agent will be evaluated. Upon completion of Phase 2a Part 1, Phase 2a&#xD;
      Part 2 will begin. The safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of IT T3011 given in&#xD;
      combination with IV pembrolizumab will be evaluated in 20 participants with histologically or&#xD;
      pathologically confirmed metastatic NSCLC. A rollover arm is also included in this study to&#xD;
      allow participants who have documented progression on T3011 alone to receive T3011 in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab if considered eligible.&#xD;
