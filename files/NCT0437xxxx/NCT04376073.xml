  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, the standard treatment for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients is&#xD;
      platinum-free chemotherapy, with poor efficacy and tolerance. The combination of&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic drugs and PARPi can play a synergistic anti-tumor role and achieve good&#xD;
      efficacy in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. This study intends to explore the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of anlotinib and niraparib dual therapy in patients with&#xD;
      platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal&#xD;
      cancer (ovarian cancer).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is an open, single-center, prospective, single-arm phase II study to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy and safety of nilapalil combined with anrotidine in the treatment of&#xD;
      platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. In this study, 40 histopathologically diagnosed&#xD;
      patients with high-grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer were&#xD;
      treated with neelapalil plus anrotinib in patients who underwent first-line chemotherapy or&#xD;
      above and had a recurrence of platinum-resistant chemotherapy (the time of tumor progression&#xD;
      of the last platinum-containing chemotherapy &lt; 6 months). The study will be divided into two&#xD;
      phases. The first phase will include six patients on a 21-day cycle (nierapalil 200mg QD*21;&#xD;
      Anrotidine 12mg qd d1-14, d15-21 suspension), all subsequent patients were enrolled if no&#xD;
      more than dose-restricted toxic event occurred within a cycle, and the combination treatment&#xD;
      was continued until the disease progressed or the toxicity was intolerable.&#xD;
