  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deficits in upper limb (UL) functional recovery persist in a large proportion of stroke&#xD;
      survivors. Understanding how to obtain the best possible UL recovery is a major scientific,&#xD;
      clinical and patient priority. We propose that UL motor recovery may be improved by training&#xD;
      that focuses on remediating an individual's specific motor impairment. Our approach is based&#xD;
      on evidence that deficits in the control of muscle activation thresholds (spatial thresholds)&#xD;
      of the elbow in stroke underlie impairments such as disordered movement and spasticity. Our&#xD;
      novel training program focuses on improving the individual's active elbow control range using&#xD;
      error augmentation (EA) feedback. Since training intensity and lesion load are key factors in&#xD;
      motor recovery that lack guidelines, we will also investigate effects of exercise dose and&#xD;
      corticospinal tract (CST) injury on UL recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial (RCT),&#xD;
      patients with stroke will participate in an individualized intensive technology-assisted&#xD;
      reaching training program, based on error augmentation (EA), in order to improve voluntary&#xD;
      elbow function. They will practice robot-assisted reaching in a virtual reality (VR) game&#xD;
      setting. We will identify if intensive training with feedback aimed at expanding the range of&#xD;
      spatial threshold (ST) control at the elbow (experimental group) is better than intensive&#xD;
      training with general feedback about task success (control group). We will also determine the&#xD;
      patient-specific optimal therapy dose by comparing kinematic and clinical outcomes after 3, 6&#xD;
      and 9 weeks of intensive training, and again at 4 weeks after training to determine&#xD;
      carry-over effects. We will quantify the severity of the participant's motor deficit, as the&#xD;
      amount of cortico spinal tract (CST) injury due to the stroke (%CST injury) and relate&#xD;
      training gains to their %CST injury. Results of this pragmatic trial will provide essential&#xD;
      information for optimizing individualized post-stroke training programs and help determine&#xD;
      optimal patient-specific training dosing to improve motor recovery in people with different&#xD;
      levels of stroke severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type of research involving personalized, impairment-based feedback and dose-effective&#xD;
      training has the potential to significantly improve rehabilitation for a greater number of&#xD;
      post-stroke individuals and improve the health and quality of life of Canadians.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recovery of upper limb movement after stroke is incomplete. Stroke is a leading cause of&#xD;
      long-term sensorimotor disability including persistent deficits in upper limb (UL) function.&#xD;
      Understanding how to improve UL recovery is a major scientific, clinical and patient&#xD;
      priority. Yet, despite numerous studies attempting to identify the most effective&#xD;
      rehabilitation interventions based on established principles of motor learning and neural&#xD;
      plasticity, post-stroke UL recovery remains incomplete. Indeed, even with therapy, UL&#xD;
      sensorimotor deficits persist in a large proportion (up to 62%) of stroke survivors for &gt;6&#xD;
      months leading to a high socio-economic burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MOTOR CONTROL DISORDERS: A consequence of the underlying control deficit after stroke is&#xD;
      hemiparesis, characterized by a diminished capacity to recruit agonist muscles,&#xD;
      unwanted/inappropriate muscle activation (i.e., spasticity, agonist and antagonist muscle&#xD;
      co-contraction), abnormal muscle activation timing, weakness and muscle fiber property&#xD;
      changes. This leads to deficits in the ability to isolate joint movement and appropriately&#xD;
      combine different joints to accomplish task-related functions. We have accumulated&#xD;
      substantial evidence suggesting that movement deficits and spasticity are associated with a&#xD;
      common control deficit in the specification and regulation of spatia thresholds (ST) of the&#xD;
      stretch reflex and other proprioceptive reflexes. STs are expressed in the spatial (angular)&#xD;
      rather than the temporal (latency) domain. ST regulation is a well-established mechanism of&#xD;
      control of stretch reflexes in animals and reflexes and movements in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ST DEFINITION AND ACTION MECHANISMS: Spatial threshold (ST) is the joint angle at which&#xD;
      muscles begin to be recruited and postural reflexes and other reflexes begin to act. By&#xD;
      shifting ST, the brain resets posture-stabilizing mechanisms to a new limb or body position.&#xD;
      These mechanisms combine to regulate STs in multi-muscle systems according to body&#xD;
      configuration and task demands. Stroke results in deficits in ST regulation. Central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS) injuries affecting descending and spinal mechanisms and intrinsic lead to&#xD;
      limitations in ST regulation. As a result, passive or active movements past the angular&#xD;
      threshold, ST (spasticity range), elicit abnormal reflex muscle activation. The ST is&#xD;
      velocity-dependent reducing the active control range in stroke patients and their ability to&#xD;
      make faster movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION APPROACH: Our approach is designed to increase the reflex-free range of elbow&#xD;
      motion in stroke. Adaptation of elbow movement to a new load (i.e., the ability to correct&#xD;
      errors) in patients with chronic stroke was substantially improved when movement was made&#xD;
      within the active control range (where spasticity did not affect muscle contraction) compared&#xD;
      to when the reflex-free range was not identified. Accordingly, the potential for motor&#xD;
      learning may be improved by considering the range of impaired elbow movement in properly&#xD;
      designed trials. To avoid eliciting movements made with abnormal muscle activation patterns&#xD;
      and other compensations (bad plasticity), training programs will be tailored to the movement&#xD;
      capacity of the individual and incorporate approaches that quantify and enlarge the joint&#xD;
      range made with typical muscle activation patterns. In this proposal, we will use a robot and&#xD;
      a novel VR learning interface to manipulate the ability to produce controlled movement at the&#xD;
      elbow, which is a common impairment in people with moderate to severe stroke. The proposed&#xD;
      personalized training approach focuses on providing specific feedback to increase an&#xD;
      individual's ST regulation range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERROR AUGMENTATION FEEDBACK (EA): Error Augmentation feedback will be used to increase the&#xD;
      active control ST zone of the elbow. EA uses intrinsic error-driven learning to enhance the&#xD;
      CNS's ability to take advantage of kinematic redundancy and find meaningful motor task&#xD;
      solutions. Specifically, subjects are provided with feedback that enhances their motor&#xD;
      errors. Manipulation of error signals has been shown to stimulate UL sensorimotor improvement&#xD;
      in both healthy and stroke subjects with greater learning gains occurring when errors are&#xD;
      larger. EA feedback will be used to dynamically remap the active elbow control range. Visual&#xD;
      feedback about elbow angle will be modified, to make it seem as if the elbow moves less than&#xD;
      in reality. Thus, when the actual elbow moves, the subject perceives the elbow as having&#xD;
      moved less and attempts to correct the error by extending the elbow further. The active&#xD;
      control range will be expanded by having subjects working near or just at the limit of their&#xD;
      ST range. Remapping of the perception/action relationship will occur when the afferent&#xD;
      feedback becomes associated with a greater elbow angle. Given the key role of errors in motor&#xD;
      learning, artificially increasing the performance error via EA will increase each&#xD;
      individual's active control range and cause learning to occur more quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPACT ON REHABILITATION: Results will build knowledge that can guide clinicians and their&#xD;
      patients in identifying the best type of training for UL functional recovery - an essential&#xD;
      component of reintegration into daily life activities. Findings can also support a paradigm&#xD;
      shift in clinical practice, encouraging rehabilitation practitioners to consider personalized&#xD;
      intervention options for improving outcomes. Increasing therapeutic options can also&#xD;
      contribute to personalized care that is tailored to the patient's particular needs and lead&#xD;
      to better functional outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1 - Determine the effectiveness of personalized exercise using EA to expand the&#xD;
      range of active elbow control in post-stroke subjects. Hypothesis 1: Intrinsic feedback about&#xD;
      movement error at the elbow will lead to dynamic remapping of muscle-level control&#xD;
      mechanisms, and improve the range of active elbow joint movement. Hypothesis 2: Subjects&#xD;
      practicing with EA will be able to incorporate the greater elbow joint range into functional&#xD;
      reaching movements, as reflected in better clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2 - Determine the patient-specific optimal dose of intensive exercise to maximize&#xD;
      arm motor recovery. Hypothesis 3: Increased training dose will lead to better kinematic and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes and better motor learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3 - Relate the amount of CST damage to UL recovery based on kinematic and clinical&#xD;
      measures. Hypothesis 4: Greater CST damage will be correlated with poorer motor learning and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups, training duration,&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRAINING DURATION: 54 subjects will perform ~30 min/session of target reaching with their&#xD;
      affected arm. To control for intensity, practice will be extended to the time needed to&#xD;
      complete 138 reaches/session with 6-10s between reaches. Sessions will be done 3 times/wk for&#xD;
      9 wks (i.e., 27 sessions, 810 mins, 3,726 trials) - considered to be high-intensity exercise&#xD;
      as recommended by the Stroke Recovery &amp; Rehabilitation Roundtable. Kinematic and clinical&#xD;
      measures will be made before (PRE), after 3 (POST3), 6 (POST6), and 9 wks (POST9) and after a&#xD;
      4 wk follow-up (FOLL-UP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE: The Minimal Clinical Important Difference (MCID) of the primary outcome measure&#xD;
      (ST) was used to compute the sample size. The MCID of the ST was determined to be 18.07°&#xD;
      using an anchor-based method (change in FMA&gt; MCID 5.25). Considering an α level of 5% and a&#xD;
      95% power (effect size=1.39) to detect differences using a mixed model ANOVA (G*Power&#xD;
      3.1.9.4), the minimal sample size is 21/group. Sample size was increased to 27 per group&#xD;
      considering a drop-out rate of 25% given the need to attend multiple training/evaluation&#xD;
      sessions for a final cohort of 54 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We will relate changes in motor behavior to initial clinical status&#xD;
      (PRE) and to post-treatment changes (POST) at 3 time points (POST1, POST2, POST3), and at&#xD;
      follow-up (FOLL-UP). Statistical approaches are based on intention-to-treat analysis.&#xD;
      Descriptive/distribution analysis will highlight main demographic and clinical&#xD;
      characteristics and control for differences in the baseline prognostic indicators between&#xD;
      groups. For Obj. 1-3, we will use a repeated measures mixed model ANOVA for primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes where the model includes one between-subject factor - group with 2 levels&#xD;
      (EA, no EA) and one within-subject factor - time (5 levels), using normalized change scores&#xD;
      (i.e., POST-PRE/PRE; FOLL-UP-PRE/PRE). We will consider changes in the primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes significant if their 95% confidence intervals (CI) exceed MCIDs for each measure. To&#xD;
      control for %CST injury as a potential confounding factor, we will run a parallel ANCOVA&#xD;
      using %CST as a covariate. This will increase the statistical power and adjust for baseline&#xD;
      group differences estimating an unbiased difference on primary outcomes. This study design&#xD;
      has been used in our previous RCT. For the active arm workspace, significance will be&#xD;
      indicated by a &gt;10% change of PRE-test area, based on an increase of the TSRT of at least&#xD;
      18°. For elbow range of motion, a significant change will be 15% of the Pre-test range. For&#xD;
      secondary outcomes, MCID values will be used when known. For measures for which MCIDs are not&#xD;
      known, we will consider a minimally significant change as &gt;15% of the pre-test value.&#xD;
      Multiple linear regression analysis on pooled data will identify relationships between&#xD;
      subjects with different levels of initial clinical impairment (%CST injury) and primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures. All analyses will consider sex as a confounding factor. While men&#xD;
      have a higher age-adjusted stroke incidence, women experience more severe strokes and have&#xD;
      higher short-term mortality. Better understanding of the influence of sex on therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions can lead to improved stroke management. For all models, residual plots will be&#xD;
      examined to verify linearity, normality and homoscedasticity. Co-linearity will be assessed&#xD;
      based on tolerance, variation of inflation and eigenvalues. Partial correlation and&#xD;
      standardized (beta) coefficients will be examined to demonstrate which explanatory variables&#xD;
      have a greater effect on the dependent variable in the multiple regression models. For each&#xD;
      outcome, variability will be estimated based on 95%CIs. Missing data will be checked for&#xD;
      non-random patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL MANAGEMENT: Daily trial management will be the responsibility of the steering committee&#xD;
      (Levin, Archambault, Piscitelli). Randomization will be done by Levin. Trial coordination and&#xD;
      data handling will be done by Piscitelli. The team has complementary expertise directly&#xD;
      relevant to the proposal and extensive experience conducting stroke research. A former&#xD;
      patient (GG) who has participated in our previous studies will help assess the feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of the technology and the protocol, including clinical and kinematic tests.&#xD;
      Piscitelli will coordinate the trial, help supervise students and take care of daily&#xD;
      management. Prevost (Clinical Research Coordinator) will recruit and assess patients from 3&#xD;
      centers within CRIR. Levin and Wien have expertise in imaging and Feldman in motor control.&#xD;
      Wein is a Stroke Neurologist at the MNI where he has conducted several RCTs. Trivino&#xD;
      (physiotherapist) has participated in several clinical research projects at the JRH using&#xD;
      technology-supported rehabilitation in patients with stroke. Berman (rehabilitation engineer)&#xD;
      designed the robotic/VR intervention and conducted the initial feasibility studies with&#xD;
      Levin. We will disseminate findings to stroke teams at CRIR affiliated hospitals through&#xD;
      in-service presentations and discuss problems of UL measurement and management. Diagnostic&#xD;
      imaging tools and motor control knowledge will be shared with researchers, clinicians and&#xD;
      patients. Feasibility of incorporating the developed technology into clinical settings will&#xD;
      be evaluated with clinicians Trivino and Wein and patient GG.&#xD;
