  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to create a biobank of oral smears permitting to&#xD;
      identify the genetic locus/loci associated with an increased risk to develop meningiomas&#xD;
      after cyproterone acetate (CPA) (Androcur®) treatment, using a GWAS approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the secondary objectives, the study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the importance of the genetic susceptibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to record the frequence of homonodependant cancers occuring in female patients with&#xD;
           Androcur® associated meningioma and in their first-degree relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to describe clinical, radiological, histological characteristics of the patients who&#xD;
           have developed meningioma after cyproterone acetate exposure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increased risk to develop a meningioma has recently been established for patients&#xD;
      received the cyproterone acetate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators observed several familial cases of CPA related meningiomas which suggest a&#xD;
      strong genetic factor modulating the risk to develop meningiomas in patients who exposed to&#xD;
      CPA. The aim of this study is to generate a biobank permitting, in future studies, to&#xD;
      identify the genetic locus/loci associated with an increased risk to develop meningiomas&#xD;
      after CPA (Androcur®) treatment, using a GWAS approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of patients will occur at hospitals where the patients will be treated and also&#xD;
      via social networking sites such as Facebook. There will be 4 groups of subjects. Five&#xD;
      hundred patients will be enrolled in each group targeting 2000 patients in total, among which&#xD;
      1000 patients (Groupe 1 and Groupe 2) will participate in the biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six centers in 5 university hospitals of APHP (Pitié-Salpêtrière, Ambroise Paré, Cochin,&#xD;
      Lariboisière, Saint-Antoine) will be involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      La duration of enrollment will be 24 months. The participation duration for each subject will&#xD;
      be 1 hour. Statistics analysis method: SAS 9.1.3.&#xD;
