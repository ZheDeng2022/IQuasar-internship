  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current pilot study proposal is to compare the use of the purified human&#xD;
      fibrinogen concentrate (FibrygaÂ®, Octapharma USA) to cryoprecipitate for the treatment of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)-associated bleeding in pediatric cardiac patients in whom&#xD;
      fibrinogen supplementation is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' hypothesis is that fibrinogen concentrate will be as effective as&#xD;
      cryoprecipitate in achieving adequate hemostasis after separation from CPB in pediatric&#xD;
      cardiac surgery patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: this will be a single-center, prospective, randomized, active-control study in&#xD;
      pediatric (24 months of age or younger) patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with CPB&#xD;
      (n=30) in-whom fibrinogen supplementation after separation from CPB is indicated, based on&#xD;
      the presence of clinically-significant bleeding and documentation of low fibrinogen level on&#xD;
      viscoelastic point-of-care testing (MCF &lt; 10 mm on the FIBTEM assay of ROTEM). Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from a parent or a legal guardian prior to surgery and anesthesia.&#xD;
      Once the need for fibrinogen supplementation is confirmed, study participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into one of two treatment groups (n=15 in each group):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cryoprecipitate group (dose: 10 ml/kg; active control group) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fibrinogen Concentrate group (dose: 70 mg/kg; intervention group). There will be no&#xD;
           placebo group since withholding treatment is neither consistent with standard of care&#xD;
           nor acceptable ethically. No other aspects of care will be modified. In the event that&#xD;
           an additional dose of fibrinogen supplementation is required (bleeding with documented&#xD;
           hypofibrinogenemia) cryoprecipitate will be administered to all study subjects&#xD;
           (including those who received FC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will be used for publication as well as the first stage towards a&#xD;
      significantly larger randomized multi-center trial (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of this pilot study the investigators plan to conduct a large&#xD;
      multi-center, randomized active-control non-inferiority trial in the future, comparing the&#xD;
      use of FC to cryoprecipitate in a much larger cohort of pediatric patients undergoing cardiac&#xD;
      surgery with CPB. Ultimately, the results of this trial are likely to improve the care of&#xD;
      pediatric cardiac surgical patients experiencing post-CPB bleeding, an under-studied yet&#xD;
      high-risk patient population.&#xD;
