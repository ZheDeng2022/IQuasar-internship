      This is a single arm, phase II, multicenter study trial evaluating Pembrolizumab in recurrent&#xD;
      platinum resistant CPS score &gt;1 positive ovarian, Fallopian tube and primary peritoneal&#xD;
      cancer patients. All the eligible patients will receive Pembrolizumab 200 mg d1 q 21 iv&#xD;
      infusion in 30 minutes, until disease progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      patient's refusal. Pembrolizumab will be administered for a maximum of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess overall survival (OS) of patients treated&#xD;
      with Pembrolizumab single agent.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from&#xD;
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided&#xD;
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned&#xD;
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using&#xD;
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;

             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;

             childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours&#xD;
             prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive&#xD;
             or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of Birth&#xD;
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course&#xD;
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of&#xD;
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not&#xD;
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.&#xD;

         17. Patients should not be breast-feeding during treatment and for 120 days following the&#xD;
             end of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         19. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]&#xD;
             reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA [qualitative] is&#xD;
             detected) infection. Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required&#xD;
             unless mandated by local health authority. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days&#xD;
             of planned start of study therapy.&#xD;
