  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute renal failure is a common complication in patients admitted to intensive care. Due to&#xD;
      the increasing incidence of acute renal failure, the use of Continuous Renal Replacement&#xD;
      Therapy (CRRT) is on the rise in the intensive care unit. The use of CRRT exposes patients to&#xD;
      some complications (bleeding, hemodynamic instability, antibiotic underdosing, malnutrition&#xD;
      and infections), justifying the importance of optimizing the quality and reliability of this&#xD;
      technique. Renal function is classically assessed by diuresis and creatinine. Creatinine&#xD;
      clearance is an indirect measure of glomerular filtration rate. Measuring creatinine&#xD;
      clearance is a simple, accessible and relatively inexpensive method. Traditionally,&#xD;
      clreatinine clearance has required 24-hour urine collection. However, it has been shown that&#xD;
      two-hour urine collection is also an accurate tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is little information and few recommendations as to when to discontinue CRRT. A&#xD;
      predictive index for the withdrawal of CRRT would reduce the duration of treatment, reduce&#xD;
      complications and costs, and speed up patient rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various parameters have been described as tools for deciding when to stop dialysis: diuresis&#xD;
      before stopping CRRT, urine and blood creatinine, daily urinary urea excretion, and sodium&#xD;
      and water balance. Among these factors, urine output and creatinine appear to be promising&#xD;
      predictive factors. The measurement of creatinine clearance combines these two factors and&#xD;
      can therefore be a good tool for predicting the return of adequate renal function.&#xD;
      Retrospective work carried out by Fröhlich et al in 2012 suggested that creatinine clearance&#xD;
      measured over 2 hours could be a good marker for successful withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that creatinine clearance measured over 2 hours after stopping&#xD;
      CRRT is be predictive of the success of the withdrawal from this type of therapy.&#xD;
