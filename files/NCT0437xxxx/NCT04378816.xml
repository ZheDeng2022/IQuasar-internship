      Background: Breast cancer rehabilitation has gradually expanded from post-surgery&#xD;
      rehabilitation to continuous rehabilitation including prehabilitation between cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis and surgical treatment, post-surgery rehabilitation, and return-to-work/return-home&#xD;
      interventions. Continuous rehabilitation provides patients with tailored training at each&#xD;
      treatment period, in order to maintain patients' functions or accelerate the recovery of&#xD;
      functions, reduce the burden of symptoms, and improve patients' independence and quality of&#xD;
      life. As the functional rehabilitation needs and lifestyle adjustment needs of each patient's&#xD;
      life role are different, only with an interprofessional rehabilitation team, patients can&#xD;
      obtain patient-centered and comprehensive rehabilitation interventions. Interprofessional&#xD;
      shared decision making (IP-SDM) is an decision-making process that interprofessional team and&#xD;
      patients discussion the treatment options, based on the best evidence and patient values and&#xD;
      preferences, to make a patient-centered treatment decision. However, the major barriers of&#xD;
      the implementation of IP-SDM are the lack of IP-SDM skills of clinicians and the lack of&#xD;
      medical knowledge of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposes: The project aims (1) to develop a patient-centered continuous and interdisciplinary&#xD;
      shared decision making approach for breast cancer rehabilitation, including IP-SDM training&#xD;
      for interprofessional rehabilitation team, as well as decision coaching, patient decision aid&#xD;
      and question prompt list for patients; and (2) to examine the effects of IP-SDM approach on&#xD;
      the IP-SDM self-efficacy of interprofessional rehabilitation team and patients, quality of&#xD;
      IP-SDM process, patients' satisfaction with decision, concordance between preferences and the&#xD;
      chosen options, patients' upper limb function and health-related quality of life.&#xD;

      Methods: This 3-year prospective project will be divided into four phases: (1) Exploration of&#xD;
      the IP-SDM needs of continuous breast cancer rehabilitation: We will interview breast cancer&#xD;
      patients and consult breast cancer care professionals with different disciplines to&#xD;
      understand the IP-SDM needs of breast cancer rehabilitation in each treatment period. (2)&#xD;
      Development of communication and decision aids: An expert panel will develop a mobile&#xD;
      application prototype of communication and decision aids. The prototype will be testes for&#xD;
      the understandability and applicability by breast cancer patients. (3) Development of&#xD;
      decision coaching and IP-SDM training programs: We will consult experts to develop a decision&#xD;
      coaching training program for breast cancer patients and an IP-SDM training program for&#xD;
      interprofessional rehabilitation team. (4) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      patient-centered continuous and interdisciplinary shared decision making approach for breast&#xD;
      cancer rehabilitation: We will conduct a parallel-group, single-blinded randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial and recruit 116 breast cancer patients at Taipei Medical University Hospital to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of the IP-SDM approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results and impacts: We expect that the patient-centered continuous and&#xD;
      interdisciplinary shared decision making approach for breast cancer rehabilitation will&#xD;
      effectively improve patients' IP-SDM self-efficacy, quality of IP-SDM process, patients'&#xD;
      satisfaction with decision, concordance between preferences and the chosen options, patients'&#xD;
      upper limb function and health-related quality of life. In the future, this IP-SDM approach&#xD;
      will be promising to be applied to other medical institutions and other cancer populations,&#xD;
      so as to enhance patient-centered, interprofessional and continuous practice in cancer care.&#xD;
