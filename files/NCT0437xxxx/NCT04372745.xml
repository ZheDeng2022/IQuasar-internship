  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a performance evaluation study to assess the performance of a home pregnancy&#xD;
      test (HPT) in the hands of lay users by comparing their results, when used according to the&#xD;
      Instructions for Use (IFU), to (a) the lay user confirmed pregnancy status, as determined by&#xD;
      a CE marked product, and (b) to trained technicians testing the same urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also assess the lay user's ability to correctly read results from randomised&#xD;
      standards, in addition to leaflet comprehension and product ease of use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study, designed to assess the performance of a home pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to recruit at total 120 volunteers, being approximately equal numbers of&#xD;
      'pregnant' and not-pregnant' women. Volunteers will be recruited either via direct invitation&#xD;
      or advertisement and will attend the study site for one visit lasting 30-40 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained from all volunteers prior to starting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All volunteers will be issues a unique study number on admission to the study. All data and&#xD;
      samples collected will be anonymised throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be provided with one investigational home pregnancy test and instructions for&#xD;
      use. They will be asked to conduct the test, following the product instructions to obtain a&#xD;
      test result which will be recorded on the result sheet. Volunteers will be instructed the&#xD;
      product is investigational and the results should not be relied upon to determine their&#xD;
      pregnancy status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study volunteers will then be interviewed by the study technician, with regards to their&#xD;
      understanding of the product instructions and complete an ease of use questionnaire. The&#xD;
      comprehension interview may be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study technician will then perform 2 further investigational home pregnancy tests on&#xD;
      randomised urine standards and the volunteer will read the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the study technician will test the volunteer's urine sample with a marketed&#xD;
      pregnancy test and record these results on the results sheet. The results of this test will&#xD;
      be used to provide the volunteer with her pregnancy status at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples provided by the volunteers will be tested with the investigational HPT by an&#xD;
      independent technician and also measured for hCG by quantitative immunoassay. Samples may&#xD;
      also be measured for other hormones related to pregnancy and fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With participant permission, the samples may be retained frozen within the SPD BioBank and&#xD;
      used for future product evaluation or research purposes.&#xD;
