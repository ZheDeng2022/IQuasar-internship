  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-arm phase II platform-basket screening study designed to test multiple&#xD;
      experimental therapies simultaneously in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) with&#xD;
      associated progressive tumors of vestibular schwannomas (VS), non-vestibular schwannomas&#xD;
      (non-VS), meningiomas, and ependymomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Master Study is being conducted as a &quot;basket&quot; study that may allow people with multiple&#xD;
      tumor types associated with NF2 to receive new drugs throughout this study. Embedded within&#xD;
      the Master Study are individual drug substudies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Investigational Drug Sub-study A: Brigatinib&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of investigational drugs to learn whether the drug(s) works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Master study is intended to enroll participants who will be placed into different&#xD;
      treatment arms (sub-studies) which will each have an additional consent and enrollment&#xD;
      processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -- The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, randomization to an&#xD;
      experimental treatment sub-study, if qualified, and observation for up to 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have tumors grow during a treatment sub-study will be permitted to&#xD;
           enroll in a different experimental treatment sub-study if they are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who are not eligible for enrollment in a different treatment sub-study will&#xD;
           be permitted to remain under observation on the Master Study to understand the growth&#xD;
           pattern of these tumors (natural history)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will be eligible to remain on this Master study for up to 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  It is expected that about 80 people will take part in the Master Study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The study will randomize a maximum of 40 patients to each of the experimental arms.&#xD;
                The overall size of the trial is not fixed by design because it include&#xD;
                arm-dropping rules for futility and allow for the possibility of arm addition by&#xD;
                amendment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Sub-study A will test the activity of brigatinib for treatment of NF2-related tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brigatinib is approved for the treatment of people with anaplastic lymphoma kinase&#xD;
           (ALK)- positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed or are&#xD;
           intolerant to crizotinib. In preclinical models, brigatinib has shown evidence of&#xD;
           activity against models of NF2-deficient tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - It is expected that 40 people will take part in the Brigatinib Sub-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The sub-study with brigatinib will include two stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Stage 1, 20 subjects with any allowable tumor type will be accrued to each arm. A&#xD;
           minimum of 2 subjects per tumor type (vestibular schwannoma, non-vestibular schwannoma,&#xD;
           meningioma, and ependymoma) must be accrued in Stage 1. Interim analysis will be&#xD;
           performed after Stage 1 to determine the radiographic response rate (RR) for each tumor&#xD;
           types. Subsequently, in stage 2, another 20 subjects will be accrued into the 2 baskets&#xD;
           with the most promising early results. If the results are equally promising for more&#xD;
           than 2 baskets, subjects will be allocated to the appropriate number of baskets.&#xD;

             influence risk of next drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received radiation to the target tumor within the last 3 years&#xD;
             prior to Master study registration.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of a different malignancy, unless (a) have been disease-free for at least 2&#xD;
             years and are deemed by the treating investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the experimental agents may have&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with these experimental agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligibility Criteria Specific to the Brigatinib Arm (substudy A):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must meet all eligibility criteria outlined in the Master Study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for&#xD;
             the brigatinib arm of the INTUITT-NF2 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is ≥ 12 years of age and has body weight at least 40 kg on Day 1 of&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be able to swallow pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical laboratory values as specified below within 28 days before the first dose of&#xD;
             study drug, as described in the protocol document:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients participating in this study should avoid becoming pregnant, and male&#xD;
             patients should avoid impregnating a female partner. Non-sterilized female patients of&#xD;
             reproductive age group and male patients should use effective methods of contraception&#xD;
             through defined periods during and after study treatment as specified below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female patients must meet 1 of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, or&#xD;
&#xD;

             contraception from the time of signing of the informed consent form through 4 months&#xD;
             after the last dose of study drug, or agree to completely abstain from heterosexual&#xD;
             intercourse. Brigatinib may decrease effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives,&#xD;
             therefore, women are recommended to use non-hormonal methods of contraception. Highly&#xD;
             effective non-hormonal birth control for women of child bearing potential with male&#xD;
             partners includes:&#xD;

&#xD;
        Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post-vasectomy) must agree to 1&#xD;
        of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and&#xD;
        through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or completely abstain from heterosexual&#xD;
        intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are both lactating and breastfeeding or have a positive serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test during the screening period or a positive urine pregnancy test on Day 1&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion,&#xD;
             potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any investigational products within 1 month or 5 half-lives (whichever&#xD;
             is longer) before the first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had major surgery within 30 days of the first dose of brigatinib. Minor surgical&#xD;
             procedures such as catheter placement or minimally invasive biopsies are allowed.&#xD;

             protocol):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have uncontrolled hypertension (defined as an average systolic blood pressure &gt;160 or&#xD;
             an average diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 for adults; for children: please refer to&#xD;
             table in protocol&#xD;
