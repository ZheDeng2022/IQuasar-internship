  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CB-5339 in treating patients&#xD;
      with solid tumors that has spread to other places in the body (advanced) or lymphomas.&#xD;
      CB-5339 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the safety, tolerability, and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of p97&#xD;
      inhibitor CB-5339 tosylate (CB-5339) administered orally on a schedule of once daily, 4 days&#xD;
      on and 3 days off, in patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of CB-5339. II. To assess the preliminary&#xD;
      antitumor activity of CB-5339 in patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the effects of CB-5339 on the ubiquitin proteasome system and on markers of&#xD;
      cell death in pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cell&#xD;
      (PBMC)s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate potential associations between CB-5339 activity and genomic alterations&#xD;
      assessed in circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive p97 inhibitor CB-5339 tosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) 4 days on and 3&#xD;
      days off. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

             there is no available standard therapy or therapy known to prolong survival; or&#xD;
             aggressive lymphoma who have refused or have no remaining curative options (e.g., stem&#xD;
             cell transplant). Patients with indolent lymphomas must have undergone 3 or more prior&#xD;
             regimens of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior therapy must have been completed &gt;= 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and&#xD;
             mitomycin C) or, if known, &gt;= 5 half-lives of the prior agent (whichever is shorter)&#xD;
             prior to enrollment on protocol (minimum of 1 week between prior therapy and study&#xD;
             enrollment), and the participant must have recovered to eligibility levels from prior&#xD;
             toxicity. Prior definitive radiation should have been completed &gt;= 4 weeks or&#xD;
             palliative radiation should have been completed &gt;= 2 weeks prior to study enrollment&#xD;
             and all associated toxicities resolved to eligibility levels (patients on study may be&#xD;
             eligible for palliative radiotherapy to non-targeted lesions after 2 cycles of therapy&#xD;
             at the principal investigator [PI]'s discretion). Patients must be &gt;= 2 weeks since&#xD;
             any investigational agent administered as part of a phase 0 study (where a&#xD;
             sub-therapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the PI's discretion and should have&#xD;
             recovered to grade 1 or baseline from any toxicities&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior monoclonal antibody therapy must have completed that&#xD;
             therapy &gt;= 6 weeks (or 3 half-lives of the antibody, whichever is shorter) prior to&#xD;
             enrollment on protocol (minimum of 1 week between prior therapy and study enrollment)&#xD;

             =&lt; 3 x institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN OR 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with&#xD;
             creatinine levels above 1.5 x institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of CB-5339 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and&#xD;
             because p97 inhibitors agents may be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and&#xD;
             men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth&#xD;
             control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation&#xD;
             and for 4 months afterwards. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 4 months after completion of CB-5339 administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects on the expansion cohort must also be willing to undergo two core biopsy&#xD;
             procedures if there is a lesion amenable to biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;= the lower limit of normal by echocardiogram&#xD;
             (ECHO) at entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) &lt; 470 ms using Fridericia's correction&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant illnesses which would compromise participation in&#xD;
             the study, including but not limited to active or uncontrolled infection, immune&#xD;
             deficiencies, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, active tuberculosis, uncontrolled asthma,&#xD;
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, cerebral vascular&#xD;
             accident/stroke within the past 6 months, or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral&#xD;
                  therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV&#xD;
                  viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial, with the exception of patients whose brain metastatic disease&#xD;
             status has remained stable for &gt;= 4 weeks after treatment of the brain metastases.&#xD;
             Patients on anti-seizure medications may be enrolled at the discretion of the&#xD;
             principal investigator providing that these patients are taking non-enzyme- inducing&#xD;
             anti-seizure medications or can be converted to these&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because CB-5339 may have the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with this&#xD;
             agent, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with CB-5339&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or previous history of sight-threatening retinal disease, including (but not&#xD;
             limited to) proliferative diabetic retinopathy, severe retinal vascular disease, and&#xD;
             advanced age-related macular degeneration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of QT-prolongation or of Torsades de pointes (TdP), or of&#xD;
             taking QT-prolonging drugs, are not eligible&#xD;
