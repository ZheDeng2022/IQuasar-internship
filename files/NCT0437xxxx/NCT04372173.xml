  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was to analyze both the concentration and the activity of the&#xD;
      clotting factors, D-dimer levels, as well as fibrinogen concentration in patients who&#xD;
      underwent primary total hip arthroplasty due to idiopathic arthrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood loss is often related to perioperative period and may result in decrease of&#xD;
      concentration of coagulation factors, which in turn may lead to increased bleeding. We&#xD;
      analyzed data of thirty patients scheduled for primary hip arthroplasty: the activity of&#xD;
      clotting factors II, VIII, X, as well as fibrinogen concentration in the following time&#xD;
      points: (i) before surgery, (ii) six hours after the procedure, and (iii) two, (iv) four, and&#xD;
      (v) six days after the operation. All laboratory tests were performed using automatic&#xD;
      analyzer. At the same time intervals, an immunoenzymatic assay was used to determine D-dimer&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;

    <description>Blood samples were taken before surgery, 6 hours, two, four, and six days after the procedure. Venous blood samples were taken from peripheral veins.&#xD;
All analyzed parameters (fibrinogen, factor II, factor VIII, factor X, D-dimer) were determined using an ACL TOP 500 CTS automated coagulation analyzer.&#xD;
All patients were operated on by a single surgical team, with cementless hip replacements implanted, and without tranexamic acid administered in the perioperative period. All patients underwent venous thromboembolic complications prophylaxis.&#xD;
The following data were collected: age, body mass index, gender, perioperative risk assessment scale according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists score, blood transfusions, hemoglobin levels before surgery and two days post-surgery, instances of thromboembolic complications. Because of the observational nature of this study no changes in the treatment of patients were made.</description>
