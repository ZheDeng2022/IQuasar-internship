  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the efficacy of a novel drug-checking intervention to prevent fatal and&#xD;
      non-fatal overdose among people who use drugs (PWUD), who are 18-65 years old at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment. The investigators will evaluate whether the incorporation of rapid fentanyl&#xD;
      testing into a theory-driven overdose education and prevention intervention reduces rates of&#xD;
      overdose compared to standard overdose education and naloxone distribution. Results from this&#xD;
      study will significantly improve public health efforts to address the fentanyl overdose&#xD;
      epidemic and reduce harms associated with exposure to drugs contaminated with fentanyl. This&#xD;
      is a full clinical trial, building on the previously approved fentanyl-test-strip pilot study&#xD;
      (2016-2017), the results of which have recently been published.(Krieger et al., 2018)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess the efficacy of the RAPIDS intervention on preventing overdose&#xD;
      among PWUD. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive the RAPIDS intervention or the&#xD;
      attention-matched control condition. Experimental arm participants will receive the RAPIDS&#xD;
      intervention, which includes education about the dangers of illicitly manufactured fentanyl&#xD;
      (IMF), motivational interviewing to increase willingness to use fentanyl test strips and&#xD;
      engage in overdose risk reduction behaviors, hands-on training to use the test strips, and&#xD;
      opportunities to plan and role- play how to implement overdose risk reduction behaviors upon&#xD;
      receipt of a positive or negative test result. In the attention-matched control arm,&#xD;
      participants will receive standardized overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND)&#xD;
      training. All participants will attend additional study visits at months 1,2,3,6, and 12. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint will be the rate of self-reported overdose over the follow-up period.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints (e.g., overdose death) will be ascertained by data linkage to statewide&#xD;
      overdose surveillance databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of this study are to: 1) Assess the efficacy of the RAPIDS intervention in&#xD;
      reducing rates of overdose among people who use drugs; 2) Examine the degree to which&#xD;
      reductions in rates of overdose are mediated by increases in information, motivation,&#xD;
      behavioral skills, and self-efficacy regarding fentanyl, rapid fentanyl testing, and harm&#xD;
      reduction practices; and 3) Explore whether there is heterogeneity of treatment effect&#xD;
      related to key participant characteristics.&#xD;
