  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      eRapa (encapsulated rapamycin) will be investigated for secondary prevention in patients with&#xD;
      diagnosed non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) through a phase II double-blind&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of long-term (one year) prevention with eRapa versus placebo. The&#xD;
      primary hypothesis is that eRapa decreases the risk of cancer relapse for patients with&#xD;
      NMIBC. Secondary hypotheses are that eRapa can improve certain immune parameters and improve&#xD;
      cognition and physical function without adversely affecting patient-reported outcomes and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-site phase II double-blind randomized trial. Subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      into placebo arm or intervention arm with low dose (0.5 mg) eRapa (encapsulated rapamycin)&#xD;
      Monday-Friday for one year or until disease recurrence. Patients will undergo endoscopic&#xD;
      evaluation of the bladder every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 2 years, and at&#xD;
      year 5. Some patients may also concurrently receive BCG immune therapy maintenance (weekly&#xD;
      for 6 weeks for induction period, weekly for 3 weeks at 3 months, 6 months, and then every 6&#xD;
      months for a total of 7 maintenance cycles following tumor removal) per standard of care.&#xD;
      Patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessments, cognitive assessments, and physical assessments&#xD;
      will be completed according to the study calendar. Research blood to assess safety, immune&#xD;
      response and rapamycin level will be collected regularly throughout the study period.&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for up to 5 years following enrollment.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Once the list is generated, a non-study staff member will deliver the list to the designated pharmacist. The pharmacist will follow the generated list in consecutive order of enrollment to determine which group the subject will be assigned. The pharmacist will prepare the correct study drug (Placebo or eRapa (encapsulated rapamycin) 0.5 mg) and label the drug with subject information. Research staff will transport drug from pharmacy to clinic and provide for subject. Randomization will remain double blinded for study staff and subject. Patients will be given a once-daily oral eRapa (encapsulated rapamycin) at 0.5 mg or placebo MF for 1 year. Once the primary objectives have been met (i.e., all participants have completed follow up), the study staff and PI will be unblinded to the randomized study treatment arms. The above mentioned generated randomization list with subject assignments will be provided to the study staff and PI by the designated pharmacist.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine 1-year Recurrence Free Survival (RFS) rate</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary analysis will be the estimation of the RFS rate with the 95% confidence interval and comparison of the rate to the historical rate of 68% using the single arm log-rank test (one-sided alpha = 0.05). If the observed rate of RFS is 80% the expected number of events is about 20-28. Recurrence confirmed by pathologic examination of biopsied tissue.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Urinary Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Scored at baseline and months 3, 6, 12 and 24. For any subject who has a recurrence after enrollment, but prior to completing a full year of dosing at Visit 6, this will also be measured at the End of Treatment visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary Quality of Life measured using the urinary domain of the QLQ-BLS24 Index (a 24-item questionnaire that measures quality of life as it relates to urinary symptoms, sexual function, and bother domains). QLQ-BLS24 with a scale ranging from 24-96, and higher scores are worse.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cognitive Function</measure>
    <time_frame>EXIT will be scored at baseline and on months 12 and 24.For any subject who has a recurrence after enrollment, but prior to completing a full year of dosing at Visit 6, this will also be measured at the End of Treatment visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive function will be measured throughout the study period using EXIT. The EXIT is a brief 25-item interview that will be used by trained research staff to evaluate executive cognitive dysfunction of subjects.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cognitive Function</measure>
    <time_frame>SLUMS will be scored at baseline and on months 12 and 24.For any subject who has a recurrence after enrollment, but prior to completing a full year of dosing at Visit 6, this will also be measured at the End of Treatment visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive function will be measured throughout the study period using St. Louis University Mental Status exam (SLUMS). The SLUMS exam will be used to evaluate memory, digit span and animal fluency.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cognitive Function</measure>
    <time_frame>TAPS will be scored at baseline and on months 6, 12, and 24. For any subject who has a recurrence after enrollment, but prior to completing a full year of dosing at Visit 6, this will also be measured at the End of Treatment visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive function will be measured throughout the study period using Texas Assessment of Processing Speed (TAPS). The TAPS test will evaluate digit/symbol coding.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cytoscopy consistent with recurrence (time to recurrence)</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will undergo office-based cystoscopy with urine cytology every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for 2 years, and at year 5, with biopsies per standard of care if necessary.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in cytoscopy results from baseline consistent with recurrence, confirmed by pathologic examination of biopsied tissue.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Short Physical Performance Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>SPPB will be scored at baseline and on months 6, 12, and 24. For any subject who has a recurrence after enrollment, but prior to completing a full year of dosing at Visit 6, this will also be measured at the End of Treatment visit.</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) consists of a balance test looking at the ability to maintain three standing positions for 10 seconds, a timed 4-meter walk in which subjects perform their walk at their preferred walking speed, and a chair stand test that times the ability of the subject to arise from a chair 5 times without using their arms. Each section is scored out of 4 points, for a total possible score of 12 points. This test provides information on several motor domains such as static and dynamic balance, coordination, and strength of lower limbs. Lower scores may be associated with increased disability risk. The SPPB and Handgrip Strength are physical assessments.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Handgrip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Handgrip Strength will be scored at baseline and on months 6, 12, and 24. For any subject who has a recurrence after enrollment, but prior to completing a full year of dosing at Visit 6, this will also be measured at the End of Treatment visit.</time_frame>
    <description>When measuring handgrip strength, the subject will be seated in a chair with the forearm at a 90-degree elbow bend. Three consecutive grip strengths will be completed with a standard grip strength dynamometer for both hands. The Handgrip Strength and SPPB are physical assessments.</description>

&#xD;
          -  18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be taking oral glucocorticoids at the time of registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not have active, uncontrolled infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No other prior non-bladder malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately&#xD;
             treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately&#xD;
             treated Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete&#xD;
             remission, or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for five&#xD;
             years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with localized prostate cancer who are being followed by an active&#xD;
             survelillance program are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing, as the use of Intravesical BCG is not&#xD;
             recommended during pregnancy. Women/ men of reproductive potential must have agreed to&#xD;
             use an effective contraceptive method. A woman is considered to be of &quot;reproductive&#xD;
             potential&quot; if she has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months.&#xD;
             Examples of effective contraception include hormonal contraception, double barrier&#xD;
             method (condom with spermicidal cream, diaphragms with spermicidal cream, or condoms&#xD;
             with diaphragms), Intrauterine device, and/or partner vasectomy. In addition to&#xD;
             routine contraceptive methods, &quot;effective contraception&quot; also includes heterosexual&#xD;
             celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy&#xD;
             prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation. However, if at any point a previously celibate patient chooses to become&#xD;
             heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures&#xD;
             outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures.&#xD;
             Both male and female patients will be required to disclose contraception method during&#xD;
             screening and agree to continue to use that contraception method through the end of&#xD;
             their participation in the study.&#xD;
