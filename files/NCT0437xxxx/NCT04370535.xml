      This pilot study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PMA-zeolite when used in&#xD;
      patients with uncontrolled CD (Crohn´s disease). The effect of the PMA-zeolite will be&#xD;
      compared between a control-group (healthy volunteers) receiving either PMA-zeolite or placebo&#xD;
      and the test-group (suffering from uncontrolled CD) and receiving either PMA-zeolite or&#xD;
      placebo. In addition, this pilot-study should furthermore provide indications for the&#xD;
      effect-size in order to estimate an effect for an eventual further human trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background of the study Crohn´s disease (CD) is a chronic progressive destructive disease.&#xD;
      Approximately one-fifth of adult and paediatric patients already have evidence of a&#xD;
      structuring or penetrating intestinal complications at diagnosis. Despite decades of&#xD;
      research, the aetiology of CD remains unknown. Disease treatments include a variety of&#xD;
      approaches like dietary changes and immunosuppressive anti-TNFa antibodies as well as&#xD;
      ancillary antibiotic therapy. Another interesting and promising approach in this context&#xD;
      might be the supplementation of the certified medical device PMA-(Panaceo micro&#xD;
      activation)-zeolite (a specific natural zeolite-clinoptilolite) due to its properties&#xD;
      documented through many studies. In particular, the promising clinical results from a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) with PMA-zeolite need to be highlighted. The strengthening/&#xD;
      supporting of the intestinal wall integrity in healthy subjects suffering from intestinal&#xD;
      problems was measured in this RCT and is claimed as intended main action of the PMA-zeolite.&#xD;
      Based on these results the application of PMA-zeolite is an interesting and promising&#xD;
      approach in patients with uncontrolled CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis In the present trial, it is being tested if supplementing PMA-zeolite can lead to&#xD;
      an improvement of the defined markers and parameters (reduction of local and systemic&#xD;
      inflammation, changes of the microbiota in the gut, positive detoxifying effect and general&#xD;
      improvement of quality of life) in patients with uncontrolled CD compared to a healthy&#xD;
      test-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims This pilot study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PMA-zeolite when used in&#xD;
      patients with uncontrolled CD. The effect of the PMA-zeolite will be compared between a&#xD;
      control-group (healthy volunteers) receiving either PMA-zeolite or placebo and the test-group&#xD;
      (suffering from uncontrolled CD) and receiving either PMA-zeolite or placebo. In addition,&#xD;
      this pilot-study should furthermore provide indications for the effect-size in order to&#xD;
      estimate an effect for an eventual further human trial.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The pilot-study is a randomized, placebo-controlled and double blinded study. The 4 subject-groups are consisting of group A and B with healthy subjects (A and B are divided into a placebo-group and into a PMA-zeolite- group) and group C and D which are subjects suffering from CD (C and D are divided into a placebo-group and into a PMA-zeolite- group). No washout phase is planned, but if food-supplements are taken this will be protocolled. The diagnostics will be performed through the defined parameters at defined time-points.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy volunteers (at least 18 years old) for first two groups (A,B), homogenous&#xD;
             starting group in age (30-60Y) and sex (m/f )&#xD;
&#xD;
             o The health-status will be confirmed through anamnesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Groups C and D will include patients with confirmed Crohn's disease that are treated&#xD;
             with standard therapy and despite of treatment do not achieve the appropriate disease&#xD;
             remission. Patients with the intermediate type of disease will be also included in&#xD;
             groups C and D.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  of quality BDQ questionnaire will be used. For the assessment of disease activity&#xD;
                  ordinary laboratory measurements will be performed (CBC, basic biochemical&#xD;
                  parameters, CRP), and calprotectin from chairs. Colonoscopy must be done in the&#xD;
                  last six months prior to inclusion of patients in the research protocol.&#xD;
                  Gastrointestinal system degree of impairment will not have influence on inclusion&#xD;
                  criteria and patients with histological intermediate type of disease will be&#xD;
                  included as well.&#xD;
