  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unhealthy eating habits inside and outside the home lead to developing obesity, leading to&#xD;
      clinical and metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and chronic&#xD;
      degenerative diseases, which are the leading causes of death in adult life. The present study&#xD;
      compared changes in dietary habits, behaviors and metabolic profiles of obese children whose&#xD;
      mothers attended group sessions, with those who received the usual nutritional consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The mother's training in healthy eating methods, eliminating foods and nutrients that&#xD;
           represent metabolic and cardiovascular risk, will change the consumption of these foods&#xD;
           in the family, reducing them by 20% and increasing the consumption of food in the same&#xD;
           proportion. beneficial, compared to the family of the child who only receives individual&#xD;
           consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Children with obesity who modify or eliminate metabolic and cardiovascular risk foods&#xD;
           and nutrients from their normal diet will have a weight loss of -1.5 BMI compared to&#xD;
           children who only receive the usual consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized clinical trial, 177 mother/obese child pairs participated, 90 in the intervention&#xD;
      group (IG) and 87 in the control group (CG). The intervention group attended six group&#xD;
      education sessions to promote healthy eating and 87 received the usual nutritional&#xD;
      consultation, over a three-month period. Frequency of food consumption, behaviors during&#xD;
      feeding in the house and metabolic profile was evaluated. Data was compared using Student's t&#xD;
      or X2.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is evaluate the change in eating behaviors, metabolic condition, and&#xD;
      nutritional status measured by anthropometry, in children with obesity who were prescribed a&#xD;
      diet to reduce their body weight in the usual nutritional consultation, in comparison to&#xD;
      children whose mothers participated in an intervention of six group sessions to acquire&#xD;
      healthy dietary habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Design. The Obesity Clinic at Federico Gómez Children's Hospital of Mexico conducted&#xD;
      a randomized clinical trial between January 2011 and December 2014 with approval from the&#xD;
      hospital's Research, Ethics and Biosecurity Committee. After providing written consent, 177&#xD;
      children with obesity (BMI ≥ 95 pc) of age 5-11 years and their mothers were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to participate in the intervention group (IG) or the control group (CG). None of the&#xD;
      participating children were receiving pharmacological treatment for obesity, were morbidly&#xD;
      obese or were associated with a genetic syndrome. Intervention group mothers (n = 90)&#xD;
      attended six weekly group sessions, which were led by nutritionists and lasted 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key message was that healthy dietary habits and health risks are acquired at home and&#xD;
      that opportunities for change can be identified in the processes that surround meal times. It&#xD;
      begins with selecting and purchasing food, followed by preparation and consumption behaviors.&#xD;
      Mothers were encouraged to participate in the sessions which involved the use of food models,&#xD;
      videos, slides, and, in some cases, real food. Upon completing each session, mothers were&#xD;
      given printed material to add to a home consultation manual. Children in this group were not&#xD;
      prescribed diets to reduce their body weight. Control group mothers and children (n = 87)&#xD;
      were given the usual nutritional consultation and were prescribed diets that covered their&#xD;
      energy requirements according to their age and sex. Similarly, CG mother/child pairs received&#xD;
      information regarding food groups and portion sizes, were trained in the use of the food&#xD;
      equivalence system to encourage variation, and were instructed on how to prepare the diet at&#xD;
      home. Neither group of children received physical activity programs. Upon concluding&#xD;
      consultations and group sessions, mother/child pairs from both groups were asked to return&#xD;
      for monthly follow-ups over the next three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assignment to intervention or control groups was made using a block randomization with 8&#xD;
      mother/child pairs in each block to assure equal allocation to groups. One of coworkers not&#xD;
      involved in data collection produced a computer-generated randomization list using the Stata&#xD;
      11.0 program. Children were randomized at the end of the baseline examination. Taking&#xD;
      experiences from the published studies the sample size calculation was based on to expect&#xD;
      differences of at less 20% in eating habits between the mothers/children dyad of the&#xD;
      intervention or control groups, to detect differences with significant level of 5% and 80%&#xD;
      power; the size of sample required was 72 mother/children pairs per group and to allow for&#xD;
      20% drop-out during the follow-up, the investigators aimed at recruiting 86 mother/children&#xD;
      dyad per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements at the beginning and end of the study. Anthropometry. The weight, height and&#xD;
      waist circumference of children in both groups were measured according to international&#xD;
      procedures. Weight was measured on a mechanical scale (Seca model-700, SECA Corp., Hamburg,&#xD;
      Germany) with 50 g precision. Height was measured on a stadiometer (SECA model-225, SECA&#xD;
      Corp., Hamburg, Germany) 0.1 cm precision. Meanwhile, waist circumference was measured at the&#xD;
      end of an exhalation with non-elastic flexible tape (Seca model-200, SECA Corp., Hamburg,&#xD;
      Germany) in a standing position at the midpoint between the lower costal border and the iliac&#xD;
      crest. Body Mass Index (BMI) and percentile value were calculated using CDC data for&#xD;
      reference, children with a BMI ≥ 95 pc were categorized with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure. Blood pressure was measured on children's right arm with a mercury&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer (ALPK2, Tokyo, Japan) using a cuff that suited arm length and perimeter and&#xD;
      following 2004 National High Blood Pressure Education Program guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires. A questionnaire of socio demographic data was applied to the mothers at&#xD;
      baseline. In addition, a survey of family feeding habits at home at baseline and three months&#xD;
      was applied, the mother was asked about the child's breakfast habit and bring lunch to&#xD;
      consume at school, family feeding habits at the time of sitting at the table (place the salt&#xD;
      shaker, sugar and sweetened soft drinks on the table, fill the plate, repeat saucer, force&#xD;
      the child to finish the meal, accept the exchange of food to what the child wants), frequency&#xD;
      of consumption of food (fried, roasted, fruits and vegetables) and drinks (simple water,&#xD;
      sugary drinks prepared at home, natural juice, industrialized juice and soft drinks). The&#xD;
      amounts of food consumption were not evaluated. A survey of physical activity and sedentary&#xD;
      activities was applied; no physical activity intervention was performed during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample. 5 mL venous blood samples after 12 h fasting periods were drawn to determine&#xD;
      glucose (mg/dL)(hexokinase method Dimension RxL Max, Siemens Euro, DPC, Llanberis, UK),&#xD;
      insulin (mIU/mL) (chemiluminescence IMMULITE 1000, Siemens), HDL cholesterol (mg/dl)&#xD;
      (enzymatic reaction/catalase, using ADVIA ® 1800 equipment), and triglycerides (mg/dl) (ILAB&#xD;
      300, Instrumentation Laboratory, Barcelona Spain). Participating children's HOMA-IR index was&#xD;
      obtained through glucose and insulin data (If xGf/22.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. Central tendency measures were used to describe the study population's&#xD;
      baseline characteristics. Student's t-test for independent samples was used to compare&#xD;
      continuous variables, such as socio-demographic data, dietary habits, feeding behaviors, and&#xD;
      biochemical and anthropometric data. Pearson X2 test was used to compare proportions between&#xD;
      groups. Continuous data without normal distribution was managed using logarithmic&#xD;
      transformation or square root. Student's t-test for related samples was used to identify&#xD;
      differences before and after the intervention in each group or its non-parametric Wilcoxon&#xD;
      equivalent. The equal proportions test was used to assess the difference in proportions in&#xD;
      dietary habits and behaviors between groups. Statistical significance was considered at P &lt;&#xD;
      0.05. Analyses were carried out with STATA SE v.12.0 (Stata Corp, CollegeStation, TX, USA).&#xD;
