      Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)&#xD;
      has infected over 100 million people causing over 2.4 million deaths over the world, and it&#xD;
      is still expanding. There is an urgent need for targeted and effective COVID-19 treatments&#xD;
      which has put great pressure on researchers across the world for developing effective drugs.&#xD;
      This paper reviews the possibility of using Recombinant Bacterial ACE2 Receptors -Like Enzyme&#xD;
      of B38-CAP to treat SARS-CoV-2 based on the intracellular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      transmission and consequences caused. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a key role&#xD;
      in cardiovascular physiology and pathology, and it's being currently being investigated as a&#xD;
      potential covid-19 and acute lung failure treatment through several clinical trials.. The&#xD;
      SARS-CoV2 binding site was identified as ACE2, a part of the RAAS, which is known to protect&#xD;
      the lung from injuries. it has been postulated that SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 may attenuate&#xD;
      residual ACE2 activity, skewing the ACE/ACE2 balance to a state of heightened angiotensin II&#xD;
      activity leading to inflammatory and oxidative organ damage, as well as pulmonary&#xD;
      vasoconstriction, which can lead to acute lung injury.. Therefore, treatment with recombinant&#xD;
      soluble ACE2 protein and drugs that up regulate ACE2 may alleviate pulmonary complication. In&#xD;
      animal models including heart failure, acute lung injury, and diabetic nephropathy,&#xD;
      recombinant human ACE2 protein (rhACE2), which is devoid of its membrane-anchored domain thus&#xD;
      soluble, has been shown to have beneficial effects. Despite its positive effects, rhACE2 is a&#xD;
      glycosylated protein, which necessitates a time- and cost-intensive protein expression system&#xD;
      using mammalian or insect cells, which may be inconvenient in drug production and medical&#xD;
      economics. Moreover, we hypothesis that treating COVID-19 patients with recombinant soluble&#xD;
      ACE2 protein may induce autoantibodies and T cells to cellular ACE2.Furthermore, rhACE2 may&#xD;
      interact with spike protein based vaccine and worsen its effect . These autoantibodies may&#xD;
      generated by enforced presentation of the soluble Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)&#xD;
      protein in a complex with COVID-19 Spike protein in fragment crystallizable (FC) Receptor&#xD;
      positive Antigen Presenting Cells in the blood The development of autoantibodies might make&#xD;
      injury and damage to the host epithelial cells and hamper their ACE2 dependent function in&#xD;
      lungs, intestine and testes which express ACE2. In addition to inducing platelet aggregation&#xD;
      and thrombosis . Although it has been stated that immune response associated with the chronic&#xD;
      infusion of rhACE2 resulting in the degradation of rhACE226, this was not the case with&#xD;
      B38-CAP; no antibodies against B38-CAP were detected in the serum of mice infused with&#xD;
      B38-CAP for two weeks... In this case we suggest that bacterial engineering could be used to&#xD;
      develop better protein drugs for COVID-19 treatment... B38-CAP is an ACE2-like enzyme derived&#xD;
      from bacteria that reduces hypertension and cardiac dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting&#xD;
      enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a key role in cardiovascular physiology and pathology, and it is&#xD;
      currently being studied in clinical trials to treat acute lung failure. In mice, B38-CAP&#xD;
      treatment prevented angiotensin II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis.&#xD;
      B38-CAP is an ACE2-like enzyme derived from bacteria, demonstrating that evolution has shaped&#xD;
      a bacterial carboxypeptidase (B38-CAP) to a human ACE2-like enzyme. As a result, we think&#xD;
      that treating COVID-19-infected patients with Bacterial ACE2 like enzymes, rather than human&#xD;
      ACE2, may be preferable because it will perform the same role as human ACE2 and may not be&#xD;
      recognized by COVID-19 spike protein&#xD;

      Recombinant Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme of B38-CAP could be promising treatment for&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection- and Its inflammatory complications better than recombinant human ACE2&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a small pilot study investigating whether there is any efficacy signal that warrants&#xD;
      a larger Phase 2B trial, or any harm that suggests that such a trial should not be done. It&#xD;
      is not expected to produce statistically significant results in the major endpoints. The&#xD;
      investigator will examine all of the biologic, physiological, and clinical data to determine&#xD;
      whether a Phase 2B trial is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy analysis will be carried only on patients receiving at least 4 doses of&#xD;
      active drug. Safety analysis will be carried out on all patients receiving at least one dose&#xD;
      of active drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to enroll more than or equal to 24 subjects with COVID-19. It is expected to&#xD;
      have at least 12 evaluable patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group: 0.4 mg/kg rbACE2 IV BID and standard of care Control group: standard of&#xD;
      care Intervention duration: up to 7 days of therapy No planned interim analysis.&#xD;
