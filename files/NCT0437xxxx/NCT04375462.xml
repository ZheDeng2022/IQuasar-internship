  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with cancer causing an intestinal or stomach obstruction often require gastric&#xD;
      drainage to prevent symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and to prevent aspiration. This is often&#xD;
      achieved by a nasogastric (NG) tube, although prolonged NG tube use can lead to unwanted side&#xD;
      effects like ulcers, bleeding, and they are generally uncomfortable. Gastric drainage through&#xD;
      the use of a percutaneously placed endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube has been used in people&#xD;
      with cancer since the 1980s. This allows relief of symptoms of malignant bowel obstruction&#xD;
      though venting of stomach contents. Decompressive PEG tubes are routinely used in individuals&#xD;
      with malignant obstruction, although these tubes tend to get clogged from food blocking the&#xD;
      tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AspireAssist is a weight loss device that allows participants to remove a large amount of&#xD;
      the food in their stomachs after each meal to help them to lose weight via an aspiration&#xD;
      device attached to the abdominal portion of the tube which allows instillation of water into&#xD;
      the stomach, followed by aspiration of the gastric contents into a receptacle or the toilet.&#xD;
      The device is placed endoscopically in an identical fashion to a standard PEG tube. Although&#xD;
      most commonly used for weight loss, the device is FDA cleared to be used as a venting tube as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the AspireAssist provides an improved quality of&#xD;
      life when compared with a standard venting gastrostomy tube for participants with malignant&#xD;
      bowel obstructions.&#xD;

      This multicentered study will enroll participants into two cohorts of (study and control&#xD;
      groups). The study group will undergo AspireAssist gastrostomy tube placement and the control&#xD;
      group will undergo standard decompressive percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement.&#xD;
      Individuals who present for venting gastrostomy placement in clinic or as consults will be&#xD;
      approached for inclusion. Gastrostomy tubes will be placed 1-2 days after enrollment to allow&#xD;
      for thoroughly consideration of inclusion by potential participants. Gastrostomy tube&#xD;
      placement will be completed endoscopically in the standard &quot;pull&quot; method in both the&#xD;
      AspireAssist and PEG groups. Questionnaires will be completed at 7 and 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate to compare healthcare utilization,&#xD;
      including major and minor tube related complications between the two groups. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives of this study are to compare changes in the ability to eat and drink after&#xD;
      placement of the gastrostomy tube and to evaluate changes in quality of life before and after&#xD;
      gastrostomy tube placement.&#xD;
