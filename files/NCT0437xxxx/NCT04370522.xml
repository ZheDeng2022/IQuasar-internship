      This is a multicentre, prospective, observational, no post-authorization study. This study&#xD;
      will be opened for recruitment approximately for 12 months for a pilot phase including at&#xD;
      least 25-30 patients and 6 controls and for 12 additional months to complete patient and&#xD;
      control inclusion until 90 patients and 20 control depending on the first part study results.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After enrolment, patients will be assigned to one of the following cohorts according to their&#xD;
      level of hormone-resistance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A (hormone-sensitive disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B (hormone-resistant disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both cohorts it will be collected residual pre-treatment tumor samples from metastatic&#xD;
      lesions, preferably obtained after last treatment just prior to study entry, and/or primary&#xD;
      breast tumor; as well as serial blood samples at baseline, after 6 weeks, at the same time of&#xD;
      radiological re-evaluation (3 months after ET initiation) and at progressive disease (PD)&#xD;
      which will be used for serial analytic determinations of the expression profiles of Natural&#xD;
      Killer (NK) cells, other lymphoid innate cells, NKG2D ligands, cytokines and other possible&#xD;
      biomarkers; in addition to obtain local data of hemogram and estradiol, Follicle Stimulating&#xD;
      Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have participated in the study during their first line of ET are eligible to&#xD;
      participate after progression, when they initiate the second line of ET (in this case,&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria should be checked newly and Informed Consent Form (ICF) signed&#xD;
      again).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the control population it will be collected blood and local data (e.g. hemogram,&#xD;
      estradiol, FSH and LH levels), in a single time-point after ICF signature.&#xD;
