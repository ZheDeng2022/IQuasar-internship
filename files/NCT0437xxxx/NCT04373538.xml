    <textblock>
      Mental illness is often chronic, severe, and difficult to treat. Though there has been&#xD;
      significant progress towards establishing effective and efficient interventions for&#xD;
      psychological health problems, many individuals do not gain lasting benefits from these&#xD;
      treatments. The Memory Support Intervention (MSI) was developed utilizing existing findings&#xD;
      from the cognitive science literature to improve treatment outcomes. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to conduct an open trial that includes individuals 55 years and older to&#xD;
      assess if a simplified version of the Memory Support Intervention improves sleep and&#xD;
      circadian functioning, reduces functional impairment, and improves patient memory for&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the huge burden associated with mental illness, a major challenge ahead is to hasten&#xD;
      progress toward developing and testing highly efficient and effective interventions for&#xD;
      psychological health problems. Progress toward establishing evidence-based psychosocial&#xD;
      treatments for most types of mental illness has been excellent, particularly the cognitive&#xD;
      and behavioral treatments (CBT). However, much work remains. The effect sizes are moderate,&#xD;
      gains may not persist, and there are patients who derive little or no benefit. Even under&#xD;
      optimal conditions, treatment failure is too common. Hence, the challenge is to improve&#xD;
      outcomes. Seminal progress toward meeting this challenge must include innovations that are&#xD;
      safe, powerful, inexpensive and simple (for fast and effective dissemination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research seeks to extend the investigators' program of research on one such&#xD;
      innovation. With an R34 and an R01 from NIMH, the investigators have been seeking to improve&#xD;
      outcome by improving memory for the content of therapy sessions. To achieve this goal, the&#xD;
      investigators have developed and adapted existing findings from the education and cognitive&#xD;
      science literatures. The resulting Memory Support Intervention (MSI) involves a series of&#xD;
      specific procedures that support the encoding and retrieval stages of an episodic memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This line of research arises from several lines of evidence: (a) memory for the content of&#xD;
      therapy sessions is poor and (b) memory impairment is modifiable. Although the outcomes will&#xD;
      be relevant to psychosocial treatments for a broad range of problems, the focus of this&#xD;
      proposal is one treatment for sleep and circadian dysfunction because (a) sleep problems are&#xD;
      one of the most prevalent psychological health problems, (b) there is substantial and&#xD;
      promising evidence for the efficacy of the transdiagnostic sleep and circadian (TranS-C), yet&#xD;
      there is also room for improvement in outcome and (c) sleep problems are associated with&#xD;
      memory impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will be conducted in order to collect data on individuals who are 55 years&#xD;
      and older because memory functioning can decline over this phase of the lifespan. Sleep and&#xD;
      circadian problems are also common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is: To conduct an open trial that includes n = 40 individuals 55 years and older to&#xD;
      assess if the Memory Support Intervention (a) improves sleep and circadian functioning, (b)&#xD;
      reduces functional impairment and (c) improves patient memory for treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The Memory Support Intervention will be delivered interwoven with Trans-C. The Memory Support Intervention is designed to improve patient memory for treatment and involves a series of specific procedures that support the encoding and retrieval stages of episodic memory. The memory support strategies are proactively, strategically and intensively integrated into treatment-as-usual to support encoding. Memory support is delivered alongside each 'treatment point', defined as a main idea, principle, or experience that the treatment provider wants the patient to remember or implement as part of the treatment.</description>
