  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis use is prevalent among pregnant women, but the effects of use on both the developing&#xD;
      fetus and pregnant woman are unknown. Importantly, drug exposure could be influenced by the&#xD;
      impact of pregnancy-associated hormones on the metabolism of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the&#xD;
      main psychoactive component of cannabis. The goal of this study is to determine whether&#xD;
      cortisol and estradiol - hormones that rise dramatically during pregnancy - increase the&#xD;
      clearance of dronabinol (THC) in reproductive age women to simulate the pregnant state. The&#xD;
      collected data will then be used to predict the time course and magnitude of changes in THC&#xD;
      metabolism in pregnant women, particularly with gradually increasing estradiol and cortisol&#xD;
      concentrations that evolve over the course of pregnancy. The overall objective of this study&#xD;
      is to better understand the effects of THC use during pregnancy on the health of the pregnant&#xD;
      woman and developing fetus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is approved as a medicinal treatment under the trade name&#xD;
      dronabinol but is also a drug of abuse when consumed as part of cannabis products. With the&#xD;
      legalization of recreational cannabis use and increased use among pregnant women, there is&#xD;
      new urgency to understand the dose-exposure relationship for THC, the mechanisms by which THC&#xD;
      is eliminated from the body, and the impact of the hormonal milieu of pregnancy on these&#xD;
      mechanisms. As approximately 4% of all pregnant women in the United States use cannabis,&#xD;
      there is a critical need for studies evaluating how cannabis metabolism may change during&#xD;
      pregnancy leading to altered exposures, pharmacology, and toxicology. Recent studies suggest&#xD;
      that cannabis exposure during pregnancy may adversely affect the developing fetus, and&#xD;
      administration of cannabis [or dronabinol (THC)] to pregnant women is therefore not ethical.&#xD;
      Analysis of THC exposures and effects during pregnancy is significantly hindered by the lack&#xD;
      of accurate, quantitative biomarkers of THC exposure and the unreliable self-report of&#xD;
      cannabis use. To address these gaps, the current study is designed to 1) characterize the&#xD;
      dose-exposure relationship of THC and its major metabolites 11-OH-THC and 11-nor-carboxy-THC&#xD;
      in reproductive age women following consumption of dronabinol orally and 2) to determine how&#xD;
      THC metabolism is altered by the pregnancy-associated hormones estradiol and cortisol.&#xD;
      Existing data show that THC and its major metabolites are cleared by metabolizing enzymes&#xD;
      whose activity increases during pregnancy and further has been shown to be induced&#xD;
      specifically by estradiol and cortisol, hormones that are markedly increased during&#xD;
      pregnancy. Based on these data, we hypothesize that increasing estradiol and cortisol&#xD;
      concentrations during pregnancy will increase the clearance of THC and its metabolites,&#xD;
      leading to an altered metabolism in pregnant women when compared to non-pregnant individuals.&#xD;
      Our clinical study seeks to determine the magnitude of changes in THC pharmacokinetics in&#xD;
      healthy female volunteers following exposures to increased estradiol and cortisol. We predict&#xD;
      that increased estradiol and cortisol concentrations will result in induction of&#xD;
      THC-metabolizing enzymes in the liver and intestine, resulting in increased clearance of THC&#xD;
      and its metabolites. The clinical study will provide the foundation for modeling and&#xD;
      simulation of THC disposition during human pregnancy. These studies will also provide seminal&#xD;
      data to allow modeling of the THC metabolome in human plasma and urine as a function of THC&#xD;
      dose and time after consumption, making a significant impact on development of reliable&#xD;
      biomarkers of THC exposures in humans.&#xD;
