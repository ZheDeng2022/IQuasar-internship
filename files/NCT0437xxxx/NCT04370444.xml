  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of two tools&#xD;
      that may help address the management of deep dyspareunia: 1) A phallus length reducer (PLR,&#xD;
      brand name: Ohnut), consisting of 4 interconnected silicone rings worn externally over the&#xD;
      penetrating object to reduce pain with deep penetration by allowing adjustable limitation of&#xD;
      penetration depth, and 2) A vaginal insert for at home self-assessment of the extent and&#xD;
      severity of deep dyspareunia.&#xD;

      Background: Endometriosis is a gynecological condition characterized by the abnormal growth&#xD;
      of endometrial like tissue outside of the uterus. The condition affects approximately 10% of&#xD;
      reproductive-age females and can cause various types of pain, including chronic pelvic pain&#xD;
      and deep dyspareunia (pelvic pain with deep sexual intercourse). Research has shown that&#xD;
      individuals with endometriosis and dyspareunia have significantly reduced sexual quality of&#xD;
      life, lower self-esteem, and impaired sexual function. Qualitative research has also&#xD;
      demonstrated that many individuals with dyspareunia feel guilty about their pain, and often&#xD;
      continue to engage in intercourse even when the pain is severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure the reduction in deep dyspareunia observed among people using the PLR with&#xD;
           their partner. The investigators hypothesize that the PLR will be associated with a&#xD;
           reduction in self-reported deep dyspareunia scores among participants randomized to the&#xD;
           PLR intervention, compared to participants randomized to the waitlist control group. The&#xD;
           measured reduction in deep dyspareunia will be used to power a future definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the acceptability of the phallus length reducer (PLR) for participants with&#xD;
           endometriosis and their partners. The investigators hypothesize that both partners will&#xD;
           indicate the PLR is acceptable on the self-reported questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore whether an at-home assessment of dyspareunia is an acceptable and valid&#xD;
           alternative to clinical measures. The investigators hypothesize that the at-home&#xD;
           assessments of dyspareunia will be acceptable to participants and will yield results&#xD;
           that are highly correlated with questionnaire-based and clinical assessments of this&#xD;
           pain.&#xD;
