  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Mother Child Education Program (MOCEP) was developed by the Mother Child Education&#xD;
      Foundation (ACEV). MOCEP is implemented in Saudi Arabia through a 25-week program conducted&#xD;
      by ACEV-trained groups with a curriculum for the child that is implemented at home by the&#xD;
      mothers. The program is designed to (1) promote parenting skills and bolster strategies that&#xD;
      support school readiness among mothers of 3-to-6- year-old children, and (2) enhance social&#xD;
      cohesion in the family and community. Rigorous evaluations of MOCEP have been conducted in&#xD;
      several contexts, but not yet in the context of Saudi Arabia. Thus, the present study aims to&#xD;
      rigorously evaluate the impact of MOCEP on child and parent outcomes among families in&#xD;
      Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The problem and its importance: According to an estimate two hundred million or a third of&#xD;
      the world's youngest children do not achieve their potential due to lack of stimulating,&#xD;
      nurturing, safe, and responsive caregiving. The importance of caregiving cannot be&#xD;
      underestimated for early child development (Engle et al.,2007). However, parents and&#xD;
      caregivers need to be supported in fulfilling this role. The results from parenting programs,&#xD;
      across high-, middle and low-income countries indicate significant trends in obtaining&#xD;
      positive results for parents and children (MOCEP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Saudi Arabia, youth represents almost 50% of the population and those &lt; 5 years of age&#xD;
      account for 10.6% (GaStat, 2019). As for the crude birth rate among the Saudi population, it&#xD;
      hits 17.23 live children for every 1,000 persons. Thus, the government has stressed the&#xD;
      importance of investing in national programs that focus on childhood within the scope of the&#xD;
      2030 vision. MOCEP was implemented in Saudi Arabia by the Child Care Association (CCA) which&#xD;
      is an NGO established in 2006. The CCA's main objective is to promote Early Child Development&#xD;
      (ECD) through the MOCEP since 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present evaluation study--a collaboration between CCA and KAIMRC--is to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of MOCEP on child and parent outcomes among families in Riyadh, Saudi&#xD;
      Arabia, using a randomized wait-list controlled trial. Specifically, the aim of the study is&#xD;
      to empirically assess the impact of MOCEP on maternal and child outcomes and to explore key&#xD;
      moderators of the programmatic impact including characteristics of the program implementation&#xD;
      and contextual characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objective 1: We will characterize the impact of MOCEP on child outcomes including&#xD;
      executive function, social-emotional skills, and cognitive skills such as emergent numeracy,&#xD;
      literacy and verbal skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objective 2: We will characterize the impact of MOCEP on parental knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes, practices, and skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive sociodemographic characterization of participating mothers and children will&#xD;
      be conducted. Maternal and child outcomes will be measured before and after the intervention.&#xD;
      Maternal outcomes will include knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding parenting, child&#xD;
      development, and education; disciplinary style; wellbeing; social support; and empowerment.&#xD;
      Child outcomes will include executive function, social-emotional skills, nutritional status,&#xD;
      and school readiness. Mothers will complete a demographic questionnaire at baseline to&#xD;
      characterize social, demographic, home, family, and community characteristics. Mothers will&#xD;
      also complete a battery addressing parenting and child development-related knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes and practices at baseline and endline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessors will use IDELA which provides a direct measure of children's learning and&#xD;
      development and assesses child school readiness through a holistic exploration of children's&#xD;
      early literacy, math, problem-solving, social-emotional development, and gross and fine motor&#xD;
      skills. The tool is available in Arabic and has been validated in multiple countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the social-emotional skills of children, in addition to the IDELA subtest, we will&#xD;
      apply the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. This parent-report measure assesses&#xD;
      children's emotional and conduct problems, hyperactivity, and peer relations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Disciplinary Style Questionnaire (DSQ), a parent-report measure of parental disciplinary&#xD;
      style, will be used to assess the frequency with which parents engage in seven forms of&#xD;
      discipline when dealing with children's undesirable behavior: inductive discipline, physical&#xD;
      punishment, manipulating privileges, harsh verbal discipline, argument, shaming, and&#xD;
      ignoring. These outcomes will be measured before and after implementation of the 25 weeks&#xD;
      MOCEP program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program dosage: will be measured by mothers' attendance at training sessions and the number&#xD;
      of sessions delivered by group leaders will be collected using attendance sheets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program engagement: will be measured by a set of items that will be developed by the Yale&#xD;
      study team, based on constructs examined in other studies (Durlak &amp; DuPre, 2008; Reyes et aL,&#xD;
      2012). The tool measuring program engagement will be administered to both parents and group&#xD;
      leaders participating in MOCEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program quality: will be measured with observational tools and self-report measures. An&#xD;
      ethnographer will be present during the training to document facets such as trainer&#xD;
      responsiveness to parents' needs, clarity of delivery, trainer motivation, parent engagement,&#xD;
      and group cohesion. Also, supervisors will complete the MOCEP Supervisor's Checklist;&#xD;
      supervisors and parents will rate the overall quality of training using items developed by&#xD;
      the research team. Finally, MOCEP curriculum worksheets will be used to determine the degree&#xD;
      to which mothers deliver the program as intended in their homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected in paper forms by trained assessors and then entered into a secured&#xD;
      electronic database prepared by KAIMRC using the KoBo Toolbox program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: We aim to recruit 100 mother-child dyads for the wait-list control and 100&#xD;
      mother-child dyads for the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling technique: The target population will be recruited based on the catchment areas for&#xD;
      the program in the Riyadh area (convenience sampling). We will randomize the enrolled&#xD;
      participants to the intervention and control groups.&#xD;

MOCEP group will be the primary intervention group and the second group will act as the wait-listed control group. Families in the wait-listed control group will participate in a special awareness program but not MOCEP. Although the families in the wait-listed control group will start as a control group (not receiving the intervention), they will have the opportunity to participate in the intervention in a later round of implementation, after the intervention group has completed the program.</description>
