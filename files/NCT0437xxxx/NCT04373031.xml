    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate the clinical and immunologic&#xD;
      activity of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy when combined with various immunotherapy&#xD;
      induction regimens as neoadjuvant therapy for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A commonly used standard neoadjuvant regimen for TNBC is a weekly taxane (e.g., paclitaxel&#xD;
      80mg/m2) for 12 weeks followed by an anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 plus&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide at 600 mg/m2 [AC]) every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chemotherapy regimen included in this study is built upon the aforementioned regimen.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab in combination with this regimen will be studied as part of a multi-arm study&#xD;
      that randomizes subjects to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control Arm: (Pembro + ACT): Pembrolizumab induction (single-dose 200mg IV), followed by&#xD;
           pembrolizumab Q3W + paclitaxel (T) weekly x 4 cycles, followed by pembrolizumab +&#xD;
           doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide (AC) Q3W x 4 cycles as neoadjuvant therapy prior to&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: (Pembro + IRX-2 + ACT): Pembrolizumab (single-dose 200mg IV) + cyclophosphamide&#xD;
           (single-dose 300 mg/m2 IV) + IRX-2 induction (1mL SQ x 2 daily, x 10 days), followed by&#xD;
           pembrolizumab Q3W + paclitaxel (T) weekly x 4 cycles, followed by IRX-2 re-induction&#xD;
           (1mL SQ x 2 daily, x 10 days), followed by pembrolizumab + doxorubicin +&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide (AC) Q3W x 4 cycles as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subsequent induction therapy arms are to be included in protocol amendments. Note: 1&#xD;
           cycle = 21 days&#xD;
