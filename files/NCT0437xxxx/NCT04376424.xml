      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of using hand carried ultrasound&#xD;
      measurements of volume status in directing treatment of heart failure patients admitted with&#xD;
      acute exacerbation. The use of hand carried ultrasound is expected to reduce hospital Length&#xD;
      of stay, heart failure re-admission rates, emergency room visits and in hospital&#xD;
      complications such as renal failure. The hypothesis tested is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null: The use of hand carried ultrasound in the management of heart failure patients did not&#xD;
      change outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative: The use of hand carried ultrasound in the management of heart failure patients&#xD;
      did change outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study endpoints are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A primary endpoint will be the impact of using hand carried ultrasound on length of&#xD;
           hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The secondary endpoint will be 30 days re-admission following heart failure&#xD;
           hospitalization, emergency room visits and in hospital complications such as renal&#xD;
           failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled un-blinded study that poses very minimal risk because&#xD;
      patients will only undergo an ultrasound measurement of Inferior vein cava (IVC) and internal&#xD;
      jugular vein diameter and compressibility. Also, the society will benefit greatly with the&#xD;
      prospect of reducing hospitalization and medical complications, optimizing healthcare&#xD;
      delivery to heart failure patients, and reducing hospitalization cost. The results of this&#xD;
      study/study procedure will only direct medical therapy that heart failure patients usually&#xD;
      receive through routine care such as dose and frequency of diuresis.&#xD;
