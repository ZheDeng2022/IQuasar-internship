    <textblock>
      Meniere's Disease is an inner ear disease characterised by progressive, fluctuating hearing&#xD;
      loss and dizziness. Pathologically, it is characterised by endolymphatic hydrops. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of Meniere's Disease can be elusive since it relies on the subjective reporting of&#xD;
      symptoms and there is no definitive diagnostic test. Non-specific symptoms can occur in the&#xD;
      early stages of Meniere's Disease and the disease progression can also fluctuate&#xD;
      unpredictably. The cochlear and vestibular compartments may be differentially involved so&#xD;
      there maybe clinical variability characterised by solely audiological or vestibular symptoms&#xD;
      (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The structural correlate of MD is endolymphatic hydrops, in which the central smaller&#xD;
      endolymphatic compartment of the inner ear (including the cochlear duct, saccule and utricle)&#xD;
      expands into the surrounding peri-lymphatic chambers. Pathological studies of temporal bones&#xD;
      in subjects with MD have demonstrated EH in most cases of Meniere's Disease (2) and its&#xD;
      presence is required for, the diagnosis of 'certain Meniere's Disease' according to 1995&#xD;
      American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) guidelines(3). An accepted&#xD;
      in vivo biological marker for endolymphatic hydrops has yet to be established. Recent&#xD;
      developments in MRI technology and techniques have however allowed the demonstration of EH&#xD;
      and the clinical application of these imaging studies is now being explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High resolution T2-weighted sequences are widely used for the demonstration of labyrinthine&#xD;
      anatomy and pathology however they are unable to distinguish the endolymphatic from&#xD;
      perilymphatic compartments and hence are generally unable to depict endolymphatic hydrops.&#xD;
      The potential role of gadolinium in discriminating the endolymphatic chamber alone first&#xD;
      became apparent in animal studies, since gadolinium was seen to accumulate in the perilymph&#xD;
      but was excluded from the endolymph by the impermeable tight junctions. Intra-tympanic&#xD;
      administration of gadolinium was initially explored, whereby high concentrations could enter&#xD;
      the labyrinth through round window diffusion, however the evolution of clinically applicable&#xD;
      high resolution sequences at 3T has allowed for gadolinium to be administered by the less&#xD;
      invasive intravenous route. Delayed (4 hours post administration) gadolinium enhanced high&#xD;
      resolution imaging is now used at a number of centres worldwide for the evaluation of&#xD;
      Meniere's Disease patients, although acquisition and analysis methods continue to evolve.&#xD;
      This is most frequently performed with 3D Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery with variable&#xD;
      flip angles turbo spin echo sequence (3D SPACE FLAIR) or 3D real inversion recovery sequence&#xD;
      (3D real IR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of cochlear or vestibular hydrops by MRI in vivo may support the diagnosis&#xD;
      of Meniere's disease in cases with incomplete phenotypes and where there are other diagnostic&#xD;
      considerations such as vestibular migraine or autoimmune ear disease. It may also facilitate&#xD;
      early identification, thus guiding future treatment options for patients who have&#xD;
      traditionally been required to take a watchful waiting approach to see how their symptoms may&#xD;
      evolve or &quot;trial-and-error&quot; approach to management. The identification of bilateral&#xD;
      endolymphatic hydrops in a patient with unilateral fluctuating aural symptoms might predict&#xD;
      future bilateral disease and potentially influence therapeutic approaches. Establishing&#xD;
      imaging as a biomarker in Meniere's disease may allow a contribution to diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      and to define homogenous cohorts for longitudinal studies of natural history and treatment&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of hydrops in each cochlea and vestibule is semi-quantitatively graded (4,5) and&#xD;
      the saccule to utricle ratio index (SURI) is routinely recorded . SURI is a qualitative&#xD;
      comparison of the volume of the saccule relative to the utricle for which a combination of&#xD;
      oblique sagittal and axial reformats are used .MRI assessment of SURI has proved a reliable&#xD;
      qualitative marker being 50% sensitive and 100% specific for MD and this is felt to be due to&#xD;
      the preferential enlargement of the more compliant saccule in EH (6). Additional features&#xD;
      recorded include any asymmetric cochlea enhancement and asymmetry in size of the&#xD;
      endolymphatic structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However there are deficiencies with this MRI approach which we would like to address with an&#xD;
      exploratory study of Meniere's disease patients on 7 Tesla MRI:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gadolinium has an excellent safety record when used at low doses (0.1-0.3 mmol/kg) in&#xD;
           patients with normal renal function. However a causative relationship between&#xD;
           gadolinium-based contrast agents and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is described in&#xD;
           patients with renal insufficiency, and there is also increasing evidence that they&#xD;
           deposit in the human brain after multiple administrations, although the clinical&#xD;
           significance of this remains uncertain (7). Therefore the development of non-contrast&#xD;
           enhanced MRI techniques using high resolution 3-dimensional (3D) Fourier transform MR&#xD;
           imaging sequences such as constructive interference in steady state (CISS) is of&#xD;
           considerable interest. In this regard, some groups have explored the utility of&#xD;
           measuring saccular height on T2w sequences as a marker of endolymphatic hydrops,&#xD;
           although the reliability and reproducibility of these techniques requires confirmation&#xD;
           (8,9). We could speculate that high resolution T2w imaging at 7 Tesla provides increased&#xD;
           SNR so may allow superior definition of these small endolymphatic structures of the&#xD;
           inner ear, allowing increased confidence and reproducibility of the observations, and&#xD;
           allowing better discrimination of endolymphatic hydrops from normal ears. Correlation&#xD;
           with the location of endolymphatic structures on contemporary delayed post gadolinium&#xD;
           inversion recovery sequences would add validation to the interpretation of the T2w&#xD;
           imaging appearances.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Due to the small size of the inner ear structures being imaged and susceptibility&#xD;
           effects arising from the adjacent aerated temporal bone, the SNR and resolution are&#xD;
           currently limited on 3D delayed post gadolinium IR imaging at 3T, making accurate&#xD;
           delineation of some of the structures (e.g. the cochlear duct) extremely difficult, and&#xD;
           hence limiting diagnostic confidence. This is particularly relevant in the early phase&#xD;
           of the disease when the structures are less dilated, which is unfortunate since the&#xD;
           clinical diagnosis is also most challenging at this stage. The lack of clear delineation&#xD;
           also impacts on the precision and inter-observer agreement of minor (semi-quantitative&#xD;
           lower grade) hydrops diagnosis. There is potential for increased spatial resolution and&#xD;
           SNR at 7T MRI with better depiction of the endolymphatic structures on the delayed post&#xD;
           gadolinium 3D IR sequence. This may result in differing semi-quantitative scoring and&#xD;
           quantitative measures of the internal inner ear structures and improved discrimination&#xD;
           of symptomatic from asymptomatic ears compared with 3T MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that HR T2w imaging at 7T will allow the reliable and reproducible&#xD;
      detection of internal inner ear structures, which correlate with the size of endolymphatic&#xD;
      structures on 3D post gad IR imaging and which may be used to distinguish symptomatic from&#xD;
      asymptomatic ears in patients with unilateral MD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cohort of 16 adult patients with unilateral Meniere's disease audio-vestibular symptoms&#xD;
      which satisfy 2015 Barany criteria and which would be referred for delayed post gadolinium&#xD;
      clinical MRI scanning as per the current standard clinical protocol at GSTT.&#xD;
