  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how RA affect the brain structures in RA-patients&#xD;
      and if anti-inflammatory treatment that target TNF-α or JAK OR physical training of hands has&#xD;
      positive impact on neuropsychiatric symptoms and morphological changes in the brain caused by&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research project is to improve the knowledge of morphological changes in&#xD;
      brain developed in connection to RA and to identify clinical and serological markers to&#xD;
      predict development of those changes and finally, to investigate if anti-rheumatic&#xD;
      interventions counteract destructive processes in the central nervous system (CNS) and&#xD;
      improve the patient's health with respect to functionality, pain experience and psychological&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the information gained in previous studies the investigators want to examine if;&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. anti-inflammatory treatment that target TNF-α or JAK signalling or&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. physical training of hands&#xD;
&#xD;
      has a positive impact on neuropsychiatric symptoms and morphological changes in the brain&#xD;
      caused by RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine this the investigators will employ a prospective open-label study design with two&#xD;
      parts, one observation part (1) and one intervention part (2). Patients will be assigned to&#xD;
      either:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. OBSERVATION PART&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Mapping brain morphology in relation to functional impairment, inflammation and&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with RA of various disease duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study this 80 RA patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinic at Sahlgrenska&#xD;
      university hospital for an observational prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RA-patients will be identified via the diagnosis registry within Reumatologi/Sahlgrenska&#xD;
      Universitetssjukhuset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: patients age 45-75 years; confirmed RA diagnosis, in the early stage of&#xD;
      the disease (1-3 years after the diagnosis, n=20); in the established stage of the disease&#xD;
      (5-8 years after the diagnosis, n=30) and in the late stage of the disease (&gt;12 years after&#xD;
      the diagnosis, n=30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: any conditions precluding MRI imaging; e.g claustrophobia; pacemaker etc,&#xD;
      medical history of ischemic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage; medical history of neurological&#xD;
      disease; inability to read and communicate in Swedish, hence being able to give informed&#xD;
      consent and fill out study questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will then undergo the study related activities; clinical examination by&#xD;
      rheumatologist and occupational therapist, blood sampling, height and weight, waist&#xD;
      circumference, blood pressure measurement, questionnaires (see below and attachment), plain&#xD;
      radiological imaging of hands and MRI of the head.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. * Clinical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documentation of number of tender and swollen joints according to the established&#xD;
                Disease Activity Score 28-protocol (DAS28) (see attachment DAS28).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documentation of number of Tender Points ie sensitive areas on the body that become&#xD;
                painful when pressure is applied according to the established TP 18 protocol (see&#xD;
                attachment TP18).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documentation of the hand joint mobility,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  pain (VAS), grip strength,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Functional arm-shoulder-hand status according to DASH protocol (see attachment&#xD;
                Handstatus).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Questionnaires used in the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
           the Health Assessment Questionarie (HAQ), the Fibromyalgia Questionaire (FIQ), the&#xD;
           Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (HADS), the Short Form Health Survey&#xD;
           (SF-36), the IPAQ (International Physical Activity Questionnaire), the Disabilities of&#xD;
           the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Questions on the patients´ diagnosis&#xD;
           and pharmacological treatment (and for women questions on hormonal status) and tobacco&#xD;
           habits are also collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Radiological imaging of hands&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Anatomical 3D MRI of the head will be performed using a standard protocol of&#xD;
                T1-weighted 3D scan with approximately isotropic voxels and a resolution of&#xD;
                approximately 1 mm^3 per voxel. The field of view (FOV) will include the head in&#xD;
                full and extend caudally to include the cerebellum and medulla. Automatic&#xD;
                anatomical segmentation using MAPER (multi-atlas propagation with enhanced&#xD;
                registration) will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. INTERVENTION PART&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To study the effect of TNF-α inhibitors/JAK inhibitors and regular physical training of&#xD;
      hands on RA-related intracranial changes. Based on the information gained in the&#xD;
      cross-sectional and in the pilot part of the investigators previous studies (Erlandsson 2016;&#xD;
      Andersson 2018), they want to investigate if anti-inflammatory treatment that target TNF-α or&#xD;
      JAK OR physical training of hands has a positive impact on neuropsychiatric symptoms and&#xD;
      morphological changes in the brain caused by RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine this a prospective open-labeled study with two groups with 66 patients in each&#xD;
      group will be employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A. Pharmacological treatment with TNF-α inhibitor or JAK inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B. Physical hand training 10 min twice daily while on stable treatment with TNF-α&#xD;
      inhibitor or JAK inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: patients age 45-75 years; confirmed and established RA. Naïve to&#xD;
      treatment with TNF-α inhibitors or JAK inhibitors to be eligible for Group A and to be on a&#xD;
      stable treatment of TNF-α inhibitors or JAK inhibitors for the last 3 months to be eligible&#xD;
      for Group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: other serious conditions precluding MRI imaging, claustrophobia; medical&#xD;
      history of ischemic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage; medical history of neurological disease;&#xD;
      inability to read and communicate in Swedish, hence being able to give informed consent and&#xD;
      fill out study questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Group A, RA patients attending the outpatient clinic at Sahlgrenska university hospital&#xD;
      set to start treatment with TNF-α inhibitors or JAK inhibitors for the first time will be&#xD;
      included. Both TNF-α inhibitors and JAK inhibitors are well tolerated, efficient&#xD;
      anti-rheumatic drugs administered to RA patients with moderate to severe disease in&#xD;
      accordance with the current recommendations for pharmacological treatment of RA&#xD;
      (www.svenskreumatologi.se/srfs-riktlinjer/#).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Group B, RA patients who already receive stable treatment with TNF-α or JAK inhibitors&#xD;
      since 3 months will be included. These patients will be instructed to carry out hand&#xD;
      exercises designed by an occupational therapist for 10 min twice daily for the entire study&#xD;
      period of 6 months (training program attached).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria are informed of the study by their responsible&#xD;
      rheumatologist. Before approaching the patient, the doctor will have made sure he/she fulfils&#xD;
      the study criteria and that he/she is susceptible and open for information about a clinical&#xD;
      study. The decision to start treatment with TNF-α or JAK inhibitors will be made by a&#xD;
      rheumatologist on the intention to treat basis, completely outside the scope of this study.&#xD;
      We will not in any way affect this decision, but simply recruit patients from those that are&#xD;
      starting TNF-α or JAK inhibitors. Once the patient has received information about the study,&#xD;
      both orally and in text, and has been given time to think and ask questions, they are asked&#xD;
      to participate and if so sign the informed consent. After consent is signed by both patient&#xD;
      and personnel a copy is given to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will then undergo the study related activities; clinical examination by&#xD;
      rheumatologist and occupational therapist, blood sampling, height, weight, waist&#xD;
      circumference and blood pressure measurement, completion of study questionnaires (see below&#xD;
      and attachment), plain radiological imaging of hands and MRI of the head. Information&#xD;
      regarding RA duration, clinical activity and medication will be retrieved from medical&#xD;
      records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documentation of number of tender and swollen joints according to the established&#xD;
                Disease Activity Score 28-protocol (DAS28) (see attachment DAS28).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documentation of number of Tender Points, ie sensitive areas on the body that&#xD;
                become painful when pressure is applied according to the established TP 18 protocol&#xD;
                (see attachment TP18).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documentation of the hand joint mobility,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  pain (VAS),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grip strength,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Functional status in shoulder, arm and hand according to DASH (see attachment&#xD;
                Handstatus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Anatomical 3D MRI of the head will be performed using a standard protocol of T1-weighted&#xD;
           3D scan with approximately isotropic voxels and a resolution of approximately 1 mm^3 per&#xD;
           voxel. The field of view (FOV) will include the head in full and extend caudally to&#xD;
           include the cerebellum and medulla.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Radiological imaging of hands&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The study participants of both groups will write a pain diary to register pain (by&#xD;
           visual analogue scale) on daily basis (attached).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients participating in the interventional part of study, both group A and B,&#xD;
      follow-up visits 3 and 6 months after first visit will be booked. At these visit they will&#xD;
      meet with occupational therapist for assessment of hand function, leave blood, complete study&#xD;
      questionnaires and hand over their completed pain diary. At the 6 month-visit an anatomic 3D&#xD;
      MRI of the head will also be performed.&#xD;
