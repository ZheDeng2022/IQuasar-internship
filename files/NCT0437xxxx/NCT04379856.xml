  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II. proof of concept, open label, two-dose, dose escalation study of NM-002&#xD;
      in adult patients with SBS who previously responded to exenatide. NM-002 is planned to be&#xD;
      administered twice, at up to 3 different dose levels, in up to 3 cohorts, each consisting of&#xD;
      3-4 patients. Doses will be administered on Days 1 and 15 by subcutaneous injection. Patients&#xD;
      will be monitored for their usage of parenteral supplementation, and will fill out a daily&#xD;
      diary for their symptoms of SBS. Urine output will be measured on a daily basis. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed for 6 weeks after the second dose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During a baseline period, all subjects will remain on their current prescription for&#xD;
      administration of PS. Between Days -7 to -5 patients who have met initial screening criteria&#xD;
      will return to the clinic and be enrolled into the study. Patients will be trained on diary&#xD;
      usage and patients receiving the SBS meds will be instructed to discontinue use of their&#xD;
      medications; Imodium, lomotil, and opium tincture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -4, subjects will begin diary entries. For 48 hours, on Days -1 and 0, patients will&#xD;
      record in their diaries total urine output, PS usage, stool output and oral liquid intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Study Day -1, patients will visit the clinic for baseline safety assessment, and review of&#xD;
      symptoms of malabsorption and PS usage. Baseline SF36 and Bowel Symptom questionnaires will&#xD;
      be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of treatment, patients will return to the clinic with a sample of urine collected&#xD;
      during the baseline run-in for urinalysis. They will have blood samples drawn for clinical&#xD;
      laboratory assessment and for pre-dose PK levels, anti-drug antibody, and AE assessments.&#xD;
      Following administration of study drug on Day 1, subjects will undergo additional serial PK&#xD;
      blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial blood samples for the pharmacokinetic evaluation of NM-002 will be drawn on Days 1 and&#xD;
      15, with single samples obtained on 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22 and 29. Additional&#xD;
      blood samples will be taken for clinical laboratory evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood glucose meters will be provided to patients to record their daily blood glucose levels,&#xD;
      and to check their blood glucose should any symptoms related to hypoglycemia occur. Patients&#xD;
      will receive written instructions regarding the symptoms of hypoglycemia and how to manage&#xD;
      them at home. They will be provided with glucose gel tubes and instructed in their use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any time on Days 6 through 24, the investigator may call for a reduction or increase in&#xD;
      PS, based on patient diary data and his/her clinical judgment. If a change in PS occurs,&#xD;
      serum electrolytes will be assessed within 48 hours of implementing the change in PS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients have experienced a reduction in PS administration during the study, on Day 25&#xD;
      they will be returned to their pre-study, standard PS regimen. On Day 27, patients will be&#xD;
      asked to return to their individual oral liquid intake established during the baseline run-in&#xD;
      period, and they will record their urine output volume for 48 hours (on Days 27 and 28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patients who experience an increase in PS administration over the original baseline level&#xD;
      will remain on the new level of PS on Days 27 and 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return to the clinic on Day 29. Blood samples will be drawn for clinical&#xD;
      laboratory analysis and for PK. Patients will continue to make daily diary entries through&#xD;
      Day 55. Telephone follow-ups will be conducted by the investigational site on Days 35±1 and&#xD;
      42±1 to assess any requirement for PS adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return to the clinic on Day 56 ± 2 for a final safety assessment.&#xD;
