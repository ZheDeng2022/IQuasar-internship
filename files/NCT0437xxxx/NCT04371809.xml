  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although epigenetics has been identified as one of the most relevant pathophysiological&#xD;
      components in the development of cardiovascular diseases, there is still considerable&#xD;
      difficulty in finding markers of epigenetic damage useful in clinical practice. Moreover,&#xD;
      these markers could be useful to predict the onset and severity of disease as well as to&#xD;
      stratify stratification the prognostic risk during the follow-up. The aim of this project&#xD;
      will be to evaluate the genome wide DNA methylation status in circulating CD4+ T cells and&#xD;
      CD8+ T cells in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), atrial fibrillation (AF) and&#xD;
      with ACS in the presence of AF.&#xD;

      Study population will include 20 healthy controls admitted to electrocardiographic control&#xD;
      without further cardiological, electrocardiographic and clinical evidence of cardiac&#xD;
      pathologies, 20 patients with ACS, and 40 patients with ACS affected or not by AF, recruited&#xD;
      at the UTIC of the UOC of Cardiology at the &quot;AORN A. Cardarelli&quot; (Naples, Italy) (Director of&#xD;
      the UOC: Dr. Ciro Mauro, as Head of Unit of the study at AORN Cardarelli; assisted by Dr.&#xD;
      Antonio Ruocco, Medical Director of Cardiology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with clinically diagnosed of AF and ACS, in particular unstable angina pectoris&#xD;
      (UAP), acute myocardial infarction without ST elevation (NSTEMI) and acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction with ST elevation (STEMI), based on clinical history, symptoms, ECG, biomarkers of&#xD;
      damage cardiac, coronary angiography, risk factors and/or other clinical tests according to&#xD;
      the guidelines for UAP/ NSTEMI and STEMI, will be recruited at the UTIC of the &quot;AORN A.&#xD;
      Cardarelli&quot; (Naples, Italy). All recruited subjects will sign a written informed consent for&#xD;
      a blood sampling for non-profit research purposes. Pharmacological therapy, diagnostic&#xD;
      information and clinical examination data and medical history will be collected from medical&#xD;
      records. Blood samples will be collected during normal clinical practice without taking&#xD;
      additional samples from the first day of admission before the use of drugs such as heparin&#xD;
      and contrast agents (&gt; 90% of the samples will be collected within a day of acute event).&#xD;
      Patients with primary cardiomyopathies, congenital heart disease, valvular diseases, stroke,&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, autoimmune diseases, acute infections, chronic lung infections, COPD,&#xD;
      emphysema, pneumoconiosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, tuberculosis, pleurisy, chronic liver&#xD;
      disease and kidney disease, hyperthyroidism or subjects whom will claim an acute febrile&#xD;
      illness within 2 weeks, will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of whole blood will be carried out from patients and controls during the&#xD;
      normal clinical practice. Biological samples will be immediately processed and stored at +4&#xD;
      °C at the regional reference biobank of the U.O.C. of Clinical Immunology and&#xD;
      Immunohematology, Transfusion Medicine and Transplantation Immunology with annexed Single&#xD;
      Regional Reference Laboratory for Organ Transplant Immunology (LIT) at the Department of&#xD;
      Internal Medicine at the University of Campania &quot;Luigi Vanvitelli&quot; (Naples, Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 25 mL of peripheral venous blood will be collected in EDTA tubes and usually&#xD;
      processed within 1 hour. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) will be isolated by&#xD;
      Ficoll gradient using Histopaque®-1077 (Sigma-Aldrich) according to manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes will be purified from PBMCs using EasySep™ Human CD4+ T and Cell&#xD;
      Isolation Kit and EasySep™ Human CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit (STEMCELL Technologies), starting&#xD;
      by 5x107/mL of PBMNCs, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomic DNA of purified lymphocite subset from each study participant will be isolated&#xD;
      immediately after cell isolation using DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to&#xD;
      manufacturer's protocol. DNA concentration and purity will be determined by using NanoDrop&#xD;
      spectrophotometer ND-2000 (Thermo Scientific) through the evaluation of the absorbance ratio&#xD;
      A260/A280 and DNA integrity checked on 1% agarose gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RRB Sequencing and bioinformatic analyses will be performed by an external Service.&#xD;
