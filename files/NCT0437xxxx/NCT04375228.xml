  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how effective rituximab or tocilizumab are in&#xD;
      treating side effects for people who are receiving immunotherapy treatment requiring&#xD;
      prolonged steroid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune-related side effects are caused by the activation of the immune system. Because&#xD;
      rituximab and tocilizumab have been shown to effectively in treating other diseased that&#xD;
      involve immune system activation, this study seeks to evaluate how effective they will be in&#xD;
      treating immune-related side effects in people receiving immunotherapy treatment for cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of two drugs, either&#xD;
      rituximab or tocilizumab, in patients who develop side effects while on treatment with&#xD;
      immunotherapy requiring prolonged steroids. Immune-related side effects are caused by&#xD;
      activation of the immune system from treatment with immunotherapy. Both rituximab and&#xD;
      tocilizumab have been given to patients with autoimmune diseases (diseases where the immune&#xD;
      system is activated against normal organs). Immune-related side effects appear to closely&#xD;
      mirror these autoimmune conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study have developed an immune-related adverse event while on&#xD;
      immunotherapy and require a long course of steroids to manage this side effect. Steroids can&#xD;
      cause many side effects with prolonged use including problems with sleep, weight gain,&#xD;
      diabetes, muscle loss, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, bone loss, and mood&#xD;
      disturbances. Drugs such as rituximab and tocilizumab have been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      other diseases involving immune system activation. This study is evaluating the effectiveness&#xD;
      of these drugs in patients who have immune-related side effects by their ability to help&#xD;
      patients discontinue steroids.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Patients with histologically confirmed advanced (metastatic or unresectable) solid tumors&#xD;
        that develop irAEs secondary to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Diagnostic&#xD;
        evaluation of irAEs must include agreement between medical oncologist and disease-specific&#xD;
        subspecialist (e.g. rheumatologist, dermatologist) on therapeutic rationale for either&#xD;
        rituximab or tocilizumab-based therapy or if evidence-based indications exist as summarized&#xD;
        below: Dermatologic (bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris) - Rituximab. Neurologic&#xD;
        (autoimmune encephalitis) - Rituximab. Hematologic (immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune&#xD;
        hemolytic anemia) -Rituximab. Rheumatologic (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis)&#xD;
        -Rituximab/Tocilizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Renal (autoimmune nephritis) - Rituximab. Pulmonary (pneumonitis) - Tocilizumab. Cardiac&#xD;
        (autoimmune myocarditis) - Tocilizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Steroid-dependent, defined as inability to wean less than 10mg of prednisone (or&#xD;
        equivalent) after 6 weeks of therapy; patients who develop intolerance to steroids (e.g.&#xD;
&#xD;
        myopathy or hyperglycemia) may be enrolled earlier than 6 weeks at the discretion of the&#xD;
        treating physician and/or the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be ≥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subject of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy&#xD;
             within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine&#xD;
             test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use contraception, or&#xD;
             abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study and through 12 months&#xD;
             after last dose of rituximab or 3 months after last dose of tocilizumab. Subjects of&#xD;
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not&#xD;
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males must practice true abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual contact&#xD;
             with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in&#xD;
             the study, during dose interruptions and for 6 months after last dose of rituximab,&#xD;
             180 days even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vaccinations must be completed 4 weeks prior to the first treatment with rituximab or&#xD;
             must not be taken at least 6 months after the last dose of chemotherapy. Non-live&#xD;
             vaccines may be given during rituximab treatment; however, patients may experience&#xD;
             reduced response rates. The safety of live vaccines has not been studied during cancer&#xD;
             treatment and their use is not recommended unless otherwise advised by the oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject must be vaccinated with the pneumococcal vaccine at least 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
        initiation of therapy, unless subject was vaccinated within 5 years of study entry. If&#xD;
        vaccination occurred greater than 5 years prior to study entry, the subject must be&#xD;
        revaccinated at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below: Absolute Neutrophil Count&#xD;
        ≥1,000/microliters Platelets ≥100,000 Hemoglobin ≥ 7.0g/dL (without transfusion in past 2&#xD;
        weeks) Note: Patients with cytopenias (e.g immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic&#xD;
        anemia) clinically consistent with irAE will be eligible at the discretion of principal&#xD;
        investigator. Patients with hematological values below those stated will not receive&#xD;
        Tocilizumab aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(SGOT)/ alanine aminotransferase (ALT)(SGPT) ≤2&#xD;
        × institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine clearance of ≥ 30 mL/min. Creatinine&#xD;
        clearance (CrCl) should be calculated at screening using the Cockcroft-Gault formula.&#xD;
&#xD;

        Performance Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;

             the risk of possible hepatitis B reactivation, which can be fatal. Patients with&#xD;
             positive serology should have viral DNA levels checked and a gastrointestinal&#xD;
