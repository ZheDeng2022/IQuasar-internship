    <textblock>
      This is a classical in vivo clinical trial, following World Health organization's&#xD;
      recommendations, ran as a multisite study within Mozambique trying to assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety in 4 sites of the two oral ACTS artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and&#xD;
      Amodiaquine-Artesunate (AQ-AS), first line treatment for malaria in mozambique, for the&#xD;
      treatment of uncomplicated malaria in children aged&lt;5 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study followed WHO recommendations for in vivo antimalarial efficacy trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population comprised children aged 6 to 59 months with microscopically confirmed&#xD;
      acute uncomplicated malaria. Other inclusion criteria included body weight ≥5kg, the presence&#xD;
      of fever (≥37.5°C axillary) or a history of fever in the preceding 24 hours, P. falciparum&#xD;
      malaria mono infection with an asexual blood density ≥2,000/µL and &lt;200,000/µL, and the&#xD;
      absence of severe signs of complicated malaria as defined by WHO. Key exclusion criteria&#xD;
      included mixed malarial infections, haemoglobin &lt;5g/dL, severe malnutrition, intake of&#xD;
      anti-malarials within the preceding seven days, ongoing prophylaxis in HIV positive patients&#xD;
      with cotrimoxazole or the intake of any other drug with anti-malarial activity, and any&#xD;
      serious underlying disease. Patients satisfying the inclusion criteria were enrolled if the&#xD;
      parent/guardian signed a detailed written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients were consecutively assigned to the cohort and treated with AL (cohort 1) or&#xD;
      AQ-AS (cohort 2). AL (Coartem™) was administered twice daily for three days (six doses in&#xD;
      total) with dosage determined according to body weight: one tablet (20mg artemether and 120mg&#xD;
      lumefantrine) for children 5 to &lt;15kg, two tablets per dose for those 15 to &lt;25kg, and three&#xD;
      tablets per dose for those 25 to &lt;35kg. AQ-AS (Winthrop™) was administered once daily&#xD;
      according to body weight: one 25mg artesunate and 67.5mg amodiaquine tablet in children &lt;9kg,&#xD;
      one 50mg artesunate and 135mg amodiaquine tablet in children 9-17.9kg; and one 100mg&#xD;
      artesunate and 270mg amodiaquine tablet in children &gt;18-35kg. All treatments were directly&#xD;
      observed for a minimum of 30 minutes. Vomiting occurring within the first 30 minutes implied&#xD;
      the repetition of the full dose of treatment. For those patients living far away from the&#xD;
      health facilities, and for which direct observation of the evening doses of AL was&#xD;
      challenging, admission was offered for the first three days of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antipyretics, such as paracetamol, were used to control fever&gt;=38ºC. In the event of severe&#xD;
      malaria or danger signs, the patient was hospitalized and received intravenous quinine,&#xD;
      according to the national malaria treatment policy. Rescue therapy according to national&#xD;
      malaria treatment guidelines was also administered in cases of early or late treatment&#xD;
      failure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits took place on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 28 after enrolment or at any time&#xD;
      point whenever the child was sick. Patients who prematurely discontinued either study drug or&#xD;
      the study were excluded from the study. Vital signs and body temperature were assessed during&#xD;
      each follow-up visit. Adverse events were recorded and assessed for severity and association&#xD;
      with study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thick and thin Giemsa-stained blood slides were prepared before each dose was administered&#xD;
      and at every follow-up visit of days 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Slides were examined by two&#xD;
      independent microscopists and considered negative if no parasites were seen after examination&#xD;
      of 200 oil-immersion fields in a thick blood film. Species determination (and thus&#xD;
      conformation of monoinfection) was made based on assessment of thin films. Blood samples for&#xD;
      PCR analysis were collected from every patient at baseline and at days 7, 14 and 28, day of&#xD;
      treatment failure or at any other unscheduled visit. PCR was performed centrally for all&#xD;
      cases of recurrent parasitaemia from day 7 onwards to distinguish recrudescence from&#xD;
      reinfection according to the standardized WHO method. The Molecular markers associated with&#xD;
      suboptimal response to ACTs will be investigated.&#xD;
