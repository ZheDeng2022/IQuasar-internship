  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those who are on dialysis, have a high&#xD;
      prevalence of cardiovascular mortality and among the risk factors; inflammation and oxidative&#xD;
      stress stand out. Furthermore, recently this scenario, beyond those alterations found in&#xD;
      these patients, it has been suggested that the imbalance gut microbiota might be a new factor&#xD;
      of cardiovascular risk. Some treatment strategies have been studied in order to modulate the&#xD;
      gut microbiota and inflammation, such as the implementation of exercise programs. However,&#xD;
      the effects of exercise on the modulation of the gut microflora and inflammation have not&#xD;
      been evaluated in these patients. The aim of this project is to investigate possible changes&#xD;
      in gut microbiota, levels of uremic toxins and inflammatory and cardiovascular markers in CKD&#xD;
      patients on hemodialysis, after application of a training program with aerobic exercise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients on hemodialysis (HD) patients present reduced&#xD;
      functional capacity to approximately 50% and uremic myopathy and disuse atrophy have a&#xD;
      significant impact on the functional capacity of these patients (Johansen, 1999; Parsons,&#xD;
      2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several physical exercise benefits for CKD patients, such as improved ability to&#xD;
      perform exercises, increase of strength, quality of life and improve the maximal oxygen&#xD;
      consumption (VO2M√ÅX), which contributes to the improvement of cardiovascular aspects&#xD;
      (Johansen, 2007; Johansen, 2005; Heiwe, 2014). In fact, CKD patients who practice regular&#xD;
      exercise have a higher survival rate (O'Hare et al., 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, some mechanisms regarding anti-inflammatory effects of the exercises has been&#xD;
      proposed, such as: reduction of visceral fat which decreases the secretion of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased production and release of anti-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      from muscle contraction and reduced expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in monocytes and&#xD;
      macrophages, which decreases the pro-inflammatory response (Petersen &amp; Pedersen, 2005;&#xD;
      Gleeson et al., 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, during exercises like running or cycling, there is an increase in capillary&#xD;
      surface area, with opening of capillaries previously inactive, consequently increasing&#xD;
      exchange of substances between the blood and the tissues. Thus, physical exercise could&#xD;
      result in a greater flux of urea and associated toxins from tissue to vascular compartment,&#xD;
      improving the efficiency of dialysis (Parsons et al., 2006; Guyton E Hall, 2017). According&#xD;
      KDOQI (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative), Kt/V, a measure of urea clearance, is the&#xD;
      most frequently applied measure of the delivered dialysis dose and reflects the dialyzer&#xD;
      effect on patient survival (KDOQI, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite results showing the benefits of exercise to CKD patients, they are poorly prescribed,&#xD;
      remaining a challenge in clinical practice and high rates of physical inactivity are observed&#xD;
      in these patients (Williams et al., 2014; Barcellos, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some gaps still need to be filled regarding the not yet known effect of physical exercise on&#xD;
      a number of clinical factors, thus allowing more specific and objective recommendations&#xD;
      (Williams et al., 2014). In this context, the present study aims to verify the effects of&#xD;
      12-week supervised and individualized intradialytic bicycle ergometer exercise on the&#xD;
      adequacy of dialysis, inflammatory markers and functional capacity of HD patients.&#xD;
