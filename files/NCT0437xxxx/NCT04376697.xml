    <textblock>
      This prospective, single-arm, open-label feasibility study will assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in&#xD;
      patients with major depression (MDD) to test the hypothesis that remission rates can be&#xD;
      increased by additional treatment sessions.&#xD;

    <description>Outcome measured by a change in depression score at baseline, before every treatment, and at 1 and 4 weeks post-treatment. A 50% improvement in the score is considered a response to rTMS. A score of 12 or less is categorized as remission.</description>

    <description>Outcome measured by a change in depression score from baseline (week prior to treatment) to 1 week and 4 weeks post-treatment. A 50% improvement in the score is considered a response to rTMS. A score of 7 or less is categorized as remission.</description>
