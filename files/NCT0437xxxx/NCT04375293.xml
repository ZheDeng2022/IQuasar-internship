      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with (w) and without (s) nasal polyps (NP) in its different&#xD;
      shapes is currently affecting up to 16% of the total population of the United States and&#xD;
      around 11% of the population in Europe. It may also be associated with a hypersensitivity to&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs in a syndrome called NSAID-exacerbated&#xD;
      respiratory disease (N-ERD) characterized by highly recurrent polyps and concomitant asthma.&#xD;
      The pathophysiological mechanisms especially with regards to the potential role of the&#xD;
      microbiome in driving N-ERD are so far not fully understood. Here, the investigators plan to&#xD;
      analyse the nasal microbiome in these patients and to compare it to nasal samples from CRSwNP&#xD;
      and CRSsNP patients as well as healthy controls (in total 80 subjects). This will provide&#xD;
      insights into potential differences in the microbiome as compared to other CRS patients and&#xD;
      the impact of the microbiome in driving this disease.&#xD;

      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with (w) and without (s) nasal polyps (NP) in its different&#xD;
      shapes is currently affecting up to 16% of the total population of the United States and&#xD;
      around 11% of the population in Europe . However CRS may also be associated with&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to aspirin and other non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors. This syndrome&#xD;
      of combined CRSwNP, asthma and intolerance to inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme was&#xD;
      termed Samter's triad, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) and recently&#xD;
      NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD). N-ERD is thought to affect around 16% of&#xD;
      patients suffering from CRSwNP , around 7% of adult asthmatic patients and 0.3-2.5% of the&#xD;
      general population. One characteristic feature of this disease is the presence of nasal&#xD;
      polyps that frequently relapse after surgery rendering this disease difficult to manage.&#xD;
      Despite its relatively high prevalence, the pathophysiologic mechanisms are yet not fully&#xD;
      understood. In this respect, an overproduction of and overresponsiveness to cysteinyl&#xD;
      leukotrienes accompanied by and underproduction of and underresponsiveness to prostaglandins&#xD;
      was observed in N-ERD patients.This indicates a dysregulation of pro and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our mucosal body surfaces are colonized by a large variety of microbes organized within&#xD;
      complex community structures. Novel sequencing techniques (e.g. 16SrRNA sequencing) have&#xD;
      facilitated in-depth analysis of the nasal microbiome in health and disease. Recent studies&#xD;
      show amongst other an enrichment in Haemophilus and Streptococcus in the nose of CRS&#xD;
      patients, whereas nasal microbiome of healthy patients is rich in Propionibacterium acnes .&#xD;
      So far, differences in microbiome were observed in healthy versus CRS patients, but the&#xD;
      impact of the microbial environment in N-ERD has not been assessed yet and is thus aim of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect nasal microbiome and nasal secretions from patients suffering&#xD;
      from N-ERD and will compare them to the microbiome of CRSwNP, CRSsNP and healthy controls&#xD;
      (n=20 per group). Additionally, cytokines in nasal secretions, protein expression at mRNA&#xD;
      levels in nasal mucosa, and serum of these patients and clinical parameters (e.g. total nasal&#xD;
      polyp score, quality of life questionnaire, olfactory performance) will be determined.&#xD;
