    <textblock>
      This study will establish the capability of a suite of conventional tests and the Neurolign&#xD;
      Dx_100 I-PAS goggle system to reliably and objectively detect mTBI in an acute setting when&#xD;
      comparing individuals with mTBI to controls with minor injuries in a similarly stressful&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will employ a comprehensive assessment battery to include&#xD;
      vestibular/oculomotor, cognitive, and symptom domains using measures that are consistent with&#xD;
      the NIH/NINDS common data elements (CDE) and current military clinical practice guidelines&#xD;
      (CPG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and health history: Subjects will report medical, concussion and health history&#xD;
      at your first visit including medications. Subjects may be asked sensitive personal and&#xD;
      family history information. Subjects have the right to not disclose the information&#xD;
      requested. This medical and concussion history, as well as your date of clearance/recovery&#xD;
      from concussion will be abstracted from the medical record for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurolign Dx_100 I-PAS testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-PAS testing will be conducted by placing the I-PAS goggles on the head of a patient and&#xD;
      asking the patient to follow instructions while a set of tests is performed. Each of these&#xD;
      tests simply involves eye motions in response to a target. The I-PAS Goggles are FDA approved&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of mTBI. Individuals will undergo a subset of tests from the tests listed&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests: Explanation/eye motion Calibration: Adjusting goggles to focus on eyes Gaze&#xD;
      horizontal: Looking right and left Predictive saccade: Looking where a subject knows a light&#xD;
      will appear Horizontal random Saccade: Looking right and left Vertical random Saccade:&#xD;
      Looking up and down Smooth pursuit horizontal: Following an object right and left smoothly&#xD;
      Smooth pursuit vertical: Following an object up and down smoothly Memory Guided saccade:&#xD;
      Remembering where an object appeared and looking Self-Paced saccade: Self-generated&#xD;
      horizontal saccades Anti-saccade: Looking away from an object that appears (opposite&#xD;
      direction horizontally, same magnitude) Optokinetic: Following a moving textured background&#xD;
      Visual reaction time: Time required to respond with a button press to a visual target Saccade&#xD;
      reaction time: Time required to initiate an eye movement to a visual target Auditory reaction&#xD;
      time: Time required to indicate with a button press that an auditory stimulus was heard&#xD;
      Subjective visual vertical: Aligning a line to be earth-vertical Subjective visual&#xD;
      horizontal: Aligning a line to be earth- horizontal Vergence and pupil tests: Binocular&#xD;
      disparity step and sinusoidal pursuit tracking by eye and pupil Light Reflex Tests:&#xD;
      Consensual pupillary response to light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vestibular/Oculomotor Tests Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening (VOMS) The VOMS will be used to&#xD;
      screen for vestibular and oculomotor symptoms and impairment. The VOMS assesses impairment&#xD;
      via patient-reported symptom provocation following each of the following components: 1)&#xD;
      smooth pursuit, 2) horizontal and vertical saccades, 3) convergence, 4) horizontal and&#xD;
      vertical vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) and 5) visual motion sensitivity (VMS). Patients&#xD;
      verbally rate changes in headache, dizziness, nausea and fogginess symptoms compared to their&#xD;
      immediate pre-assessment state on a scale of 0 (none) to 10 (severe) following each VOMS&#xD;
      assessment, to determine if any domain provokes symptoms. Scores on any VOMS item of 2+&#xD;
      reflects a positive screening cut-off for vestibular or oculomotor impairment (Mucha et al.,&#xD;
      2014). Convergence is also assessed in the VOMS using both symptom report and objective&#xD;
      measurement of the near point of convergence (NPC averaged across 3 trials. NPC values &gt;5 cm&#xD;
      reflect a positive clinical screening cut-off. The VOMS requires limited equipment: a 14 pt&#xD;
      font NPC hand held fixation stick, metronome, and a 1 page paper scoring form. The VOMS&#xD;
      requires approximately 5 minutes to administer and score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic Visual Acuity Test (DVAT) To assess vestibulo-ocular reflex function, the clinical&#xD;
      version of the DVAT will be performed. First, the lens-corrected static visual acuity will be&#xD;
      assessed using a standard Snellen or LogMAR eye chart. The lowest line that all letters can&#xD;
      be read will be recorded. For dynamic visual acuity, the patient will flex their head down 30&#xD;
      deg, then rotate their head in the yaw plane at a frequency of about 2 Hz and amplitude of&#xD;
      20-30 deg. A metronome will be used to set the frequency. Again, the lowest line that all&#xD;
      letters can be read will be recorded. A loss of greater than 2 lines suggests an impaired&#xD;
      VORThe DVAT takes approximately 5 minutes to administer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Vertigo Analog Scale (VVAS) The VVAS assesses how much dizziness (0-10 visual analog&#xD;
      scale) an individual reports for 9 different activities, such as walking through a&#xD;
      supermarket aisle, being in a room with fluorescent lights, going down an escalator, walking&#xD;
      over a patterned floor, etc. A positive result occurs when an individual rates at least two&#xD;
      of the nine items on the VVAS above zero (VVAS positive). The VVAS takes 5 minutes to&#xD;
      administer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Immediate Post-concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT). ImPACT is a&#xD;
      computerized neurocognitive test that includes six modules: 1) verbal memory, 2) design&#xD;
      memory, 3) X's and O's, 4) symbol matching, 5) color matching, and 6) three letter memory&#xD;
      (ImPACT Applications Inc.). These modules are used to form four composite scores: verbal and&#xD;
      visual memory (%), visual motor processing speed (#), and reaction time (RT) (sec). The&#xD;
      ImPACT also includes the Post-concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS), which is a 22-item&#xD;
      self-reported symptom severity inventory of somatic, cognitive, affective and sleep-related&#xD;
      symptoms. The ImPACT test takes 20-30 minutes to administer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Measure (ANAM). The ANAM will be used to assess&#xD;
      neurocognitive performance. ANAM is a computerized neurocognitive test that includes eight&#xD;
      test modules: 1) code substitution delayed, 2) code substitution, 3) matching to sample, 4)&#xD;
      mathematical processing, 5) procedural reaction time, 6) simple reaction time, 7) simple&#xD;
      reaction time repeated, and 8) go/no go (ANAM v. 4.3; Vista Life Sciences). These modules are&#xD;
      scored based on accuracy, speed, and throughput (accuracy/mean reaction time). The ANAM takes&#xD;
      approximately 20 minutes to administer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms Modified Balance Error Scoring System (mBESS) The BESS measures postural stability&#xD;
      and consists of three stances including feet side by side, a tandem stance, and a single-leg&#xD;
      stance on the non-dominant leg. The three stances are performed for 20 sec each, three on a&#xD;
      firm surface and three stances on a dynamic (medium density foam) surface. All stances are&#xD;
      completed with eyes closed and with hands on the iliac crests. Errors include lifting hands&#xD;
      off the iliac crests, opening the eyes, stepping, stumbling, or falling, moving the hip into&#xD;
      more than a 30 degree of flexion or abduction, lifting the forefoot or heel, or remaining out&#xD;
      of the testing position for more than 5 seconds. Each error equals 1 point, with higher&#xD;
      scores indicating worse performance. For the current study, the investigators will use the&#xD;
      modified BESS (mBESS) that consists of the three stances performed on the firm surface only.&#xD;
      Clinical cut-offs for BESS suggest that a total error score 9 or greater indicates clinical&#xD;
      impairment in balance. The mBESS takes approximately 5-6 minutes to administer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) The DHI is a 25-item self-report measure that examines&#xD;
      dizziness-related handicap. It has good psychometric properties, is not prone to ceiling or&#xD;
      floor effects, has been used in the mTBI population, measures deficits across the spectrum of&#xD;
      impairments, activities and participation, and is brief to complete. Each item is categorized&#xD;
      into one of three domains: functional, emotional, or physical. It was developed with the help&#xD;
      of patients who complained of dizziness and uses a three-item response scale,&#xD;
      &quot;yes/sometimes/no&quot; scored as &quot;4/2/0&quot; respectively. The DHI has good internal consistency for&#xD;
      the total score ( 0.89). The test-retest reliability is high (r = .97) and it is responsive&#xD;
      to change in a vestibular population. The DHI has been validated in individuals with mTBI.&#xD;
      The DHI takes approximately 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) Per the recommendations of the JPC-8/CRMRP Complex&#xD;
      Traumatic Brain Injury Rehabilitation Research Clinical Trial Award, the NSI will be&#xD;
      completed by all participants. The NSI is a 22-item (i.e. symptom) scale in which&#xD;
      participants rate the severity of symptoms on a 5-point scale (0 = None, 1 = Mild, 2 =&#xD;
      Moderate, 3 = Severe, 4 = Very Severe) ranging from 0-60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18) The BSI-18 is an 18-item symptom inventory that&#xD;
      assesses the level of psychological distress during the past 7 days on 18 items. The BSI-18&#xD;
      yields total global severity index ranging from 0-72, as well as somatic, depression, and&#xD;
      anxiety sub-scale scores. Any sub-scale T-score &gt;63 is reflective of clinical impairment on&#xD;
      that sub-scale. The BSI-18 requires 5 minutes to complete and score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) The PSQI will be used to assess sleep quality. The PSQI&#xD;
      is a self-report measure including 18 items that comprise seven component scores: 1)&#xD;
      subjective sleep quality, 2) sleep latency, 3) sleep duration, 4) sleep efficiency, 5) sleep&#xD;
      disturbances, 6) sleep medication usage, and 7) daytime dysfunction. Subscale and global PSQI&#xD;
      scores are calculated, with higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administered Tests&#xD;
&#xD;

      days post-injury, and Visit 3 31 or more days post-injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mTBI and control participants will complete their testing at either the UPMC Concussion&#xD;
      Clinic in a private exam room or the concussion research lab in a research dedicated&#xD;
      environment. No testing will occur in an open, non- confidential, public area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control participants will complete 1 visit, completing all of the same assessments with the&#xD;
      I-PAS system, surveys, and neurocognitive testing. Testing for Control participants will be&#xD;
      completed at the concussion research lab in a confidential, dedicated research setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
