    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no robust evidence about how women with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)&#xD;
      perceive pregnancy risk. The aims of this research are to understand women with CKD's&#xD;
      perception of risk in pregnancy. In order to provide appropriate pre-pregnancy and antenatal&#xD;
      counselling including accurate presentation of risk of pregnancy outcomes, it is important to&#xD;
      establish how do women with CKD perceive their risk in pregnancy. In addition, to facilitate&#xD;
      discussion about pregnancy for women with CKD, it is critical to understand key psychosocial&#xD;
      factors influencing their risk perceptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in two phases. In phase one, risk perceptions in women with CKD&#xD;
      who are contemplating pregnancy will be quantitatively measured with potential influencing&#xD;
      psychosocial factors including their illness perceptions, quality of life, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression and perceived social support. Demographic, pregnancy-intentions, medical and&#xD;
      pregnancy histories will also be collected. Phase one findings will establish to what extent&#xD;
      do women with CKD perceive their pregnancy risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase two, perception of risk, pregnancy intention and behaviour, will be qualitatively&#xD;
      explored in women with CKD who perceive high and low degrees of risk. This sub-study will&#xD;
      facilitate understanding about which factors and experiences impact risk perception and their&#xD;
      relationship with pregnancy intentions and behaviour.&#xD;

      The objectives for this research are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To understand how women with CKD perceive their pregnancy risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the associations between biopsychosocial factors (demographics, psychosocial&#xD;
           factors, renal and pregnancy history) and women with CKD's perception of risk in&#xD;
           pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the relationship between pregnancy-related intention and perception of&#xD;
           pregnancy risk in women with CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To gain an in-depth understanding of the biopsychosocial factors which influence risk&#xD;
           perception and pregnancy-related behaviour, in women with CKD who perceive high and low&#xD;
           risk perceptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve these objectives this study is divided into two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Quantitative assessment of risk perception and biopsychosocial factors in women with&#xD;
      CKD Phase 2: Qualitative exploration of risk perception in women with CKD with high and low&#xD;
      risk perception scores&#xD;
