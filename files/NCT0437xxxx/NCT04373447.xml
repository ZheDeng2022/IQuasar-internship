      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last decades and due to improvement of medical heath care, large number of elderly&#xD;
      persons were prevalence. Old age usually had cardiopulmonary different diseases. Biliary&#xD;
      problems are high in old age. advancement of laparoscopic that occurred in the last years&#xD;
      made the use of laparoscopy is available in these cardiopulmonary risk patients. many studies&#xD;
      faced the role of laparoscopy in acute cholecystitis in elderly but no studies stated a new&#xD;
      and a safe laparoscopic approach to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: compare between Fundus-Calot cholecystectomy with low pressure pneumo-peritoneum VS open&#xD;
      cholecystectomy in Emergency cases with cardiopulmonary risk patients as regard&#xD;
      intraoperative data and postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study prospective randomized controlled study was conducted on 374 cases with acute&#xD;
      cholecystitis, biliary colic, mucocele and pyocele of gall bladder in emergency general&#xD;
      surgery department. Patients were divided into 2 groups, Group A: fundus-Calot approach&#xD;
      (235cases) and Group B (235cases): classical open approach&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION Evolving the role of laparoscopy in the last decades in managing of&#xD;
           different surgical diseases especially biliary diseases had made laparoscopic&#xD;
           cholecystectomy of special interest in the field of surgery. The wide spread of use of&#xD;
           laparoscopic cholecystectomy put this surgery in the front line of the commonest&#xD;
           operation performed in digestive system surgery and really put open cholecystectomy a&#xD;
           side.[ Gouma DJ, Rauws EA, Lameris JS. Bile duct injury after cholecystectomy: risk of&#xD;
           mortality substantially higher. NedTijdscr Genseeskd 2004; 148: 1020-24.]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Laparoscopic cholecystectomy advantages are numerous to both the doctors and the&#xD;
           patients. Advantages to the surgeons are safety and rapidity of the operation with&#xD;
           experienced surgeons. To the patients as regard small sized operative wounds, less pain&#xD;
           postoperative, less wound infection and hence rapid discharge from hospital and regain&#xD;
           its usual daily activities . [Stanisic V, Bakic M, Maqgelinic M, Kolasinac H. Babic I.&#xD;
           [Laparoscopic cholecystectomy of acute cholecystitis]. Med Preql 2010; 63: 404-8.]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Despite the fact that laparoscopic approach had many benefits over open approach, yet&#xD;
           many hazards may occur from laparoscopic cholecystectomy starting with viscous injury&#xD;
           during induction of pneumoperitoneum and conversion till fatal biliary and vascular&#xD;
           injuries during blind and insisted dissection of disturbed anatomy and frozen Calot&#xD;
           triangle. these complications may occur with best surgical hands and decreased with&#xD;
           increasing learning curve.[ Russel JC, WalshSJ, Mattie AS, Lynch JT. Bile duct&#xD;
           injuries.1989- 1993: A state wide experience: Connecticut laparoscopic cholecystectomy&#xD;
           registry. Arch Surg 1996; 131:382-8.][ Atmaram DC, Lakshman K. Predictive factors for&#xD;
           conversion of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Indian J Surg 2011; 73: 42-3] a study put us&#xD;
           on the way to avoid bile duct injuries [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
           The incidence of gall bladder disease increase with advancement of age so that 20-30% of&#xD;
           patients undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy is elderly patients &gt; 60 years with&#xD;
           cardiopulmonary risks. and increase to 80 % after 90 years .Elderly patients had&#xD;
           cardiopulmonary risks and reduced physiological reserve [Festi D, Dormi A, Capodicasa S,&#xD;
           Staniscia T, Attili AF, Loria P, et al: Incidence of gallstone disease in Italy: results&#xD;
           from a multicenter, population-based Italian study (the MICOL project). World J&#xD;
           Gastroenterol 2008; 14:5282-5289.] [Ratner J, Lisbona A, Rosenbloom M, Palayew M,&#xD;
           Szabolcsi S, Tupaz T: The prevalence of gallstone disease in very old institutionalized&#xD;
           persons. JAMA 1991; 265: 902-903.]. Other study stated lower incidence of acute&#xD;
           cholecystitis in the elderly group of only 6%[ S. W. Lee, S. S. Yang, C. S. Chang, and&#xD;
           H. J. Yeh, &quot;Impact of the Tokyo guidelines on the management of patients with acute&#xD;
           calculous cholecystitis,&quot; Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, vol. 24, no. 12,&#xD;
           pp. 1857-1861, 2009.]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Insufflation of CO2 induces both hemodynamic and mechanical effects. Compression of the&#xD;
           vascular system decrease cardiac output due to increase peripheral resistance. Abdominal&#xD;
           distension hinder movement of diaphragm. [ Enciso NJ (2013) Anestesia en la cirugía&#xD;
           laparoscópica abdominal. An Fac med 74(1): 63-70.].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Head up position during laparoscopic cholecystectomy decrease venous return and release&#xD;
           catecholamine in the blood causing increase in peripheral vascular resistance and&#xD;
           myocardium exerts more efforts to pump the blood against high peripheral&#xD;
           resistance.[13][14] [15]&#xD;
&#xD;
           No randomized studies have compared fundus-Callot laparoscopic cholecystectomy with low&#xD;
           pressure pneumoperitoneum with open cholecystectomy in cardiopulmonary risk patients&#xD;
           with urgent cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the outcome of urgent LC using either&#xD;
           fundus-Callot approach or open approach in cardiopulmonary risk patients as regard&#xD;
           morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. THE AIM OF THE WORK The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the outcome of&#xD;
           urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy under low pressure Pneumo-peritoneum using either&#xD;
           fundus-Callot first approach Vs open approach in cardiopulmonary risk patients as regard&#xD;
           morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients and methods Study design: Prospective Randomized controlled clinical study.&#xD;

      Sampling method: simple random sample with a balance the data were uploaded into the database&#xD;
      using a standard closed-field electronic form; to guarantee patient anonymity, no information&#xD;
      that could permit patient identification was registered in the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of sample size calculation: Sample size calculated to be 187 at each group based on&#xD;
      global complications rate difference between open and laparoscopic group from previous paper&#xD;
      with 80% power of study and 95% confidence interval&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. Full clinical examination: pain in right hypochondrium radiated to right shoulder, local&#xD;
           examination revealed tenderness in right hypochondrium or mass and fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ultrasonography: thick edematous wall of gall bladder distended gall bladder or stone&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients are divided into 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (n=187): patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with low pressure&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum and initial fundus first cholecystectomy followed by dissection of Calot&#xD;
      triangle (fundus-Calot dissection) Group B (n=187): patients underwent open cholecystectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efforts to decrease bias in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For pretrial bias: Good Define objectives. Risk and outcome .Select patients on&#xD;
           probability sample with adequate sample size. Define confound factors and avoid it&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To avoid during trial bias: Standardize reaction and management of patients&#xD;
           blindly-Objective data use rather than subjective-Good handling of data- plan designed&#xD;
           for drop out&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To avoid after trial bias: Suitable statistical analysis used-Good and carefully&#xD;
           interpretation-Control of confound&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were given general anesthesia. The stomach and the urinary bladder were deflated&#xD;
      with naso-gastric tube and a catheter. The anaesthiologist continuously monitor the vital&#xD;
      signs, PO2 and PCO2 of the patients throughout the surgery. Insufflation of the abdomen were&#xD;
      done by either Verres needle or open Hasson techniques. Endoscope was introduced through the&#xD;
      umbilical incision and the other three trocars were introduced in epigastrium(10 mm), right&#xD;
      subcostal(5 mm) and right anterior axillary line at the level of umbilicus(5mm).we started&#xD;
      release of the fundus first by incision of the peritoneum on left side of middle of gall&#xD;
      bladder, and the dissection continued in the peritoneum around the fundus to the other side&#xD;
      in inverted u-shaped figure. Then the fundus of gall bladder is freed from the liver by&#xD;
      coagulation. Then the fundus is grasped to the right shoulder with ease and this help&#xD;
      elevation of the neck of gall bladder into view. We then begin to dissect the cystic duct and&#xD;
      cystic artery with blunt and sharp dissection till critical view of safety appears. The&#xD;
      cystic duct and artery are controlled by clips and divided. Finally the rest of gall bladder&#xD;
      adherent to the liver is removed. A drain is put in gall bladder bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open cholecystectomy: subcostal Kocher incision. The abdominal layer is entered till opening&#xD;
      the peritoneum. By the use of retractors, the neck of gall bladder is exposed and any&#xD;
      adhesion from omentum, colon or duodenum is released carefully. Then we dissect on cystic&#xD;
      duct and artery carefully and they were controlled by Vicryl 2/0 sutures. Then the gall&#xD;
      bladder is freed from its bed. Sometimes, we performed fundus first approach that helped us&#xD;
      greatly to expose neck of gall bladder. Aspiration of the gall bladder helped us to grasp the&#xD;
      fundus. A drain was put in gall bladder bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mortality (90-day mortality and mortality at maximal follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Postoperative complications: early (hemorrhage, bile leak, wound infection) and late&#xD;
           complications (biliary stricture)&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Port site hernia Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conversion to open cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Total hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intra-operative findings (duration of operation, intra-operative bleeding and iatrogenic&#xD;
           injuries)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Return to work.&#xD;
