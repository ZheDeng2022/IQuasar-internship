    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of palliative &quot;QUAD SHOT&quot; radiotherapy&#xD;
      combined with pembrolizumab and evaluate the effects of the combination treatment patients&#xD;
      with recurrent cancer of head and neck.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During this study, patients will receive infusions of pembrolizumab with radiotherapy&#xD;
      (palliative QUADSHOT regimen). The patient will receive treatment of pembrolizumab once every&#xD;
      3 weeks and palliative &quot;QUAD SHOT&quot; radiotherapy every 4 weeks. These 28 day period of time is&#xD;
      called a cycle. The cycle will be repeated 3 times. Each cycle is numbered in order. The&#xD;
      patient will be treated for up to 3 cycles followed by pembrolizumab single drug until&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or tumor progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will also complete a survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of the study is up to two years.&#xD;
