  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a dermatologic disease characterized by depigmentation of the skin. While the&#xD;
      loss of melanocytes observed in vitiligo is driven by the immune system, repigmentation of&#xD;
      the skin that occurs during UV light treatment is driven by melanocytes that migrate out of&#xD;
      the hair follicle and into the epidermis or the activation of stem cells within the&#xD;
      epidermis. Unfortunately, some skin areas affected by vitiligo have very few hair follicle&#xD;
      melanocytes and an indeterminate number of epidermal melanocytes and therefore unable to&#xD;
      respond to light therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study seeks to examine the relative efficacy of different harvesting methods for&#xD;
      the melanocyte keratinocyte transplant procedure (MKTP) in the treatment of vitiligo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, this study will analyze the tissue of excess tissue harvested during the&#xD;
      procedure to identify distinct cellular and molecular features of chronic vitiligo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Dr. Ganesan's clinic at the UCI (University of California, Irvine) Department of&#xD;
      Dermatology will be approached for participation in the study. The study will include both&#xD;
      men and women and will not be limited by race or ethnicity. The investigators will exclude&#xD;
      individuals less than 18 years old for the study as the investigators believe it would be&#xD;
      difficult for these subjects to tolerate the melanocyte keratinocyte transplant procedure.&#xD;
      Participants will be offered a melanocyte keratinocyte transplant procedure with one of the&#xD;
      three different tissue harvesting methods (a blade, suction blister) and the method without&#xD;
      dissociation (Cellutome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has three arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MKTP with Surgical Blade&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MKTP with Negative Pressure Instrument (suction blistering device).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Suction blister grafting without cell dissociation utilizing Cellutome (a device used&#xD;
           for treating chronic burn wounds)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first arm of the study, a normally pigmented area on the patient was anesthetized with&#xD;
      1% lidocaine with epinephrine. Using a surgical knife, the investigator removed a small&#xD;
      portion of the epidermis that is unaffected by vitiligo from a small area (2cm2) on the&#xD;
      patient's thigh to obtain donor cells. Epidermis that was harvested with the surgical knife&#xD;
      was washed with Lactated Ringer's solution three times and then dissociated using trypsin to&#xD;
      separate the cells into a single cell suspension. The recipient area to be grafted was&#xD;
      ablated with an Erbium YAG(yttrium aluminum garnet)laser. Half of the dissociated single&#xD;
      cells from the donor area (thigh)was then transplanted on to the area affected by vitiligo&#xD;
      that the participant is interested in grafting (5 cm2 area).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator then evaluated response to treatment in the transplanted areas at 1 day, 1&#xD;
      week, 1 month and 3 months, and 6 months by both photography and quantifying the&#xD;
      VASI(Vitiligo Area Scoring Index) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VASI(Vitiligo Area Scoring Index)is the percentage of vitiligo involvement and is calculated&#xD;
      in terms of hand units. One hand unit is approximately equivalent to 1% of the total body&#xD;
      surface area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second arm of the study, the investigator used a minimally invasive procedure (suction&#xD;
      blister grafting) to sample the grafted skin and donor skin- this method can separate the&#xD;
      epidermis from the dermis without inducing a scar. A normally pigmented area on the upper&#xD;
      thigh was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine. Using a suction blister technique,&#xD;
      the investigator removed a small portion of the epidermis that was unaffected by vitiligo&#xD;
      from a small area (4 cm2 or 0.6 inch cm2) on the patient's thigh to obtain donor cells.&#xD;
      Epidermis that was harvested was washed with Lactated Ringer's solution three times and then&#xD;
      dissociated using trypsin to separate the cells into a single cell suspension. The recipient&#xD;
      areas to be grafted were used to harvest epidermis using a suction blister device. Half of&#xD;
      the dissociated single cells from the donor area (thigh) were then transplanted on to the&#xD;
      area affected by vitiligo that the patient was interested in grafting (5 cm2 area or 0.7&#xD;
      inch2). The suction blister skin from the recipient sites was simultaneously dissociated into&#xD;
      a single cell suspension. A portion of the remainder of the cells (from both the donor and&#xD;
      recipient site) was subjected to flow sorting to quantify the populations of melanocytes and&#xD;
      keratinocytes and to detailed molecular analysis (single-cell RNA sequencing and histology)&#xD;
      to characterize the molecular features of chronic vitiligo. The investigator then evaluated&#xD;
      response to treatment in the transplanted areas at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 3 months, and 6&#xD;
      months by both photography and quantifying the VASI score. This arm of the study is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third arm of the study, the investigator uses a minimally invasive procedure (suction&#xD;
      blister grafting without cell dissociation) to sample the grafted skin and donor skin- this&#xD;
      method can separate the epidermis from the dermis without inducing a scar. A normally&#xD;
      pigmented area on the upper thigh will be anesthetized with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.&#xD;
      Using an epidermal harvesting system which is a suction blister technique, the investigator&#xD;
      will remove multiple small portions (about 128 blisters-1.8 mm in diameter) of the epidermis&#xD;
      unaffected by vitiligo from a small normal area (5 cm2 ) on the patient's thigh to obtain&#xD;
      donor cells and using a regular negative pressure instrument for removing four samples for&#xD;
      histopathological study (two from the vitiligo area and two from the normal donor skin). The&#xD;
      epidermis from the donor area (thigh) will then be transplanted on to the area affected by&#xD;
      vitiligo that the patient is interested in grafting. Also, the four portions from the normal&#xD;
      skin and the recipient site will be sent for the histopathological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will then evaluate response to treatment in the transplanted areas at 1 day,&#xD;
      1 week, 1 month and 3 months, and 6 months by both photography, quantifying the change in&#xD;
      depigmented surface area, and the VASI(Vitiligo Area Scoring Index) score. Also, the&#xD;
      investigator will evaluate the two vitiligo samples and two normal skin samples through&#xD;
      histopathology to assess where the unique populations of cells identified in their&#xD;
      RNA-sequencing analysis are localized (obtained from arm 2). The investigator hypothesizes&#xD;
      that his transplant procedure will yield excellent to good repigmentation, resulting in a&#xD;
      mean of 60% reduction in surface area (SD=30%) from baseline to 6-month follow up. With a&#xD;
      sample size of 5 patients, this study will achieve 90% power to test this hypothesis based on&#xD;
      a two-sided paired t-test at p=0.05 significance level. In addition, the investigator will&#xD;
      compare the results from the 7 patients harvested using the surgical blade technique&#xD;
      (procedure already completed and follow up results pending) with the results from 7 patients&#xD;
      harvested with the suction blisters (completed) and seven patients from the newly proposed&#xD;
      experimental group (three completed to date).&#xD;
