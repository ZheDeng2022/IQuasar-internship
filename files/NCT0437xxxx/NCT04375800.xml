  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-group, open-label, multi-site study in pediatric participants with human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, aged 4 weeks to &lt;12 years and weighing &lt;45&#xD;
      kg, who are treatment-naive (TN) or have been virologically suppressed (VS) on stable&#xD;
      combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for ≥3 months with no history of treatment failure.&#xD;
      The first primary objective is to evaluate the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      doravirine (DOR) [MK-1439] when given in combination with 2 nucleoside/nucleotide analog&#xD;
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) or as part of the fixed dose combination (FDC) of&#xD;
      DOR/lamivudine (3TC)/tenofovir disproxil fumarate (TDF) in participants ≥6 to &lt;12 years and&#xD;
      weighing ≥14 to &lt;45 kg. The second primary objective is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of DOR when given with 2 NRTIs or as part of the FDC of DOR/3TC/TDF, in&#xD;
      participants ≥6 to 12 years and weighing ≥14 to &lt;45 kg, through Week 24.&#xD;
