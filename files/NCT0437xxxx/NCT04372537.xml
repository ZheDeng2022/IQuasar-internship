  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electroneuromyography (ENMG) is a regular neurological investigation that might be painful or&#xD;
      unpleasant. Medical hypnosis can avoid these sensations, and is more and more performed&#xD;
      during other medico-technical procedures (radiology, biopsies for example). This study aims&#xD;
      at evaluate the effect of medical hypnosis on pain and anxiety during ENMG, in patients&#xD;
      presenting with anxiety. Our hypothesis is that the anxiety and pain during ENMG will be&#xD;
      lower in patients with hypnosis compared to patients with standard care. This will allow us&#xD;
      to help patients with this tool during most ENMG procedures, and extend it to other&#xD;
      electrophysiological procedures in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical hypnosis is more and more used during some medico-technical investigational&#xD;
      procedures, such as interventional radiology, dental procedures, baby deliveries. Using the&#xD;
      modified conscious state induced by trance or by conversational hypnosis (thanks to verbal&#xD;
      and nonverbal language) allows a better tolerance of these procedures. Only very few&#xD;
      situations recommend against this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENMG is a frequently performed procedure in neurology to explore neuromuscular functions. It&#xD;
      implies electric stimulations, needle insertion and needs the patient cooperation and the&#xD;
      patient's well-being. This is all the more necessary that this procedure may be repeated for&#xD;
      a patient along his/her life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one study evaluated the effect of hypnosis on pain and anxiety during ENMG (Slack and&#xD;
      al., 2009). Despite a low statistical power due to a small sample, it showed a reduction of&#xD;
      the maximal pain during the needle electromyography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More proof is therefore needed to assess the efficacity of hypnosis against pain and anxiety&#xD;
      during ENMG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several members of our nurse and medical team have an experience in hypnosis practice and&#xD;
      this procedure is sometimes used in some patients, when specifically required, alone or with&#xD;
      other analgesic procedures (like nitrous oxide), but not in the current standard practice.&#xD;
      This is mainly useful in patients with anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's principal objective is then to evaluate the effect of an hypnosis procedure,&#xD;
      compared to a standard clinical procedure alone, on pain consecutive to ENMG, in patients&#xD;
      presenting with anxiety when attending an ENMG. The secondary objective is to assess the&#xD;
      effect of hypnosis on anxiety consecutive to the ENMG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a monocentric, controlled, randomized, open-labeled study, with two balanced arms.&#xD;
      The study cannot be blind since the members of the staff will apply at the same time the&#xD;
      hypnosis procedures and the ENMG investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have to undergo an ENMG due to their standard care investigations will be&#xD;
      consecutively included as long as they're taken care of by members of the staff with an&#xD;
      hypnosis experience and express any anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      48 patients in each group will have to be include to achieve a sufficient power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be blindly performed by our methodology, biostatistics and data&#xD;
      management unit. All tests will be bilateral with an alpha risk of 5%, with an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is a reduction of pain and anxiety in the hypnosis group compared to the&#xD;
      standard care one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this is confirmed, it will be an argument to offer this procedure in a systematic way to&#xD;
      any patient with anxiety who has to undergo an ENMG as well as developing its use in other&#xD;
      electrophysiological investigations.&#xD;
