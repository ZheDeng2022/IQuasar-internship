  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine the use of tranexamic acid (TXA) in gender mastectomy&#xD;
      surgery, specifically looking at volume loss (blood and transudate) postoperatively.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anecdotal data from plastic surgeons around the country suggests that tranexamic acid has&#xD;
      decreased patient's drain outputs, swelling, and bruising. Based on these anecdotal reports,&#xD;
      many University of Wisconsin (UW) surgeons in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery became&#xD;
      interested in its use. It has a very safe profile and is inexpensive; therefore, many UW&#xD;
      plastic surgeons have started using it topically prior to closure in many of procedures.&#xD;
      Surgeons notice decreased drain output and bruising; and therefore decided to formally study&#xD;
      the effects of tranexamic acid to determine whether there was a statistical difference in&#xD;
      outcomes with the use of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this sub-study, topical TXA will be applied to the surface of surgical sites and the&#xD;
      primary outcome will be days to drain removal postoperatively. Secondary outcomes that would&#xD;
      be assessed is total drain fluid output in milliliters, hematoma and seroma rates, and need&#xD;
      for transfusion for hemoglobin &lt; 7.0 postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the use of TXA will result in earlier removal of drains by decreasing&#xD;
      total drain fluid output and decreased need for transfusions, thus minimizing the associated&#xD;
      complications/risks with drains and transfusions. The overall study is in two-parts, 1) a&#xD;
      prospective study with retrospective controls via chart review and 2) a prospective&#xD;
      controlled trial in bilateral procedures where participants serve as their own control with&#xD;
      one side having tranexamic acid irrigation and the other side having saline irrigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This record documents a prospective controlled trial of the use of TXA in gender mastectomy,&#xD;
      specifically.&#xD;
