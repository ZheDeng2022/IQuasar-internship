  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy with anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibodies has revolutionized the treatment&#xD;
      of metastatic and advanced NSCLC, but its application in neoadjuvant setting has not been&#xD;
      well established. Results from a pilot clinical study reported the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade. There are several neoadjuvant immunotherapy (NEOSTAR, LCMC3,&#xD;
      NADIM, IMpower131) ongoing, and the preliminary results are reported in 2019 American Society&#xD;
      of Clinical Oncology, which show promising therapeutic prospect. However, the therapeutic&#xD;
      response rate (major pathologic response [MPR]) are not so good (20% - 45%) for PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitor monotherapy. To improve the therapeutic response, the investigators design a&#xD;
      multiple-canter, open-label, phase II trial for stage II-IIIA resectable NSCLC. The&#xD;
      participants will receive neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor (camrelizumab) combined with&#xD;
      antiangiogenic drug (apatinib) or platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
