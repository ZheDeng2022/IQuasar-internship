  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label single arm phase 2 clinical trial in patients with metastatic solid&#xD;
      malignancy of any histology who have previously experienced limited progression in at least 1&#xD;
      and up to 5 lesions while on immune checkpoint inhibitors monotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All potential subjects are required to undergo screening evaluation to determine eligibility&#xD;
      within 28 days of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will continue the same immune checkpoint inhibitors on which they&#xD;
      experienced limited progression and will also receive radiation therapy. radiation therapy&#xD;
      for all subjects will consist of treating one tumor of the treating physician's preference,&#xD;
      and after a 1-week interval during which immune checkpoint inhibitor is continued alone,&#xD;
      radiation therapy will be given to a second and separate tumor. No additional radiation&#xD;
      therapy will be delivered. immune checkpoint inhibitors will be continued until disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Diagnostic imaging studies will be performed to&#xD;
      determine treatment response at baseline/screening, 8 weeks after initiation of radiation&#xD;
      therapy to the first lesion and every 8 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cell composition will be evaluated at various time points within&#xD;
      14 days of starting radiation therapy, on Day 8 (1 week after starting radiation therapy to&#xD;
      the first lesion), Day 23 (1 week after starting radiation therapy to the second lesion), and&#xD;
      8 weeks after treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 52 subjects will be enrolled on this trial. The expected rate of accrual is 2&#xD;
      patients per month at a single institution over 26 months.&#xD;
