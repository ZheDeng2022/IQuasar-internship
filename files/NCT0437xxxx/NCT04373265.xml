      This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of Relacorilant in combination with&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab for Patients with Adrenocortical Carcinoma with Excess Glucocorticoid&#xD;
      Production.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relacorilant is a small molecule antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of relacorilant when given in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) with&#xD;
      glucocorticoid (GC) excess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients are those with advanced ACC associated with GC excess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive treatment until progressive disease (PD) (per RECIST v1.1) is&#xD;
      confirmed, experience unmanageable toxicity, or until other treatment discontinuation&#xD;
      criteria are met. All patients will be followed for documentation of disease progression,&#xD;
      survival information (i.e., date and cause of death) and subsequent treatment.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients will treated with a lead-in of 300 mg relacorilant once daily from Day -3 to Cycle 1 Day 1 prior to the first dose of pembrolizumab. From Cycle 1 Day 1 until confirmed p or unacceptable toxicity with relacorilant and pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab will be administered every 6 weeks (on Day 1 of each 42-day cycle) and relacorilant will be administered daily.&#xD;
On Cycle 1 Day 2, the patient's dose increases to 100 mg relacorilant once daily for 2 weeks. The patient's relacorilant doses may then escalate by 100-mg increments every 2 weeks based on tolerability until they reach 400 mg relacorilant once daily.&#xD;
For patients who tolerate the 400 mg relacorilant once daily, but their Cushing-syndrome symptoms persist, further dose escalation in 100-mg increments to a maximum of 600 mg relacorilant once daily may be considered after approval of the Medical Monitor and as long as the patient's AUC0-24 at their current dose does not exceed the maximum allowable exposure.</description>
