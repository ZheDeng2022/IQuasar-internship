  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is a highly genetic and complex neurological&#xD;
      disorder, where disruptive behavior, emotional imbalance, and lack of attention can interrupt&#xD;
      with normal development of adolescents, self-awareness, and self-regulation in a way that has&#xD;
      an impact on the family unit. Effective family intervention programs, that empower resilience&#xD;
      and strength, to cope with the stressful situation from ADHD, are therefore needed.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge regarding what type of interventions are the most&#xD;
      effective for these families. As well as, little is known about the benefits of family-level&#xD;
      intervention for families of adolescents with ADHD at outpatient care and what amount of&#xD;
      combination in an intervention is appropriate. Psychiatric advanced practical nurse (APN)&#xD;
      practitioners are in a key role to offer such an intervention. Therefore, the aim of this&#xD;
      pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of offering a family-level intervention, for&#xD;
      parents of 13-17 years old adolescents with ADHD, at a Children and Adolescents' Psychiatric&#xD;
      Outpatient Unit (BUGL). Also, to evaluate if the intervention, which consists of group&#xD;
      educational sessions, family sessions, and access to evidence-based information's on ADHD,&#xD;
      fitted the families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nurse-led educational and support intervention will be offered for parents of adolescents&#xD;
      with ADHD once a week over a 5-week time period. First, there will be offered three group&#xD;
      support sessions, with information about the general impact of the ADHD disorder on the&#xD;
      family's daily life. Second, two special therapeutic conversations and support interviews&#xD;
      will be offered to each family, where each parent can discuss their daily situation&#xD;
      specifically and its impact on the family as a whole. Third, caregivers will have access to&#xD;
      about 140 pages of evidence-based material on a closed website (pan pale) regarding the ADHD&#xD;
      disorder in adolescents and its impact on the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of this process will help in determining the feasibility of subjecting the&#xD;
      intervention to a more expensive and time-consuming randomized controlled trial (RCT) study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study is a cornerstone to represent many methodological design challenges when&#xD;
      studying a vulnerable group of parents or when testing the feasibility of an intervention.&#xD;
      Attrition of dropout is one of the most crucial components in intervention research for&#xD;
      families of adolescents in third-line care as for families of adolescents with ADHD.&#xD;
      Furthermore, motivation is important to keep parents engaged, as well as to minimize the risk&#xD;
      of them dropping out of the study. In a pilot study, questions are asked regarding if the&#xD;
      intervention can be done, and it is determined whether an intervention warrants further&#xD;
      testing, and if so, how. This special design then elements the study as a small-scale study,&#xD;
      before the main full-size study will be conducted. Further, this design of a study is also&#xD;
      done to improve the quality, to evaluate the safety of the intervention, to re-evaluate the&#xD;
      recruitment possibilities as well as to considering ethical aspects of a larger randomized&#xD;
      control trial (RCT) study. This pilot study is therefore conducted to assess the feasibility&#xD;
      of a 5-week Family strength-oriented therapy conversation (FAM-SOTC) intervention in an RCT.&#xD;
      Preliminary research is used to assess the process, resources, management, and scientific&#xD;
      value. This is an important factor in increasing the efficiency and results of future RCTs&#xD;
      and preventing wasted time and resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From November 2018 until March 2019, will caregivers of adolescents aged 13-18 with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of ADHD at BUGL be randomly selected and invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for family participation are (a) adolescents diagnosed with ADHD at BUGL&#xD;
      and (b) born between 2001 and 2007. (c) Caregivers needed to speak and read fluent Icelandic&#xD;
      and (d) be living close to the capital city. Exclusion criteria are (a) caregivers not&#xD;
      speaking or reading fluent Icelandic and (b) the family living in the countryside&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FAM-SOTC intervention emphasizes the family's strength and resilience, empowering parents&#xD;
      of adolescents with ADHD to support themselves and their child. The FAM-SOTC requires nurses&#xD;
      to build trust in the therapeutic relationship, listen to families, reflect on therapeutic&#xD;
      questions, and offer appropriate evidence-based information and guidelines. The FAM-SOTC is&#xD;
      based on the Calgary family assessment model (CFAM) and Calgary family intervention model&#xD;
      (CFIM), as well as the illness beliefs model (IBM), which views suffering as stemming from&#xD;
      the beliefs about the illness, but not the illness itself. Addressing beliefs about the&#xD;
      illness presents a new path for helping families to handle stressful situations. In addition,&#xD;
      Barkley's clinical manual for family assessment and intervention are used to guide caregivers&#xD;
      step-by-step in how to deal with demanding ADHD symptoms. Clinical advice will be given to&#xD;
      strengthen the supportive role of parents to improve the parent-teen relationship and the&#xD;
      adolescent's adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 5-week family strength-oriented therapeutic conversation intervention proceeded as&#xD;
      follows: caregivers will be invited to participate once a week over a 5-week time period.&#xD;
      First, a two-hour ADHD educational and psychosocial group support sessions will be held for&#xD;
      caregivers (five families in a group, one per week over a 3-week period) that included&#xD;
      general ADHD information, a 10-step process for supporting adolescents in a positive,&#xD;
      constructive way, and problem-solving exercises to practice in the group and at home (a total&#xD;
      of six hours of educational and psychosocial support sessions). Second, APNs led special&#xD;
      therapeutic conversations and provided individualized support for each family (once a week&#xD;
      for 2 weeks; 60-90 min each section, resulting in 2-3 hours of support for each family). The&#xD;
      individualized support emerged from the therapeutic relationship and family relations and&#xD;
      allowed caregivers to tell their narrative illness stories. Therapeutic questions are used&#xD;
      for assessment (CFAM) of caregivers' strengths, resiliency, and resources to understand their&#xD;
      need for further guidance and to recommend interventions (build on the CFIM) to identify&#xD;
      facilitate and/or constrain beliefs. Thereby, the FAM-SOTC can strengthen family functioning,&#xD;
      well-being, illness beliefs, and family support. Third, over the whole study period, parents&#xD;
      received access to a website with about 140 pages of evidence-based (EB) - educational and&#xD;
      informative material to be used as they wished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, participants will provide written informed consent with&#xD;
      agreeing to participate. Data will be collected with accurate, reliable questionnaires&#xD;
      through the research electronic data capture (REDCap) data management platform. Caregivers&#xD;
      and adolescents answer different questionnaires at the same time. The baseline measurement is&#xD;
      taken at time one (t1) before caregivers received the intervention, and follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaires are given at time two (t2) after the intervention (post-intervention), 5-weeks&#xD;
      from baseline (t1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following instruments will be used for caregivers to measure their satisfaction and&#xD;
      changes in their adolescents' ADHD symptoms: family-support (ICE-FPSQ); illness beliefs&#xD;
      (ICE-FIBQ); family-activity (ICE-EFFQ); coping health inventory for parents (CHIP); the&#xD;
      general well-being schedule (GWB); treatment evaluation questionnaire (TEQ); paediatric&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaire (PedsQL); ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS); adolescents&#xD;
      Disruptive Behaviour Rating Scale (DBRS); and background list in which information about&#xD;
      gender, age, education, work, family status, diagnoses, and other psychological treatment are&#xD;
      selected. The instruments for the adolescents to measure their self-esteem and mastery before&#xD;
      and after their parents received the intervention are the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale (50)&#xD;
      and the Perlin et.al Mastery scale, in addition to a background questionnaire in which&#xD;
      information about gender, age and education will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis are based on Polit and Beck's implementation of descriptive statistics: 1)&#xD;
      determine how many will agree to participate, 2) calculate median (the middle number) and&#xD;
      interquartile range (IQR) (IQR = Q3-Q1, a measure of the spread of the number of sessions&#xD;
      completed and mean length of time to complete the data collection form), 3) compute effect&#xD;
      sizes and confidence intervals around estimates, 4) assess whether, for each person a&#xD;
      reliable improvement will occur, 5) determine whether, a clinically significant change will&#xD;
      occur in a responder analysis, 6) assess whether changes and benchmarks will be established&#xD;
      to decide the feasibility, or if larger research is needed for the results to be deemed&#xD;
      meaningful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethic guidelines from the International Council of Nursing for ethical principles with human&#xD;
      beings will be used. Before families agree to participate in the study, they receive an email&#xD;
      with information about their role in the research, the nature of the study, and data&#xD;
      collection. In addition, they will receive contact information from a psychiatrist, in case&#xD;
      if they will experience discomfort with participating. Those that can not participate when&#xD;
      invited have the opportunity to participate later and those that chose to receive the&#xD;
      intervention but not answer the questionnaires will receive the intervention without&#xD;
      participating in the study. Participating in the study has no effect on other treatment&#xD;
      offered at the Psychiatric Unit; participants received the treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study will help assess whether it is worth evaluating the 5-week FAM-SOTC&#xD;
      intervention in a larger RCT study. As well as, representing methodological challenges for&#xD;
      these families in a combination with a protocol of educational and support program for&#xD;
      families of adolescents with ADHD to enhance adolescents' self-management behaviors. The&#xD;
      results will be of interest to health care professionals working with ADHD adolescents&#xD;
      patients. Additionally, our study will be of value to user organizations and policymakers&#xD;
      administering education and support programs aimed at the prevention and treatment of ADHD in&#xD;
      adolescents. In a way, to encouraging and empowering parents of adolescents wiht ADHD at&#xD;
      psychiatric outpatient unit in their parenting caring role that can affect the families as a&#xD;
      whole in a positive way.&#xD;
