  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a clinical trial to determine the retention and durability of the anterior&#xD;
      zirconia wing bridge. The type of zirconia-wing bridge the investigators are researching in&#xD;
      this study has two wings which generally have three countersunk holes (meaning that the&#xD;
      circumference of the outer portion of the hole is larger than the inner part of the hole).&#xD;
      Composite resin (dental filling material) is placed in the holes as well as under and around&#xD;
      the wings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve patients will have bridges placed and be evaluated every 6 months (ideally) to&#xD;
      determine if the bridge is staying in place (retention) and if it is resistant to fracture&#xD;
      (durability).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients missing an anterior tooth, the treatment options available include a dental&#xD;
      implant, a removable partial denture, or a bridge. Some patients may not desire an implant&#xD;
      due to the surgical nature, the limited bone available or the high cost. Removable partial&#xD;
      dentures are relatively inexpensive but are undesirable for many patients due to the limited&#xD;
      esthetics, trouble speaking and annoyance of an oral prosthesis. Traditional bridges use&#xD;
      adjacent teeth as abutments and replace the missing tooth. However, these require the removal&#xD;
      of 1-2 mm of tooth structure on adjacent teeth provide room for the porcelain of the bridge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decades ago, the option for a conservative bridge was primarily found in the Maryland bridge,&#xD;
      which had two metal wings that were cemented or bonded on to two abutments. Though&#xD;
      conservative, the Maryland Bridge did not enjoy a high reputation because of the high rate of&#xD;
      debonding (falling off).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last several decades, the use of zirconia as a restorative material in dentistry has&#xD;
      dramatically risen due to its toughness, resemblance in color to natural teeth, and&#xD;
      affordability. Also, composite resin bonding agents (adhesive for dental fillings) have&#xD;
      increased in strength and effectiveness. With these two advancements, the possibility of&#xD;
      overcoming the some of the previous shortcomings with the Maryland Bridge is more of a&#xD;
      reality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of zirconia-wing bridge we are researching in this study has two wings which&#xD;
      generally have three countersunk holes (meaning that the circumference of the outer portion&#xD;
      of the hole is larger than the inner part of the hole). Composite resin (dental filling&#xD;
      material) is placed in the holes as well as under and around the wings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the zirconia-wing bridge presents a desirable alternative to traditional options&#xD;
      for missing anterior teeth. With the advancements in resin-bonding and zirconia, this study&#xD;
      seeks to examine how these combined elements can be used in the zirconia-wing bridge to&#xD;
      maximize durability and retention in clinical scenarios.&#xD;
