  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While international guidelines have indicated that use of a routine invasive strategy was&#xD;
      favored for high-risk patients with NSTE-ACS and for all STE- ACS, the lower risk patients&#xD;
      successfully reperfused and carrefully selected may perhaps not benefit of this systematic&#xD;
      strategy. Evaluation of complications occurring in a contemporary population of ACS may help&#xD;
      to evaluate the need of ICU strategy. Coupled with favorable outcomes in many patients, these&#xD;
      data may be an opportunity for testing of strategies to refine triage to less costly hospital&#xD;
      care units. The investigators thus want to compare, through an observational and prospective&#xD;
      study, the event rate of two groups of patients with ACS admitted to ICU . Patients are&#xD;
      classified as &quot;high risk&quot; and &quot;low risk&quot; according to specific medical criteria validated in&#xD;
      the literature. The study will include all consecutive patients admitted for NSTACS and STACS&#xD;
      admitted to the intensive care department of the Montpellier university hospital with the&#xD;
      diagnosis of ACS confirmed by coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary goal is to compare the percentage of patients with at least one serious clinical&#xD;
      event between the high and low risk groups. A serious event is defined by the occurrence&#xD;
      within 7+/-5 days of one of the following criteria: death all causes, serious neurological or&#xD;
      hemorrhagic complications, hemodynamic instability and severe heart failure, rhythm or&#xD;
      sustained or poorly tolerated conduction disorders requiring therapeutic intervention,&#xD;
      painful recurrence requiring new coronary angiography, secondary transfer to intensive care&#xD;
      for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that low-risk patients will have very few events and no fatal events and&#xD;
      that they could not require intensive care unit admission .&#xD;

      All patients admitted in the ICU Montpellier University center for ACS from May 2019 to May&#xD;
      2020 will be evaluated and classed as low risk patients (groupe LR) or not low risk patients&#xD;
      (NLR) after coronary angiography evaluation. High risk criteria will include age &gt;80 years,&#xD;
      severe comorbidities, unstable hemodynamic or rhythmic state requiring specific therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention, failure of reperfusion or unsatisfactory result of angioplasty, patients with&#xD;
      residual coronary lesions requiring further revascularization, left ventricular ejection&#xD;
      fraction &lt;40%. Patients who have not received optimal antithrombotic treatment during&#xD;
      angioplasty for any reason will also be considered at high risk, as will patients at risk of&#xD;
      bleeding due to antecedent or associated pathology or taking a long-term anticoagulant&#xD;
      treatment. For the specific case of SCA with ST segment elevation, they will all be included&#xD;
      in the group, except for patients who have been successfully reperfused less than 3 hours&#xD;
      after the onset of pain or who have an open artery during coronary angiography performed&#xD;
      within the first 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary endpoint is to compare the percentage of patients with at least one serious&#xD;
      clinical event between the high and low risk groups. A serious event is defined by the&#xD;
      occurrence within 7+/-5 days of one of the following criteria: death all causes, serious&#xD;
      neurological or hemorrhagic complications, hemodynamic instability and severe heart failure,&#xD;
      rhythm or sustained or poorly tolerated conduction disorders requiring therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention, chest pain recurrence requiring new coronary angiography, any secondary&#xD;
      transfer to intensive care for any reason. Secondary endpoints include evaluation of adverse&#xD;
      events (all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalization for cardiac and&#xD;
      non-cardiac causes) at 1 month follow-up in the 2 groups, length of hospitalization of the&#xD;
      two groups, calculation of the average number of serious events per patient The low-risk&#xD;
      group event rate is estimated at 3 percent without any fatal events. It is estimated at 15&#xD;
      percent in the high risk group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a frequency of the event of 3% in the low risk group and 15% in the high risk group,&#xD;
      it is necessary to include at least 269 patients, including 196 patients in the high risk&#xD;
      group and 73 patients in the low risk group (for a power of 90% and an alpha risk of 5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that low-risk patients, about 1/3 of ACS admission in ICU, will have very&#xD;
      few events and no fatal events and that they don't need intensive care admission&#xD;
