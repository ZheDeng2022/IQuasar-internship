  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well binimetinib and nivolumab work in treating patients with&#xD;
      BRAF V600 wildtype melanoma that has spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes and cannot be&#xD;
      removed by surgery (locally advanced unresectable) or has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (metastatic). Binimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help&#xD;
      the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread. Giving binimetinib and nivolumab together may work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with melanoma compared to nivolumab alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Objective response rate (ORR), which is defined as the proportion of response-evaluable&#xD;
      participants either with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, as determined by the investigator&#xD;
      assessment, at best overall response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Progression-free survival (PFS), clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + stable disease [SD]&#xD;
      among response-evaluable participants, per RECIST 1.1), overall survival (OS) and duration of&#xD;
      response (DOR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluation of histologic evidence of response (p-ERK reduction in residual tumor cells and&#xD;
      CD8 T cell or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or tumor infiltrating lymphocyte [TIL]&#xD;
      infiltration induced by combination treatment) using pretreatment and early on-treatment&#xD;
      tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive binimetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and nivolumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1&#xD;
      year, then annually thereafter.&#xD;
