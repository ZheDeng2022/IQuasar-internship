    <textblock>
      Obesity has been reported to impair regulation of appetite and lead uncontrollably hunger and&#xD;
      satiety response. Ghrelin is orexigenic hormone from the stomach meanwhile, leptin is&#xD;
      anorexigenic from adipose. Interestingly, obesity is associated with acylated ghrelin and&#xD;
      leptin resistance. Study about the impact of high protein and fiber with combined exercise&#xD;
      (HPFE) to suppress hunger among young obese still unclear. The hypothesis was that high&#xD;
      protein-fiber would result in decreased in acylated ghrelin and leptin in HPFE group. Thus,&#xD;
      the investigator examined the effect of an 8 weeks HPFE on acylated ghrelin and leptin.&#xD;
      Subjects were randomized into four groups: High Protein-Fiber (HPF; n=15). High Protein-Fiber&#xD;
      and exercise (HPFE; n=15), Exercise (E; n=15) and control (C; n=15). The diet prescribed 1200&#xD;
      kcal/day, based on basic energy requirement minus 300kcal, consisted high protein (25%) and&#xD;
      fiber (30g/day). The exercise is combination aerobic and resistance training, with target 75%&#xD;
      heart rate maximum. Plasma acylated ghrelin and leptin were analyzed with enzyme immunoassay.&#xD;

      1. Introduction Obesity pandemic occurred in both developed and developing countries. The&#xD;
           prevalence of young obesity is rising among adolescents in developing countries as well,&#xD;
           rising from 8.1% to 12.9% in 2013 for boys and from 8.4% to 13.4% in girls. The&#xD;
           Indonesian Basic Health Research showed prevalence of young obesity in Indonesia&#xD;
           increase from 18,8 menjadi 31% on 2007 till 2018. The prominent problem with young&#xD;
           obesity is the accumulation of adipose cells in the abdominal which can interfere with&#xD;
           appetite hormones. Ghrelin is the only known as orexigenic hormon which secreted from&#xD;
           the stomach. The leptin is one of anorexigenic mainly released by the adipose tissue.&#xD;
           The orexigenic hormone acylated ghrelin and the anorexigenic hormones leptin are an&#xD;
           important players in regulating appetite, food intake, energy balance, and adipogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Regarding body weight regulation, key element are the control of energy intake which is&#xD;
           regulated at the simplest level by sensation of hunger. Body weight is controlled by a&#xD;
           complex system, including both peripheral and central factors. Two of the hormones that&#xD;
           appear to play a crucial role in the regulation of food intake and body weight are&#xD;
           leptin and ghrelin. Interestingly, obesity is associated with acylated ghrelin and&#xD;
           leptin resistance. Hyperleptinemia is blunted response in satiety. Postprandial acylated&#xD;
           ghrelin levels in obesity abdominal subjects do not fall, so hunger still appears. In&#xD;
           obese subjects experience leptin resistance because the leptin receptor is disrupted so&#xD;
           that there is a failure of sending leptin signals to the hypothalamus. Many study&#xD;
           especially about acylated ghrelin still controversial. Studi Andarini showed plasma AG&#xD;
           concentration is higher before and after eating at all time points, regardless of food&#xD;
           type, in obese individuals, as compared with normal weight individuals. Consistant with&#xD;
           the Ozkan et al reveal the AG increase following obesity status.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Different types of protein can result in different levels of satiety. Metabolites,&#xD;
           including certain amino acids, contribute to the food intake is arginine. The ability of&#xD;
           specific L-amino acids, including L-arginine (L-Arg), to stimulate anorectic agent&#xD;
           (GLP-1 and PYY) release has been studied previously in vitro. The study Alamshah et al&#xD;
           showed L-Arg reduced food intake and stimulated gut hormone release in rodents. The role&#xD;
           fiber affect the release satiety and gastric emptying rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Managing weight loss with modification lifestyle in young obesity actually requires&#xD;
           paying special attention to high compliance and less hunger more satiety. The study&#xD;
           aimed to examine the effect of giving a high protein diet rich arginine and fiber diet&#xD;
           with exercise among adolescent obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methods and Matherials 2.1 Participants The program was conducted from Juli to Oktober&#xD;
           2018. Subject were recruited through nutrition screening and campaign mass media. For&#xD;
           sample size, the investigator calculated previous studies regarding AG with following&#xD;
           setting: power was set at 80%, p value at 0.5 and standardized difference was 21.2,&#xD;
           resulting in a sampel size of 12 subjects, including 20% for drop out. Inclusion&#xD;
           criteria are body mass index &gt; 25 kg/m2, waist circumference &gt;80 cm for female and &gt;90&#xD;
           cm for male. The investigator exclude who were taking dietary supplements or medication,&#xD;
           smokers, have pregnancy, lose body weight &gt; 10% before treatment and have chronic&#xD;
           disease history. The participants consisted of 60 adolescents obesity who were selected&#xD;
           from outpatient of Universitas Diponegoro, Semarang, Indonesia. Subjects were randomized&#xD;
           into four groups : High Protein-Fiber (HPF; n=15). High Protein-Fiber and exercise&#xD;
           (HPFE; n=15), Exercise (E; n=15) and control (C; n=15). All participants has signed&#xD;
           informed consent and the study was approved by Kariadi Hospital-Diponegoro University&#xD;
           with provision Declaration of Helsinki (Number 427/EC/FK-UNDIP/VII/2018)&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Study design and randomization. The study design was randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      (four-arm). The random assignment was generated by a computerized program. The duration of&#xD;
      intervention is 8 weeks. It was not possible to blind the dietitians who advised on dietary&#xD;
      prescribe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Diet protocol The subject were randomly into four of different intervention. The HPFE&#xD;
      prescribed balanced diet (55%carbohydrate, 25% protein, and 20% fat). Based on the Academy&#xD;
      Dietetics of Association recommends using the Miflin-St Jeor equation for estimating RMR in&#xD;
      obese individuals. Subject have body weight means 75 kg, so the total energy was calculated&#xD;
      1500 kcal,then minus 300kcal. The distribution energy of breakfast (30%), lunch (40%) and&#xD;
      dinner (30%) and extra 500ml plan water before meal. The investigator choose the protein&#xD;
      sources rich arginine like all type fish, tempeh, nuts/peas. The investigator serve the diet&#xD;
      menu everyday in our laboratory. The diet was prescribed with the use of standardazied&#xD;
      household measure to quatify the food portion in each meal. The subjects were monitored the&#xD;
      diet everyday with logbook. The control group give nutrition education once a week in&#xD;
      nutrition laboratory. The nutritional data was calculated by software (Nutrisurvey).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Exercise protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      One session of training program included the following program component :&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) 5 min warm-up; 2) 25 min aerobic training; 3) 10 min resistance training, 4) 5 min&#xD;
      cool-down. The resistance training was performed without weight training machine&#xD;
      (chalestenic). The movement includes plank, mountain climber, pilates leg pulls, right side&#xD;
      plank, left side plank, flutter kick, toe touch crunches, crunch, knee tuck crunches and&#xD;
      russian twist. The muscle strength level by 40 repetition maximum (RM). Rest between the sets&#xD;
      of the resistance training was set 20reps. The aerobic training was performed koreographic&#xD;
      for at least 25 min and the intensity was 75% heart rate maximum. The frequency of training&#xD;
      was five times a week (on alternate day) under professional trainer. Heart rate during&#xD;
      training was monitored using HR monitor (H10, POLLAR, Kemple, Finland)&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 Body composition Body weight, and percent body fat mass, were analyzed by a bioelectric&#xD;
      impedance analyzer (TANITA DC-360) with light clothes and no shoes. Height was measured by&#xD;
      stadiometer (SECA 207). BMI was calculated as body weight in kilograms divided by height in&#xD;
      meters squared (kg/m2). Waist Circumference (WC) was measured with a inelastic measuring tape&#xD;
      around the mid-section between the margin of the last rib and the iliac crest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Hormone Analysis Venous blood samples were obtain after 10h fasting. Blood samples for&#xD;
      insulin and leptin were stored in plain tubes, and acylated ghrelin were stored in tubes with&#xD;
      EDTA. For active ghrelin, immediately after collection, 40 mL p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid&#xD;
      was added to each blood sample. The samples were centrifuged at 3500X at 4C for 10 min. For&#xD;
      acyl ghrelin, after centrifugation, the plasma was pipetted in 1.5-mL microtubes, and 100 mL&#xD;
      hydrochloric acid (1N) was added for each 1 mL plasma. For all blood sample, the respective&#xD;
      supernatant fluids were pipetted and frozen at 80°C for a later analysis by an enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunoassay (Elabscience E-EL-H2002 for AG, E-EL-H0113 for leptin). Blood samples for&#xD;
      trigliserida and HDL were stored in tubes with non EDTA, and analyzed with clinical chemistry&#xD;
      automatic analyzer (Indiko thermoscientific).&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1 Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed IBM SPSS. Variable not normally distributed were&#xD;
      nonparametric test. Wann whitney U test was used to test for difference all parameter at&#xD;
      baseline. We compared change in variable (baseline-week8) in each sub group using pair t=test&#xD;
      or wilcoxon signed rank test to determine the impact of differential change. To test for&#xD;
      change in parameters between four group used kruskal wallis.&#xD;
