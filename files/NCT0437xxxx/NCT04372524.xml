  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will validate a previously developed pediatric prognostic biomarker algorithm&#xD;
      aimed at improving prediction of risk for the later development of chronic graft-versus-host&#xD;
      disease (cGvHD) in children and young adults undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By developing an early risk stratification of patients into low-, intermediate-, and&#xD;
      high-risk for future cGvHD development (based upon their biomarker profile, before the onset&#xD;
      of cGvHD), pre-emptive therapies aimed at preventing the onset of cGvHD can be developed&#xD;
      based upon an individual's biological risk profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also continue research into diagnostic biomarkers of cGvHD, and begin work&#xD;
      into biomarker models that predict clinical response to cGvHD therapies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) occurs when the new donor immune system &quot;attacks&quot;&#xD;
      tissues in the recipient following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT),&#xD;
      leading to chronic inflammation, scarring and fibrosis, impaired immunity (including immune&#xD;
      deficiency and immune dysregulation), and altered organ system functioning. Almost any organ&#xD;
      or system has the potential to be affected by cGvHD, although eight organ systems are&#xD;
      classically involved, including the skin, eyes, mouth, lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract,&#xD;
      genitourinary tract, and the musculoskeletal system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be enrolling allogeneic HSCT recipients before conditioning, following&#xD;
      these patients prospectively until 12-months (+/- 1 month) post-transplant for the&#xD;
      development of all forms of GvHD (classical acute, late acute and chronic GvHD), collecting&#xD;
      blood samples at day +60 (+/- 7 days), day +100 (+/- 14 days), and at the onset of either&#xD;
      late acute or chronic GvHD. Two extra blood samples will be collected exclusively from HAPLO&#xD;
      transplant recipients, who never developed any late-acute GvHD or chronic GVHD at the 6- and&#xD;
      12-month post-transplant time points. In addition, clinical data will be collected at&#xD;
      different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case report forms of standard transplant related data will be completed and entered into a&#xD;
      REDCap database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be drawn and shipped to the Central Laboratory in Vancouver, BC, Canada,&#xD;
      processed, analyzed, and the final biomarker risk algorithm completed. Selected clinicians&#xD;
      will be offered to complete a short survey asking about their perception of the feasibility&#xD;
      of altering their approach to cGvHD management based upon these results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If chronic GvHD develops at any time after transplant (day 0 to 1 year), or if any form of&#xD;
      GvHD occurs at or after day +100 (whether late acute, chronic GvHD, or overlap syndrome), a&#xD;
      blood sample will be drawn before escalating immune suppression, and the onset GvHD case&#xD;
      report form will be completed following the protocol. If chronic GvHD is confirmed, an&#xD;
      additional CRF will be submitted at 24-months (+/- 3 months) post-transplant to document new&#xD;
      chronic GvHD manifestations, severity, and response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will have between 2 and 4 blood samples drawn over the course of 1-year&#xD;
      post-transplant, depending upon their event and GvHD status.&#xD;
