      cessation program for lower-income young adult smokers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Using content and strategy developed from the formative research phase, this randomized&#xD;
      smoking cessation trial will test the impact of a tailored cessation intervention for&#xD;
      socioeconomically-disadvantaged young adult (SDYA) smokers compared to a usual-care control&#xD;
      on intervention engagement, self-efficacy to quit, and 30-day point prevalence abstinence at&#xD;
      3-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place over a 3-month period. Individuals who complete the screening&#xD;
      survey and are eligible to participate will be asked to complete a 15-20 minute baseline&#xD;
      survey at the start of the study. This survey will ask questions about use of mobile phones,&#xD;
      tobacco use, recent alcohol and other drug use, concerns about the coronavirus outbreak and&#xD;
      how it may affect personal tobacco use, and physical activity. After the first survey,&#xD;
      participants will be assigned randomly to one of two study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Referral to a quit smoking hotline (quit line)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Referral to a quit smoking hotline (quit line), plus enrollment in a web and&#xD;
      text-based smoking cessation intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will be enrolled after completing the following steps, in order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Providing consent to participate in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Confirming contact information;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Completing a payment acknowledgement form that allows us to reimburse for survey/task&#xD;
           completions; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Completing the baseline survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To complete enrollment, participants in Group B will also be required to register for an&#xD;
      account on BecomeAnEx.org and enroll in text messages on the site. Once registered, Group B&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in a text message program customized for this study and will&#xD;
      need to respond to the initial message from the text message platform to initiate text&#xD;
      messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group B will receive daily text messages for 3 months with content delivered&#xD;
      through the Truth Initiative's BecomeAnEx digital quit smoking platform. They will also&#xD;
      receive brief (1-2 minute) weekly check-in surveys related to the week's messages and smoking&#xD;
      status during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3-months, participants in both groups will receive the 15-minute follow-up assessment.&#xD;
      Participants in both groups who report quitting smoking at 3-months will be mailed a kit in&#xD;
      order to take a saliva test to measure the amount of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, in&#xD;
      their saliva. Participants who report smoking at the 3-month follow-up will not receive this&#xD;
      saliva test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study procedures will take place remotely, with surveys conducted online. Participants in&#xD;
      Group A will be paid at least $30 for participation and up to $80. Participants in Group B&#xD;
      will be paid at least $40 for participation and up to $170.&#xD;
