    <textblock>
      &quot;Increased health risks and diseases are believed to be caused by multilevel interactions of&#xD;
      genetic and environmental factors (including lifestyle habits). Considering the recent&#xD;
      advancements in genetic analysis, wearable devices, and big data analysis techniques,&#xD;
      collecting and analyzing personal genetic information, lifelogs, and environmental data and&#xD;
      predicting the exact health risks of individuals could be possible.&#xD;

      These changes enable the development of healthcare solutions that allow users to actively&#xD;
      engage in healthcare and provide appropriate care measures to sufficiently delay or prevent&#xD;
      chronic diseases, thereby minimizing the financial losses of the individuals and the society.&#xD;
      In particular, chronic diseases such as metabolic syndrome can be prevented or delayed&#xD;
      through healthy lifestyle habits. Controversy regarding the effectiveness of using wearable&#xD;
      devices and mobile health applications for maintaining lifestyle habits and losing weight&#xD;
      exists. Additionally, a study assessing the health of the participants and the disease&#xD;
      prevention care for the participants using the genetic data and the lifelog data by the&#xD;
      wearable device has not been conducted yet. Therefore, the objective is to operate a&#xD;
      lifestyle correction program for examinees who visited a family medicine and health checkup&#xD;
      center to develop a user-participation health and disease prevention care system using&#xD;
      genetic data and lifelog data. From adults who visited a family medicine and health checkup&#xD;
      center, the following should be performed: (1) collect a variety of clinical information,&#xD;
      including lifestyle data, physical information, metabolic parameters, genetic information,&#xD;
      and metagenomes, which can affect chronic diseases; (2) establish a service model that&#xD;
      combines lifestyle data, examination data, and genetic data and analyzes and identifies one's&#xD;
      health level through a smartphone application; and (3) examine the effects on the metabolic&#xD;
      parameters, lifestyle data, and metagenome (gut microbiome) after using the device (smart&#xD;
      healthcare).This pilot study aimed to provide personalized &quot;my data&quot; by linking clinical data&#xD;
      and personal lifestyle patterns of the participants who visited a family medicine and&#xD;
      examination center.&#xD;
