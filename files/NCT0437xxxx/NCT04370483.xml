  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how well leflunomide works for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      high-risk smoldering plasma cell myeloma, for the delay of disease progression.&#xD;
      Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as leflunomide lower the body's immune response and are used&#xD;
      with other drugs in the treatment of some types of cancer. The information learned from this&#xD;
      study will help researchers to learn more about the anti-myeloma activity of leflunomide, and&#xD;
      whether it may delay the onset of symptomatic multiple myeloma in patients with high-risk&#xD;
      smoldering multiple myeloma.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the anti-myeloma activity of leflunomide, when given as a single agent, as&#xD;
      assessed by 6-month progression-free response rate based on International Myeloma Working&#xD;
      Group (IMWG) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single agent leflunomide. II. To summarize and&#xD;
      assess toxicities by type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate overall and progression-free survival probabilities. IV. To estimate&#xD;
      response rate and duration of response. V. To describe the impact of treatment on quality of&#xD;
      life, as assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality&#xD;
      of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) Score version (v)3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the molecular evolution of the tumor cells. II. To evaluate whether&#xD;
      specific genetic subtypes respond differently to leflunomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the role of immune cells in the progression of smoldering multiple myeloma&#xD;
      (SMM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the role of leflunomide in modulating the immune system. V. To examine the&#xD;
      relationship between immunological changes and disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive leflunomide orally (PO) once daily (QD). Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 28 days&#xD;
      until an alternative myeloma therapy has commenced or until disease progression, and then up&#xD;
      to 6 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women and women who are lactating. Leflunomide has potential for teratogenic&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the&#xD;
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance&#xD;
             with clinical study procedures, e.g., infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction,&#xD;
             unable to swallow medication, social/ psychological issues, etc&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to&#xD;
             comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to&#xD;
             feasibility/logistics)&#xD;
