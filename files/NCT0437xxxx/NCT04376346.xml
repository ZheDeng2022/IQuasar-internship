  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorders (FASD) result in lifelong disability and are a leading cause&#xD;
      of preventable birth defects in the US. Urban American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) young&#xD;
      women are at high risk for alcohol exposed pregnancies (AEPs) which can cause FASD. In this&#xD;
      project, the inverstigators will test the effectiveness of a culturally adapted mobile health&#xD;
      intervention to prevent AEP, using social media to recruit AIAN young women from urban&#xD;
      centers across the nation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project builds on a prior NIAAA-funded project which used intensive&#xD;
      community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods to adapt CHOICES, an evidence-based&#xD;
      brief alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) prevention intervention supported by the CDC, to&#xD;
      American Indian Youth CHOICES (AIY-C). AIY-C contains features that make it highly amenable&#xD;
      to mHealth approaches, including a framework for integrating diverse cultural teachings, few&#xD;
      modules of short duration, and concrete opportunities for goal-setting and achievement.&#xD;
      Innovative for this population is the plan to recruit young AIAN women from major urban areas&#xD;
      in the US through social media-and to deliver AIY-C via mobile devices, increasingly&#xD;
      ubiquitous among AIAN young adults. While social media recruitment and mHealth interventions&#xD;
      are not new, only very recently have they been used with AIAN populations. The investigators&#xD;
      will partner with urban AIAN organizations to guide us through social media recruitment&#xD;
      strategies, mHealth intervention translation and implementation, and evaluation in urban AIAN&#xD;
      settings. The investigators propose 3 specific aims: (1) Develop and pilot social-media-based&#xD;
      recruitment strategies for urban AIAN young women; (2) translate AIY-C for mHealth delivery&#xD;
      through an iterative and theoretically driven process and pilot the developed translated&#xD;
      mHealth AIY-C intervention; and (3) recruit 700 (final N=525) urban AIAN young women using&#xD;
      identified social media strategies, and conduct an RCT to rigorously evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the mHealth translation of AIY-C for preventing AEP and FASD.&#xD;
