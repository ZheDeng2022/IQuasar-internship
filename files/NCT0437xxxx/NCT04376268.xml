  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical removal of impacted third molars is one of the most frequent procedures carried out&#xD;
      in the oral and maxillofacial surgery clinics. There are a varying range of postoperative&#xD;
      complications including pain, edema and swelling. Antibiotics, analgesics and mouthwashes are&#xD;
      usually prescribed for the treatment of these complications. Patients undergoing impacted&#xD;
      third molar surgery are frequently prescribed chlorhexidine mouthwashes with/without&#xD;
      benzydamine hydrochloride. However, there has been a search for alternatives with&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and analgesic properties as part of the oral care routine&#xD;
      following surgical removal of impacted third molars. Thus, this multicenter study was aimed&#xD;
      to evaluate the effects of chlorhexidine mouthwashes with different boric acid concentrations&#xD;
      (%0.1, %0.5, %1, %1.5, %2 and %2.5), and boric acid mountwash on the postoperative&#xD;
      complications and compared with chlorhexidine mouthwash after the removal of impacted wisdom&#xD;
      teeth.&#xD;

    <description>In order to evaluate the postoperative pain, a seven-day scheduled pain diary was given to the patients. To record the level of pain, patients were instructed to rate it on a 10-cm visual analog scales (VAS) was used wherein 0 indicated no pain and 10 indicated the worst pain imaginable.</description>

    <description>Facial swelling was assessed using thread and millimeter ruler and five following measurements were taken: Distance I (from angle of the mandible to labial commissure); Distance II (from angle of the mandible to nasal border); Distance III (from angle of the mandible to external corner of the eye); Distance IV (from angle of the mandible to tragus) and Distance V (from angle of the mandible to soft pogonion).</description>

    <description>The maximum mouth opening (MMO) was measured in millimeters with a caliper from the incisal edge of the right upper and lower incisor teeth. For evaluation of trismus, the percentage of difference in MMO during postoperative period was calculated by subtracting the preoperative measurement from the postoperative measurement then divided by the preoperative measurement and multiplied by 100.</description>

    <description>After anesthesia, the horizontal incision was made with no. 15 scalpel blade and a full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was raised. In all surgical procedures, bone removal and/or tooth sectioning were performed under abundant irrigation. Following the extraction, granulation tissues were removed, and post extraction cavity was irrigated with sterile 0.9% saline solution. After the bleeding was controlled, the mucoperiosteal flap was repositioned by 3.0 silk sutures. The patients were postoperatively prescribed paracetamol (Parol® 500 mg, Atabay Chemical Industry, Istanbul, Turkey) to use when required with a maximum of 4 doses per day. Patients were instructed to maintain a soft diet, and refrain from mouth washing, brushing and flossing during the first 24 hour. They were also instructed to rinse their mouth with 15 ml of mouthwash for 30 seconds, 3 times a day, and continue until the 7th postoperative day.</description>
