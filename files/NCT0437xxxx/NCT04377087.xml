  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if delaying the start of the olaparib until there is a&#xD;
      rise in a tumor marker called CA-125 will result in a longer time until the next or different&#xD;
      treatment for the patient's cancer. The study will also evaluate how delaying the start of&#xD;
      maintenance therapy will affect symptoms; physical functioning; quality of life; and impact&#xD;
      on finances.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II trial will investigate if waiting until the time of chemical recurrence,&#xD;
      denoted by rising CA125, to start a PARP inhibitor will lead to an improved time to next&#xD;
      therapy with improved quality of life and at a lower financial toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARP-I have shown efficacy as both monotherapy and as maintenance therapy. This trial will&#xD;
      explore whether patients with recurrent ovarian cancer could derive the same efficacy benefit&#xD;
      from a delayed start of a PARP-I compared to immediate maintenance therapy. Delayed start&#xD;
      would have the benefit of sparing the physical, psychological, and financial toxicity&#xD;
      associated with prolonged treatment. This approach would be particularly relevant in a&#xD;
      population of platinum-sensitive patients who can have prolonged treatment-free intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With widespread use of PARP-I, regardless of timing, understanding, and overcoming PARP-I&#xD;
      resistance is becoming a major clinical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will start within 8 weeks of completion of platinum-based treatment. Monitored&#xD;
      with CA 125 levels every 28 days. Olaparib will be started when CA 125 rises by two-fold of&#xD;
      their nadir value. Olaparib will be dosed at 300 mg orally twice a day, 28 days of treatment&#xD;
      will be a cycle. Follow-up will consist of CA125 drawn every 28 days and CT scans obtained at&#xD;
      doubling of CA- 125 and then every 12 weeks* to assess for recurrence or progression.&#xD;
      Clinician- and patient-reported adverse events recorded every 28 days. Cancer-related worry&#xD;
      and distress assessed every 28 days. Measures of quality of life and physical function, and&#xD;
      financial toxicity assessed every 12 weeks.&#xD;
