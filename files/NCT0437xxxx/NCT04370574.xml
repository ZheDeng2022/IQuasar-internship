  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains among cancers with a very poor prognosis&#xD;
      (1-year survival &lt;20%). Endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration (EUS/FNA) is the&#xD;
      common examination for all patients with suspicious pancreatic mass. A method was recently&#xD;
      developed : it preserves the sanitary sample, named EXPEL, which allows standard pathology&#xD;
      examination and OMICS analyzes from the &quot;rinse&quot; liquid. After EUS/FNA in clinical practice,&#xD;
      the content of the needle is rinsed in CytoLyt® preservative solution. After cytofiltration,&#xD;
      this liquid is systematically discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the EXPEL concept, we hypothesise that this all-patients inclusive approach&#xD;
      (&quot;Modified EXPEL&quot; procedure) combined with the methodology to access proteomic and&#xD;
      metabolomics information in these original samples will allow us to identify a series of&#xD;
      clinically useful marker signatures that will ultimately be measurable, non-invasively, in&#xD;
      the patient blood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical and pathological data will be prospectively collected to obtain 2 subgroups: PDAC&#xD;
      and non-PDAC according to the final biopsy diagnosis. A combined quantitative analysis of the&#xD;
      proteins and their peptides contained in CytoLyt® will be performed. ROC curves, AUC,&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value associated&#xD;
      to biomarkers will be calculated to isolate combinations of diagnostic biomarkers. Candidate&#xD;
      biomarkers will be validated by immunohistochemistry and multiple reaction monitoring.&#xD;
      Prognostic biomarkers will be evaluated by generating 1-year overall survival curves and Cox&#xD;
      regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present research, modeled on current practice, employs novel and holistic approach -&#xD;
      PANEXPEL methodology - to establish a new repertoire of biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. We&#xD;
      intent to provide a comprehensive proteomic and metabolomics biomarker signature that will be&#xD;
      measurable in the patient blood using common clinical methods. The potential for translation&#xD;
      &quot;from benchside to bedside&quot; is especially high due to the involvement of clinical teams. We&#xD;
      expect to propose a combined, robust protein/metabolite biomarker signature that can be&#xD;
      rapidly tested in the clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Necessary biological resources: Biological resources will include Cytolyt® and Blood Samples,&#xD;
      accompanied by a signed Free and Informed Consent for each included patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CytoLyt® fluid will be first processed by Pathology Dept. of the CHU for routine PDAC&#xD;
           diagnosis. In essence, the samples are filtered, tissue fragments and cells are kept for&#xD;
           analysis while flow-through is kept until the diagnosis is confirmed. Once this is&#xD;
           completed, the samples will be transferred to the lab where the proteins found in the&#xD;
           CytoLytR fluid will be precipitated and then solubilized. The protein extracts are&#xD;
           stored at -80°C pending proteomic analysis. The remaining CytoLytR fluid supernatant is&#xD;
           also stored at - 80°C to be used for metabolomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood sample will be collected from each patient that underwent diagnostic biopsy. Dry&#xD;
           tube for serum analysis 5 ml will be collected at the time of inclusion during the&#xD;
           routine blood test (mandatory assessment pre-operative or pre-chemotherapy). The blood&#xD;
           sample is centrifuged at 1500xg for 15 minutes while the resulting sera are aliquoted&#xD;
           (500μl/aliquot; 4-5 aliquots per patient) and stored at -80°C. These samples will be&#xD;
           stored at Biologic Resources Center (CRB Montpellier) that is labelled NF-S-96900&#xD;
           (AFNOR). The serum samples are intended for the validation phase (WP4) and will be&#xD;
           exclusively dedicated to this study.&#xD;
