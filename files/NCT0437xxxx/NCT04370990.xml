  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is associated with high morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      The Danish Lung Association estimates that 320,000 Danes live with COPD, of which&#xD;
      approximately 50,000 with severe COPD. In 2017, records showed that 23,979 admissions in&#xD;
      Denmark were related to COPD; of these patients, about 20% were readmitted 2-30 days after&#xD;
      discharge. The main symptom is dyspnea, which is often accompanied by anxiety. Primary&#xD;
      treatment is; oxygen, bronchiolitis, prednisolone, morfica, NIV, and anxiolytics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers at Hvidovre Hospital have developed an oxygen robot that continuously monitors&#xD;
      the patient's SaO2 (oxygen saturation) and automatically administrates the oxygen depending&#xD;
      on it. The preliminary results show that patients with robot-administrated oxygen were within&#xD;
      defined SaO2 range in 85.7% of the time versus 46.6% when oxygen was nurse-administrated. The&#xD;
      research was conducted as a multicentre Randomized Controlled Trial focusing on physiological&#xD;
      end-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a lack of knowledge about the patient perspective of treatment with the oxygen&#xD;
      robot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To examine the effect of robot-administered oxygen on patients' perception of dyspnoea,&#xD;
      including the emotional response in the form of anxiety and depression&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perspective is to be able to provide a holistic response to whether robot-administered&#xD;
      oxygen can be a better method of treating and alleviating dyspnoea.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a high prevalence disease and is associated&#xD;
      with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. In 2017, there were 23.979 COPD related&#xD;
      admissions in Denmark, approximately 10% died during hospitalization, while 20% of survivors&#xD;
      were readmitted between day 2-30 after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with COPD often experience long disease trajectories characterized by a substantial&#xD;
      burden of symptoms, impaired functional status, multiple admissions and thereby reduced&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cardinal symptom dyspnea is associated with hypoxemia, anxiety and depression. Evidence&#xD;
      shows that depression is a significant risk factor for disabling dyspnea, while risk of&#xD;
      anxiety increases with the severity of Dyspnea. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is&#xD;
      indicated to lie between 10%-55% and 10%-86% in patients hospitalized with COPD in&#xD;
      exacerbation . Patients with COPD have an 85% increased risk of developing anxiety compared&#xD;
      to a matching control group without COPD. The prevalence of anxiety is 10 times higher among&#xD;
      patients with COPD than in the background population and are strongly associated with the&#xD;
      risk of hospitalization, long admissions, readmissions and death. Anxiety and depression are&#xD;
      often treated with benzodiazepines which have a respiratory suppressive effect. Consumption&#xD;
      of benzodiazepines increases disease progression, and studies have shown that 31.7% of&#xD;
      patients with COPD have a benzodiazepine consumption and that 9% initiate a new&#xD;
      benzodiazepine ordination in conjunction with an exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidence that oxygen prevents disease progression and mortality is consistent, but there&#xD;
      is a lack of knowledge about whether oxygen, can reduce the intensity of dyspnea in patients&#xD;
      with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the acute phase of an exacerbation the oxygen flow is titrated to achieve a SaO2 between&#xD;
      88-92%. Keeping patients with COPD within the given SaO2 range is essential because too low&#xD;
      SaO2 can induce tissue damage, heart overload and difficulty concentrating, while&#xD;
      hyperoxaemia can inhibit respiration and increase the risk of hypercapnia, acidosis and the&#xD;
      need for ventilatory support in the form of Non-invasive Ventilation (NIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, oxygen flow is administered and titrated, via aggregates, by nurses&#xD;
      based on point observations, with the risk of patients being outside optimal SaO2 range,&#xD;
      between observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve practice, a group of researchers at Hvidovre Hospital has developed an oxygen&#xD;
      robot, called O2matic, which continuously monitors the patient's SaO2 and automatically&#xD;
      administrates oxygenflow according to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      O2Matic has been tested in a randomized controlled trial in 2018. Patients admitted with an&#xD;
      exacerbation of COPD and hypoxemia (SaO2 ≤ 88%) was included (N = 19). The design was&#xD;
      crossover and patients were allocated to either 4 hours of manual oxygen administration via&#xD;
      nurse followed by 4 hours of oxygen administration via O2Matic, or vice versa. The study&#xD;
      showed that patients with O2matic controlled oxygen administration were within defined SaO2&#xD;
      range in 85.7% of the time versus 46,6% of the time when the oxygen was controlled and&#xD;
      administrated by a nurse . These results are in consensus with a former Canadian study&#xD;
      testing an alternative oxygen robot (FreeO2). The two RCT Studies provide evidence to&#xD;
      investigate robot-administered oxygen therapy for inpatient patients with exacerbation of&#xD;
      COPD in a larger multicenter RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyspnea is defined as; &quot;A subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consist of&#xD;
      qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity&quot;. The experience of dyspnea is a&#xD;
      product of a physical perception based on signals from the body to the brain followed by the&#xD;
      cognitive processing of these into an emotional experience. Dyspnea is thus an emotional and&#xD;
      sensational experience based on perceptual afferent feedback from various respiratory&#xD;
      receptors. Up to 16 possible mechanisms are involved in the process . Given the above,&#xD;
      dyspnea is a complex symptom, mainly induced by the body's attempts to obtain homeostasis,&#xD;
      when subjected to hypoxemia. Despite this dyspnea is not the same as hypoxemia, as it has not&#xD;
      been clearly demonstrated that reduced hypoxemia, by oxygen therapy also reduces Dyspnea.&#xD;
      However, there are indications in the literature that oxygen therapy can reduce the&#xD;
      experience of dyspnea. A significant barrier to the use of oxygen therapy as an intervention&#xD;
      on fragmentary dyspnea in patients with COPD is the risk of hypercapnia and acidosis. Oxygen&#xD;
      therapy administrated according to saturation in a closed-loop-feedback-system by a robot,&#xD;
      could potentially be an intervention to relieve fragmentary dyspnea in patients with COPD.&#xD;
      International guidelines show that dyspnea is not treated consistently nor effectively in the&#xD;
      advanced stages of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioids are one of the most widely used agents in the treatments of dyspnea. Opioids&#xD;
      suppress' respiration and treatment should be balanced to avoid respiratory depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines points out the importance of identifying and graduate the intensity of dyspnea in&#xD;
      clinical practice, without indicating any superior instruments to achieve this. Majority of&#xD;
      instruments developed, describe dyspnea in relation to activity. As COPD progress, dyspnea&#xD;
      intensifies and patients will become more inactive and often live a sedentary life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few questionnaires measure the sensory and emotional domains of dyspnea independently of&#xD;
      activity and diagnose. One is the multidimensional Dyspnoea profile (MDP) that has currently&#xD;
      been translated into Danish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reduce symptom burden, length of hospital stay, number of re-admissions and&#xD;
      mortality, new knowledge and more effective methods for treating and alleviating dyspnea and&#xD;
      the associated anxiety and depression are needed in patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies investigating the effect of oxygen therapy, including time with and degree of&#xD;
      hypoxemia, in hypoxemic patients experiencing dyspnea, anxiety or depression during&#xD;
      hospitalization with acute exacerbation, could not be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because O2matic provides a new and unique opportunity to reduce and illuminate time with&#xD;
      hypoxemia during hospitalization and patient's subjective experience of the sensory and&#xD;
      emotional aspects of dyspnea can be reported on a validated questionnaire via MDP, the&#xD;
      investigators now have an option to investigate if a robot intervention, that reduces time&#xD;
      with hypoxemia, has an effect on dyspnea in patients admitted with a exacerbation of COPD.&#xD;
      Furthermore, investigators want to examine whether this intervention alters the consumption&#xD;
      of opioids and benzodiazepines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis. Robot-administered oxygen reduces the perception of dyspnea measured at&#xD;
      scale A1 on the multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP), in patients with COPD and hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective. To investigate if oxygen administration by O2matic has an effect on the&#xD;
      perception of dyspnea in patients admitted with an exacerbation of COPD and hypoxemia, versus&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Global dyspnea measured on scale A1 on multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP) Secondary&#xD;
