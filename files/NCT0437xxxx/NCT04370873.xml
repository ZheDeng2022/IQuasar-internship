  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess MK-5475 in the PH-COPD population by evaluating&#xD;
      the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), changes in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and&#xD;
      changes in pulmonary blood volume (PBV) after administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study hypothesis is that the MK-5475 results in superior reduction of the mean&#xD;
      PVH following 28 days of dosing compared to placebo in participants with PH-COPD.&#xD;
