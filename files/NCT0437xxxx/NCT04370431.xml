  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is integrated Phase 1, Single centre, Randomized study will be conducted in 3 parts,&#xD;
      each with a specific primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: To characterise the safety and tolerability of TTYP01 in healthy adult subjects; Part&#xD;
      B: To evaluate the bioavailability of TTYP01 tablets in healthy adult subjects; Part C: To&#xD;
      characterise the food effect of TTYP01 tablets in healthy adult subjects under the fasted or&#xD;
      fed condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of&#xD;
      TTYP01 tablets in healthy adult subjects, and the effects of gender on the PK of TTYP01&#xD;
      tablets in healthy adults. In Part A of the study, a total of 32 healthy adult subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled over four consecutive cohorts (8 per cohort), with participants receiving a&#xD;
      single dose of TTYP01 at one of four levels (60, 120, 10 or 240 mg), to assess the PK and&#xD;
      safety of TTYP01. In Part B, 16 healthy adults will be randomized into 2 groups, and the&#xD;
      comparison of the PK of edaravone (TTYP01 and intravenous (IV) edaravone) will be evaluated&#xD;
      using a randomized, open-label, four-period crossover design under fasted conditions. In the&#xD;
      first crossover period, subjects will receive a single fixed dose of TTYP01 followed by the&#xD;
      alternate IV dose after completion of the washout phase, and in the second crossover period,&#xD;
      subjects will receive a higher fixed dose of TTYP01 followed by the alternate IV dose after&#xD;
      completion of the washout phase. In Part C, 18 healthy subjects will be enrolled to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of food on the PK of TTYP01 using a randomized, open-label, two-period cross-over&#xD;
      design. Participants will be randomized into two groups and administered a fixed dose of&#xD;
      TTYP01 on Day 1 (Period 1) under the fed conditions and the second dosing day (Period 2)&#xD;
      under the fasted conditions, while the other group being administered a fixed dose of TTYP01&#xD;
      on Day 1 (Period 1) under the fasted conditions and the second dosing day (Period 2) under&#xD;
      the fed conditions.&#xD;
