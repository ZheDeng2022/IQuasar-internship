      This study will be a 2-period study conducted with 26 healthy male or female subjects.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to either receive a single dose of surufatinib with food&#xD;
      in period 1, then without food in period 2, or vice-versa.&#xD;

      This study will be a single center, open label, randomized crossover, 2-period study&#xD;
      conducted with 26 healthy male or female subjects. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of&#xD;
      the 2 possible treatment sequences as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fed/Fasted: surufatinib with food on Day 1 and surufatinib without food on Day 8&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting/Fed: surufatinib without food on Day 1 and surufatinib with food on Day 8&#xD;
