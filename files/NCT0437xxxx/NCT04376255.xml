  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to improve the quality of care we provide to patients, medical trainees need to&#xD;
      experience low incident, high mortality events in a safe learning environment. There is a&#xD;
      selection bias for predisposing characteristics of health care providers, as most people who&#xD;
      have pursued a career in medicine are motivated to learn how to manage medical emergencies.&#xD;
      Resources have been traditionally enabled with conventional simulation centers or mobile&#xD;
      simulation units. However, these are costly and difficult to access. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate a mixed reality alternative to conventional simulation. The need for&#xD;
      this is inherent in becoming a medical provider and use of these resources will improve&#xD;
      health practices and health services.&#xD;
