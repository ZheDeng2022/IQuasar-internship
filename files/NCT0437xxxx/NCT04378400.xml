      An institutional audit of the short term complications and long term outcomes of patients&#xD;
      undergoing laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy for vault/cervical prolapse.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to audit the outcomes of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy procedures done&#xD;
      in our unit. The investigators aim to permanently monitor outcomes of this procedure&#xD;
      correcting vaginal vault prolapse or cervical descent. Auditing institutional performance&#xD;
      with pelvic floor procedures is increasingly being required by (inter)national societies in&#xD;
      pelvic floor medicine, so that patients can be counseled on outcomes they can expect at a&#xD;
      given institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sacrocolpopexy is offered to patients with symptomatic prolapse (≥stage II) of the vaginal&#xD;
      apex (vault or cervix). The procedure involves dissection of the promontory and the vaginal&#xD;
      vault, suturing of two meshes to the anterior and posterior aspect of the vagina using&#xD;
      minimally three rows of sutures on each side, and one row at the apex. Thereafter the mesh is&#xD;
      fixed with staples to the promontory and the peritoneum closed, with staples and a running&#xD;
      suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators started auditing this procedure 20 years ago because of the conversion to&#xD;
      laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High anatomical and subjective cure rates are reported on the medium term (range 12-60&#xD;
      months), though long-term data (60 months or longer) are scarce and most studies focus on&#xD;
      anatomical outcomes.4 The investigators recently published medium term outcomes of patients&#xD;
      operated up to 2014 1. Now the aim is to extend this audit to patients operated since 2014&#xD;
      and install a process of permanent monitoring our performance with this operation. The&#xD;
      investigators also want to use the availability of outcomes in large numbers and/or the long&#xD;
      term, to detect potential rare or long term complications, and study the effects of small&#xD;
      technical increments such as extending dissections, associate other pelvic floor&#xD;
      reconstructive procedures or the change in bio-materials used for this operation. All these&#xD;
      may affect outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is a subjective outcome, using a patient-centered approach and report patient&#xD;
      reported out-comes. Additional outcomes such as anatomical failure, or complications, both by&#xD;
      occurrence and time point, re-interventions, and pelvic floor functional outcomes are&#xD;
      secondary outcomes that allows the investigators to benchmark their performance to previous&#xD;
      studies and other series. Key in an objective assessment process is that patients are&#xD;
      examined by an experienced clinician not involved in the management, which will also be used&#xD;
      herein.&#xD;

    <measure>Subjective Success Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective Success assessed by the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) tool, which is a 5-point Likert scale, where the patients are asked the following question at the follow up visit: &quot;Compared with how you were doing before your recent pelvic floor operation, would you say that now you are: &quot;much better&quot;, &quot;a little better&quot;, &quot;about the same&quot;, &quot;a little worse&quot; or &quot;much worse&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective success</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Objective Success will be defined as: achievement of a POP-Q score Stage ≤1, without re-intervention for POP or graft related complication at approximately 12 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative complications</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Occurrence of operative complications: classified as either intra-operative or postoperative (within 3 months of operation), and according to the Dindo classification, as we earlier did.</description>

    <measure>Reintervention rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years postoperative</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Up to 10 years postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative graft related complications (GRC) out of a (non-limitative) list of de novo dyspareunia, worsening of pre-existing dyspareunia, incidence of chronic pain, occurrence of exposure, extrusion or any other complication and any reintervention because of the above. GRC will be categorized according to the IUGA classification</description>

    <measure>Prolapse Quality of Life (P-QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>P-QoL: self-reported severity of symptoms in patients with urogenital prolapse and their impact on 9 different quality of life domains with scores for each domain, ranging between 0 and 100. Higher scores indicate a greater impairment of quality of life. This has been validated for the Flemish population</description>

        Since our last audit (April 30, 2014), we have operated on more than probably another 250&#xD;
        patients, who will be contacted. Based on our previous experience, we expect a 85% response&#xD;
        rate.&#xD;
