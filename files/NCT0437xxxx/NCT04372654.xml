    <textblock>
      During percutaneous cardiovascular intervention, temporary cardiac stimulation may be&#xD;
      required. Usually this stimulation is generated via a temporary pacing catheter. In order to&#xD;
      reduce the complexity of the procedure, a new stimulation strategy has been developed: the&#xD;
      &quot;Direct Wire Pacing technique&quot;.In this approach, the cardiac stimulation is provided via the&#xD;
      guidewire connected to an external pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous study demonstrated the superiority of the new technique compared to the former.&#xD;
      However this technique is likely to generate electrical pain, risk of bleeding for the&#xD;
      patient and risk of blood exposure accident for the operators. This is why the medical device&#xD;
      ELECTRODUCER SLEEVE has been developed. This device integrates a pacing function to the&#xD;
      introducer and the guidewire used. The &quot;Direct Wire Pacing technique&quot; is simplified, secured&#xD;
      and more reproducible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During percutaneous cardiovascular interventions such as Transcatheter Heart Valve or&#xD;
      coronary intervention, temporary cardiac stimulation may be required. Usually this&#xD;
      stimulation is generated via a temporary pacing catheter in the right ventricle. This&#xD;
      procedure requires an additional venous access and the insertion of the stimulation catheter,&#xD;
      which are both likely to generate complications. In order to reduce the complexity and&#xD;
      increase the safety of the procedure, a new stimulation strategy has been developed: the&#xD;
      &quot;Direct Wire Pacing technique&quot;. In this approach, the specific venous access and the&#xD;
      implantation of a stimulation catheter are avoided. The cardiac stimulation is provided via&#xD;
      the guidewire inserted into the left ventricle or into the coronary arteries. This guidewire&#xD;
      is connected to an external Pacemaker using an alligator clamp (Cathode). The Pacemaker anode&#xD;
      is also connected using a clamp attached to a needle piercing the subcutaneous tissue,&#xD;
      obtaining a closed electrical circuit. This technique was validated during previous studies&#xD;
      in the TAVI context through two registries and one randomized controlled trial. This study&#xD;
      demonstrated the superiority of the new technique by showing a reduction of the procedural&#xD;
      duration, radiation exposure and costs; with similar efficacy and safety. However the&#xD;
      subcutaneous needle insertion is likely to generate electrical pain, risk of bleeding for the&#xD;
      patient and risk of blood exposure accident for the operators. This subcutaneous anode&#xD;
      increases the stimulation threshold (mA) which can cause stimulation failures. Moreover,&#xD;
      several technical difficulties preclude general adoption by the scientific community. This is&#xD;
      why the medical device ELECTRODUCER SLEEVE has been developed. This device integrates a&#xD;
      pacing function to the introducer and the guidewire used during percutaneous cardiovascular&#xD;
      interventions. The guidewire then behaves like an intra-cardiac cathode. Thanks to the&#xD;
      device, the complex manipulation of needles and clamps during the intervention are avoided as&#xD;
      well as pole inversions. The &quot;Direct Wire Pacing technique&quot; used during the coronary and&#xD;
      structural interventions is thus simplified, secured and more reproducible.&#xD;
