  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury increases the risk for chronic kidney disease, length of stay,&#xD;
      readmissions and mortality. Currently the only way to diagnose acute kidney injury is with a&#xD;
      serum creatinine or drop in urine output. Biomarkers for acute kidney injury are well&#xD;
      elevated before rise in creatinine. Hypothesis is that by implementing an electronic alert&#xD;
      system with an algorithm followed by remote ischemic preconditioning will prevent acute&#xD;
      kidney injury.&#xD;

      The propose study is to incorporate an alert system in current medical health system and an&#xD;
      algorithm will be used to activate clinicians and Nephrologist to confirm if patient is at&#xD;
      high risk. Once identified as high risk the clinician and/or nephrologist will intervene and&#xD;
      change current management if needed. First phase of study will look at an alert system and&#xD;
      algorithm was enough to lower incidence of acute kidney injury. Phase 2 will also use alert&#xD;
      system and algorithm that will be further randomized those that are identified as high risk&#xD;
      for acute kidney injury to remote ischemic preconditioning.&#xD;
