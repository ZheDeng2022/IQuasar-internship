      This phase I/IIa trial studies the best dose and side effects of rintatolimod and interferon&#xD;
      (IFN) alpha-2b in treating cancer patients with COVID-19 infection. Interferon alpha is a&#xD;
      protein important for defense against viruses. It activates immune responses that help to&#xD;
      clear viral infection. Rintatolimod is double stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) designed to&#xD;
      mimic viral infection by stimulating immune pathways that are normally activated during viral&#xD;
      infection. Giving rintatolimod and interferon alpha-2b may activate the immune system to&#xD;
      limit the replication and spread of the virus.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety of the combination of intravenous (i.v.) rintatolimod administered&#xD;
      with or without i.v. IFN alpha (recombinant interferon alfa-2b [Intron A]) in patients with&#xD;
      cancer with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the kinetics of viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs in the course of treatment&#xD;
      and Days 7 and 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy of the treatment combination in patients with cancer with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the kinetics of viral load in the peripheral blood in the course of treatment&#xD;
      and Days 7 and 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the kinetics of changes of the immune subsets and circulating inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators (including C-reactive protein [CRP], cytokines, chemokines, interferons) in&#xD;
      peripheral blood in the course of treatment and Days 7 and 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the induction of known mediators of antiviral immunity that include (myxovirus&#xD;
      resistance gene, MxA; protein Kinase R (PKR); oligoadenylate synthetase-2 (OAS2); RNAse-L,&#xD;
      IFN-stimulated gene-15 (ISG15); IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT1)&#xD;
      and IFN-inducible transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), TLR3, RIG-I, MDA5, IRF3, IRF7, in&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swabs material and blood cells of patients on all tiers of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of recombinant interferon alfa-2b followed&#xD;
      by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEAD-IN PHASE: Patients receive rintatolimod IV over 2.5-3 hours on day 1 and day 3 (or 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive rintatolimod IV over 2.5-3 hours and recombinant interferon alfa-2b&#xD;
      IV over 20 minutes on day 1 and on day 3 or 4 in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPANSION COHORT: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Patients receive rintatolimod IV over 2.5-3 hours once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM IV: Patients receive standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed up at days 7, 14 and 30 after initiation of the study regimen.&#xD;
