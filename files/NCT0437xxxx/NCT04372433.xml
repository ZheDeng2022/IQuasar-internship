&#xD;
         21. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or&#xD;
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia patients or patients with known Philadelphia chromosome&#xD;
