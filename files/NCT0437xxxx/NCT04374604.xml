    <textblock>
      Background: Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality worldwide, and it affects 3% to 8% of all pregnancies. Maternal and perinatal&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality resulting from preeclampsia are due to its complications. Clinical&#xD;
      prediction of complications associated with preeclampsia may facilitate initiation of timely&#xD;
      management to reduce or avert adverse outcomes associated with the condition. Studies on&#xD;
      current biomarkers (proteinuria or uric acid) have shown poor performance in the prediction&#xD;
      of adverse pregnancy outcomes in preeclamptic women. Placental growth factor (PlGF) is an&#xD;
      angiogenic growth factor that is exclusively produced by the trophoblast. Circulating levels&#xD;
      of placental growth factor have been reported to be reduced in women with preeclampsia.&#xD;
      Therefore there is a need to evaluate the predictive performance on adverse pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes of this pregnancy specific biomaker among preeclamptic women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To determine the predictive accuracy of maternal serum PlGF level for adverse pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes in preeclamptic women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Method: It is a prospective cohort study that will be conducted on 110 women&#xD;
      that will be admitted for preeclampsia in the Federal Teaching Hospital and Saint Patrick&#xD;
      Mile 4 Hospital Abakaliki. On admission women who will give informed consent will have their&#xD;
      blood sample collected. The sample will be analysed using Enzyme linked Immunosorbent Assay&#xD;
      technique to determine the level of PlGF (pg/ml). All the study participants will be followed&#xD;
      up until delivery. The socio-demographic characteristics and maternal and perinatal adverse&#xD;
      outcomes will be entered into a proforma. Data will be entered and analyzed using SPSS&#xD;
      version 22.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength and limitation: The strength of the study is that a single biomaker, PlGF, will be&#xD;
      assayed and the test will be performed once, which is cost-saving. The limitation of this&#xD;
      study is that there would not be long term follow up of participants after hospital discharge&#xD;
      and so complications that will occur after discharge will not be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: Considering the contribution of preeclampsia to maternal morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      in Abakaliki and poor predictive performance of available biochemical markers on adverse&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes among preeclamptic women, there is need to conduct this study so as to&#xD;
      ascertain the utility of PlGF in predicting adverse outcome among preeclamptic women in&#xD;
      Abakaliki.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Despite advances in care, preeclampsia remains a leading cause of maternal and&#xD;
      perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide and its syndromic nature makes diagnosis and&#xD;
      management difficult.1 Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-specific syndrome, defined by new&#xD;
      onset hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation.2 It complicates 2-8% of&#xD;
      pregnancies and accounts for more than 50,000 maternal death annually.2,3 In developing&#xD;
      countries, where lack of access to appropriate maternal care is a major problem, maternal&#xD;
      death rates are as high as 15% as compared with 0% to 1.8% in industrialized countries.1 A&#xD;
      10-year review of maternal mortality in Ebonyi state University Teaching Hospital showed that&#xD;
      PE and eclampsia accounted for 6.1% of maternal death.4 Preeclampsia affects multiple organ&#xD;
      systems and can lead to severe maternal and fetal complications.5-10 Maternal and perinatal&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality resulting from PE are due to its complications.6-8 Maternal&#xD;
      complications include eclampsia, cerebrovascular accident, placental abruption, disseminated&#xD;
      intravascular coagulation, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome,&#xD;
      liver hemorrhage or rupture, pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome, acute&#xD;
      renal failure, and death. Perinatal consequences include stillbirth, preterm delivery, fetal&#xD;
      growth restriction (FGR), and neonatal death.5-10 The only curative treatment for PE is&#xD;
      delivery of the placenta.9-13 The challenge in caring for women with PE is to identify those&#xD;
      who are at increased risk of complications so that appropriate and timely delivery can be&#xD;
      offered.14 Most of the symptoms associated with PE are common and nonspecific, which can lead&#xD;
      to poor predictability of adverse outcomes.15 Moreover, the capacity to predict adverse&#xD;
      maternal and perinatal outcomes remains poor.15 Recognition of those patients at risk of&#xD;
      adverse outcomes related to PE can reduce or avert maternal and perinatal morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality associated with the condition.16 Currently available biochemical makers such as&#xD;
      proteinuria and uric acid have been shown to be poor predictors of adverse pregnancy outcomes&#xD;
      in preeclamptic women.16-20 This suggests that a clinical diagnostic test able to predict&#xD;
      maternal and fetal risk could be useful. Among biochemical markers, attention has recently&#xD;
      focused on angiogenic factors, such as PlGF. Placental growth factor is an angiogenic growth&#xD;
      factor related to vascular endothelial growth factor that is exclusively produced by the&#xD;
      trophoblast.18 A growing body of evidence suggests that an imbalance of&#xD;
      angiogenic/anti-angiogenic factors are involved in the pathophysiology of PE.18 Studies on&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of PE support the hypothesis of a pathogenetic model of defective&#xD;
      placentation resulting from reduced concentrations of angiogenic growth factors (free PlGF)&#xD;
      and increased concentrations of anti-angiogenic factors such as soluble Fms-like tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase-1 (sFlt-1).16-24 The majority of studies of PlGF testing have focused on either&#xD;
      prediction of PE or confirmation of the diagnosis once PE is suspected. Even though this&#xD;
      biomarker has excellent predictive value for PE, a major issue is that there is no clear&#xD;
      intervention that can prevent the subsequent development of the disease. Several preventive&#xD;
      measures such as supplementation with vitamin C and vitamin E, aspirin, or calcium fail to&#xD;
      consistently prevent subsequent development of PE.19 Thus, the value remains either a&#xD;
      &quot;research procedure&quot; or a method of risk assessment to identify patients who may benefit from&#xD;
      more intensive surveillance. Currently studies are focused on evaluating the role of plasma&#xD;
      angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors in predicting the outcome of patients with PE. Studies&#xD;
      have shown a positive correlation between low maternal serum PlGF levels and adverse maternal&#xD;
      and fetal outcomes.21 These findings have led to speculation that PlGF might be useful in&#xD;
      both the prediction of PE and prognosis with respect to the occurrence of related adverse&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the contribution of PE to maternal morbidity and mortality in Abakaliki and poor&#xD;
      predictive accuracy of available biochemical markers on adverse pregnancy outcomes and the&#xD;
      search for better predictive maker of adverse outcomes among preeclamptic women, a study on&#xD;
      PlGF as a predictor of outcomes among preeclamptic women in Abakaliki is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 JUSTIFICATION FOR THE STUDY Preeclampsia has remained among the leading causes of&#xD;
      maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide.22 Maternal deaths resulting from PE are due to&#xD;
      complications associated with the condition.20-25 Clinical prediction of disease&#xD;
      complications may facilitate initiation of timely management to prevent morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in the mother and baby. The studies on current predictive biomarkers (proteinuria&#xD;
      or uric acid) of adverse outcomes among preeclamptic women have shown poor predictive&#xD;
      results.24 Hence there is a need for identification of highly specific and sensitive&#xD;
      biomarkers that would allow early identification of patients at risk and for prediction of&#xD;
      adverse outcomes for women who developed the condition and thus help in providing proper&#xD;
      prenatal care. Placental growth factor appears to be a promising tool in this regard.&#xD;
      Literature search showed that this study has not been done in Abakaliki. Hence, the outcome&#xD;
      of this study will help to make evidence based recommendations on the role of maternal serum&#xD;
      level of PlGF in the management of preeclamptic women in Abakaliki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 AIM AND OBJECTIVES AND RESEARCH QUESTION 3.1 AIM The aim of the study is to test the&#xD;
      predictive accuracy of maternal free PlGF concentration for pregnancy adverse outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with preeclampsia based on a single assay at the time of admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES To compare the mean serum level of PlGF among preeclamptic women with&#xD;
      and without adverse pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the relationship between the level of PlGF and adverse maternal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the association between serum PlGF level and adverse perinatal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the cut off value of PlGF associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the sensitivity and specificity of cut off value of PlGF associated with adverse&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 RESEARCH QUESTION Is maternal PlGF level predictive of adverse pregnancy outcomes in&#xD;
      preeclamptic women in the Federal Teaching Hospital and Saint Patrick Mile 4 Hospital&#xD;
      Abakaliki? 3.4 NULL HYPOTHESIS There is no association between maternal serum PlGF&#xD;
      concentration and adverse pregnancy outcomes in preeclamptic women 3.5 ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
      There is an association between maternal PlGF level and adverse pregnancy outcomes in&#xD;
      preeclamptic women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 METHODOLOGY 4.1 STUDY AREA This study will be done at the antenatal ward, labour ward,&#xD;
      postnatal ward and neonatal intensive care unit department of the Federal Teaching Hospital,&#xD;
      Abakaliki, Ebonyi State.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki is a federal tertiary health care institution located at&#xD;
      the state capital. It is a product of a merger of the former Federal Medical Centre,&#xD;
      Abakaliki and the then Ebonyi State University Teaching Hospital by the Federal Government of&#xD;
      Nigeria in 2011. The department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the hospital maintains&#xD;
      gynaecological emergency, antenatal clinic, antenatal ward, labour ward, theatre complex and&#xD;
      postnatal ward for both booked and unbooked patients. These are managed by Consultants and&#xD;
      Resident Doctors with trained Nurses and Midwives. There are 25 Consultants manning 5 units&#xD;
      in the department with an average of 5 Consultants per unit. The units run the antenatal and&#xD;
      gynaecological clinics on each of the working days of the week. In 2017, three thousand and&#xD;
      two hundred deliveries were taken and there were 204 cases of preeclampsia. The maternal&#xD;
      mortality ratio in a 10 year review of maternal death in the hospital was 1, 359 per 100,000&#xD;
      live births.4 Ebonyi State is one of the five states in the Southeast geopolitical zone of&#xD;
      Nigeria created in 1996 from the old Abakaliki division of Enugu State and old Afikpo&#xD;
      division of former Abia State. It has 13 local government areas with an estimated population&#xD;
      of about 4.3 million, with a land mass of approximately 5, 932 sq km.33 The state is bordered&#xD;
      in the north by Benue State, east by the Cross river Sate; south by Abia State and West by&#xD;
      Enugu state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 SAMPLING METHOD Total sampling method will be used for the study. All women diagnosed&#xD;
      with preeclampsia on admission who meet the inclusion criteria and give informed consent will&#xD;
      be recruited for the study. The study participants will be followed up until hospital&#xD;
      discharge after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 DIAGNOSIS OF PREECLAMPSIA Measurement of blood pressure: Upper arm blood pressure will be&#xD;
      measured by the researcher or research assistant using the Mercury Sphygmomanometer (ELKO B.P&#xD;
      APPARATUS) after the study participant has rested for 5 minutes. All of the participants will&#xD;
      be seated on a chair in an upright position with back support. A cuff will be placed around&#xD;
      the non-dominant upper arm, which will be supported at the level of the heart; with the&#xD;
      bladder of the cuff in the midline over the brachial artery pulsation. The systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressures will be determined by Korokoff I and V respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preeclampsia will be defined as hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg on ≥ 2 recordings taken ≥ 4 hours apart after 20 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation or a single measurement of systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg and/or diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure of 110 mmHg with proteinuria (≥ 2+ by dipstick).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION The sample size calculation was based on the formula N=Z^2 x&#xD;
      SD^2/d^2 Z1-α = Standard normal variate at 5% type 1 error (P&lt;0.05) is 1.96 SD = Standard&#xD;
      deviation of variable based on previous studies (The SD of PlGF value which preeclamptic&#xD;
      women were predicted to developed adverse pregnancy outcomes was 0.56. Note: 0.56 was derived&#xD;
      by getting the average SD of PlGF for developing adverse pregnancy outcomes from two previous&#xD;
      studies ).25,26 d = Absolute error or precision (set at 10%) Therefore, N= 120.5 Adding 10%&#xD;
      attrition rate which is approximately 12. Therefore the sample size is 140.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5 SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND TRANSPORT On admission women who give consent for the study will&#xD;
      have their urine and blood samples taken. Bed side urinalysis to know the degree of&#xD;
      proteinuria will be carried out by the researcher or research assistants using True-Screen&#xD;
      Combi 11 reagent strips (Lifesane Biotech, USA). The blood sample will be taken and&#xD;
      transferred to a universal specimen bottle and the specimen taken to the hospital laboratory&#xD;
      for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.6 SPECIMEN PROCESSING, STORAGE AND ANALYSIS At laboratory processing of the specimen will&#xD;
      be carried out by three medical laboratory scientists and the researcher. Assay will be&#xD;
      performed as soon as 40 samples are ready. Estimation of free PlGF levels will be done by&#xD;
      ELISA technique using the Human PlGF ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostics, Germany). The result of&#xD;
      the test will be reported in pg/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.7 QUALITY CONTROL Three medical laboratory scientists will be involved in the sample&#xD;
      analysis with the aid of the researcher under the supervision of a chemical pathologist.&#xD;
      Three laboratory scientists will be dedicated to sample analysis while the chemical&#xD;
      pathologist will occasionally test random samples to ensure that the results are&#xD;
      corresponding with results of the test samples from the other three.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.8 RESEARCH ASSISTANTS Research assistants comprise the 2 residents and 5 house officers&#xD;
      from each team and each assigned a specific role to play during the study period. There will&#xD;
      be three training sessions for the assistants during which the details of the study with the&#xD;
      role of each assistant will be explained. Retraining sessions may be done in the course of&#xD;
      the study if deemed necessary. Whatsapp chat group will be created for easy communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.9 DATA COLLECTION METHOD The data would be collected using a proforma that has four parts&#xD;
      which include the socio-demographic characteristics of the study participants, Blood&#xD;
      pressure, Urinalysis result, adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes and PlGF level. After&#xD;
      delivery, data proforma sheets will be completed for all participants before entering the&#xD;
      information into a database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.10 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The data analysis will be performed using the SPSS version 22.0&#xD;
      program for Windows (IBM Corp. Amork, New York, U.S.A). Categorical variables would be&#xD;
      presented as frequencies and percentages while continuous variables would be presented as&#xD;
      mean ± standard deviation. The mean PlGF values of women with and without adverse outcomes&#xD;
      will be compared using the Student's t-test. To determine the best cut off value of PlGF&#xD;
      (designated as X) for the prediction of adverse outcomes, the receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristic (ROC) curve analysis would be used and areas under the curve (AUC) calculated.&#xD;
      Logistic regression would be used to determine the association between the cut off value of&#xD;
      PlGF and each of the composite maternal and perinatal adverse outcomes. Multivariable&#xD;
      logistic regression would be constructed to account for potentially confounding factors&#xD;
      selected based on clinical information (maternal age, gestational age at presentation, parity&#xD;
      and mode of delivery). The sensitivity and specificity would be determined for the cut point&#xD;
      cited above. A p value &lt;0.05 would be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.11.0 ETHICAL CONSIDERATION 4.11.1 ETHICAL APPROVAL Ethical approval for the study has been&#xD;
      sought for and obtained from the hospital Research Ethics Committee with approval number&#xD;
      FETHA/REC/VOL2/2018/041. Informed consent will be obtained from each study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.12 SOURCE OF FUNDING There is no source of funding for this study. The researchers will&#xD;
      bear the cost of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.13 STRENGTH AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY The strength of the study is that a single&#xD;
      biomaker, PlGF, would be assayed and the test would be performed once, which is cost-saving.&#xD;
      The limitation of this study is that long term follow up of participants will not be carried&#xD;
      out and adverse outcomes that will occur following hospital discharge will not be assessed.&#xD;
      In addition, reliable results are obtained when the assay procedure is performed with a&#xD;
      complete adherence to good laboratory practice and this will be ensured by quality control&#xD;
      that will be put in place in course of the study.&#xD;
