    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is to produce preliminary data testing the feasibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness of high intensity interval training (HIIT) on cardiovascular health parameters&#xD;
      in individuals with paraplegia. The long term research goal is to determine whether these&#xD;
      short term physiologic effects translate to long term reduction in cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      mortality in this high risk population. The rationale for this study is that identifying a&#xD;
      well-accepted form of exercise in individuals with paraplegia, which is safe and effective in&#xD;
      improving cardiovascular health parameters, would provide an efficient and sustainable&#xD;
      evidence-based approach to lowering cardiovascular disease risk. We propose the following two&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: Measure cardiovascular changes after a 16-week HIIT program in individuals&#xD;
      with paraplegia. Measurements will include oxygen utilization during maximal exercise via&#xD;
      VO2max testing (primary outcome measure), body composition via dual energy X-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry, blood lipid panel, C-reactive protein blood test, and glucose utilization via&#xD;
      oral glucose tolerance blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: Investigate the feasibility, sustainability and acceptance of implementing&#xD;
      high-intensity interval training (HIIT) via arm-ergometer as a form of home exercise in&#xD;
      individuals with paraplegia. After the personalized training session with the arm-ergometer&#xD;
      and the HIIT protocol, each participant will be given an arm-ergometer (also known as&#xD;
      arm-cycle) to use within their home to complete three sessions weekly for the entire16 week&#xD;
      program. An adjustable table will be provided to allow for height customization of each&#xD;
      arm-ergometer, and provide a method for securing the device during exercise. The&#xD;
      arm-ergometers allow the subject to complete the exercise intervention from their own&#xD;
      wheelchair. Compliance will be monitored via chest strap heart rate monitors. Acceptance of&#xD;
      the program will be determined through a pre- and post- training survey Spinal Cord Injury&#xD;
      Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale (SCI ESES) and interview with participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of this project, we expect to have determined whether HIIT is an&#xD;
      appropriate form of exercise intervention for individuals with paraplegia, effective in&#xD;
      improving short-term cardiovascular health parameters within a 16 week home program. We&#xD;
      anticipate participants will find HIIT acceptable given the time-efficiency of the protocol,&#xD;
      the convenience of using their own wheelchair and the elimination of environmental barriers&#xD;
      by performing the program within their home. This study is expected to have a positive impact&#xD;
      on cardiovascular health in individuals with paraplegia and foresee this form of exercise&#xD;
      being implemented as a standard of care recommendation in the physical activity guidelines&#xD;
      for individuals with paraplegia.&#xD;
