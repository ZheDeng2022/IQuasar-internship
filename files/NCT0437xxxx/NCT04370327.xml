  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects over 236 million people globally. A classic symptom&#xD;
      of PAD is intermittent claudication (IC) which is associated with reductions in physical&#xD;
      function. The evidence is irrefutable that supervised exercise programmes (SEP) improve pain&#xD;
      free and maximal waking distance. However, adherence rates are poor with exercise-related&#xD;
      pain cited as contributable factor. Exercise at mild claudication or pain- free exercise&#xD;
      improves walking ability, however current guidelines recommend exercise should be performed&#xD;
      to near maximal claudication to improve walking ability. Conflicting evidence exists and&#xD;
      there is a lack of evidence that has directly compared the relative effects of exercise&#xD;
      prescribed at different levels of claudication. Therefore, the primary objective is to&#xD;
      directly compare the effects of exercise prescribed at different levels of claudication pain&#xD;
      on functional outcomes&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a progressive disease and is characterised by&#xD;
      atherosclerotic occlusion of the arteries in the lower limbs, resulting in a reduction of&#xD;
      blow flow. Globally, it is estimated that 236 million people are living with PAD, with the&#xD;
      number of cases increasing by 24% from 2000 to 2010 (Song et al., 2019). A classic symptom of&#xD;
      PAD is intermittent claudication (IC), which is characterised by ischemic muscle pain&#xD;
      precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest. IC is associated with various comorbidities&#xD;
      such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidaemia as well as reductions in physical&#xD;
      function, quality of life, and balance. National and international guidelines recommend&#xD;
      exercise therapy as first line treatment for patients with IC, advocating two hours per week&#xD;
      of a supervised exercise over a three-month period, with patients being encouraged to&#xD;
      exercise to the point of maximal pain. Exercise therapy is also a cost-effective option, as a&#xD;
      three month programme costs less than a tenth of the cost of angioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite the plethora of evidence demonstrating the benefits of SEP, less than half&#xD;
      of vascular units in the United Kingdom (UK) have access one and patient uptake rates low. A&#xD;
      lack of motivation has been shown as one of the primary reasons for poor adherence with&#xD;
      claudication pain being suggested as a contributable factor. Indeed, exercise-induced pain&#xD;
      has been shown as a major barrier to physical activity in this population and the level of&#xD;
      pain prescribed during SEP influences completion rates. When exercise is prescribed at higher&#xD;
      levels of pain, completion rates are lower. However, current evidence and guidelines advocate&#xD;
      exercising to the point of near maximal pain, despite evidence to the contrary, suggesting&#xD;
      that mild- or pain-free exercise improves walking ability. As such, it remains unclear which&#xD;
      level of claudication is optimal for improving functional outcomes in patients with IC which&#xD;
      can affect patient adherence, clinical practice and exercise prescription. The lack of&#xD;
      adequately powered, randomised clinical trials investigating the effects of exercise&#xD;
      prescribed at differing levels of claudication pain has also been highlighted in a recent&#xD;
      scientific statement from the American Heart Association&#xD;
