    <textblock>
      Exploring epigenetic mechanisms of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome&#xD;
      (ME/CFS) is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying its pathophysiology. Three&#xD;
      potential candidates have been selected (BDNF, COMT, and HDAC genes). DNA methylation in the&#xD;
      promoter regions of those genes will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed a randomised controlled trial and will enrol 70 patients with&#xD;
      ME/CFS and 35 age-, sex-, and BMI-matched healthy controls. Both groups will be randomised in&#xD;
      2 groups and receive either one session of aerobic exercise or a validated test designed to&#xD;
      trigger mental stress and mental fatigue. The primary aim is to assess genetic and epigenetic&#xD;
      mechanisms of BDNF, COMT and HDAC genes in response to exercise and the stress task.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The only way to improve the diagnosis and treatment of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic&#xD;
      Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is to better understand the mechanisms underlying its&#xD;
      pathophysiology. Central nervous system dysfunctions play a major role in ME/CFS and help&#xD;
      explaining patients' symptoms, such as general malaise occurring after physical activity&#xD;
      (i.e. post-exertional malaise). Therefore, post-exertional malaise in relation to three major&#xD;
      candidates involved in central nervous system functioning - brain-derived neurotrophic factor&#xD;
      (BDNF), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and histone de-acetylases (HDAC) - will be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BDNF is a protein involved in crucial functions such as nerve growth, memory and learning,&#xD;
      and plays a role in neuronal sensitisation and pain. However, no study has explored the role&#xD;
      of BDNF in ME/CFS. Our research group performed a preliminary study which focussed on BDNF in&#xD;
      ME/CFS. In a previous study, the investigators assessed DNA methylation (an epigenetic&#xD;
      mechanism that contribute to gene expression silencing), and protein expression in serum of&#xD;
      the BDNF in patients with ME/CFS and healthy controls. Patients showed significantly less DNA&#xD;
      methylation and significantly more BDNF protein. Given these exciting findings, further study&#xD;
      is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMT is an enzyme encoded by its homonymous gene. The enzyme degrades catecholamines like&#xD;
      dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine. Catecholamines have been repeatedly associated with&#xD;
      pain, stress, and depression. Lower COMT activity increases catecholamines level, causes&#xD;
      hyperalgesia, and has been associated with depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, research on histone acetylation shows that another group of enzymes (Histone&#xD;
      de-acetylases, HDACs) are increased during neural sensitisation and pain. However, no&#xD;
      research has been done on HDACs in patients with ME/CFS. Interestingly, aerobic exercise has&#xD;
      been shown to increase BDNF release and decrease COMT and HDACs activity. Given the&#xD;
      detrimental acute effects that exercise can have on patients with ME/CFS, investigators&#xD;
      hypothesised that understanding the role of BDNF, COMT, and HDACs following exercise would&#xD;
      help elucidating both mechanisms of post-exertional malaise and ME/CFS pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised controlled trial has been designed including 70 patients with ME/CFS and 35&#xD;
      age-, sex-, and BMI-matched healthy controls. Both groups will be randomised in 2 groups. One&#xD;
      group will undergo one session of aerobic exercise, and the other group undergoes a validated&#xD;
      test designed to trigger mental stress and mental fatigue. All participants will undergo&#xD;
      clinical assessments, measurements of pain thresholds, and blood withdrawal before and after&#xD;
      the exercise/mental stress exposure. The aims are to assess genetic and epigenetic mechanisms&#xD;
      of BDNF, COMT and HDAC genes, as well as the expression of these factors in blood and serum&#xD;
      in patients with ME/CFS.&#xD;
