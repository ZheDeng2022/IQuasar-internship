  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab with or without standard of care axitinib&#xD;
      works in treating patients with clear cell kidney cancer that has spread to nearby tissues or&#xD;
      lymph nodes (locally advanced) or other places in the body (metastatic) who are undergoing&#xD;
      surgery. Pembrolizumab is an antibody that is designed to bind to and block the activity of&#xD;
      PD-1, a molecule in the body that may be responsible for inhibiting the body's immune&#xD;
      response against cancer cells. Axitinib is a type of drug known as a tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors work by blocking enzymes called tyrosine kinases. These&#xD;
      enzymes may be too active or found at high levels in some types of cancer cells and blocking&#xD;
      them may help keep cancer cells from growing. Giving pembrolizumab with or without axitinib&#xD;
      may work better in controlling the cancer and decrease the likelihood of it coming back&#xD;
      following surgery in patients with kidney cancer compared to usual treatment (surgery&#xD;
      followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy).&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the impact of pembrolizumab-based therapy on the composition, phenotype, and&#xD;
      function of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) in subjects with advanced renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (RCC) undergoing cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN)/metastasectomy (MET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the clinical efficacy of preoperative pembrolizumab-based therapy in subjects&#xD;
      with advanced RCC undergoing CN/MET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the clinical efficacy of continued pembrolizumab-based therapy following&#xD;
      CN/MET in subjects with advanced RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab-based therapy in subjects with&#xD;
      advanced RCC undergoing CN/MET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the clinical efficacy of preoperative pembrolizumab-based therapy in subjects&#xD;
      with advanced RCC, by pathologic response. (Clinical).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the relationship between changes in TIICs and clinical efficacy in subjects&#xD;
      with advanced RCC treated with pembrolizumab-based therapy. (Scientific).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize changes in the frequency and number of circulating T cells induced by&#xD;
      pembrolizumab-based therapy in subjects with advanced RCC. (Scientific).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the impact of pembrolizumab-based therapy on the composition and phenotype&#xD;
      of the tumor microenvironment (including tumor and stromal cells) in subjects with advanced&#xD;
      RCC. (Scientific).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine whether locally advanced versus metastatic RCC exhibit differences in immune&#xD;
      composition or phenotype at baseline and in response to pembrolizumab-based therapy.&#xD;
      (Scientific).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the change in T cell repertoire within the tumor and blood induced by&#xD;
      pembrolizumab-based therapy in subjects with advanced RCC. (Scientific).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To explore molecular profiles to identify potentially predictive biomarkers for subjects&#xD;
      with advanced RCC treated with immunotherapy (Scientific).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Within 14-21 days following the end of treatment, patients will&#xD;
      undergo standard of care CN or MET. Patients with progressive disease (PD) may undergo CN or&#xD;
      MET per physician discretion. Within 21-42 days after surgery, patients with no disease (R0&#xD;
      resection) or microscopic disease (R1 resection) receive pembrolizumab IV every 42 days for&#xD;
      up to 9 cycles (1 year) and patients with macroscopic disease (R2 resection) receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab IV every 42 days for up to 18 cycles (2 years) in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and standard of care&#xD;
      axitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-42. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 14-21 days&#xD;
      following the end of treatment, patients undergo standard of care CN or MET. Patients with PD&#xD;
      may undergo CN or MET per physician discretion. Within 21-42 days after surgery, patients&#xD;
      with an R0 or R1 resection receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and axitinib PO&#xD;
      BID on days 1-42. Treatments repeat every 42 days for up to 9 cycles (1 year) in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with an R2 resection receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and axitinib PO BID on days 1-42. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 42 days for up to 18 cycles (2 years) in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will occur at treatment discontinuation, 30 days post-discontinuation, and then&#xD;
      every 12 weeks for up to 1 year post-discontinuation. Subjects who discontinue study&#xD;
      participation due to progressive disease will return for a mandatory safety follow-up visit&#xD;
      within 30 days of(+7 days) after the final dose of study treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1,or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent&#xD;

             known active hepatitis C virus (defined as hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid&#xD;
             (RNA) [qualitative] is detected) infection. No testing for hepatitis B and hepatitis C&#xD;
             is required unless mandated by local health authority&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples of live&#xD;
