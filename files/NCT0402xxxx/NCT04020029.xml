  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindsets have been rigorously studied in the domains of development, education, and more&#xD;
      recently, in health and disease. However, there are no large-scale longitudinal studies of&#xD;
      the mindsets held by cancer patients and how they may affect treatment outcomes, physical&#xD;
      health, and psychological well-being. This randomized, single-blind, treatment-as-usual (TAU)&#xD;
      control study aims to assess (1) mindsets at four time points spanning from the point of&#xD;
      diagnosis to six weeks post-treatment to patients who are newly diagnosed with cancer and&#xD;
      undergoing treatment with curative intent, and (2) the impact of a brief but targeted mindset&#xD;
      intervention to help instill more useful mindsets about the nature of cancer and the role of&#xD;
      the body on patient reported measures of physical and psychological health. This study aims&#xD;
      to add to the existing literature on psychosocial interventions for cancer patients and&#xD;
      survivors while addressing the substantial time and cost limitations of traditional&#xD;
      interventions. It also contributes to the body of research indicating that mindsets play an&#xD;
      important role in both health and wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two secondary objectives. First, we aim to determine the impact of patient&#xD;
      mindsets on measures of treatment (treatment efficacy and treatment related adverse events)&#xD;
      and psychosocial health (stress, coping, mood, emotions). Second, we aim to understand the&#xD;
      relationship between patient mindsets and biomarkers of immune and inflammatory processes in&#xD;
      patients undergoing cancer treatment&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G), a widely used patient reported health outcome measure. The FACT-G consists of 27 questions. Each question is answered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Higher scores on the FACT-G indicate better quality of life. Questions fall into four subscales measuring four domains of quality of life: physical wellbeing (7 questions), social/family well-being (7 questions), emotional well-being (6 questions), and functional well-being (7-questions).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measuring mindsets</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient mindsets will be measured using the Illness Mindset Inventory (IMI). The IMI is a 20-item measure of mindsets about chronic illness. The Cancer version of the IMI consists of two subscales: mindsets about the nature of cancer and mindsets about the role of the body. Each item is rated on a 6 point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (6).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear of Cancer Recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fear of Cancer Recurrence will be measured using the Cancer Worry Scale (CWS). The CWS is a 6-item measure that assesses worry about the risk of developing cancer in cancer survivors. All items use a 4-point scale of frequency, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (almost all the time). The CWS will be measured at only one time-point (CP-7), 6 weeks after the completion of treatment</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biomarker Analyses</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be analyzed for the following biomarkers of interest.&#xD;
C-reactive protein (CRP)&#xD;
-6 / Interleukin (IL) IL-8&#xD;
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measuring stress with cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Stress will be measured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). This 10-item measure is the most commonly used measure of perceptions of stress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measuring coping with cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Coping will be measured using the Cancer Behavior Inventory (CBI). The CBI is a 27-item measure of self-efficacy for coping with cancer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measuring affect with cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Affect will be measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). The PANAS is a 20 item scale measuring positive and negative affect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measuring emotional regulation with cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Emotion Regulation will be measured using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). The ERQ is a 10-item self-report scale designed to measure use of strategies to alter emotion: reappraisal of cognitions and suppression of expressions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will only recruit patients â‰¥ 18 years who are fluent in English and are without&#xD;
             cognitive impairment. We have no gender, race, or ethnicity restrictions. Diagnosis of&#xD;
             cancer (breast, lung, GI or colorectal, or lymphoma) and treatment given with curative&#xD;
             intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients diagnosed with lung cancer, breast cancer, GI/Colorectal cancer, or Lymphoma&#xD;
             to be treated with curative intent will be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be recruited if they are receiving at least one course of systemic&#xD;
             treatment. As we are recruiting participants near the point of diagnosis, we will&#xD;
             target individuals who have not received prior therapy for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neither ECOG or Karnofsky Performance Status will be employed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document is&#xD;
             required for participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment plan includes course of systemic treatment involving no less than 4 and no&#xD;
             more than 12 infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgical procedures, if applicable, must take place either before the initiation of&#xD;
             systemic treatment or after the last infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There are no restrictions regarding the use of other investigational agents; however,&#xD;
             use of any investigational agents will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No active major mental health diagnoses including severe depression, severe anxiety,&#xD;
             bipolar / manic depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, or&#xD;
             any psychotic disorder. Patients with mild depression or anxiety, or depression or&#xD;
             anxiety that is well managed with treatment, will not be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant / nursing patients will not be excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a previous diagnosis of cancer (cancer survivors) will be excluded from&#xD;
             this study. Cancer survivors may already have preconceived notions about the nature of&#xD;
             a cancer diagnosis and the course of treatment, and therefore may not respond to our&#xD;
             intervention in the same way as individuals who are encountering a cancer diagnosis&#xD;
             for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are HIV-positive will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have major comorbidities that would substantially reduce life expectancy&#xD;
             despite successful cancer treatment (i.e., comorbid end stage heart disease or kidney&#xD;
             disease) will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
