    <textblock>
      Visual field defects (VFD) usually do not show improvement beyond 12 weeks from onset.&#xD;
      Plasticity occurs in areas of residual vision (ARV) at the visual field which are the&#xD;
      functional counterpart of partially damaged brain regions at the areas around brain lesion.&#xD;
      Few treatment options are currently available for post-stroke VFD. In this pilot study, the&#xD;
      effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to these areas on VFD&#xD;
      in patients with cortical infarction will be studied. Patients will be divided into two&#xD;
      groups; an active group which will receive active stimulation and a sham group which will&#xD;
      receive placebo stimulation through a sham coil.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Visual functions are widely distributed over large areas within the cerebrum. Secondary to&#xD;
      such wide distribution, visual field defects (VFD) are a common outcome of brain insults&#xD;
      especially cerebrovascular stroke whether hemorrhagic or ischemic. Among these, homonymous&#xD;
      hemianopia is the most frequently encountered VFD in clinical practice. VFD ranges from 8.3%&#xD;
      to 16% in the chronic stage of stroke, while it reaches 25% in acute and subacute stages of&#xD;
      stroke. In other studies, it was reported to be even higher. In a database of 11900 stoke&#xD;
      patients, VFD was found in 60.5% with homonymous hemianopia accounting for 35%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These VFDs usually show some degree of improvement within few months from onset secondary to&#xD;
      resolution of edema and diaschisis, yet by 3 to 6 months the condition tends to become&#xD;
      stationary with no further improvement and only 5% of patients will show full recovery of&#xD;
      their visual field. In some studies recovery was mostly along the first 10 days of insult&#xD;
      followed by decrease in recovery rate that nearly stops 10-12 weeks after insult. Beyond this&#xD;
      time point, very few cases develop spontaneous recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasticity occurs in areas of residual vision (ARV) at the visual field borders rather than&#xD;
      areas of absolute blindness. These ARVs are the functional counterpart of partially damaged&#xD;
      brain regions at the perilesional areas. Recovery of function - both early in life and in&#xD;
      adults - is stimulation dependent. This stimulation can be either through visual experience,&#xD;
      behavioral training or brain stimulation. To the investigator's knowledge, direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (DCS) is the only brain stimulation modality that has been studied in cases of&#xD;
      VFDs. Results showed that DCS can expand visual field in stroke patients with the effects&#xD;
      being stable over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, it is hypothesized that stimulation of the perilesional seemingly&#xD;
      healthy brain tissue close to the visual cortex would result in clinical improvement based on&#xD;
      the concept of ARVs. To achieve this precise targeting, navigated rTMS would be the most&#xD;
      suitable technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to study the effect of navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) applied to perilesional areas on patients with cortical visual field&#xD;
      defects (cVFD) due to stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized sham-controlled clinical trial that will be conducted in the&#xD;
      neuromodulation research lab, neurology department, Ain Shams University. The study is&#xD;
      approved by Ain Shams University faculty of medicine local research ethics committee (REC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3D MRI: An MRI Brain T1WI with 200 cuts of 0.9 mm sections will be obtained. Segmentation of&#xD;
      the head model will be done to separate scalp, skull and brain layers. A three-dimensional&#xD;
      virtual head model will then be created for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Selection: The target for stimulation will be determined and marked for each patient&#xD;
      using a neuronavigation system on his virtual head model. Targets will be selected along the&#xD;
      perilesional area in the nearest seemingly healthy tissue to the visual cortex based on the&#xD;
      following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ARV (grey zone) will be identified in the perimetry of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Corresponding area in the 3D head model will then be determined based on visuotopy of&#xD;
           the primary visual cortex.&#xD;
