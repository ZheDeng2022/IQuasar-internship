    <textblock>
      Regional anaesthesia has many advantages but it might be a stressful and painful experience.&#xD;
      Usually, the anesthetist administers a pharmacologic intravenous sedation to achieve&#xD;
      patient's comfort. Though, these medications are not benign, and disadvantages include&#xD;
      unpredictable response, adverse effects, and interference with cooperation. The virtual&#xD;
      reality hypnosis distraction (VRHD) could be a good non-pharmacological technique to improve&#xD;
      patient's comfort, decrease anxiety and procedure related pain. This study is a prospective&#xD;
      study where sixty patients scheduled for orthopedic surgery requiring regional anesthesia&#xD;
      were randomized in three groups according to the use or not of VRHD during the regional&#xD;
      procedure or before as a complementary premedication. The anesthetic management during the&#xD;
      regional procedure and the surgery remained otherwise standard for each patient. The first&#xD;
      endpoint is to assess if the use of VRHD allows a decrease in drug consumption of opioids&#xD;
      (µg) and benzodiazepine (mg) throughout the regional procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second endpoint is to determine if the VRHD increases the patient's satisfaction of their&#xD;
      anaesthetic management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third endpoint is to study various parameters of use of this specific anaesthetic&#xD;
      management: time required for the installation and operation time of the VRHD device; the&#xD;
      variation of haemodynamic parameters between the separate groups; pain procedure-related and&#xD;
      behavioural pain scale scores between the separate groups.&#xD;

      Background Regional anesthesia has many advantages but it might be a stressful and painful&#xD;
      experience and the anaesthetist has to establish all the necessary measures to maintain&#xD;
      patient's comfort and cooperation. In practice, this ideal situation may be the most&#xD;
      challenging part of the regional anesthetic practice. Usually, the anesthetist administers a&#xD;
      pharmacologic intravenous sedation, including opioids and benzodiazepines to achieve&#xD;
      patient's comfort. These medications are not benign, and disadvantages include possible&#xD;
      unpredictable response, adverse effects, and hindered cooperation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the non-pharmacologic techniques which may be used to improve the patient's comfort,&#xD;
      decrease anxiety and procedure related pain, hypnosis and virtual reality distraction are&#xD;
      increasingly used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of the encouraging scientific and clinical findings, hypnosis for analgesia is not&#xD;
      universally used in medical centers. Its widespread use has been limited by factors such as&#xD;
      the advanced expertise, time and effort required by clinicians to provide hypnosis, and the&#xD;
      commitment required by patients to engage in hypnosis. It is a challenge to make hypnosis a&#xD;
      standard part of care in this environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvements in technologies made virtual reality (VR) distraction a unique practical tool to&#xD;
      provide an immersive, multisensory and three-dimensional (3D) environment that creates a&#xD;
      sense of presence which enables to modify the perception of reality and to capture a greater&#xD;
      degree of attention. Several theories have been proposed to explain how distraction may&#xD;
      inhibit or decrease perception of pain by capturing a greater degree of attention. The&#xD;
      &quot;virtual reality analgesia&quot; (= analgesia produces by virtual reality) is a product of the&#xD;
      attentional distraction. Hoffmann et al. explained that there is a limit to the conscious&#xD;
      attentional resources humans have available to process large amounts of incoming information.&#xD;
      Conscious attention is required for pain perception. Hoffmann et al. theorize that the more&#xD;
      immersive the VR system, the more attention will be drawn into the virtual world, leaving&#xD;
      less attention available to process nociceptive signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, VR shows an interest in numerous clinical applications (to help treat anxiety&#xD;
      disorders, control pain, support physical rehabilitation, and distract patients during wound&#xD;
      care) VR technology guides the patient through the same steps used when hypnosis is induced&#xD;
      through an interpersonal process. With attentional mechanisms as a common denominator, the&#xD;
      attention-captivating qualities of virtual reality and the suggestion inherent in hypnosis,&#xD;
      the potential for a synergistic effect between these modalities is signiﬁcant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a device which combined the advantage of VR technology and hypnosis could probably&#xD;
      improve the patient's comfort, decrease his anxiety and procedure related pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first endpoint of our study is to assess if virtual reality hypnosis distraction (VRHD)&#xD;
      decreases the need of pharmacologic intravenous sedation during a regional anaesthesia&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second endpoint is to determine if VRHD increases patient's satisfaction concerning their&#xD;
      anaesthetic management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third endpoint is to study various parameters of this specific anesthetic management:&#xD;
      time required for the installation and operation time of the VRHD device; variation of&#xD;
      haemodynamic parameters; pain procedure-related and behavioural pain scale scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Our study is a prospective randomized study. The protocol was approved by the&#xD;
      Independent Ethics Committee from Erasmus Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written Informed consent was obtained from all participating subjects. Subjects were&#xD;
      randomized by the use of a computer-generated random table. Sixty patients scheduled for&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgery needing regional anaesthesia are randomized according to the used of VRHD&#xD;
      during the regional procedure or before as a complementary premedication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients and the anesthetist in charge of the patient were not blinded but the data&#xD;
      collection and statistical analysis were blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia management The anesthetic management was standardized for each patient. All&#xD;
      subjects were fasting from midnight and premedicated with 0,25-0,5 mg alprazolam per os one&#xD;
      hour before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the regional block, the surgical asepsis was respected and the regional block was&#xD;
      performed under ultrasound guidance (machine Epic or Philips…). A basic monitoring was&#xD;
      installed (EKG (electrocardiogram), NIBP (non-invasive blood pressure), SpO2 (pulse oximetry&#xD;
      saturation). A 18 gauge catheter was placed in a vein. To avoid hypoxemia, all patients&#xD;
      benefited of a supplemental nasal oxygen (3l/min) if the SpO2 &lt; 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperatively, the patient was maintained under sedation or general anesthesia according&#xD;
      to the surgical prerequisites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the postoperative period, standard care was provided to the patient at the postoperative&#xD;
      care unit according the American society of anesthesiologists (ASA) recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol In the control group, the patient received the standard pharmacologic&#xD;
      intravenous sedation before the regional anaesthesia (2 mg midazolam + 5 µg de sufentanil)&#xD;
      without VRHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study group VRHD 1, the patient received the VHRD technique during the peripheral&#xD;
      nerve block and received a pharmacologic intravenous sedation only if the patient's asked for&#xD;
      it or if the patient shows some discomfort (behavioural pain scale score &gt;3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study group VRHD 2, the patient received the VHRD technique a first time before the&#xD;
      regional procedure and a second time during the peripheral nerve block. The patient received&#xD;
      a pharmacologic intravenous sedation only if the patient's asked for it or if the patient&#xD;
      shows some discomfort (behavioural pain scale score &gt;3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality hypnosis distraction protocol The VHRD technique is the program of&#xD;
      OncomfortTM (Oncomfort Inc, Houston, USA). The OncomfortTM device include the hyper vision 3D&#xD;
      virtual reality glasses and disposable single-patient-use headphones. The program is an&#xD;
      immersive experience focused on inducing relaxation environment and this program exists in&#xD;
      durations of 5,15 and 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the group VHRD 1 and 2, the investigators use the program throughout the regional block.&#xD;
      The duration chosen for the VHRD program was 15 or 30 min depending of the time required for&#xD;
      the regional procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the group VHRD 2, the investigators use the program of 5 min for the session occuring&#xD;
      before the regional procedure, followed by a 15 or 30 min program during the regional&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were coached by a separate practitioner aside from the regional anesthesiologist&#xD;
      performing the regional block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcomes The first endpoint is to assess if the use of VRHD decreases of 50% the drug&#xD;
      consumption of opioids (µg) and benzodiazepine (mg) throughout the regional procedure in&#xD;
      comparison with standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second endpoint is to determine if the VRHD increases the patient's satisfaction of their&#xD;
      anaesthetic management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third endpoint is to study various parameters of this specific anesthetic management:&#xD;
      time required for the use and installation of the VRHD device; variation of hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters between the separate groups, pain procedure-related and behavioural pain scale&#xD;
      scores between the separate groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis As the first endpoint is to determine if the VRHD decreases the need of&#xD;
      pharmacologic intravenous sedation of 50%, the sample size (N=60) is determined by an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat test (control group n=20, VRHD 1 n= 20 and VRHD n= 20).&#xD;
