      This study is to assess socio-economic factors, clinical and virtual precision,&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes, and esthetics during the treatment with monolithic multi-unit&#xD;
      iFDPs in a complete digital workflow&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fixed Dental Prosthesis (FDPs) are the treatment of choice for the rehabilitation of&#xD;
      partial-edentulism, especially in posterior (free-end) sites. Compared to classical&#xD;
      tooth-bourne removable prostheses, the implant-based treatment approach is a more biological&#xD;
      approach protecting the neighboring teeth including surrounding tissues. In addition, it is a&#xD;
      more comfortable solution for the patient but often represents a time- and cost-intensive&#xD;
      treatment modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is of great interest to offer the advantages of Implant-supported Fixed Dental&#xD;
      Prosthesis (iFDP) to a broader patient population. Thus, this is only possible if new&#xD;
      technologies are affordable, which can shorten the overall clinical treatment time and the&#xD;
      technical production process to achieve a reasonable cost-benefit ratio in combination with a&#xD;
      high quality outcome of the final prosthodontic reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this time, the classical impression technique with implant transfer posts and elastomeric&#xD;
      materials for the manufacturing of master casts out of gypsum still represents the gold&#xD;
      standard for implant prosthodontic reconstructions. The conventional approach involves&#xD;
      biological, technical, patient-related and economic compromises such as complex and costly&#xD;
      technical manufacturing steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative to this established method is the digital implant workflow. In contrast to the&#xD;
      conventional approach, the digital process can virtually detect the 3D implant position in a&#xD;
      contact-free way with an Intraoral Scanner (IOS) device including further technical&#xD;
      processing with Computer-Aided-Design (CAD)/ Computer-Aided-Manufacturing (CAM) technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the entire production process of monolithic iFDPs is introduced starting with IOS&#xD;
      and following a virtual construction without any physical model situations. In addition, the&#xD;
      production of the iFDP itself is simplified by the option to connect a full-contour&#xD;
      monolithic Zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) reconstruction to pre-fabricated bonding base abutments&#xD;
      in a complete digital workflow without any physical master casts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to assess socio-economic factors, clinical and virtual precision,&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes, and esthetics during the treatment with monolithic multi-unit&#xD;
      iFDPs in a complete digital workflow without any physical model situation.&#xD;

    <description>FIPS defined by 5 variables: (1) interproximal, (2) occlusion, (3) design, (4) mucosa (5) bone. Scoring scheme of 0-1-2 is assigned for each variable, resulting in a maximum score of ten (5 Ã— 2). The variable &quot;Interproximal&quot; is assessed for mesial-distal contact areas and the papillary presence of the adjacent dentition. &quot;Occlusion&quot; is evaluated for static and dynamic patterns and &quot;Design&quot; for contour, shape, color and finish. The 3 variables related to restoration are scored as major discrepancy (0), minor discrepancy (1), or no discrepancy (2). Quality and quantity of peri-implant soft tissue conditions is categorized under &quot;Mucosa&quot; as non-keratinized/non-attached (0), non-keratinized/attached (1), or keratinized + attached (2). Marginal bone levels are analyzed under &quot;Bone&quot; assessing the radiographic level of the alveolar crest mesially and distally: loss &gt; 1.5 mm (0), loss &lt; 1.5 mm (1), and no loss (2). Higher score represents better outcome.</description>
