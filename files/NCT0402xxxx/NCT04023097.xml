  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study objective is to test the Silk'n Toothwave self-selection, by potential end users.&#xD;
      Additionally, this study will evaluate if contraindicated subjects will self-exclude from use&#xD;
      of the device and the ability to understand accurately the labeling content (box and user&#xD;
      manual).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Silk'n Toothwave Device, in its original packaging, along with the user manual will be&#xD;
      provided to the patient in a simulated home use environment. The patient labeling will be in&#xD;
      the format intended for distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will sign an informed consent before any study activity. Five (5) potential end&#xD;
      users and Additional five (5) contraindicated subjects will be screened for this&#xD;
      self-selection study. Subjects will be provided with the device in its original packaging and&#xD;
      will be evaluated for their ability to decide if they are eligible or they should&#xD;
      self-exclude themselves from use of the device based solely on reading the device labeling&#xD;
      (box and user manual).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the subjects complete reviewing the labeling materials (box and user manual) they will&#xD;
      be requested to perform a labeling comprehension exam for testing the ability to correctly&#xD;
      understand the labeling content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will not include treatment.&#xD;
