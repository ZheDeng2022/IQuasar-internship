  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study that will be conducted in four low income countries to&#xD;
      describe newborn weight patterns in the first month after birth and their association with&#xD;
      clinical and demographic factors including dietary intake.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Worldwide, more than 50 million children under 5 are wasted&#xD;
      (weight-for-length/height Z-score (WLZ) &lt;-2) and over 150 million children under 5 are&#xD;
      stunted (length/height-for-age Z-score (LAZ) &lt;-2); such wasting and stunting often begin&#xD;
      during infancy. Optimal early nutrition can prevent wasting and stunting. In low income&#xD;
      countries, there is therefore a need to understand early weight patterns and how they relate&#xD;
      to dietary intakes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The proposed study will assess the relationship between infant dietary intake and&#xD;
      weight change in low income countries by characterizing neonatal weight loss/gain patterns,&#xD;
      dietary intake, and growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: We will use a prospective cohort study design to describe early infant weight&#xD;
      patterns and their relationship to dietary intake. Up to 880 newborns and their mothers will&#xD;
      be enrolled in four countries: Guinea-Bissau, Nepal, Pakistan and Uganda (up to 220&#xD;
      newborns/site). Enrolled infants will be followed from birth until one month of age and will&#xD;
      be assessed by anthropometry, dietary survey and hemoglobin measurement. Mothers will also be&#xD;
      assessed for anthropometry and hemoglobin. Infants' fathers and next-oldest siblings will&#xD;
      also be enrolled for anthropometry if available and willing to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to describe sample characteristics. We will use various&#xD;
      regression modeling techniques to examine the links between individual, family, and community&#xD;
      characteristics and early infant weight patterns. Logistic regression models will also be&#xD;
      used to consider potential confounding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study findings will allow us to describe weight patterns in the first 30 days after birth and&#xD;
      their relationship to the dietary intake during that time. We hypothesize that infants who&#xD;
      lose 6% or more of their birth weight prior to beginning weight gain will have lower WAZ at&#xD;
      30 days of age. We also hypothesize that at 12 days of age, weight change relative to birth&#xD;
      weight will be lower for infants born &lt;2500g then for infants born ≥2500g.&#xD;
