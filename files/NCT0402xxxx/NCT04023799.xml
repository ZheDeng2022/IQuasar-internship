      MTN-045 is a cross-sectional study that will utilize questionnaires, including&#xD;
      Discrete-Choice Experiments (DCE) and joint decision tasks, to assess couples' preferences&#xD;
      related to dual purpose prevention (DPP) products that could be used to prevent unintended&#xD;
      pregnancies and HIV infection. Post-survey explanatory in-depth interviews (IDIs) will be&#xD;
      conducted with a subset of participants to explore DPP product-related decisions..&#xD;

      MTN-045 is a cross-sectional study that will utilize questionnaires, including DCEs and joint&#xD;
      decision tasks, and IDIs to assess heterosexual couples' preferences related to DPP products&#xD;
      that could be used to prevent unintended pregnancies and HIV infection. One main goal of the&#xD;
      study is to determine heterosexual couples' preferences for a DPP product to inform product&#xD;
      delivery and future product design to maximize uptake and willingness to use among&#xD;
      sub-Saharan African heterosexual couples. Another main goal of the study is to assess the&#xD;
      level of influence of the male partner on a woman's preferences for a DPP product and on her&#xD;
      decision-making process regarding product preferences and use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MTN-045 study population will consist of approximately 400 heterosexual sub-Saharan&#xD;
      African couples of reproductive age who have been in a relationship for ≥ 3 months and are&#xD;
      interested in contraception and/or HIV prevention. Women who are currently using&#xD;
      contraceptives as well as those not using contraceptives will be eligible. Couples who are&#xD;
      living together as well as those not living together will be eligible. All participants will&#xD;
      complete survey questionnaires, first separately from their partner, then followed by a joint&#xD;
      couples' decision task. Up to 80 participants, i.e., one or both partners from a subset of up&#xD;
      to 40 couples, will be selected to complete an IDI.&#xD;
