  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of repeat injections and pain associated&#xD;
      with injection of PN40082 and comparative pain associated with RV001 with a topical&#xD;
      anesthetic and RV001 for lip augmentation.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled, roll-over retreatment clinical&#xD;
      study of retreatment of subjects seeking lip augmentation who received treatment with either&#xD;
      PN40082 or Restylane Silk in prior Protocol PRO 2018-02 (NCT04032977), and PN40082 in prior&#xD;
      Protocol PRO 2018-03 (NCT04029519). Subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      receive a single additional treatment with either RV001, RV001 with a topical anesthetic, or&#xD;
      PN40082. The Evaluating Investigator will be blinded to the treatment. Injections of the&#xD;
      study device will be performed by an unblinded Treating Investigator.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Injections of the study device are performed by the unblinded Treating Investigator. The blinded Evaluating Investigator is not allowed to retrieve study supplies or to be present during opening of the study supplies or during the injections. The Treating Investigator is not to have any discussion with the Evaluating Investigator or subjects regarding the treatments.&#xD;
Subjects are blinded to treatment assignment. Subjects are physically masked (blindfolded) just prior to and during all injection procedures to prevent observation of the syringes containing study device.&#xD;
Subjects, investigators, the Sponsor's staff conducting the study, and members of the administrative team will not have access to individual subjects' treatment assignments. In the event of an emergency that requires breaking of the study blind, the randomization code will be maintained by each investigator that can be opened to reveal the study device.</masking_description>
