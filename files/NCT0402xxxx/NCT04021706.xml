  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults with low muscle mass also usually have low bone mass, making them vulnerable to falls,&#xD;
      fractures and other injuries. This project will determine the effectiveness of treatment with&#xD;
      a ghrelin receptor agonist in improving short term indicators of muscle and bone health in&#xD;
      adults with low bone and muscle mass. The results of this trial will inform the design of a&#xD;
      larger, definitive randomized trial designed to establish efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults with both osteopenia and sarcopenia (osteosarcopenia) have greater risk of falls and&#xD;
      fractures than those with osteopenia or sarcopenia alone. Drugs are available to reduce&#xD;
      fracture risk but currently exercise is the only effective strategy to combat muscle loss.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the majority of adults who start a self-monitored exercise program drop out&#xD;
      after 6 months and other options are needed. Ghrelin receptor agonists have been under&#xD;
      development to treat anorexia and weight loss in patients with cancer cachexia. The agonist&#xD;
      anamorelin has significantly increased weight and lean tissue mass in these patients.&#xD;
      Anamorelin mimics the hormone ghrelin which not only increases appetite, but also acts on the&#xD;
      pituitary to increase pulsatile growth hormone (GH) secretion. Pulsatile GH stimulates the&#xD;
      production of insulin-like growth factor 1 which is anabolic to both muscle and bone. GH&#xD;
      levels decline with age and this is thought to contribute to the age-related muscle and bone&#xD;
      losses in adults. The central hypothesis is that anamorelin will increase muscle mass,&#xD;
      improve muscle function, and increase bone formation in adults with osteosarcopenia. To test&#xD;
      this hypothesis, the investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blind, 2-armed,&#xD;
      parallel-group intervention trial in 32 osteosarcopenic men and postmenopausal women age 50&#xD;
      and older. Participants will be randomized to anamorelin (100 mg per day) or placebo and&#xD;
      treated for 12 months. The primary endpoint is change from baseline in muscle mass by&#xD;
      D3-creatine dilution. Secondary endpoints are:appendicular lean tissue mass/ht2 (ALM/ht2)&#xD;
      measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA); the bone formation biomarker,&#xD;
      amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP), total body lean mass by DXA. Exploratory outcomes are&#xD;
      changes in isokinetic leg strength, grip strength, and muscle performance (Health&#xD;
      ABC-Physical Performance Battery (HABC-PPB), serum IGF-1 and C-telopeptide (CTX), and spine&#xD;
      and hip bone mineral density (BMD). The proposed treatment supplies the anabolic stimulus to&#xD;
      build both muscle and bone. Anamorelin has not been tested in adults with osteosarcopenia.&#xD;
      The investigators propose to evaluate this treatment in osteosarcopenic adults who are most&#xD;
      in need of treatment and who are also most likely to benefit. Data obtained from this pilot&#xD;
      study are critical to determine the feasibility and guide the design of a definitive trial to&#xD;
      evaluate this ghrelin receptor agonist as potential therapy to mitigate the dual hazards of&#xD;
      osteopenia and sarcopenia.&#xD;
