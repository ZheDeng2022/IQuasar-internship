      Phase I study of adoptive immunotherapy for advanced MUC1* positive breast cancer with&#xD;
      autologous T cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor, huMNC2-CAR44 specific&#xD;
      for a cleaved form of MUC1 (MUC1*)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent trials have demonstrated that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells (CAR-T&#xD;
      cells) specific for the CD19 molecule can mediate marked tumor regression in a subset of&#xD;
      patients with advanced acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).&#xD;
      It would be ideal to extend CAR-T cell therapy to common epithelial cancers. However, this&#xD;
      poses several challenges, including the identification of molecules expressed on tumor cells&#xD;
      that can be targeted safely with CAR-T cells. Minerva Biotechnologies has developed a CAR T&#xD;
      (huMNC2-CAR44) that targets the extra cellular domain of the cleaved form of MUC1 (called&#xD;
      MUC1*), which is the form of MUC1 that functions as a growth factor receptor and is present&#xD;
      on large percentage of solid tumors, including breast tumors. The antibody targeting head of&#xD;
      huMNC2-CAR44 specifically recognizes a cancerous form of MUC1* and does not bind to another&#xD;
      form of cleaved MUC1 that is present on some normal tissues that also have a rapid turnover.&#xD;
      The huMNC2-CAR44 product consists of autologous T cells that are isolated from cancer&#xD;
      patients, transduced with a proprietary lentiviral vector backbone manufactured under cGMP&#xD;
      and containing sequences for a human CD8 alpha leader sequence, humanized MNC2-scFv (MUC1*&#xD;
      targeting head), portions of human CD8 hinge and transmembrane domains, and human 4-1BB and&#xD;
      human CD3-zeta costimulatory domains. The huMNC2-CAR44 transduced T cells are&#xD;
      antigen-stimulated in vitro, with a synthetic MUC1* extracellular domain peptide. The CAR T&#xD;
      cells are then ready for administration to the patient. The investigators propose to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of adoptively transferred autologous T cells&#xD;
      genetically modified to express a CAR that targets MUC1*, huMNC2-CAR44, in a phase I clinical&#xD;
      trial in patients with metastatic MUC1* positive breast cancer.&#xD;
