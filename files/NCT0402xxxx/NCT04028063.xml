  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, single-institution, single arm Phase II study&#xD;
      conducted using a Simon two-stage design with an additional safety lead-in. The overall&#xD;
      objective is to determine the efficacy of combination doxorubicin with dual checkpoint&#xD;
      blockade with anti-CTLA-4 antibody AGEN1884 and anti-PD-1 antibody AGEN2034. The&#xD;
      investigators will estimate the progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS6mo) of&#xD;
      doxorubicin plus AGEN1884/AGEN2034 in comparison to historical PFS6mo with doxorubicin&#xD;
      monotherapy, calculated as the mean from two large randomized Phase 3 clinical trials.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint for the study is PFS6mo by RECIST 1.1. The sample size calculation is&#xD;
      based on a Simon Two-Stage design with incorporation of early stopping rules for safety and&#xD;
      futility (See section 9 for statistical considerations). The Investigators will enroll up to&#xD;
      35 patients on the study to obtain 28 evaluable patients for the primary endpoint. Safety of&#xD;
      the combination will be evaluated after the first six patients complete the DLT observation&#xD;
      period of 9 weeks. This lengthy DLT period is designed to capture safety and toxicity&#xD;
      profile, understanding that immune-related toxicities from checkpoint inhibitors may not&#xD;
      emerge immediately. This will also ensure adequate evaluation of potential cardiac and&#xD;
      hepatic toxicity from combination doxorubicin and checkpoint inhibitor therapy. If two or&#xD;
      more patients experience DLT in the initial safety lead-in cohort, the regimen will be&#xD;
      declared intolerable. Any patients who do not complete study therapy through the 9-week DLT&#xD;
      observation period for any reasons other than toxicity will be replaced for safety lead-in&#xD;
      assessment. If fewer than two patients experience DLT, the investigators will proceed to&#xD;
      expansion to complete enrollment of 15 patients in Stage 1. Following enrollment of stage&#xD;
      one, accrual will pause for analysis of efficacy. If 6 or fewer of the 15 patients are&#xD;
      progression-free at 6 months, the investigators will halt the study for futility. If 7 or&#xD;
      more patients are free from progression, then the investigators will proceed with enrollment&#xD;
      of 13 additional patients to complete stage 2. the investigators are powered to detect&#xD;
      improvement in 6-month PFS rate to 63.4% with the combination over the 43.4% historical&#xD;
      PFS6mo.&#xD;

             judgment of the interventional radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If&#xD;

             will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Females of child bearing potential that are sexually active must agree to either&#xD;
             practice 2 medically accepted highly effective methods of contraception at the same&#xD;
             time or abstain from heterosexual intercourse from the time of signing the informed&#xD;
             consent through 120 days after the last dose of study drug. See Appendix B for&#xD;

               -  Conception while on treatment must be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with&#xD;
             the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents (within 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to Cycle 1, Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 or&#xD;
             has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;

             or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks&#xD;
             earlier. Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy or alopecia are an exception to this&#xD;
             criterion and may qualify for the study. Note: If subject received major surgery, they&#xD;
             must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the&#xD;
             intervention prior to starting therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Additional known malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis or leptomeningeal disease. Subjects with previously treated brain&#xD;
             metastases may participate provided they are stable based on the following: 1) MRI&#xD;
             brain obtained during screening evaluations shows no radiographic evidence of&#xD;
             progression or new lesions, 2) any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline, 3)&#xD;
             no requirement for steroids for at least 28 days prior to trial treatment. This&#xD;
             exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of&#xD;
             clinical stability. Patients without a known history of brain metastases do not&#xD;
             require screening brain MRI prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
