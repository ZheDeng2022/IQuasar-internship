  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti PD-1 monoclonal antibodies (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) alone or in association with&#xD;
      antiCTLA4 (Ipilimumab) are established as indisputable treatment of metastatic melanoma, with&#xD;
      unprecedented overall survival, and are indicated for first-line treatment including patients&#xD;
      with BRAF mutation. Given their high molecular weight, their penetration in the brain&#xD;
      sanctuary is uncertain and relies on disruption of the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) which occurs&#xD;
      occasionally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SonoCloud® is an implantable device delivering low intensity pulsed UltraSound (US). Along&#xD;
      with systemic injection of an US resonator, SonoCloud® demonstrated safe and efficient at&#xD;
      repetitively opening the BBB. The investigators anticipate that BBB opening could help at&#xD;
      increasing brain penetration of monoclonal antibodies and potentially boosting immunity in&#xD;
      the brain. This could translate in controlling brain disease with the same magnitude as for&#xD;
      extra-cranial disease. This would also open avenues for optimizing the treatment of brain&#xD;
      metastases in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in many other cancers.&#xD;

    <description>Dose with the highest probability of BBB opening efficacy without toxicity directly related to the ultrasound emission.&#xD;
Toxicity evaluation:&#xD;
Safety will be assessed clinically and using brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An electroencephalogram will be performed only if clinically needed. Dose-Limiting-Toxicities (DLTs) evaluation will be done during the first 4 weeks of treatment for Nivolumab treatment and 6 weeks for Nivolumab + Ipilimumab treatment. DLTs directly related to the ultrasound emission are defined as occurrence of an adverse effect during the first administration of treatment, such as: :&#xD;
neurological deficit within 2 days after the procedure and persistent at day 15;&#xD;
localized brain edema not preexisting to the procedure;&#xD;
occurrence of cerebral median line deviation not controlled by routine treatment or requiring salvage surgical procedure;&#xD;

    <description>The SonoCloud System is an active implantable medical. The SonoCloud is indicated to locally and transiently increase the permeability of the blood brain barrier to facilitate the passage of substances into the cerebral parenchyma.&#xD;
The SonoCloud System consists of :&#xD;
an implantable ultrasound transducer,&#xD;
a needle connection device,&#xD;
an external radiofrequency generator, and&#xD;
an ultrasound resonator. The SonoCloud® is designed to be fixed to the skull. The device is placed in a burr hole or in place of a bone flap and ultrasound energy is delivered directly to the brain tissue, without traversing the skull bone. The device is activated by connecting the implant to the external generator system using the transdermal needle. Once connected to the external generator, the implant delivers low-intensity pulsed UltraSound (US) for duration of 120-270 seconds. A total of 3 US dose levels will be evaluated (0.78, 0.9 and 1.03 MPa).</description>
