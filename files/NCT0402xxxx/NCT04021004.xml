  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A self-designed qualitative questionnaire survey was used to investigate opinions and views&#xD;
      among thirty Physiotherapists practising in the UK, who had undertaken formal training in&#xD;
      Pilates exercise therapy to treat people with MSK conditions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pilates is a popular exercise therapy approach that focuses on strength, core stability,&#xD;
      flexibility, muscle control, and posture (Wells et al., 2014). This approach has evolved over&#xD;
      time, to form a valuable therapeutic tool in the prevention and rehabilitation of a variety&#xD;
      of injuries (Di Lorenzo, 2011). More recently, Pilates has become increasingly popular due to&#xD;
      its wide-ranging health benefits for individuals with a range of MSK (musculoskeletal)&#xD;
      disorders, as well as other conditions (Byrnes, Wu, &amp; Whillier, 2018). This method has become&#xD;
      more commercially recognised and accessible through various professional institutions. The&#xD;
      Australian Physiotherapy &amp; Pilates Institute (APPI), is a globally run organisation licensed&#xD;
      in sixteen countries, delivering over 17000 classes per year, as a &quot;graduated system of&#xD;
      specific exercise rehabilitation&quot; (Appihealthgroup.com, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the UK, Pilates based exercise therapy is used within both the National Health Service&#xD;
      (NHS) and private healthcare sectors in the management of low back pain (LBP), general MSK&#xD;
      pain, and various degenerative conditions (Yamato et al. 2015). An estimated 17.8 million&#xD;
      people live with a musculoskeletal condition in the UK, around 28.9% of the total population&#xD;
      (Global Burden of Disease network, 2016). Over 8.75 million people aged 45 and over have&#xD;
      sought treatment for osteoarthritis (Arthritis Research UK, 2013), for which the main&#xD;
      management strategy is exercise-based therapy. MSK healthcare services are under increasing&#xD;
      pressure to provide care to the ageing population, and tackle the healthcare impact&#xD;
      associated with inactivity (Hubbard et al., 2004). Group based exercise such as class&#xD;
      Pilates, offers an accessible opportunity to increase activity levels in such individuals&#xD;
      (Karlsson, Gerdle, Takala, Andersson, &amp; Larsson, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is considerable evidence that Pilates has numerous physical benefits and may improve&#xD;
      self-management of MSK conditions. This includes a wealth of quantitative research, several&#xD;
      systematic reviews have demonstrated positive improvements on pain, quality of life and&#xD;
      functionality (Aladro-Gonzalvo, Araya-Vargas, Machado-DÃ­az, &amp; Salazar-Rojas, 2013; Byrnes et&#xD;
      al., 2018). However, of the Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) reviewed, high levels of&#xD;
      heterogeneity were reported, in terms of sample (sub-types of back pain), exercise selection,&#xD;
      delivery and frequency of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to this, there is a dearth of qualitative research evaluating Pilates as a&#xD;
      treatment approach, mostly focusing on LBP populations (Gaskell &amp; Williams, 2018). These&#xD;
      methods can be valuable to review the definition, scope and rationale of Pilates treatment&#xD;
      methods used by Physiotherapists, to provide optimum rehabilitation. Use of a qualitative&#xD;
      approach could also gain understanding of how Physiotherapists utilise Pilates for a range of&#xD;
      conditions other than LBP (Wells et al., 2014). Therefore, this study aims to investigate the&#xD;
      variation in Pilates delivery and why, and in line with previous qualitative studies, further&#xD;
      explore the perceived benefits, risks and rationale for this exercise approach. This is the&#xD;
      first study to review NHS and private physiotherapists in their use of Pilates group&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To participate in the study and complete the survey, it was specified that&#xD;
             participants needed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Have undertaken some form of formal Pilates instruction training, such as the&#xD;
                  Matwork Foundation Pilates courses with the APPI (Australian Physiotherapy and&#xD;
                  Pilates Institute) or BCP (Body Control Pilates, 2018). Physiotherapists did not&#xD;
                  have to be a fully certified instructor to participate in the study, however,&#xD;
                  they must have completed a minimum of one formal Pilates Instruction course.&#xD;
                  Participants were required to specify this in the demographics section of the&#xD;
                  survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Be registered with the HCPC (Health and Care Professions council) to currently&#xD;
                  practice as a Physiotherapist without restriction in the UK. The reasoning for&#xD;
                  only surveying Physiotherapists is in keeping with the rationale of previous&#xD;
                  studies (Wells et al., 2014; Allen, 2014; Brennan and French, 2008). Who have&#xD;
                  advocated that including only Physiotherapists with formal Pilates training&#xD;
                  guarantees similar standards of practice of participants, as standards and&#xD;
                  qualification level may vary otherwise. Additionally, extending the survey to&#xD;
                  other practioners would make further comparisons challenging through data&#xD;
                  analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Be computer literate, have e-mail access, time to commit to completion of the&#xD;
                  survey, and ability to understand written English language.&#xD;
