    <textblock>
      Generalized aggressive Periodontitis (GAgP) and chronic periodontitis (CP) are inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases. Little is known about molecular changes and signaling cascade of host response.&#xD;
      Inflammatory diseases are undercontrol of genetic and enviromental factors. Transcription&#xD;
      factors are gene-specific factors that are often considered to act as a link connecting&#xD;
      genetic and enviromental factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the gene regions that are thought to play a role in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of GAgP and CP, and to interpret new and reliable pathognomonic-prognostic&#xD;
      markers in the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases with the help of expression and&#xD;
      mutation analyzes and polymorphism studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Generalized aggressive Periodontitis (GAgP) is a multifactorial, destructive, inflammatory&#xD;
      and complex disease. The progression of the disease is undercontrol of immunologic,&#xD;
      microbiologic, environmental and genetic factors. The immunologic and genetic factors are not&#xD;
      clearly defined yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic periodontitis (CP) is an infectious disease resulting within the supporting tissues&#xD;
      of the teeth. It is commonly detected in adults. CP is initiated and sustained by bacterial&#xD;
      plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both AgP and CP are inflammatory diseases. Little is known about molecular changes and&#xD;
      signaling cascade of host response. Inflammatory diseases are undercontrol of genetic and&#xD;
      environmental factors. Transcription factors are gene-specific factors that are often&#xD;
      considered to act as a link connecting genetic and environmental factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is a continuation project. In the previous 2 studies which were conducted and&#xD;
      published with the support of TÜBİTAK 1001 and KOU BAP, it was found 2 gene regions thought&#xD;
      to have an effect on GAgP and KP pathogenesis by genomics, proteomics and immunohistochemical&#xD;
      methods; MZB1 and ECH1. The aim of this study is to confirm these gene regions by gene&#xD;
      expression analysis, mutation analysis and polymorphism studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, there was no study on the genome analysis, protein activity and&#xD;
      immunohistochemical examination of these genes in the CP and GAgP. There was no study that&#xD;
      evaluated the expression, mutation and polymorphism studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 2 steps of the study were completed with the support provided by Kocaeli University&#xD;
      Scientific Research Project Unit [119.500,00 TL (KOU BAP 2013/5)] and TUBITAK [(TÜBİTAK 1001&#xD;
      214S008, 261.500,00 TL)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the gene regions that are thought to play a role in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of GAgP and CP, and to interpret new and reliable pathognomonic-prognostic&#xD;
      markers in the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases with the help of expression and&#xD;
      mutation analyzes and polymorphism studies. Gene sites identified and clinically relevant in&#xD;
      this study will serve as the basis for another study in which these genes are aimed at&#xD;
      silencing.,,,&#xD;
