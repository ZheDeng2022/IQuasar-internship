      This is a multicenter phase IIb study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of&#xD;
      ModraDoc006 in combination with ritonavir (denoted ModraDoc006/r) in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer, suitable for treatment with a taxane.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label 1:1 randomized Phase IIb trial to determine the efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of oral ModraDoc006/r versus i.v. docetaxel in mCRPC subjects. Cohort 1 will&#xD;
      receive i.v. docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 Q3W. Cohort 2 will receive 30 mg ModraDoc006 in&#xD;
      combination with 200 mg ritonavir in the morning and 20 mg ModraDoc006 in combination with&#xD;
      100 mg ritonavir in the evening (7-12 hours after the morning dose), on Day 1, 8 and 15 of a&#xD;
      21-day cycle. All patients will also receive 5 mg oral prednisone twice daily. Treatment in&#xD;
      both cohorts will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or&#xD;
      discontinuation for any other reason. The end of the trial is defined as the time point when&#xD;
      all subjects have discontinued trial treatment and have been given follow-up for safety&#xD;
      measurements according to the trial assessment schedule.&#xD;

The treatment outcome will be estimated and used as the basis for the design of the future pivotal phase 3 trial. The sample size of 50 evaluable patients per cohort will provide a sufficiently precise point estimate of the primary endpoint ORR in both groups to calculate the sample size for the pivotal study.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. It has two components: health state description and evaluation.&#xD;
In the description part, health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in &quot;work, study, housework, family or leisure activities&quot;. In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using three-level (EQ-5D-3L) or five-level (EQ-5D-5L) scale.&#xD;
In the evaluation part, the respondents evaluate their overall health status using the visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS).</description>
