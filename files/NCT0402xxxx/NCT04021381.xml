  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of urolithiasis is around 10 % in the French population. It is thus a major&#xD;
      public health issue. When the stone is not spontaneously removed, interventions such as&#xD;
      extracorporeal lithotripsy or flexible ureteroscopy (F-URS) are performed. F-URS is usually&#xD;
      preferred in renal stones &gt; 7 mm in comparison with lithotripsy, with better results.&#xD;
      Efficacy of ureteroscopy is based on the &quot;stone-free rate&quot; (SFR) at 3 months. A SFR index is&#xD;
      assessed according to the existence of residual fragments and their size. SFR score 1&#xD;
      (fragment ≤ 1mm) has been poorly studied, and is supposed to occur in 60% of cases. These&#xD;
      residual fragments account for the high frequency of recurrence, probably favored by crystals&#xD;
      aggregation and growth of these fragments under supersaturated urines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, calcium stones risk factors are urine supersaturation and crystal growth inhibitors&#xD;
      deficiency. Citrate is the major crystal growth inhibitor in human urine. A hypocitraturia is&#xD;
      reported in half of the lithiasic population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, citrate salts appear as an interesting therapeutic option, in order to slow&#xD;
      crystal growth but also to chelate calcium, and consequently to solubilize stones in situ.&#xD;
      However, to date, there is no available controlled study after surgical intervention such as&#xD;
      flexible ureteroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the investigator's study is to evaluate the efficacy of a 3-month potassium and&#xD;
      magnesium citrate treatment following ureteroscopy on the elimination of residual fragments&#xD;
      (SFR score 1).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The screening visit takes place 3 months to 3 days before the baseline visit. Patient will be&#xD;
      informed of the study protocol by the surgeon who will perform the flexible ureteroscopy. As&#xD;
      usual in clinical practice, a CT scan will be routinely performed. CT-scan interpretation&#xD;
      will be centralized and performed blindly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the ureteroscopy day (baseline visit: Some sites, according to their usual practice, may&#xD;
      admit their patients to hospital the day before the surgery (D-1)), inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be checked by the surgeon. A second information on the study protocol will be&#xD;
      given and the protocol consent will be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of hospital admission, blood and urine will be collected by a nurse in order to&#xD;
      define stone risk factors and other comorbidities after informed consent of the patients.&#xD;
      Then patients will undergo ureteroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stone fragments will be sent for analysis to the stone centre Laboratory (Tenon Hospital,&#xD;
      Paris) with images of the stones during surgery (morphoconstitutional analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized for treatment within 7 days following F-URS, and after&#xD;
      verification of randomization criteria. If the randomisation criteria are not completed, the&#xD;
      patient will end its participation to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Else, the patient is randomized and treatment for 3 months (placebo or citrate salts,&#xD;
      blinded) will be delivered by the investigational site and administration will begin the day&#xD;
      following surgery, thus discharge. A 33 cl glass will be provided for the administration of&#xD;
      the treatment. Furthermore 24-hour urine collection will be explained and patients will be&#xD;
      given the vessel in order to collect urine at M3 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of study visit will take place at 3 months +/- 10 days after ureteroscopy visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical check-up by the urologist in charge, including a CT-scan and blood and urine&#xD;
      biological tests under randomized treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized treatment will be stopped the day of this M3 visit. Adverse events (including drug&#xD;
      tolerance, urinary symptoms) and date of stent removal if any will be collected. Compliance&#xD;
      will be assessed, using a log book.&#xD;
