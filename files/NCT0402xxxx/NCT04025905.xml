  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social cognition impairments, frequently encountered in Serial Mental Illness, reduce the&#xD;
      ability to find and to keep a job. Cognitive remediation and social cognition training reduce&#xD;
      the impact of cognitive impairments on work outcomes . The purpose of this research is to&#xD;
      associate a social cognition training program to vocational rehabilitation in the transition&#xD;
      network (transitional Workforce Assistance Facilities and Services) to help people to&#xD;
      maintain their jobs and to access to work in an ordinary environment. To support the&#xD;
      development of social cognition interventions, additional care (users will retain their usual&#xD;
      medical follow-up) will be implemented within the Workforce Assistance Facilities and&#xD;
      Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is part of a strong partnership between the Cognitive remediation network&#xD;
      (health sector: rehabilitation centers) and the Transition network (medico-social sector:&#xD;
      three Workforce Assistance Facilities and Services having partnerships with rehabilitation&#xD;
      centers). This partnership has been experienced previously in the RemedRehab project funded&#xD;
      by the 2012 hospital clinical research program (PHRC). This project was recently completed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social cognition training concomitant to work help to maintain employment in transitional&#xD;
      Workforce Assistance Facilities and Services .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will be offered to anyone with severe psychic disorders and a&#xD;
      social cognition disorder who started working in one of the transitional Workforce Assistance&#xD;
      Facilities and Services in the year prior to inclusion to limit selection bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population is defined by the transitional Workforce Assistance Facilities and&#xD;
      Services users involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis is not included in the inclusion criteria. It will, however, be established&#xD;
      according to DSM-5 criteria for included users, who will benefit from a semi-structured&#xD;
      interview .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefits in the social cognition training programgroup are: best job maintaining&#xD;
      rate in transitional Workforce Assistance Facilities and Services , improvement of social&#xD;
      cognition, improvement of interpersonal skills, improvement of self-esteem, improvement of&#xD;
      professional insertion and improvement of the patient's vision of his place in society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in information group may expect benefits on socialization and&#xD;
      empowerment.&#xD;
