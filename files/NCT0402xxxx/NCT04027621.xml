      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of remote ischemic&#xD;
      conditioning combined with intravenous thrombolysis in treating acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, cases of ischemic stroke who undergo intravenous thrombolysis within 4.5 hours&#xD;
      from onset are included. The experimental group receive basic treatment and remote ischemic&#xD;
      conditioning for 200mmHg, 2 times within 6 hours to 24 hours from thrombolysis. The control&#xD;
      group receive basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning control for 60mmHg, 2 times&#xD;
      within 6 hours to 24 hours from thrombolysis . Two groups will be followed up for 90 days to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of remote ischemic conditioning combined with intravenous&#xD;
      thrombolysis in treating acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
