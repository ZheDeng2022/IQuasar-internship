      This is an exploratory qualitative study to understand the needs of patients with&#xD;
      pneumoconiosis, and the care-giving experience of their family caregivers. Patients with a&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of pneumoconiosis for at least 1 year and had registered with the&#xD;
      Pneumoconiosis Compensation Fund Board in Hong Kong to receive compensation will be eligible&#xD;
      to join this study. The respective family caregivers of these patients, who are 21 years of&#xD;
      age or older, assuming the role as the primary caregivers of a pneumoconiosis patient who&#xD;
      have registered with the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Fund Board will be invited to join. The&#xD;
      nurse will carry out an individual in-depth qualitative interview at patient's home. The&#xD;
      nurse will also conduct a home environment assessment. After obtaining the written consent,&#xD;
      an interview guide with a list of open-ended questions will be used to elicit the illness&#xD;
      experience and self-care needs of the pneumoconiosis patients and the caregiving experience&#xD;
      of their family caregivers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumoconiosis is a fibrotic pulmonary disease resulting from workplace exposure to hazardous&#xD;
      dusts containing free silica or asbestos, which causes irreversible progressive respiratory&#xD;
      impairment among the sufferers. These patients may experience disabling symptoms (e.g.&#xD;
      progressive severe dyspnea, chronic and uncontrolled cough, sputum production, fatigue,&#xD;
      activity intolerance, decreased mobility and sleep disturbance) despite optimal medical&#xD;
      treatment. Pneumoconiosis is considered as a chronic, progressive and incurable disease which&#xD;
      requires long-term comprehensive rehabilitation services and support. Effective disease&#xD;
      management relies on engaging patients in long-term comprehensive rehabilitation. The overall&#xD;
      aim of this study is to explore the illness experience and needs of patients with&#xD;
      pneumoconiosis, and the caregiving experience of their respective family caregivers through&#xD;
      home visits. The findings will provide important insight into the development of an effective&#xD;
      and tailor-made support program for patients with pneumoconiosis in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exploratory qualitative study to understand the needs of patients with&#xD;
      pneumoconiosis, and the care-giving experience of their family caregivers. Patients with a&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of pneumoconiosis for at least 1 year and had registered with the&#xD;
      Pneumoconiosis Compensation Fund Board in Hong Kong to receive compensation will be eligible&#xD;
      to join this study. The respective family caregivers of these patients, who are 21 years of&#xD;
      age or older, assuming the role as the primary caregivers of a pneumoconiosis patient who&#xD;
      have registered with the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Fund Board will be invited to join. The&#xD;
      nurse will carry out an individual in-depth qualitative interview at patient's home. The&#xD;
      nurse will also conduct a home environment assessment, as the home environment plays an&#xD;
      important role in promoting or restricting performance of everyday tasks of people with&#xD;
      disabling chronic diseases and their caregivers. The interviews will be conducted with the&#xD;
      patients and the caregivers separately, so they can talk openly and confidentiality is&#xD;
      guaranteed. Prior to commencement of the data collection, the nurse will provide an&#xD;
      information sheet to solicit participants' understanding about the nature of the study, their&#xD;
      rights and confidentiality issues. After obtaining the written consent, an interview guide&#xD;
      with a list of open-ended questions will be used to elicit the illness experience and&#xD;
      self-care needs of the pneumoconiosis patients and the caregiving experience of their family&#xD;
      caregivers. All the interviews will be audio-taped after obtaining the permission from the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore the illness experience and needs of patients with pneumoconiosis&#xD;
      and the care-giving experience of their caregivers. Specifically, the objectives of this&#xD;
      study are as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand the self-care behaviors and illness experience of patients with&#xD;
           pneumoconiosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the needs of patients with pneumoconiosis when managing the disease at home&#xD;
           and in the community&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand the caregiving experience of the family caregivers of patients with&#xD;
           pneumoconiosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the caregivers' needs when taking care of patients with pneumoconiosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore how disease management and caregiving take place in patients' home&#xD;
           environment and to identify the environment-related facilitators and barriers for&#xD;
           managing pneumoconiosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the interview, the nurse will also conduct a home environment assessment with a&#xD;
      standard environmental checklist to evaluate the home for safety, modification needs and ease&#xD;
      of mobility. Such assessment would provide valuable information to inform the needs of&#xD;
      pneumoconiosis patients and their caregivers when they participate community-based and&#xD;
      home-based rehabilitative activities. The assessment includes the environment outside and&#xD;
      within patients' home environment, such as any difficulties in accessing the entrance of the&#xD;
      building (e.g. barrier-free entryway, no elevator for one or more floor), the use of&#xD;
      equipment or adaptations in the home to aid in daily activities, such as rails and commodes.&#xD;
      The commonly seen home environmental hazards will also be assessed, such as the exposure to&#xD;
      second-hand smoking, the use of nonskid mats in bathroom, grab bars in the shower or tub,&#xD;
      spacing and entryway in the bathroom and bedroom. Each of the item will be assessed to&#xD;
      solicit a 'no problem observed' or 'problem observed'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The audio-taped qualitative data will be transcribed verbatim by the research nurse. Content&#xD;
      analysis will be adopted for the data analysis. In particular, the qualitative data will be&#xD;
      analyzed to seek a better understanding of what and how the patients and the caregivers can&#xD;
      be supported in their disease self-care and caregiving trajectory. The emerged themes from&#xD;
      the qualitative data will be used to optimize the patient support program in the subsequent&#xD;
      quantitative phase of the study. The home environment assessment data will be summarized by&#xD;
      appropriate numbers and percentages.&#xD;
