      Our goal is to examine linkages between physical activity, appetite control, and energy&#xD;
      metabolism in adolescents. We will assess metabolic function and appetite control in male and&#xD;
      female adolescents stratified by bodyweight and physical activity using across-sectional&#xD;
      study design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is the most serious public health problem of the 21st century, given the&#xD;
      prevalence, global reach, and widespread health, economic, and social consequences. While&#xD;
      weight gain at the most basic level is due to a chronic energy surplus, there are a host of&#xD;
      influences that act on the energy balance system that remain largely unknown. Thus, there is&#xD;
      a critical need to identify previously unexamined factors that may influence the energy&#xD;
      balance system in order to develop effective interventions for prevention and treatment. Our&#xD;
      long-term goal is to quantify the dynamic relationships between various physiological and&#xD;
      psychological components of the energy balance system. Our short-term goal is to examine&#xD;
      linkages between physical activity, appetite control, and energy metabolism in adolescents.&#xD;
      The status quo as it relates to appetite control is that body weight status and related&#xD;
      peripheral signals are a key regulator of energy intake. In contrast to body weight playing a&#xD;
      primary role in energy regulation, our working hypothesis is that high levels of regular&#xD;
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) result in a metabolic phenotype consisting of&#xD;
      enhanced metabolic function and proper regulation of appetite, which prevents the development&#xD;
      of obesity. We have reported that adults with low levels of MVPA have dysregulated appetite&#xD;
      control, evidenced by higher levels of energy intake and elevated levels of dietary&#xD;
      disinhibition. Additionally, we have observed that rats with low fitness possess dysregulated&#xD;
      control of appetite and reduced hepatic fat oxidation compared to rats with high fitness.&#xD;
      Based on these findings in adults and rodents, in addition to supportive work by others, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that low levels of MVPA create a metabolic phenotype, leading to dysregulated&#xD;
      appetite control which predisposes individuals to weight gain. To test this hypothesis we&#xD;
      will perform two studies focused on the links between physical activity and appetite. For&#xD;
      Study 1, we will assess metabolic function and appetite control in male and female&#xD;
      adolescents stratified by bodyweight (normal vs overweight/obese) and physical activity&#xD;
      (sedentary vs. active) using a 2 x 2 cross-sectional study design (N=40). For Study 2, we&#xD;
      will examine the influence of MVPA on the same outcomes by randomly assigning sedentary&#xD;
      overweight/obese adolescents (N=44) to either a structured-exercise group or no treatment&#xD;
      control for three months. The specific aims of the proposed studies are: 1) To examine the&#xD;
      association between physical activity and appetite control in adolescents, with metabolic&#xD;
      function serving as a mediator; and, 2) To test if increased physical activity through an&#xD;
      exercise intervention influences metabolic function and appetite control. At the completion&#xD;
      of the proposed studies, it is our expectation that we will have described the independent&#xD;
      effects of physical activity and body weight on energy metabolism and appetite in&#xD;
      adolescents. This study will have a significant positive impact on the understanding of&#xD;
      energy balance in adolescents, and will inform public health interventions that specifically&#xD;
      target mechanisms associated with weight gain in youth.&#xD;
