  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study investigating folate deficiency (lack of folic acid in the blood) in patients&#xD;
      who take the drug olaparib to treat their advanced ovarian or breast cancer. The primary goal&#xD;
      of this study is to determine the frequency and timing of folate deficiency, and to learn&#xD;
      more about whether giving folic acid supplements (vitamins) will help delay or avoid&#xD;
      deficiency in these patients. Deficiency can cause doctors to reduce or stop treatment with&#xD;
      olaparib. In this case, patients are not getting the best treatment for their cancer due to&#xD;
      the unwanted side effect.&#xD;
