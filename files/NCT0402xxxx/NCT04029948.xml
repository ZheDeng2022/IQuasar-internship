      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      TURBT [transurethral resection of bladder tumor] constitutes a crucial procedure in the&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer. A complete resection should be achieved either in&#xD;
      fractions in bigger, or en-bloc in smaller tumours. The incise and scattering technique is&#xD;
      against all oncological principles, damage caused by heat and fragmentation of the tumour&#xD;
      hampers histological processing. The technique of resection in fractions ignores the&#xD;
      parameter of negative surgical margins, theoretically, liberating tumour cells into the&#xD;
      irrigation fluid, which facilitates their implantation and early recurrence. Furthermore,&#xD;
      pathological staging may be impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The absence of lamina muscularis propria (LMP, detrusor muscle, DM) in the specimen is&#xD;
      associated with a higher risk of residual disease and early recurrence. Absence of LMP is&#xD;
      also associated with lower surgical experience. The frequency of detecting MIBC in the second&#xD;
      resection in initial pT1 ranges from 4 to 25%, and increases to 45% when no LMP was present.&#xD;
      European guidelines 2018, stated that, En-bloc resection using monopolar or bipolar current,&#xD;
      Thulium-YAG or Holmium-YAG laser is feasible in selected exophytic tumours. It provides high&#xD;
      quality resected specimens with the presence of detrusor muscle in 96-100% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Martin-Doyle et al in the large analysis of 15,215 patients to assess recurrence,&#xD;
      progression, and cancer-specific survival (CSS) from 73 studies, the highest impact risk&#xD;
      factor was depth of invasion (T1b/c) into lamina propria (progression: [HR], 3.34; P &lt; .001;&#xD;
      cancer-specific survival: HR, 2.02; P = .001). Other previously proposed factors also&#xD;
      predicted progression and CSS (lymphovascular invasion (LVI), associated CIS, non-use of&#xD;
      bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), tumor size &gt; 3 cm, and older age; HRs for progression between&#xD;
      1.32 and 2.88, P ≤ .002; HRs for CSS between 1.28 and 2.08, P ≤ .02).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2018 EUA guidelines stated that, the depth and extent of invasion into the lamina propria (T1&#xD;
      substaging) has been demonstrated to be of prognostic value in retrospective cohort studies&#xD;
      (LE: 3). Its use is recommended by the most recent 2016 World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      classification. However, the optimal system to substage T1 remains to be defined (Babjuk et&#xD;
      al., 2018). These difficulty may be attributed to muscularis mucosa is only identified in 15%&#xD;
      to 80% of bladder biopsy specimens, though its presence in 90% of radical cystectomy&#xD;
      specimens (Wood, 2012). We have hypothesis that enbloc resection can get muscularis mucosa&#xD;
      rate similar to radical cystectomy specimens rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last decade, the en-bloc resection of bladder tumor (ERBT) as an alternative to TURBT&#xD;
      has gained more and more interest among urologists. Theoretically, ERBT offers three goals:&#xD;
      to improve the resection quality, lowering perioperative complication rates, and decreasing&#xD;
      recurrence rates. A new envisaged goal is also to decrease the number of second TURBTs. By&#xD;
      using the correct ERBT technique, higher DM rates in comparison with TURBT can be achieved&#xD;
      (theoretically up to 100%)(Kramer et al., 2017) In a recent study with more than 2000&#xD;
      patients of pT1 high-grade tumor, the most important parameter that was associated with&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival was the detection of DM within the tissue. The authors stated that&#xD;
      in case that DM is present one may even avoid second resections in high-risk NMIBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a retrospective multicentre study (EBRUC) with 221 patients in 4 arms, median tumour size&#xD;
      was 2.1 cm and largest tumours reached even 5 cm, with LMP being present in 97.3 %. All&#xD;
      techniques have in common that first a circular incision is made in the mucosa around the&#xD;
      tumour. Subsequently, the tumour is dissected en-bloc including muscle layer using&#xD;
      monopolar/bipolar current or holmium/thulium laser energy. Up to date, no clear answer can be&#xD;
      given which patient is suitable for enbloc resection. Roughly, 30% of patients are not&#xD;
      eligible because of tumor size, formation, and localization. The challenge of large specimen&#xD;
      retrieval could be solved using the combination of vaporisation of the exophytic tumour part&#xD;
      and En bloc resection of the tumour ground.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although bipolar current hypothetically be favorable with regard to the obturator nerve&#xD;
      reflex and subsequent bladder perforation (0.9% vs. 6.4%) when compared with monopolar&#xD;
      current. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, Cui et al found no statistically&#xD;
      significant differences in obturator nerve reflex between bipolar and monopolar TURBT (OR=&#xD;
      0.35; 95% CI, 0.06-1.95; P = 0.23) and also no differences on bladder perforation (OR= 0.51;&#xD;
      95% CI, 0.25-1.01; P = .05). European guidelines 2018, stated that though bipolar resection&#xD;
      has been introduced to reduce the risk of complications (e.g., bladder perforation due to&#xD;
      obturator nerve stimulation) and to produce better specimens for the pathologist. Currently,&#xD;
      the results remain controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from a multitude of retrospective cohort or comparison studies, only two prospective,&#xD;
      randomized trials on ERBT have been published. Both studies were performed in China, and&#xD;
      details on statistical preparation, patient selection, and definitions of primary and&#xD;
      secondary goals are missing. Thus, there is still an urgent need a thoroughly planned trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS OF THE WORK&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of laser and electrical enbloc resection of non&#xD;
      muscle invasive bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detect exact criteria of tumours eligible for enbloc resection either by laser or&#xD;
      electro-surgical energy.&#xD;

      Patients will be asked to participate in this study and will be provided with an informed&#xD;
      consent form in line with Good Clinical Practise and the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of participants Patients appointed for an outpatient diagnostic cystoscopy will&#xD;
      be reviewed for the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Legible patients will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in the study and to sign the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Randomization will be performed using computer generated random tables using&#xD;
      stratified blocked randomization in 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      peri procedure work up Preoperative evaluations included: detailed medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, routine blood examination, urinalysis &amp; urine cytology, renal and liver function&#xD;
      tests, ultrasonography, thoracic radiography, computed tomography with contrast scans of the&#xD;
      abdomen and pelvis or MRU, Every patient will undergo cystoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention All the surgeries will be performed in lithotomy position under spinal or&#xD;
      general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group will be managed by 2-micron wave length laser ERBT while the other group will be&#xD;
      managed by electro-surgical ERBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principles of enbloc resection will be applied similarly in both groups by starting the&#xD;
      procedure with circumferential incision few millimetres around the tumour then lifting the&#xD;
      tumour and dissection underneath its muscle base&#xD;

&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Continuous data will be summarized using the mean ± SD and compared by t&#xD;
      test. Categorical variables will be compared using the χ2 test or Fisher's exact test. The&#xD;
      Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 13.0, for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL) will&#xD;
      be applied for statistical analysis. P≤.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
