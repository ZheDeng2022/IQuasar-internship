    <textblock>
      Volume expansion is one of the main treatments for shock, with the goal of increasing cardiac&#xD;
      preload and, consequently, cardiac output. However, this increase only occurs if there is a&#xD;
      preload-dependence of cardiac output, which is present in 50% of cases. A test to predict the&#xD;
      effectiveness of volume expansion prior to administration would avoid the need for excess&#xD;
      treatment if it proves to be unnecessary. The end-expiratory pressure test (PEEP) would be to&#xD;
      vary the PEEP in patients in shock conditions placed under mechanical ventilation. PEEP is&#xD;
      the positive pressure maintained in the airways at the end of expiration. It opposes systemic&#xD;
      venous return and lowers cardiac preload. It also distends the pulmonary vessels, increases&#xD;
      their resistance and opposes the ejection of the right ventricle. The decrease in PEEP could&#xD;
      alleviate the obstacle to venous return and thus increase cardiac preload, mimicking a volume&#xD;
      expansion, increasing cardiac output only in the case of preload dependence. This test would&#xD;
      be an easy alternative to the tests used in current practice. To evaluate the ability of the&#xD;
      PEEP test to detect a preload-dependence condition, defined by a passive passive leg raising&#xD;
      test, in patients in shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve&#xD;
      constructed to describe the ability of the PEEP test to detect a preload-dependency&#xD;
      condition. We measure cardiac output by analysis of the pulse wave contour before and after&#xD;
      the passive leg raising and PEEP test tests, then according to these tests, measurement of&#xD;
      the cardiac output before and after volume expansion.&#xD;
