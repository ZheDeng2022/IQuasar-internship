      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To confirm the safety and feasibility of canakinumab and spartalizumab (PDR-001)&#xD;
           administered using a standard dose / schedule in the neo-adjuvant setting in renal cell&#xD;
           carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immune response to combination canakinumab and spartalizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess anti-tumor activity as measured by pathologic downstaging&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with localized and non-metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) represent an &quot;at-need&quot;&#xD;
      population who would benefit from immunotherapy earlier in their disease course with a PD-1&#xD;
      therapy combined with a second immunotherapy agent. A logical next step is to pursue the&#xD;
      combination of an anti-PD1 therapy with CTLA-4 blockade extrapolating from recent successes&#xD;
      in the metastatic setting. The primary concern with previous approaches and studies is that&#xD;
      CTLA-4 based therapy is associated with increased risk of autoimmune side effects which&#xD;
      potentially could delay a curative surgery. Clearly, the neoadjuvant setting in RCC&#xD;
      represents an ideal space to evaluate novel I/O combination strategies aside from CTLA-4&#xD;
      blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to confirm the safety and feasibility of canakinumab and spartalizumab&#xD;
      (PDR-001) administered using a standard dose / schedule in the neo-adjuvant setting in renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma. This is a single-center, single arm, open-label pilot study evaluating the&#xD;
      feasibility, safety, anti-tumor effect, and immunogenicity of neoadjuvant canakinumab and&#xD;
      spartalizumab given prior to radical nephrectomy in patients with localized renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma. Patients will be recruited from the outpatient Urology clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive canakinumab at a dose of 300 mg Q4weeks and spartalizumab at&#xD;
      400 mg Q4weeks IV. Approximately 14 days after the last dose of canakinumab and&#xD;
      spartalizumab, patients with proceed to radical nephrectomy, and nephrectomy tissue will be&#xD;
      examined for the secondary endpoints. Follow-up evaluation for adverse events will occur 30&#xD;
      days and 90 days after surgery. Patients will then be followed by their urologists and&#xD;
      oncologist according to standard institutional practices, but will require repeat labs every&#xD;
      3 months along with standard of care surveillance imaging.&#xD;
