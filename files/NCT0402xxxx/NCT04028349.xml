             method of birth control, as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative urine β-human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin (β-hCG) pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine β-hCG pregnancy&#xD;

                  purpose is to reduce viral load to undetectable levels. Mono- or bitherapy will&#xD;
                  not be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. HAART is considered stable if participants did not change their ARVs within the&#xD;
                  last 4 consecutive weeks prior to start of screening. Changes in formulations are&#xD;
                  allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Participant must be willing to continue their HAART throughout the study as&#xD;
                  directed by their local physician.&#xD;

             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illnesses or clinically significant&#xD;
             disease), diagnosed on the basis of physical examination, medical history and the&#xD;
             investigator's clinical judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
