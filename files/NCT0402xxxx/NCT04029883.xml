  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension represents a major cardiovascular risk factor that can be controlled through the&#xD;
      use of medications, yet medication non-adherence represents a common problem that leaves&#xD;
      patients at elevated risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Interventions to improve&#xD;
      medication adherence have thus far been either unsuccessful or unsustainable. The&#xD;
      investigators propose an intervention that leverages insights from behavioral economics to&#xD;
      improve medication adherence among hypertensive patients. Strong data indicates that linking&#xD;
      the taking of medications to daily routines ('anchoring') increases adherence, however,&#xD;
      existing interventions built on this information have failed to create successful, long term&#xD;
      improvements in medication adherence. This study aims to leverage behavioral economic&#xD;
      insights to improve medication adherence to antihypertensive medications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to complement linking medication taking to a daily routine with two&#xD;
      added components to make it easier for participants to stick to their anchoring plan:&#xD;
      increasing information salience through frequent text messages and providing intermittent&#xD;
      rewards for pill-taking according to the anchoring plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be implemented in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a high-volume&#xD;
      clinical practice to establish feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. The&#xD;
      specific aims include 1) a formative phase to develop the intervention and evaluate its&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability via focus groups with key stakeholders; 2) a RCT of 60&#xD;
      hypertensive patients in which a control group (n=20) is provided education on anchoring&#xD;
      medication taking to a daily routine, and two intervention groups, one (n=20) who receives&#xD;
      anchoring education and daily text message reminders and another (n=20) which receives&#xD;
      anchoring education, text messages, and financial incentives for adherence in accordance with&#xD;
      their anchoring plan; and 3) data collection in preparation for a future R01 application,&#xD;
      including focus group discussions with key stakeholders (patients, providers [Physicians,&#xD;
      Nurses, Advanced Care Practitioners, Pharmacists] and clinic staff) and exit focus groups&#xD;
      with study participants regarding ways to improve the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is: the intervention is effective by anchoring pill-taking to an existing&#xD;
      routine, tested by comparing the pooled (Message group + Incentive group) vs. the Control&#xD;
      group. The secondary hypothesis is: adding incentives to the text messages is more effective&#xD;
      for routinizing pill-taking (testing outcomes in the Incentive group vs. Message group).&#xD;
      Outcomes from this study have the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of the&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators of medication adherence among hypertensive patients and potentially&#xD;
      provide evidence for a low-cost and scalable intervention to improve medication adherence in&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;

    <description>The Control group will receive care as usual, as well as a MEMS-cap and a leaflet explaining the importance of pill-taking routines and how to establish them. The study coordinator will spend approximately ten minutes with them to go over the leaflet and answer questions. Control group participants also spend time with the study coordinator at each clinic visit where contact information is updated, and any MEMS-cap problems are resolved. These procedures, which we successfully applied in previous studies, minimize the possibility that results are confounded by differences in attention or other non-specific effects between groups.</description>

    <description>The Message group will receive the same brief information session as the Control group but also receive daily text messages reinforcing the information provided for 3 months. A key insight from BE is that people typically are initially highly motivated to change their behavior, but their enthusiasm declines over time. To keep the importance of routinizing pill- taking salient (i.e. high on a person's mental priority list), we will send daily text messages using a freely available web platform. These messages will reinforce the information provided at recruitment, and remind participants of their personalized routinization strategy. Messages will be tailored and refreshed based on patient-specific factors including BP control, prior adherence, and current medication regimen.</description>

    <description>The Incentive group will receive the same information and text messages, but in addition have a chance of winning small, intermittent rewards for taking their medication at the time coinciding with their anchoring strategy. In this group, participants will be eligible for a prize drawing if they take their medication within +/- 1 hour of the time they carry out their existing routine behavior on at least 80% of days between clinic visits. When the participants return for their monthly visit, the study coordinator will download their MEMS-cap data and check whether this eligibility criteria was satisfied. MEMS software can be easily customized to display this information. If the patient qualifies, s/he is invited to draw one of three laminated cards with numbers 0, 25, and 50 out of a bag. The client receives the corresponding amount in USD in the form of a gift card immediately after the drawing.</description>
