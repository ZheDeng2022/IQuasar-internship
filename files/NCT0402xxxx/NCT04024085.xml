      The aim of the study is to create a specific test to assess the global time required to go to&#xD;
      the toilet and to perform micturition, at the moment the patient decides to urinate in&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis population, and to assess its reliability.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are frequent in central nervous system disorders&#xD;
      especially in patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Prevalence of LUTS is important (32 to&#xD;
      96.8%) and increases with the multiple sclerosis (MS) duration and the severity of the&#xD;
      neurological deficiencies and disabilities. Overactive bladder with urgency, frequency, urge&#xD;
      incontinence, is the most common symptom, reported by 37-99% of the PwMS. OAB not only&#xD;
      impacts quality of life but overactive detrusor associated with detrusor sphincter&#xD;
      dyssynergia can lead to upper urinary tract alteration (reflux, dilatation, urinary tract&#xD;
      infection). In the absence of risk factor, the treatment aims to improve comfort and quality&#xD;
      of life. Anticholinergic drugs are usually the first-line treatment, but their frequent&#xD;
      adverse effects (constipation, xerostomia, cognitive impairment) may impact compliance and&#xD;
      adherence. The warning time (defined as the time between the first desire to void and the&#xD;
      micturition impossible to defer) only partially reflects the possibilities of continence.&#xD;
      Indeed, other numerous and various factors such as patient mobility, autonomy for transfers,&#xD;
      speed of undressing, etc., can influence the global time between the first alert (first&#xD;
      desire to void) and the imperious micturition and thus on the risk of incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The global time required to go to the toilet and undress is difficult to quantify and no&#xD;
      specific and validated test is available for this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to create a specific test to assess the global time required to go to&#xD;
      the toilet and to perform micturition, at the moment the patient decides to urinate in&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis population, and to assess its reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators develop a new tool to assess the global time required to go&#xD;
      to the toilet until patients are ready to void: Time to be Ready to Void (TRV). The different&#xD;
      stages to go to the toilet are individualized, and two prior steps are defined: a mobility&#xD;
      stage starting when the examiner gives the starting signal, includes the stand up, the walk&#xD;
      to the toilets, and stops when the patient puts his hand on the door handle; and a settled&#xD;
      stage starting as soon as the subject has his hand on the door handle, until he is undressed&#xD;
      and in his usual and secure position to void. The &quot;interval&quot; or &quot;lap&quot; function of the&#xD;
      chronometer is used to facilitate the recording. Difficulty of each stage is assessed by a&#xD;
      4-point Likert type scale with 3 indicating ''no difficulty'' and 0 indicating ''impossible&#xD;
      or necessitate human help&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was approved by the local ethics review board RCB: 2018-A01644-51. Participants&#xD;
      will be recruited in a Neuro-urology department during a medical appointment, an urodynamic&#xD;
      assessment, or a day hospital related to urinary disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EDSS score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinary Symptom Profile score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data of the last urodynamic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  need to void with numerical scale between 0 and 10 before the test&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess inter-rater reliability, two examiners record the first TRV try with both a digital&#xD;
      chronometer. To assess reliability of the TRV, a second try is done after at least 10 minutes&#xD;
      of rest, with one of the two examiners, checking that the need to void has not changed&#xD;
      significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the internal consistency of the TRV, further tests are carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a 10-meter walk test (10MWT) at maximum speed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a Timed Up and Go (TUG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a Tinetti Mobility Test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the self-questionnaire Fall Efficacy Scale International for balance evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a bilateral Nine Hold Peg (NHP) Test for dexterity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the Katz - activities of daily living index (Katz ADL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed with the R software for Windows (Rx64 3.2.3, R&#xD;
      Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Descriptive data will be presented as&#xD;
      means with SD for continuous data and as medians with range for ordinal data and data not&#xD;
      normally distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter-rater reliability and test-re test reliability will be assessed using intra-class&#xD;
      correlation coefficient (ICC, absolute agreement). Internal consistency with the&#xD;
      complementary tests will be assessed using Spearman correlation.&#xD;
