    <textblock>
      The presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of prostate cancer patients has&#xD;
      been shown to be an important indicator of metastatic disease and poor prognosis.&#xD;
      Additionally, changes in CTC number throughout treatment have been demonstrated to reflect&#xD;
      therapy response. However, the CellSearch® (Menarini-Silicon Biosystems) is the only FDA- and&#xD;
      Health Canada-cleared CTC platform available at the present time, and is thus considered the&#xD;
      current &quot;gold standard&quot; for clinical CTC analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notably, CTCs are undetectable in ~35% of metastatic CRPC patients. This suggests that either&#xD;
      CTCs are truly not present in &gt;1/3 of patients with advanced metastatic disease; and/or that&#xD;
      CTCs are present but not detectable as they do not meet the standard CellSearch® definition&#xD;
      of CTCs. Given the accumulating evidence that prostate cancer cells can lose epithelial&#xD;
      characteristics as they evolve towards a more metastatic phenotype, the investigators believe&#xD;
      the latter scenario is most likely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process during embryonic&#xD;
      development and cancer metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the role of androgen receptor (AR) signaling in EMT is poorly understood, studies&#xD;
      have also demonstrated that EMT may be facilitated by androgen deprivation,&#xD;
      castration-resistance, and/or disruption of androgen signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, several clinical studies have demonstrated that CTCs with a purely mesenchymal&#xD;
      phenotype are undetectable by CellSearch®, but that the presence of mesenchymal marker&#xD;
      expression on CTCs with a hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype is indicative of poor&#xD;
      prognosis. In addition, previous pre-clinical data from the Allan laboratory has demonstrated&#xD;
      that in animal models, prostate cancers with a mesenchymal phenotype shed greater numbers of&#xD;
      CTCs more quickly and with greater metastatic capacity than those with an epithelial&#xD;
      phenotype. Notably, the clinically-used CellSearch®-based assay captured the majority of CTCs&#xD;
      shed during early-stage disease in vivo, and only after the establishment of metastases were&#xD;
      a significant number of undetectable CTCs present. This suggests that current clinical assays&#xD;
      may be limiting ability to capitalize on the full potential of CTCs, and that a greater&#xD;
      understanding of CTC biology is necessary in order to guide future technology development and&#xD;
      translation to the clinic.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of prostate cancer patients has&#xD;
      been shown to be an important indicator of metastatic disease and poor prognosis.&#xD;
      Additionally, changes in CTC number throughout treatment have been demonstrated to reflect&#xD;
      therapy response. Although these cells are very rare (~1 CTC per 105-107 leukocytes), recent&#xD;
      technological advances have now facilitated sensitive enumeration and characterization of&#xD;
      CTCs. Techniques to enrich and analyze CTCs include size- and/or density-based separation and&#xD;
      antibody-based techniques with/without the aid of microfluidics, while detection techniques&#xD;
      rely almost exclusively on protein- (immunofluorescence/flow cytometry) or nucleic acid-based&#xD;
      (RT-PCR/qRT-PCR) assays. However, the CellSearch® (Menarini-Silicon Biosystems) is the only&#xD;
      FDA- and Health Canada-cleared CTC platform available at the present time, and is thus&#xD;
      considered the current &quot;gold standard&quot; for clinical CTC analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CellSearch® uses an epithelial-based marker approach for immunomagnetic enrichment,&#xD;
      isolation, and quantitative immunofluorescence of CTCs. Using this assay, it has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that CTCs are readily detectable in ~65% of castrate-resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
      (CRPC) patients and that the presence of ≥5 CTCs in 7.5ml of blood is indicative of&#xD;
      progressive metastatic disease and reduced overall survival. Notably, CTCs are undetectable&#xD;
      in ~35% of metastatic CRPC patients. This suggests that either CTCs are truly not present in&#xD;
      &gt;1/3 of patients with advanced metastatic disease; and/or that CTCs are present but not&#xD;
      detectable as they do not meet the standard CellSearch® definition of CTCs&#xD;
      (EpCAM+/Cytokeratin 8/18/19 [CK]+/DAPI+/CD45-). Given the accumulating evidence that prostate&#xD;
      cancer cells can lose epithelial characteristics as they evolve towards a more metastatic&#xD;
      phenotype, the investigators believe the latter scenario is most likely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process during embryonic&#xD;
      development and cancer metastasis. Activation of EMT leads to profound phenotypic changes&#xD;
      resulting in loss of cell polarity, loss of cell-cell adhesion, resistance to apoptosis, and&#xD;
      acquisition of migratory/invasive properties. It has also been proposed that tumor cells (via&#xD;
      the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition [MET]) may revert back to an epithelial phenotype in&#xD;
      order to facilitate metastatic growth in secondary sites, suggesting a role for phenotypic&#xD;
      plasticity during metastatic progression. At the molecular level, EMT is mediated by&#xD;
      decreased expression of epithelial proteins (E-cadherin, CK, EpCAM); as well as corresponding&#xD;
      increases in mesenchymal factors (N-cadherin, Vimentin, Twist, Zeb), with MET mediated by the&#xD;
      opposite changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, Gleason grading can arguably be viewed as morphological evidence of EMT, since&#xD;
      increasing Gleason score is associated with progressive loss of epithelial architecture, loss&#xD;
      of defined basement membrane/cell polarity, and increased invasion. In support of this,&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that decreased expression of E-Cadherin or increased expression of&#xD;
      mesenchymal markers (Vimentin, N-Cadherin, SNAIL) in primary prostate tumors is associated&#xD;
      with advanced Gleason score, metastasis, and/or poor prognosis. Although the role of androgen&#xD;
      receptor (AR) signaling in EMT is poorly understood, studies have also demonstrated that EMT&#xD;
      may be facilitated by androgen deprivation, castration-resistance, and/or disruption of&#xD;
      androgen signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, several clinical studies have demonstrated that CTCs with a purely mesenchymal&#xD;
      phenotype are undetectable by CellSearch®, but that the presence of mesenchymal marker&#xD;
      expression on CTCs with a hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype is indicative of poor&#xD;
      prognosis. In addition, previous pre-clinical data from the Allan laboratory has demonstrated&#xD;
      that in animal models, prostate cancers with a mesenchymal phenotype shed greater numbers of&#xD;
      CTCs more quickly and with greater metastatic capacity than those with an epithelial&#xD;
      phenotype. Notably, the clinically-used CellSearch®-based assay captured the majority of CTCs&#xD;
      shed during early-stage disease in vivo, and only after the establishment of metastases were&#xD;
      a significant number of undetectable CTCs present. This suggests that current clinical assays&#xD;
      may be limiting the ability to capitalize on the full potential of CTCs, and that a greater&#xD;
