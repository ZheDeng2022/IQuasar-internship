  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind comparative study, performed in pediatric subjects (Age 6-11)&#xD;
      traveling to developing regions with a known high incidence of traveler's diarrhea. The&#xD;
      subjects will be suffering from acute diarrhea for at least 12 hours, without symptoms of&#xD;
      systemic infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 142 subjects are expected to be enrolled in the study, 1:1 in the Rifamycin SV&#xD;
      MultiMatrix (MMX) plus Oral Rescue Therapy (ORT) group and in the placebo tablets plus ORT&#xD;
      group respectively. The day of randomization (Visit 1, Day 1), the subjects will start the&#xD;
      treatment receiving ORT plus Rifamycin SV MMX 100 mg (as two tablets of 50 mg each) twice&#xD;
      daily (morning and evening) or ORT plus placebo tablets (as two tablets) twice daily (morning&#xD;
      and evening). The subjects will begin the treatment within 72 hours of onset of diarrhea.&#xD;
      Treatment duration will last 72 hours. The total number of tablets for the entire treatment&#xD;
      course will be 12 (4 × 50 mg tablets/day for 3 days). The administration of the ORT will&#xD;
      follow the specification reported in the product label. The tablets will be orally&#xD;
      administered during the day. No tablet administration will be done during the night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, subjects/their parents/or guardians will complete Diary cards (PDC) in&#xD;
      which will be daily recorded date, time of first tablets intake, time and consistency of each&#xD;
      stool, presence of blood in stools, abdominal pain/cramps, flatulence, tenesmus, urgency,&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, fever, adverse events (AEs), and concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the subjects will be assessed for safety and efficacy at Visit 2 (Day 2)&#xD;
      and Visit 3 (Day 4/5) as final Study Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool samples for microbiological assessment will be collected at Visits 1 and 3. Stool will&#xD;
      be examined and cultured at local labs for main enteropathogens and for the presence of&#xD;
      protozoa, ova and yeasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine sampling for routine safety analyses will be collected at Visit 1 and at&#xD;
      Visit 3.&#xD;
