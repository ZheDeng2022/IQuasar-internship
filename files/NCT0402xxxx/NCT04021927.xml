  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a descriptive prospective study of safety and efficacy of the reflective PT ring&#xD;
      device. Neonates with an elevated total serum bilirubin (TSB) meeting PT criteria per their&#xD;
      clinician during hospital admission will be eligible for enrollment after informed parental&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neonatal jaundice (NNJ) continues to be a significant global problem affecting over 80% of&#xD;
      neonates while severe neonatal jaundice affects at least 481,000 neonates annually. Jaundice&#xD;
      and jaundice related complications like Kernicterus Spectrum Disorder (KDS) are gaining&#xD;
      recognition among the world's health policy leaders as an important area for further research&#xD;
      and development. The long-term sequelae of KSD include choreoathetoid cerebral palsy,&#xD;
      sensorineural hearing loss, and upward gaze palsy. KSD is irreversible resulting in a&#xD;
      lifetime of physical, emotional, social and economic challenges. Access to cost-effective&#xD;
      methods of improving pediatric jaundice care along with improved circumferential (full body)&#xD;
      illumination technologies is an affirmed objective of the AAP (American Academy of&#xD;
      Pediatrics). The investigators hypothesize that unused therapy light (irradiance) surrounding&#xD;
      the neonate using an existing single-lamp bank phototherapy (PT) device is sufficient in&#xD;
      quantity and if redirected onto the patients untreated or poorly illuminated skin surfaces,&#xD;
      it will accelerate metabolism and excretion of bilirubin. This PT ring device redirects&#xD;
      unused phototherapy light sideways onto the neonate body using an open-faced ring approach.&#xD;
      The technology will illuminate previously unexposed and poorly exposed skin regions where&#xD;
      treatable bilirubin exists. The device is superior to current PT devices in that it converts&#xD;
      existing waste light into treatment efficacy while integrating into existing overhead lamp&#xD;
      systems offsetting the purchase of secondary devices that are often unaffordable and create&#xD;
      hospital complexity, cost and inefficiency issues. A further benefit of the device will be&#xD;
      reduced ambient blue-light spillover in patient care areas, an ongoing concern for medical&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
