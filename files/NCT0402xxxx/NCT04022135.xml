  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this two-arm, double-blind randomized pilot study, the investigators will recruit 60&#xD;
      generally healthy, low-risk pregnant women aged 19-42 years living in Vancouver, Canada.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to supplement with either 0.6 mg/day folic acid or an&#xD;
      equimolar dose (0.625 mg/day) of (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid for 16-weeks of their&#xD;
      pregnancy. Randomization will occur at 8-21 weeks gestation (after neural tube closure) to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of harm should the natural folate prove less effective. All participants will&#xD;
      also receive a prenatal multivitamin not containing any form of folate, to ensure adequacy of&#xD;
      other nutrients (e.g. iron) required during pregnancy. Three-hour fasting venous blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected at baseline and endline to measure serum and red blood cell folate,&#xD;
      unmetabolized folic acid and other related biomarkers. Women will be given the option to&#xD;
      continue supplementing until 1-week postpartum, and provide a small (3mL) breastmilk sample&#xD;
      in order to measure differences in folates in breastmilk. These pilot data will be used to&#xD;
      inform a definitive trial regarding the most effective form of folate supplementation for&#xD;
      mothers and their babies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sample size of 50 women (25 in each group) are required to reliably estimate the&#xD;
      distributions of serum and red blood cell folate. Thus, to account for drop outs or loss to&#xD;
      follow up, a total of 60 women (30 in each group) will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To establish the mean ± standard deviation change in serum folate, red blood cell&#xD;
      folate, and unmetabolized folic acid levels in each group following supplementation with&#xD;
      (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid or folic acid for 16-weeks of pregnancy. Exploratory&#xD;
      analyses will be to measure differences in folate forms and folate binding protein in&#xD;
      breastmilk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine participation recruitment and retention rate, the most effective&#xD;
      recruitment strategies for this population, and adherence to study protocol (to inform a&#xD;
      definitive trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women may undergo informed consent process anytime &lt;21 weeks gestation. Once participants&#xD;
      indicate that they are interested in participating in the trial, the participant will be&#xD;
      given a study ID, and a baseline visit will be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline visit will occur between 8-21 weeks gestation, and will involve discontinuation&#xD;
      of current folate/prenatal vitamin supplementation, review and signing the informed consent&#xD;
      form (a scanned copy will be shared with the participant), randomization to a folate group,&#xD;
      provision of study supplements, completion of a baseline questionnaire, completion of a food&#xD;
      frequency questionnaire, measurement of weight and height, and a small blood draw (12ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: total time: 16 weeks. Participants will supplement daily with the folate and&#xD;
      prenatal vitamin supplements. The research coordinator will call the participants half way&#xD;
      through the intervention period to serve as a reminder and answer any questions, which will&#xD;
      enhance protocol adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endline visit will occur between 24-37 weeks gestation, and will involve collecting any&#xD;
      remaining supplements (for capsule counts), a weight measurement, and a small blood draw&#xD;
      (12ml), and completion of a short endline questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional continuation of study: After the endline visit, women who are planning to breastfeed&#xD;
      will have the option to continue supplementing with the study supplements until approximately&#xD;
      1 week postpartum, at which time they will provide a small (3 mL) breastmilk sample. The aims&#xD;
      of this collection will be to measure difference in folate forms (including total proportion&#xD;
      of unmetabolized folic acid) and breastmilk folate-binding protein.&#xD;
