  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study goal is to evaluate the ability of the V.A.C. ULTA™ Negative Pressure Wound Therapy&#xD;
      System and V.A.C. VERAFLO CLEANSE CHOICE ™ (VFCC) dressing system with saline as an irrigant&#xD;
      in increasing viable tissue in full thickness wounds (such as chronic, acute, traumatic,&#xD;
      sub-acute, and dehisced wounds and/or ulcers) with difficult to manage bioburden and slough.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. is anticipated to be hospitalized for the duration of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. is ≥22 years of age or their legally authorized representative is able to provide&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. has a full thickness wound (such as chronic, acute, traumatic, sub-acute, and dehisced&#xD;
             wounds and/or ulcers) measuring ≥4cm in length and ≥4cm in width (before removal of&#xD;
             eschar at the bedside) excluding undermining/tunneling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. has, in the opinion of the investigator, no more than 2/3 of the visible wound bed&#xD;
             surface area considered to be clean, healthy, and viable. If eschar is present at&#xD;
             baseline, it must be removed by bedside debridement prior to assessing the percentage&#xD;
             of clean, healthy, and viable wound bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. has a negative urine or serum pregnancy test at screening (if female and has potential&#xD;
             for pregnancy) and is willing to take precautionary measures to prevent pregnancy&#xD;
             during the duration of the study (up to 9 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. has been diagnosed with malignancy in the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. has untreated osteomyelitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. has an untreated systemic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. has active cellulitis in the peri wound area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to study materials: dressing and/or dressing&#xD;
             components such as acrylic adhesives or polyurethane.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. has, in the opinion of the investigator, a clinically significant condition that would&#xD;
             impair the Subject's ability to comply with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. has had radiation directly to the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. has been diagnosed with a major vascular deficit limiting arterial inflow to the wound&#xD;
             region, as determined by the Investigator's interpretation of the Subject's medical&#xD;
             history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. has eschar in the wound that cannot be removed by beside or sharp and/or mechanical&#xD;
             debridement.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. is participating in another interventional clinical trial for the duration of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. has unexplored fistulas in the wound or fistulas in the wound that connect to other&#xD;
             body cavities.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. has inadequate hemostasis at the wound site, as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
