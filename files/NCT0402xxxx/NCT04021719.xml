      This application proposes OnTrackNY as a regional scientific hub for the Early Psychosis&#xD;
      Intervention Network (EPINET) program as part of the National Institute of Mental Health&#xD;
      (NIMH)'s creation of a national learning health care system (LHS) for early psychosis care.&#xD;
      OnTrackNY has grown into a 22-site network, under the leadership of Lisa Dixon, MD, MPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Created and supported by the New York State's Office of Mental Health (OMH), OnTrackNY is a&#xD;
      nationally recognized model providing coordinated specialty care (CSC) for adolescents and&#xD;
      young adults within two years of the onset of non-affective psychosis. OMH regulates and&#xD;
      licenses all mental health programs in New York and is a direct-services provider via&#xD;
      state-operated programs statewide. This makes OMH an ideal partner for establishing a&#xD;
      statewide learning health care system for early psychosis care. Further, OnTrackNY's&#xD;
      administration, OnTrackCentral, operates within the OMH-supported Center for Practice&#xD;
      Innovations at Columbia Psychiatry. In this model, OnTrackCentral serves as the hub and the&#xD;
      22 OnTrackNY programs serve as the spokes. Since 2014, the still-growing OnTrackNY network&#xD;
      has served over 1,600 individuals. From its inception, OnTrackNY has aimed to deliver&#xD;
      high-quality, data-driven, accountable and culturally competent care consistent with an LHS.&#xD;
      As a condition of funding, all OnTrackNY providers follow established protocols that require&#xD;
      submission of patient- and site-level standard measures of early psychosis clinical features,&#xD;
      services, and treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed EPINET regional hub, the OnTrackNY LHS, will emphasize and enhance two critical&#xD;
      foundational components - Aim 1: proactively engage stakeholders to optimize understanding of&#xD;
      key problems and their solutions at every LHS phase; and Aim 2: develop data systems with&#xD;
      enhanced standardized data collection, including post-discharge data and linkages to external&#xD;
      data systems, and enhancing data analytics that will allow for client-level treatment&#xD;
      planning and prospective analytics, delivering real time, dynamic and actionable information&#xD;
      to stakeholders. These LHS components do not follow in a stepwise sequence but instead&#xD;
      operate in parallel and interact to facilitate and enhance quality improvement processes.&#xD;
      This backbone will support the development of practice-based research.&#xD;

      This application proposes OnTrackNY as a regional scientific hub for the Early Psychosis&#xD;
      Intervention Network (EPINET) program as part of NIMH's creation of a national learning&#xD;
      health care system (LHS) for early psychosis care. As a continuation of the NIMH-supported&#xD;
      RAISE-Implementation and Evaluation Study, OnTrackNY has grown into the 22-site (and still&#xD;
      expanding) network under the leadership of Lisa Dixon, MD, MPH. OnTrackNY is a nationally&#xD;
      recognized model for providing CSC for adolescents and young adults within two years of the&#xD;
      onset of non-affective psychosis. OnTrackNY sites are located in licensed outpatient clinics&#xD;
      at community agencies, state-operated facilities, and community and academic hospitals in&#xD;
      urban, suburban, and rural areas throughout New York. This network has served over 1,600&#xD;
      individuals to date, with 451 new enrollees in calendar year 2017. Thanks to its sponsorship&#xD;
      by the New York State Office of Mental Health (OMH), OnTrackNY has progressed to meet its&#xD;
      goal of providing CSC to any young person with early psychosis in New York State, regardless&#xD;
      of ability to pay. OnTrackNY includes OnTrackCentral-the &quot;hub&quot;-a team of nine staff, who&#xD;
      provide training and technical assistance to sites and manage data collection, and the 22&#xD;
      teams which are its &quot;spokes.&quot; From its inception, OnTrackNY has sought to deliver&#xD;
      high-quality, data-driven, accountable care consistent with an LHS. (See Facilities for&#xD;
      details on sites.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Foundations of a LHS in OnTrackNY: Several factors facilitated OnTrackNY's LHS&#xD;
      foundations: 1) OnTrackNY evolved from the data-oriented RAISE-Implementation and Evaluation&#xD;
      Study; 2) its location within the Center for Practice Innovations, an OMH-funded and&#xD;
      empirically driven technical assistance center for scaling up evidence-based practices housed&#xD;
      within Columbia Psychiatry; and 3) a strong commitment by OMH to high quality, accountable&#xD;
      care. OnTrackCentral obtains stakeholder input from clinicians, program directors and state&#xD;
      administrators. All OnTrackNY teams are contractually obligated to follow established&#xD;
      protocols requiring specific service components and standardized client- and site-level&#xD;
      measures for treating first episode psychosis (FEP). OnTrackCentral provides ongoing&#xD;
      technical assistance to support the model, identify programmatic gaps and problems, and&#xD;
      facilitate practice-based learning and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Opportunity for OnTrackNY to Build a Better LHS: EPINET provides the opportunity to&#xD;
      leverage the nascent LHS foundations of OnTrackNY and build a large, state-of-the-art LHS for&#xD;
      early psychosis care. The investigators propose to expand and restructure the continuous&#xD;
      quality improvement (CQI) process to: (Aim 1) include key stakeholders at every phase of the&#xD;
      LHS and (Aim 2) provide accurate and appropriate delivery of real-time data to clients and&#xD;
      providers to facilitate measurement-based care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LHS Frameworks and Conceptual Model: This LHS is based on the principles of the Institute of&#xD;
      Medicine's (IOM) (now National Academy of Medicine) model for a continuously learning&#xD;
      healthcare system which brings together stakeholders to review data and technologies to&#xD;
      develop and apply strategies to improve quality and increase efficiency. The investigators&#xD;
      will use the IOM's LHS model, operationalizing the components according to the six LHS phases&#xD;
      described by the Group Health Cooperative. While this LHS model provides an aspirational&#xD;
      roadmap for a cyclic improvement approach, significant knowledge gaps limit translation and&#xD;
      implementation of knowledge into evidence-based communications, campaigns, guidelines and&#xD;
      other tools, products, and interventions. The investigators will draw on the Knowledge to&#xD;
      Action (KTA) framework, which guides knowledge translation and implementation activities&#xD;
      within each phase of the LHS model. The KTA planning tool directs knowledge creation and&#xD;
      action cycles through questions for stakeholders to consider during each LHS phase. Through&#xD;
      an iterative process, knowledge creation begins with stakeholders, data and mixed methods&#xD;
      practice- based research during the LHS Scanning and Surveillance phase. The Action Cycle&#xD;
      outlines a process, representing the activities needed for knowledge to be implemented in&#xD;
      practice. Knowledge is adapted to the local context, and barriers and facilitators to its use&#xD;
      are explicitly assessed. Stakeholders are centrally involved in tailoring knowledge and&#xD;
      interventions to those who will use it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal will thus build a stakeholder-driven LHS that will establish the data&#xD;
      infrastructure needed to promote measurement-based treatment within a structure supporting&#xD;
      continuous quality improvement which, in turn, supports practice-based research-with the&#xD;
      overall goal of improving care and outcomes for individuals with early psychosis. This&#xD;
      EPINET-supported LHS will create an engine to optimize the potential of CSC to improve the&#xD;
      lives of people with schizophrenia.&#xD;
