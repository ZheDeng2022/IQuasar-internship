  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of prerectal resection syndrome (LARS) after middle and low rectal cancer&#xD;
      surgery is as high as 70%, which seriously affects the quality of life of patients. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that colon pouch can reduce and alleviate LARS symptoms. However, most previous&#xD;
      studies focused on open surgery, and the evaluation index lacked objectivity. Therefore, in&#xD;
      the context of minimally invasive rectal cancer surgery, it is necessary to re-evaluate the&#xD;
      value of improved surgical methods for the prevention of LARS, so as to improve the quality&#xD;
      of life of patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The incidence of prerectal resection syndrome (LARS) after middle and low rectal cancer&#xD;
      surgery is as high as 70%, which seriously affects the quality of life of patients. LARS may&#xD;
      be related to the injury of anal internal sphincter, anal sensory nerve injury, defecation&#xD;
      reflex pathway injury, changes in anorectal Angle and rectum sigmoid Angle, changes in new&#xD;
      rectal sensory function and compliance, and changes in dynamics,etc. After AR surgery, the&#xD;
      rectum loses its good compliance and the storage capacity is reduced, which is one of the&#xD;
      important reasons for the increased frequency and urgency of defecation.Therefore, on the&#xD;
      basis of traditional colon-rectum (or anal canal) end-to-end anastomosis, &quot;J&quot; shaped pouch&#xD;
      anastomosis, end-to-end anastomosis, coloplasty and other special anastomosis methods were&#xD;
      performed. Meanwhile, for the lack of objective evaluation index, the results were not&#xD;
      credible. The LARS score was first published in 2012,and has been validated, evaluated, or&#xD;
      used as an outcome measure in more than 30 published scientific papers. Further&#xD;
      more,laparoscopic surgery is widely used in gastrointestinal surgery. Herein, current&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial comparing coloplasty with straight colorectal anastomosis in LARS&#xD;
      in order to guide clinical practise was conducted.&#xD;
