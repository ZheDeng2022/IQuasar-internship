  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and behavior in the body of the experimental drug TMB-365&#xD;
      in people with HIV-1 infection. This will be the first test of TMB-365 in humans. One dose of&#xD;
      the study drug is given to each participant, followed by 10 weeks of monitoring for safety&#xD;
      and levels of the drug in the blood. The first group of participants will receive the lowest&#xD;
      dose (400 mg). If no safety concerns are seen, the next group will begin at a higher dose&#xD;
      (800 mg). If no safety concerns are seen in the second group, the third group will begin at&#xD;
      the highest dose in this study (1600 mg).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase 1, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, sequential single dose&#xD;
      escalation study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters&#xD;
      of TMB-365 administered via intravenous infusion (IV) to HIV-1 infected participants at one&#xD;
      of three successively increasing dose levels: 400 mg, 800 mg, and 1600 mg. Each participant&#xD;
      will be monitored for 10 weeks post-administration. All participants will be expected to&#xD;
      participate in PK sampling during Weeks 1, 4, 5, and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning with the lowest dosage group, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review&#xD;
      available data after four participants have completed two weeks of post-dose follow-up to&#xD;
      determine if dosing of the next dosage group may proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) emerge, defined as a single Grade 4 or two of the same&#xD;
      Grade 3 clinical or laboratory adverse events deemed possibly, probably or definitely related&#xD;
      to the study drug, or a serious adverse event deemed possibly, probably or definitely related&#xD;
      to the study drug as graded by the DAIDS Table for Grading Severity of Adult and Pediatric&#xD;
      Adverse Events Version 2.1, then dosing of the next higher dose group will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing in the highest dose group will begin after four of the eight participants in second&#xD;
      group have successfully completed the scheduled study drug administration and two weeks of&#xD;
      follow-up, and those data, along with all available data from the initial dose group have&#xD;
      been reviewed by the DMC and no DLTs or SAEs as defined above are identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants may initiate standard combination antiretroviral therapy six weeks after&#xD;
      receiving the study drug.&#xD;
