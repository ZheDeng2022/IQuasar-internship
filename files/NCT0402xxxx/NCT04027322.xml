      Background: Acute pharyngitis (AP) is a common presentation to the Emergency Department (ED).&#xD;
      Most AP patients' who present to the ED are interested in relief their sore throat (pain).&#xD;
      There are different approaches available in the literature to control AP pain. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that the use of systemic glucocorticoids significantly decreases patients' sore throat.&#xD;
      Up to our knowledge, there are no available trials looking at the role of nebulized&#xD;
      glucocorticoids in treating infective AP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Our aim is to investigate in pediatrics and adults population ≥5 years presenting to ED&#xD;
      with AP if the use of a single dose of nebulized glucocorticoids as an adjunct to standard AP&#xD;
      treatment, compared with placebo leads to complete resolution or improvement in symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The investigators are planning to conduct a multi-center, double-blind randomized&#xD;
      control trial. There will be three arms; first arm: nebulized Budesonide, second arm:&#xD;
      nebulized Dexamethasone and third arm: placebo nebulized Normal Saline (NS). The patients&#xD;
      will be followed up for 15 days through phone calls to assess the primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes. Our primary objective is to investigate whether the use of a single dose of&#xD;
      nebulized glucocorticoids compared with placebo leads to significant improvement or complete&#xD;
      resolution of the sore throat within 24hrs. Our secondary objectives are to assess if a&#xD;
      single dose of glucocorticoids will: reduce sore throat at 48 hours, reduce absence from work&#xD;
      or school, reduce the incidence of hospital admission, and reduce the rate of re-attendance&#xD;
      to ED. Since there is no available data about the effect of nebulized glucocorticoids in AP,&#xD;
      the appropriate sample size will be calculated after running a pilot study. The data will be&#xD;
      recorded in the EpiData@ software. Then the data will be analyzed using the SPSS@ software.&#xD;
      The ethical approval was sought from the ethical committee in each participating hospital and&#xD;
      they approved it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The result of this study will be presented in local conferences as well in&#xD;
      international conferences. The investigators will aim to publish the study in a well-known&#xD;
      international emergency medicine journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical application: up to our knowledge this study is the first study worldwide looking at&#xD;
      the effect of nebulized glucocorticoids in patients with infective acute pharyngitis. As&#xD;
      mentioned earlier that there are multiple approaches available in the literature to control&#xD;
      sore throat pain and if our hypothesis turned to be correct then another alternative&#xD;
      treatment can be added. The investigators believe that the use of topical route to administer&#xD;
      glucocorticoids is more convenient for physicians and have less chance to develop adverse&#xD;
      effect in comparison to systemic steroids.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute pharyngitis (AP) is a commonly diagnosed condition in the Emergency Departments (ED).&#xD;
      In the United States (USA), there are approximately 12 million visits to health institutions&#xD;
      due to acute pharyngitis(1). It is defined as an acute inflammation of the pharynx and/or&#xD;
      tonsils and the diagnosis is made clinically(2). Although there are variable etiologies for&#xD;
      AP, viral infections are the commonest(3). Symptoms of AP vary in the severity but the most&#xD;
      common symptom for which the patients seek medical care is a sore throat. The patient may&#xD;
      complain of fever, flu symptoms, odynophagia (painful swallowing), neck pain, poor oral&#xD;
      intake, nausea, and vomiting. Of these symptoms, around 80% of patients with AP were&#xD;
      interested more to relieve their pain(4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different approaches were suggested to control AP pain. It is well established that oral&#xD;
      acetaminophen and ibuprofen are effective in decreasing AP pain(5). Different forms of&#xD;
      topical therapies like lozenges/drops, throat sprays, gargles, and teas are also available&#xD;
      for relief AP related pain. There is no evidence that a particular topical lozenge or spray&#xD;
      is superior in efficacy(6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic glucocorticoids have been proven to be effective in decreasing AP sore throat.&#xD;
      Systemic reviews and meta-analysis studies showed that a single dose of systemic&#xD;
      glucocorticoids decreases pain within 24 hours by two times and at 48 hours by 1.5 times(7)&#xD;
      (8) compared to patients who didn't receive steroids. A recently published trial showed that&#xD;
      the use of systemic glucocorticoids in less severe acute pharyngitis significantly result in&#xD;
      complete resolution of a sore throat at 48hours(9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucocorticoids are commonly used medication in the emergency department. They have a very&#xD;
      good safety profile(10). A short course of glucocorticoids is less likely to result in&#xD;
      adverse events (AE) and if occurred usually with systemic, not with local&#xD;
      glucocorticoids(10). Studies have shown that the use of a single dose of systemic&#xD;
      glucocorticoids for acute pharyngitis did not result in significant adverse events and no&#xD;
      serious adverse events were reported (7) (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of glucocorticoids in AP can be attributed to their anti-inflammatory actions.&#xD;
      They inhabit the formation of the pro-inflammatory mediators in the endothelial cells of the&#xD;
      airways. This will decreases the inflammatory reaction at the pharynges which will lead to a&#xD;
      reduction in the throat pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to our knowledge, no available trials are looking at the role of nebulized glucocorticoids&#xD;
      in treating infective AP. A Randomized Control Trial (RCT) showed that the use of nebulized&#xD;
      dexamethasone significantly decreases the incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat&#xD;
      at 2, 4, 8, and12 hours(11). There was no complication reported from the use of nebulized&#xD;
      dexamethasone(11). Despite the available evidence about the effectiveness of glucocorticoids&#xD;
      in acute pharyngitis, some physicians are still reluctant to prescribe it as an adjunct&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that the uses of local glucocorticoids (nebulization) will&#xD;
      significantly reduce sore throat in patients with AP. The investigators believe that the use&#xD;
      of topical route to administer glucocorticoids is more convenient for physicians and have&#xD;
      less chance to develop adverse effect in comparison to systemic steroids. The investigators&#xD;
      aim to investigate in pediatrics and adults population ≥5 years presenting to ED with AP if&#xD;
      the use of a single dose of nebulized glucocorticoids as an adjunct to standard AP treatment,&#xD;
      compared with placebo leads to complete resolution or improvement in symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - To investigate in pediatrics and adults population ≥5 years presenting to ED with AP&#xD;
           if the use of a single dose of nebulized glucocorticoids as an adjunct to standard AP&#xD;
           treatment compared with placebo leads to significant improvement or complete resolution&#xD;
           of the sore throat within 24hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether a single dose of inhaled Glucocorticoids compared with Placebo will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduce sore throat at 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduce absence from work or school.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduce the incidence of hospital admission due to the complication of the sore throat&#xD;
           within 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduce the rate of re-attendance to ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Study Design: The trial will be multi-center, double-blind randomized control trial. There&#xD;
      will be three arms; first arm: nebulized Budesonide, second arm: nebulized Dexamethasone and&#xD;
      third arm: placebo nebulized Normal Saline (NS). The patients will be followed up for 15 days&#xD;
      through phone calls to assess the primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target population:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Overall Description of Trial Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Pediatrics and adult aged 5 years or over presenting to the emergency&#xD;
                     department (ED) with acute pharyngitis (AP).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inclusion Criteria and Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      refer to &quot;Eligibility&quot; section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &gt; The Number of Participants: Up to our knowledge the available literature only about the use&#xD;
      of systemic glucocorticoids in AP. No available studies looked at the effect of nebulized&#xD;
      glucocorticoids in AP sore throat. Therefore The investigators are conducting a pilot study&#xD;
      to look at the effect of nebulized glucocorticoids and from the result of the pilot study,&#xD;
      the sample size will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment for the pilot study is already started since June 2019. It is conducted in&#xD;
      two centers for 20 participants in each arm. The investigators will use the same protocol&#xD;
      (mentioned below) for both the pilot study and the main study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &gt; Inform consent: After checking for eligibility and patient willingness to participate in&#xD;
      the trial, a written informed consent form will be given to the participant by the enrolling&#xD;
      clinician. The written informed consent will be submitted to the patient so he/she can read&#xD;
      it plus a verbal presentation of the form will be conducted by the care provider. The form&#xD;
      has to be signed by the participant or caregiver personally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details about the exact nature of the trial, the implications of the trial and possible&#xD;
      adverse effects will be included in both verbal presentations and written informed consent.&#xD;
      The written consent will clearly state that the participant has the rights to withdraw from&#xD;
      the study at any time for any reason without prejudice to future care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &gt; Screening and Eligibility Assessment: Any patient who presented to the emergency department&#xD;
      with a sore throat should be screened by the triage nurse or doctor for eligibility of the&#xD;
      participant for the study. A participant information sheet will be kept in the triage room&#xD;
      and the doctors' room. The treating physician will check the eligibility of the patient by&#xD;
      checking inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any patient who is not eligible to participate or&#xD;
      declines to participate will be recorded on the screening log with reasons for ineligibility&#xD;
      or declining (if known) and have no further involvement in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who are found eligible and accept to participate in the trial will be included&#xD;
      in the trial and proceed to baseline trial assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline Trial Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Once the participant is eligible for the trial, the treating physician will take&#xD;
                the baseline characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The treating physician will explain to the participant the process of the trial and&#xD;
                the ways of data recording. He/she will explain to the participant how to fill the&#xD;
                trial dairy which will be provided to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The treating physician will take the contact number of the participant and inform&#xD;
                him/her that he/she will be called by the trial investigators at the following&#xD;
                time:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At 24 hours, on day 2, on day 7, and day 15 after inclusion in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  May also receive 1 or 2 calls to encourage the patient to complete the trial and to&#xD;
                check on participant's compliance to study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data collection sheet will be available online using &quot;Google Forms&quot;. The treating&#xD;
                physician is required to fill the baseline assessment sheet within 6 hours from&#xD;
                participant inclusion in the trial and send it through online to the principal&#xD;
                investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Items to be collected in the baseline data collection sheet:&#xD;
&#xD;

                  -  Throat swab for microscopy and culture: to be collected in the day of&#xD;
                     presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Patient completed items will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Ratings of throat soreness, pain on swallowing and difficulty swallowing&#xD;
                          using Numeric pain score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Sealed non-transparent envelopes with blocked randomization (3,6,9).&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Envelops contain a folded paper written on it the type of intervention: as follow&#xD;
           (Dexamethasone, Budesonide, or Placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Each time the care provider decided to include a patient in the study he/she picks&#xD;
                an envelope according to the sequence of randomization and read the content of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Both the follow-up investigators (the assessors) and the patients will be blinded,&#xD;
                but not the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Method: all patients will receive nebulization of 8 milliliters (ml) solution:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo normal saline will be administered for the control group: dose 8 ml of normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucocorticoid nebulization for the intervention group: Dose of 8 ml of study medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the treating physician includes a patient to the trial, he/she will send the&#xD;
           patient's data to the principal investigator through online Google Forms. The principal&#xD;
           investigators will assign another investigator to contact the patient without telling&#xD;
           him the type of intervention the patient received and ask him/her about the study&#xD;
           endpoint outcomes (mentioned above). The study outcome assessors will be required to&#xD;
           fill the data online using Google Forms and forward it back to the study principal&#xD;
           investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           &gt; Subsequent assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 new phone numbers will be opened for the trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each participant will be provided with a diary which is specifically designed for the&#xD;
           trial. It will include patient questions about patient pain and other symptoms. The&#xD;
           patient will keep recording in the diary for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participants will be contacted by telephone at 24hours, 48hours, 7 days and 15 days&#xD;
           to collect the study primary and secondary objectives and to ensure completion of&#xD;
           symptoms diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The follow-up call is standardized with pre-specified questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An additional phone call will be done if needed to encourage the participants to&#xD;
           complete symptoms diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of End of Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The trial ends once the targeted sample size achieved and follow up completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation/ Withdrawal of Participants from Study Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each participant has the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators may discontinue a participant from the study for any of the following&#xD;
           reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Failure of the participant to follow the study protocol, major missing data e.g.&#xD;
                reporting the primary endpoint of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Continuation of the study will harm the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The reason for withdrawing/discontinuation from the study will be recorded in the case&#xD;
           report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the reason for the participant withdraw is an adverse event from the study&#xD;
           intervention, a follow-up appointment will be arranged for the participant with study&#xD;
           investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the participant found to be not eligible for the trial after randomization, he/she&#xD;
           will be removed from the trial and all his information will be removed from the trial&#xD;
           database.&#xD;
&#xD;
           * Description of Study Treatment: refer to &quot;Arms and Interventions&quot; section&#xD;
&#xD;
           * Compliance with Study Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will be observed taking the single dose of study medication once they&#xD;
           have provided full informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           * Availability of the Study Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study medications will be supplied by the participating hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study medications are available in the participating hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           * Concomitant Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treating physician may prescribe any of the following medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Antibiotics, if indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Any other advised treatment, including Paracetamol aspirin ibuprofen, Gargle,&#xD;
                Difflam, Zinc, steam, and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Post-Trial Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After study medication administration in ED, the participants follow normal medical care&#xD;
           of AP.&#xD;
&#xD;
           *Safety reporting:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucocorticoids are used Commonly in the emergency department. They have a very good&#xD;
           safety profile(10). A short course of glucocorticoids is less likely to result in&#xD;
           adverse events and if occurred usually with systemic, not with local glucocorticoids&#xD;
           (10). Studies have shown that the use of a single dose of systemic glucocorticoids for&#xD;
           acute pharyngitis did not result in significant adverse events and no serious adverse&#xD;
           events were reported (7) (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although the risk of developing adverse events secondary to the usage of nebulized&#xD;
           glucocorticoids, all adverse events will be documented by the study investigators. Any&#xD;
           adverse events reported by the participant will be investigated for causality. These&#xD;
           investigations will be done by a medically qualified investigator. The severity of&#xD;
           events will be assessed on the following scale: 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A participant has the free rights to withdraw from the trial due to what he or she&#xD;
           perceives as intolerable adverse events. Adverse events that result in a participant's&#xD;
           withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the withdrawal form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The data will be recorded in the EpiData@ software. Then the data will be analyzed using&#xD;
      the SPSS@ software. All randomized participants will be included in the analysis, assuming no&#xD;
      complete resolution for missing data. The proportion of complete resolution of a sore throat&#xD;
      at 24 hours in those participants who have received nebulized glucocorticoids on which this&#xD;
      trial is powered will be compared using logistic regression model. Odds ratio and their 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval (CI) will be reported. The p-value of &lt;0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for the Termination of the Trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be terminated in case of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - If the study medications appear to be harmful to the participants e.g. multiple cases&#xD;
      reported serious adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Control and Quality Assurance Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The study will be conducted according to this protocol. All the investigators will receive&#xD;
      training on the trial procedure before the start. The principal investigator will be&#xD;
      responsible for continuous monitoring of compliance with the study protocol and data&#xD;
      recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted in three hospitals in Muscat. Two hospitals are under the&#xD;
           umbrella of Armed Forced Hospital (AFH) and one hospital is the Royal Oman Police&#xD;
           Hospital (ROP). The ethical approval was sought from each hospital individually and they&#xD;
           approved it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trial staff will ensure that the participants' anonymity is maintained. Participants'&#xD;
           details will be identified by their hospital Identification (ID) number e.g. (AFH_ID&#xD;
           number). All data will be stored securely and only accessible by the trial staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To conduct such a study, sponsors who will help us to cover the costs of the study is&#xD;
           needed. The investigators submitted the proposal to the following institution looking&#xD;
           for financial support: The Research Council Oman: status pending&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators asked the participating hospitals for their permission to utilize&#xD;
           their resources to conduct the study. The investigators got all the study's medications&#xD;
           and equipment from the participating hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Result dissemination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The result of this study will be presented in local conferences as well in international&#xD;
      conferences. The investigators will aim to publish the study in a well-known international&#xD;
      emergency medicine journal.&#xD;

    <description>Both medications used for the intervention groups are Glucocorticoids. The effect of glucocorticoids in AP can be attributed to their anti-inflammatory actions. They inhabit the formation of the pro-inflammatory mediators in the endothelial cells of the airways. This will decreases the inflammatory reaction at the pharynges which result in a reduction of throat pain.&#xD;
Studies have shown that the use of a single dose of systemic glucocorticoids for acute pharyngitis did not result in significant adverse events and no serious adverse events were reported (7) (8).</description>
