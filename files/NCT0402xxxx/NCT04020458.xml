    <textblock>
      The study aims to understand why dental infections in end-stage kidney patients results in&#xD;
      poor outcomes for kidney functions and eventually transplant. Further, if an active dental&#xD;
      treatment is provided to such patients, does it helps improve the kidney functional&#xD;
      parameters, and eventually results in better survival of kidney transplant. In addition, the&#xD;
      molecular markers that result in altered interactions between the blood cells and bacteria in&#xD;
      these patients will be identified and compared with those found in a healthy subjects, or&#xD;
      subjects with gum disease but no kidney disease. Besides, if any of the makers of altered&#xD;
      interactions found in the blood can be found to be altered in the saliva samples from the&#xD;
      patients with gum disease (periodontitis), and kidney disease, it will help to develop a&#xD;
      non-invasive oral risk test for predicting outcomes of kidney transplant survival.&#xD;

      PURPOSE: The Dental College of Georgia (DCG) and the Periodontics and Oral Health and&#xD;
      Diagnostic Sciences departments propose to develop a collaborative clinical and research&#xD;
      program with the Carlos and Marguerite Mason Trust Solid Organ Transplant Center at the&#xD;
      Augusta University (AU) Medical Center. The overall goal is to develop a dental intervention&#xD;
      program, with a research component, to address the role of dental infections in kidney&#xD;
      transplantation outcomes, with the goal of improving best practices for kidney transplant&#xD;
      patients. The study, which has been funded by the Mason Trust (C.W. Cutler, PI) is aimed&#xD;
      toward improving overall quality of life of the patients on dialysis or with kidney&#xD;
      transplant and reducing transplantation complications and failure rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: To evaluate the effect of dental intervention on kidney transplant outcomes for&#xD;
      patients with chronic kidney diseases awaiting kidney transplant/ or having received a kidney&#xD;
      transplant within two (2) years. This aim will examine whether dental intervention will&#xD;
      improve outcomes of patients with periodontitis (PD) and kidney disease, including kidney&#xD;
      function and allograft survival in patients with chronic kidney diseases&#xD;
      post-transplantation. Hypothesis is that active dental intervention will result in better&#xD;
      oral health in patients with chronic kidney diseases resulting in better transplantation&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: To determine the pathophysiological links between PD and chronic kidney disease with&#xD;
      or without kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis is that active treatment of PD in chronic kidney patients will shift the systemic&#xD;
      molecular profile towards anti-inflammatory, resulting in better transplant outcomes for&#xD;
      these patients. The correlation of expression of various molecular proteins in saliva and&#xD;
      blood will help to develop a non-invasive oral risk test for predicting outcomes of kidney&#xD;
      transplant survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three groups in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control groups: There will be 2 control groups. The data from these two groups will help&#xD;
      establish the baseline for the different parameters to study in the experimental population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1: moderate to severe generalized periodontitis (PD) (no kidney disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2: healthy controls, no PD or kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Group 3: Patients with chronic kidney disease : i. Group 3a- stage 5 (without dialysis,&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 20)/ stage 5D (on dialysis), awaiting kidney transplant.&#xD;
      (n=50) ii. Group 3b- Stages 2-4 (patients who have had either a living donor transplant&#xD;
      (n=25), or deceased donor transplant within the last 2 years (n=25), with /without no history&#xD;
      of rejection of kidney transplant) (total n=50).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Group 1 and Group 2 subjects will be recruited from the patient population at AU-Dental&#xD;
      College of Georgia (DCG), post-graduate periodontics clinic and/or primary care clinics at&#xD;
      AU-Medical College of Georgia or volunteers who are willing to participate in this research&#xD;
      study, after looking at study advertisements placed on DCG monitors or AU clinics. The group&#xD;
      3 patients will be recruited from among the patients registered at the AU Heath Kidney&#xD;
      Transplant Center, who are either awaiting kidney transplant (Group 3a) or have received&#xD;
      kidney transplant within last 2 years (Group 3b). The medical records of the potential will&#xD;
      be reviewed against pre-screening criteria to determine their eligibility for the study. The&#xD;
      eligible subjects will be invited for participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the pre-screening visit (visit 1), potential subjects will receive the Informed Consent&#xD;
      Document (ICD) describing the overall aim of the study, study design, participation, and&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. The consent process will occur in a separate room with no time&#xD;
      restrictions. All questions and concerns will be clarified by the PI /Periodontics residents&#xD;
      on the study or research coordinator. Consenting subjects will sign and date the consent&#xD;
      form, and will receive a copy of the ICD. Any study procedure will be initiated only after&#xD;
      obtaining a written, signed consent document from the potential subject. The consent document&#xD;
      will be stored in a locked drawer in the research coordinators office at the Clinical&#xD;
      Research Center, along with the subjects' records. At each of the subsequent visits (visits&#xD;
      2-8), eligible subjects will confirm consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures considered standard of care for all subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Filling out a medical and dental history form&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Being clinically examined by a dentist&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Receiving oral hygiene instructions, oral health counseling, and referral for dental&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dental intervention plan for Group 1 and 3 subjects with periodontitis only, considered&#xD;
           standard of care i. Full mouth intraoral X-rays (FMX)&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Full periodontal exam, diagnosis, Oral hygiene instructions (OHI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. RX: 7 days of p.o. metronidazole (250mg)/amoxicillin (500mg) T.I.D., combined with local&#xD;
      chlorhexidine rinses (not for subjects with Kidney transplant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Single visit intensive scaling and root planning (SRP) (full mouth)&#xD;
&#xD;
      v. Re-evaluation after 4-6 weeks (referral for definitive treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      vi. Extraction of teeth deemed hopeless based on periodontal, endodontic or restorative&#xD;
      considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      vii. Caries control, sedative dressing (palliative), referral to endodontic dentist for root&#xD;
      canal treatment (RCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of kidney function parameters, such as creatinine level and glomerular filtration&#xD;
      rate, will be done at the AU Health Kidney Transplant Center for Group 3 subjects, as part of&#xD;
      standard of care and follow-up visits at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures for research purposes only on all subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phlebotomy for peripheral blood samples (15 mls per visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sampling of dental plaque for microbiological analysis before and after dental&#xD;
           intervention program (DIP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measurement of unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rate measurement and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Collection of whole saliva for microbiological analysis, cytokine profile and other&#xD;
           molecular markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risks to subjects include&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There is a small risk that subjects using antibiotics may have gastrointestinal&#xD;
           problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is a small risk that the use of mouth rinses can temporarily stain teeth light&#xD;
           brown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There is a small risk that the collection of a blood sample may cause major pain and&#xD;
           bruising where the needle enters the skin, fainting and/or infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. There is a very small risk that periodontal probing, subgingival plaque sample&#xD;
           collection, and dental anesthesia injections will cause major discomfort&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. There is a small risk that SRP may also cause major discomfort and pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Withdrawal of fifteen (15) ml of blood from Group 3 subjects might put them at risk for&#xD;
           anemia. Group 3 patients will be monitored at the AU-Health Kidney Transplant Clinic for&#xD;
           anemia using CBC, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be actively assessed for the occurrence of serious (SAEs) and non-serious&#xD;
      adverse events (NSAEs) throughout the study. SAEs are defined as fatal or life-threatening&#xD;
      events that require inpatient hospitalization or cause persistent or significant disability&#xD;
      or incapacity. NSAEs are defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, condition&#xD;
      or disease temporally associated with a study intervention or medication. SAEs should be a&#xD;
      rare occurrence and NSAEs are likely related but not restricted to procedures for biological&#xD;
      sampling, scaling and root planning and antibiotic use including: inter-current illness,&#xD;
      fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, drug interactions, drug hypersensitivity, gingival&#xD;
      pain, dentine hypersensitivity. Participants will be asked about any abnormal signs and&#xD;
      symptoms and intra-oral examinations will be performed at every dental visit. Moreover, a&#xD;
      phone number will be provided to participants for reporting any unexpected AE. Any&#xD;
      occurrences will be recorded in preset forms and the following items will be assessed:&#xD;
      description of the adverse event, period, frequency, severity, relationship with study&#xD;
      procedures and medications, action taken and resolution. All SAEs will be reported to the IRB&#xD;
      accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality will be maintained by restricting access to subjects' data and&#xD;
      de-identification of datasets and specimens. De-identification of the research records will&#xD;
      be achieved by generating a subject study number. A separate list matching the subjects'&#xD;
      study numbers and dental records will be kept in a separate file, which will be stored in a&#xD;
      looked drawer in the research coordinator's office at the Clinical Research Center. Research&#xD;
      team members will only have access to confidential data as needed for the strict execution of&#xD;
      their functions. Subjects will not be identified by name in any report or publications&#xD;
      resulting from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of statistical analysis, there will be 4 groups with experimental group 3a&#xD;
      and 3b treated as separate groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a preliminary step, the Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to assess normality of each&#xD;
      dependent variable (DV). If the DV appears to be normally distributed, four-group repeated&#xD;
      measures analysis based on a mixed effects regression model (MRM) will be performed. For each&#xD;
      DV, MRMs will be used to assess the significance of each of the following design factors and&#xD;
      covariates: (1) Within-subjects (repeated-measures) Factor: Time (6 levels: Baseline, 4&#xD;
      weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years); (2) Between-subjects Factor: Group (4 levels:&#xD;
      Groups 1, 2, 3a, 3b); (3) Interaction terms: Time by Group, Group by selected covariates,&#xD;
      Time by selected covariates; and (4) Covariates (age, race, sex, etc.). For each DV, several&#xD;
      competing covariance structures for the repeated measures will be examined, including&#xD;
      unstructured, compound symmetry, Huynh-Feldt, first-order autoregressive, first-order&#xD;
      autoregressive with heterogeneous variances, etc. The Akaike (AIC) and Bayesian (BIC)&#xD;
      Information Criteria will be used to select the most appropriate covariance structure.&#xD;
      Tukey-Kramer adjustments will be made to any post-hoc multiple comparisons in order to&#xD;
      control the family-wise error rate at the 0.05 level. If a DV appears to be non-normally&#xD;
      distributed, an attempt will be made to identify a transformation to normality using the&#xD;
      Box-Cox method. If an appropriate transformation cannot be found, robust multivariate&#xD;
      analyses will be used instead of standard normal-theory based methods. All statistical&#xD;
      analyses will be carried out using SAS 9.4, and all statistical tests will be performed using&#xD;
      a two-tailed significance level of 0.05 unless otherwise specified.&#xD;
