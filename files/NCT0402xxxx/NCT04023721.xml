             cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must be willing and able to comply with all study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have HBV DNA &lt;LLOQ at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ALT normal or, if elevated, &lt;2× ULN with a documented etiology for elevation such as&#xD;
             non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) confirmed by either ultrasound or controlled&#xD;
             attenuation parameter (CAP) score &gt;280 on elastography&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Negative urine or serum pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential)&#xD;
             documented within the 24-hour period prior to the first dose of IP. If the urine&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of&#xD;
             contraception throughout the study and for 3 months after discontinuing study&#xD;
             treatment. Men with female partners who are of childbearing potential must agree that&#xD;
             they or their partners will use a highly effective method of contraception throughout&#xD;
             the study and for 3 months after discontinuing study treatment. Male subjects must not&#xD;

               -  Highly effective methods of contraception are hormonal contraceptives (oral,&#xD;
                  injectable, patch, intrauterine devices), male partner sterilization, or total&#xD;
                  abstinence from heterosexual intercourse, when this is the preferred and usual&#xD;
                  lifestyle of the subject. Note: The double-barrier method (eg, synthetic condoms,&#xD;
                  diaphragm, or cervical cap with spermicidal foam, cream, or gel), periodic&#xD;

                  interruptus), lactational amenorrhea method, and spermicide only are not&#xD;
