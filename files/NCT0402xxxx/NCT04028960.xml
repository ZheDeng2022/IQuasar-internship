  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how Humulin-R regular insulin affects the body's&#xD;
      ability to feel low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) when delivered intranasally compared to&#xD;
      placebo in subjects with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) with hypoglycemia awareness. The study will&#xD;
      use continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to collect this information. The study drug or&#xD;
      placebo will be administered using an intranasal device.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoglycemia occurs with high frequency among patients with T1D. With repeated episodes of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia, the counter-regulatory pathways to restore normal glucose are blunted, and&#xD;
      patients can become unaware of the hypoglycemia. It is estimated that 40% of patients with&#xD;
      T1D have hypoglycemia unawareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. To assess non-inferiority of dangerous hypoglycemia with administration of intranasal&#xD;
           insulin in T1D participants with intact awareness of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To describe changes in overall glycemic control with administration of intranasal&#xD;
                insulin in T1D participants with intact awareness of hypoglycemia&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To describe changes in hypoglycemia awareness with administration of intranasal&#xD;
                insulin in T1D participants with intact awareness of hypoglycemia&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To describe changes in safety endpoints with administration of intranasal insulin&#xD;
                in T1D participants with intact awareness of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exploratory:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To describe changes in memory, attention and executive function with administration&#xD;
                of intranasal insulin in T1D participants with intact awareness of hypoglycemia&#xD;

SipNose intranasal device: The SipNose device is an aerosol nasal delivery platform that uses pressurized delivery through the discharge of compressed air, resulting in an aerosol that delivers the drug in a narrow plume geometry, which targets the olfactory epithelium in the upper nasal cavity. From the olfactory epithelium, therapeutics rapidly reach the central nervous system, traveling extracellularly along the olfactory nerves. The device is not currently commercially available, but numerous studies have demonstrated its ability to intranasally deliver radiolabeled and therapeutic compounds to the brain.</description>

SipNose intranasal device: The SipNose device is an aerosol nasal delivery platform that uses pressurized delivery through the discharge of compressed air, resulting in an aerosol that delivers the drug in a narrow plume geometry, which targets the olfactory epithelium in the upper nasal cavity. From the olfactory epithelium, therapeutics rapidly reach the central nervous system, traveling extracellularly along the olfactory nerves. The device is not currently commercially available, but numerous studies have demonstrated its ability to intranasally deliver radiolabeled and therapeutic compounds to the brain.</description>
