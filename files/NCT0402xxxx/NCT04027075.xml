  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substance-abusing youth - especially those who are involved in the juvenile justice system -&#xD;
      are at higher risk than nonusers for mental health problems, including depression, conduct&#xD;
      problems, personality disorders, suicidal thoughts, attempted suicide, and completed suicide.&#xD;
      The proposed Phase II project aims to develop and test the efficacy of a mobile app, called&#xD;
      Rewire, that is geared toward helping high risk adolescent substance users reduce or quit&#xD;
      their substance use. The Rewire app is based on the primary substance use cessation&#xD;
      components tested in our previous work with juvenile justice-involved adolescents and on&#xD;
      intervention components shown to be central to smoking cessation; it applies a mindfulness&#xD;
      approach as the guiding framework for the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that interventions based on mindfulness have been an efficacious&#xD;
      intervention for a variety of problems, including substance use among adolescents. We propose&#xD;
      to adapt and test the feasibility and efficacy of a smart phone application (app)&#xD;
      intervention prototype that would help adolescent substance users reduce or quit their&#xD;
      substance use through the development of stress reduction, emotion regulation, and&#xD;
      mindfulness skills. During the development process, 20 high-risk adolescents will be&#xD;
      recruited for participation in focus groups and usability testing of early versions of the&#xD;
      app; their initial reactions to content and functionality will help guide final iterations.&#xD;
      Rewire is a twelve module program, and each module consists of a teaching component and a&#xD;
      practice component. Modules take 5 minutes or less to complete. Module topics include&#xD;
      developing an awareness of mind and body states, mindful decision making, and maintaining&#xD;
      sobriety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the Rewire app will be evaluated with 400 high risk adolescents that are&#xD;
      involved in the juvenile justice system; the first 20 adolescents will be involved in the&#xD;
      development process and the remaining 380 participants will be randomly and equally assigned&#xD;
      to the Rewire condition (n = 190) or the Department of Youth Services standard treatment&#xD;
      condition (n = 190). Youth will be assessed at baseline and will be instructed to attempt to&#xD;
      reduce substance use with a target quit date of 28 days in the future. The Rewire group will&#xD;
      receive instructions for using the app in the 28 days following baseline. All youth will&#xD;
      complete 1 and 3 month followups. Assessments will consist of online surveys asking about&#xD;
      substance use, emotion regulation, family demographics, and mindfulness practices. The Rewire&#xD;
      group will also be asked for their thoughts and opinions on the app. Biochemical verification&#xD;
      of self-reported substance use, a urine sample, will be collected at each interview.&#xD;
