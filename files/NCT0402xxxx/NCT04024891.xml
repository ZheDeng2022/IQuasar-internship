    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of Nyxol (phentolamine mesylate ophthalmic solution 1%) to&#xD;
           expedite the reversal of pharmacologic mydriasis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of Nyxol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of Lumify® to suppress conjunctival hyperemia (redness)&#xD;
           potentially associated with administration of Nyxol&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, 2-arm cross-over, double-masked Phase 2b study in approximately 32 healthy&#xD;
      subjects, evaluating safety and efficacy of Nyxol in subjects with pharmacologically induced&#xD;
      mydriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit subjects will be screened for study eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening, eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to one of the two treatment&#xD;
      sequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment sequence 1: Placebo (Visit 1), Nyxol (Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment sequence 2: Nyxol (Visit 1), Placebo (Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by mydriatic agent (2.5% phenylephrine or 1% tropicamide).&#xD;
      Approximately one half of the randomized subjects will receive 2.5% phenylephrine and one&#xD;
      half will receive 1% tropicamide. Subjects will receive their mydriatic agent 1 hour before&#xD;
      treatment. Each subject will receive the same mydriatic agent throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, pupil diameter (PD), accommodation, near and distance visual acuity (VA) and&#xD;
      redness in each eye will be measured before (-1 hour/baseline) and 1 hour after (maximum/0&#xD;
      minutes) the mydriatic agent instillation in each eye (i.e., right before the study treatment&#xD;
      is administered), and at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours after treatment&#xD;
      dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As needed, two hours post treatment, subjects may request the administration of Lumify® in&#xD;
      the non-study eye.&#xD;
