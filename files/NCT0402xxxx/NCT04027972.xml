  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A group of 6 able-bodied healthy volunteers will receive Neostigmine (NEO) and Glycopyrrolate&#xD;
      (GLY) intravenously and via 2 methods of Iontophoresis (ION): one-patch and two-patch&#xD;
      administration, with subsequent blood draws over 1 hour in order to measure the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic behavior of the drugs in-vivo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The maximum dose of NEO is limited to 10.0 mg and the dose of GLY to 2.0 mg per subject per&#xD;
      administration. Subjects will be asked to arrive at the Spinal Cord Research Center at the&#xD;
      JJP VAMC (Room 7A-13) on the day of their appointment. On Day 1, following the obtainment the&#xD;
      subject's consent, filling out a MoCA cognitive assessment and establishing an IV access&#xD;
      point, administration of the medications via IV will be performed. The study design will&#xD;
      consist of a Day 1 visit to determine the pharmacokinetic profiles of the IV doses of NEO and&#xD;
      GLY. During the second visit, at least 24 hours later, NEO (0.07 mg/kg) and GLY (0.014&#xD;
      mg/kg), applied separately to two patches, will be simultaneously delivered by transdermal&#xD;
      administration by ION for 20 minutes. During the third and final visit, at least 24 hours&#xD;
      following the second visit, a single patch containing 0.07 mg/kg of NEO and 0.014 mg/kg of&#xD;
      GLY will be applied to the skin and delivered by transdermal administration by ION for 20&#xD;
      minutes..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate, bowel sounds, blood pressure and symptoms will be recorded at 0, 2, 4, 7, 10, 20,&#xD;
      40, 60 minutes of the initiation of the IV push and at 0, 10, 20, 40 and 60 minutes after the&#xD;
      initiation of ION. Bowel evacuation time and time after the completion of delivery (by either&#xD;
      ION or IV) will be recorded throughout the study visit, as described in Table 2. The subject&#xD;
      will assume his/her normal bowel evacuation (BE) position until a bowel movement occurs;&#xD;
      privacy draping and privacy will be provided at the time of BE. The subjects will be&#xD;
      monitored for a minimum of 60 minutes. A minimum of two research personnel will be present&#xD;
      during the study visit to record all of data and perform the tasks required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the start a 30 second IV push of NEO which will be followed by a NS flush (12 mL), and&#xD;
      then a 30 second IV push of GLY which will be followed by a NS flush (12 mL), venous blood (2&#xD;
      mL) will be drawn into a gold-topped vial at 2, 4, 7, 10, 20, 40 and 60 minutes. Identical&#xD;
      technique blood draws will be performed at 10, 20, 30, 40 and 60 minutes after the start of&#xD;
      ION. Upon drawing, the blood will be placed in an ice bath and spun using a cooled centrifuge&#xD;
      within 5 minutes of collection. Upon completion of 5 minutes of centrifugation, the resulting&#xD;
      serum will be aliquoted into two separate vials, with equal volumes and labelled with date,&#xD;
      time of draw, associated procedure, NEO or GLY testing destination and the subject's unique&#xD;
      identifier. The transfer vials will be inserted into dry ice for at least 10 minutes, after&#xD;
      which they will be placed into the -80 degrees Celsius freezer. Plasma levels of NEO and of&#xD;
      GLY will be batched and measured at a later date. A file designating the tubes with random&#xD;
      numbers associated with the draw times will be created for each subject to conceal the&#xD;
      sequence of draw and to attempt the removal of possible bias during the measurement and&#xD;
      recording of the concentrations of NEO and GLY (SUNY Downstate Albany Research Laboratory&#xD;
      using GE LC-MRM detector).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Doses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1: 0.02 mg/kg NEO and 0.004 mg/kg GLY via IV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2: 0.07 mg/kg NEO and 0.014 mg/kg GLY via ION (Two patch administration)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 3: 0.07 mg/kg NEO and 0.014 mg/kg GLY via ION (One patch administration)&#xD;
