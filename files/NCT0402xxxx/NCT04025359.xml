  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty male and female (ages 18-60) participants with OUD currently receiving methadone or&#xD;
      buprenorphine will be enrolled. Prior to their daily methadone or buprenorphine dose and thus&#xD;
      at trough plasma levels of opioid, participants will receive dronabinol (10, 20mg) or&#xD;
      placebo. Subsequently, all participants will undergo laboratory testing of opioid-related&#xD;
      outcomes. Pain sensitivity will be measured using the well-validated Cold Pressor Test (CPT),&#xD;
      the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) and a pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS).&#xD;
      Attentional bias will be measured using a visual probe task. Negative affect will be measured&#xD;
      using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Cognitive performance will be&#xD;
      measured by a comprehensive cognitive battery. The order of study medication administration&#xD;
      will be counterbalanced order to minimize carryover effects. On the initial screening day and&#xD;
      at the end of medication treatment, blood will be drawn to determine serum cytokine levels.&#xD;
      One week after the last study medication dose, a follow-up session will be conducted during&#xD;
      which participants will undergo urine toxicology testing and a safety evaluation before final&#xD;
      discharge from the study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over human laboratory study.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to come to the testing site for a total of four times: one initial&#xD;
      screening session (~ 3 hours) and three test days (~ 6 hours each) where study medication&#xD;
      will be administered, separated by at least 72 hours to limit carryover effects for&#xD;
      dronabinol administration. Twenty male and female participants with OUD on MAT will be asked&#xD;
      to arrive at approximately the same time each morning, coordinating with attendance at their&#xD;
      opioid maintenance clinic. Subjects will be asked to refrain from using alcoholic beverages&#xD;
      and drugs during study participation. Urine screens and breathalyzer measurements will be&#xD;
      done before the test sessions to check abstinence from drugs (e.g., cocaine, illicit opioids,&#xD;
      benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and amphetamines) and alcohol respectively. Those who are&#xD;
      non-compliant will be discharged from the study. To minimize nicotine and withdrawal effects&#xD;
      on cognitive performance, subjects who smoke will be advised to continue smoking as usual.&#xD;
      Since we will provide a standard breakfast, participants will be asked not to eat for two&#xD;
      hour before they arrive for the test sessions. A study nurse will confirm with their&#xD;
      respective program that participants did not receive either methadone or buprenorphine that&#xD;
      morning, and will call the program when testing is complete to permit dispersal of that day's&#xD;
      methadone or buprenorphine dose. On the initial screening day and at the end of medication&#xD;
      treatment, blood will be drawn to determine serum cytokine levels. Participants will undergo&#xD;
      a variety of cognitive and self-report measures, as well as assessments to confirm restraint&#xD;
      from illicit drug use and lack of adverse effects of medication. Prior to their daily&#xD;
      methadone or buprenorphine dose and thus at trough plasma levels of opioid, participants will&#xD;
      receive dronabinol (10 mg, 20 mg) or placebo. Subsequently, all participants will undergo&#xD;
      laboratory testing of measures relevant to vulnerability to relapse, including physiological,&#xD;
      subjective and cognitive outcomes. The order of study medication administration will be&#xD;
      counterbalanced order to minimize the impact of potential carryover effects between the&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
