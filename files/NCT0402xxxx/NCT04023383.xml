  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyaluronan, a glycosaminoglycan found in connective tissues and extracellular matrix, has&#xD;
      been postulated to reduce postoperative adhesions, because of its unconditioned biological&#xD;
      functions at tissue repair but unfortunately it has a fluid nature that causes rapid&#xD;
      degradation, and it cannot effect long enough to work as an adhesion barrier.(10,11) For this&#xD;
      reason a New cross-linked hyaluronan (NCH) gel, that has higher viscosity compared to natural&#xD;
      hyaluronan has been developed by BioRegen Biomedical (Changzhou, Jiangsu, China). It has the&#xD;
      ability for gradually absorption within 1 to 2 weeks in vivo, which are the acquired repair&#xD;
      period and the critical time for adhesion formation. Although it seems evident that&#xD;
      endometriosis has a serious impact on the daily Quality of Life of women; comparable data for&#xD;
      the effect of adhesion barriers to patients who have had laparoscopic (Deep infiltrating&#xD;
      endometriosis) DIE surgery is missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore a pilot randomised controlled study was conducted to evaluate the effect of NCH gel&#xD;
      on short term quality of life in patients who had undergone laparoscopic surgery due to DIE.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective 1:1 randomised placebo-controlled study was conducted in our department during&#xD;
      the study period January 2017-January 2019. All patients were included after obtaining&#xD;
      written, signed informed consent before participating. All of the procedures were performed&#xD;
      by the same surgery team who are experienced in minimally invasive (Deep infiltrating&#xD;
      endometriosis) DIE surgery. The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      hospital (Approval number: 2017/04/35) 60 patients who were underwent for laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery for the treatment of deep infiltrating endometriosis without bowel involvement were&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows, aged 18 to 45 years, and undergoing&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery for suspicious of DIE and persistent pain irrespective to any medical&#xD;
      treatment. Patients were booked for follow-up visits at the 3rd and 6th month postoperative&#xD;
      months and wanted to fill the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria for the study were as; acute or severe infection, autoimmune disease,&#xD;
      known/suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to Hyaluronan or its derivatives, concurrent&#xD;
      use of a systemic anti-inflammatory or hormonal drug at least 3 months prior to the surgery,&#xD;
      clinical evidence of cancer; use of anticoagulant, fibrin glue, other thromboembolic agents,&#xD;
      or any other anti-adhesion agent during the procedure ,patients with surgically diagnosed&#xD;
      bowel involvement or need bowel resection, and who want to receive any postoperative hormonal&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were allowed to voluntarily withdraw from the trial for any reason at any time,&#xD;
      and could be terminated by investigators owing to safety concerns, violations of&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, or pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure The patients were laid low lithotomy position under general anesthesia.&#xD;
      Patients were assigned at random to either the NCH gel or control group in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      through a computer based program. A standardised technic with 4 abdominal incision&#xD;
      laparoscopic approach with 10 mm umbilical trocar for the optic camera and three 5 mm&#xD;
      axillary ports for the surgical instruments were used. All of the surgeries initiated from&#xD;
      exploring the pelvic cavity, identification of the ureters and dissection transection of the&#xD;
      pelvic adhesion by 5 mm bipolar cautery used at 25 kw for coagulation mode and scissors. The&#xD;
      incision was begun on the left pelvic sidewall just cephalad to the last deposit. The&#xD;
      incision was then extended towards the uterus, lateral and parallel to the left uterosacral&#xD;
      ligament. The uterosacral ligament was pushed medially and down and the healthy tissues&#xD;
      including the ureter were pushed upwards and laterally away from the dissection. It then&#xD;
      transected the right utero-sacral ligament and was continued along the right pelvic sidewall&#xD;
      just lateral and above the right uterosacral ligament until it extends beyond all obvious&#xD;
      deposits. All of the endometriotic foci was grasped and pulled then undercut and freed so&#xD;
      that the whole lesion and a surrounding margin of healthy tissue was removed. After an&#xD;
      extensive bleeding control the Patients in the intervention group had 40 mL of HyaRegen NCH&#xD;
      gel instilled into the peritoneal cavity through a large-bore cannula following standard&#xD;
      laparoscopic procedures. The patients in the control group had 40 cc sterile saline solution&#xD;
      compatible with the body temperature. Operators could not be blinded to treatment allocation,&#xD;
      but the questionnaire assessors and the patients were blinded to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre and Postoperative assessment of pain and quality of life A dedicated research assisted in&#xD;
      this study was asked the validated (visual analogue scale) VAS (dysmenorrhea, dyschezia,&#xD;
      dyspareunia, dysuria, and pelvic pain), (endometriosis health profile-5) EHP-5 and (short&#xD;
      form 12) SF-12 questionnaires before the day of the surgery. (12-14) A validated form of VAS&#xD;
      score was used and scored from 0: No pain to 10: the worst pain all in their lives in a&#xD;
      likert fashion. The VAS and (quality of life ) QoL questions were asked then in the 3rd and&#xD;
      6th month of during their follow up visits. A validated form of SF-12 that includes physical&#xD;
      functioning, role limitation due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health,&#xD;
      vitality (energy/fatigue) social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and&#xD;
      mental health (psychological distress or wellbeing) were asked. The questions are scored and&#xD;
      analysed using a statistical algorithm to give two scores: the physical component summary and&#xD;
      the mental component summary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A validated form of EHP-5 questionnaire was used to determine endometriosis related QoL of&#xD;
      the patients. EHP-5 consists of two parts: the first has a central questionnaire that&#xD;
      evaluate five dimensions - pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social&#xD;
      support, and self-image; and the second part measuring the areas of sexual intercourse, work,&#xD;
      relationship with children, feelings about medical professional, treatment and infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data analysis was performed by using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics for&#xD;
      Windows, Version 20.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). A one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was&#xD;
      performed to analyse the distribution of clinical variables. The frequency and percentage of&#xD;
      the categorical variables and the mean, standard deviation, median and range values of the&#xD;
      continuous and ordinal variables were presented. The study groups were compared using Student&#xD;
      t test for parametric variables and Mann Whitney U test for the non-parametric variables. A&#xD;
      post-hoc sample size calculation was performed via a two-sided Z test (α=0.05, β=0.20) for&#xD;
      each study groups in order to obtain VAS scores as the primary outcome A p-value of &lt; 0.05&#xD;
      was considered statistically significant for all calculations&#xD;
