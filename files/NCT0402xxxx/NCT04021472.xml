  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the investigators will examine whether text messages sent to Veterans will&#xD;
      help support in meeting nutrition or physical activity health goals. All participants will&#xD;
      get text messages over two month to support their goal.&#xD;

      Trial is suspended due to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are preparing to conduct a one-group pilot trial evaluating Veterans who&#xD;
      receive automated text messaging. Completion of this pilot trial will provide preliminary&#xD;
      insights regarding efficacy and feasibility of a text messaging program on self-efficacy,&#xD;
      goal commitment, and health confidence. It will also provide data on how best to incorporate&#xD;
      health coaching into the adoption and use of connected care technologies for health behavior&#xD;
      and behavior change.&#xD;
