  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is as an open-label study to be conducted at multiple study centres across New&#xD;
      Zealand and Australia designed to characterise the safety, tolerability and preliminary&#xD;
      assessment of the anti-tumour efficacy of bacTRL-IL-12 after intravenous (IV) infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening period (Day -14 to Day -2), treatment and observation&#xD;
      (Day 1 to Day 22), safety follow-up period (Day 28 to Day 31), and efficacy follow-up period&#xD;
      (until progression, death, revocation of consent, or lost to follow-up).&#xD;

    <description>bacTRL-IL-12 is a live, genetically modified Bifidobacterium longum (B longum), for administration via IV infusion. The probiotic bacteria selectively colonize solid tumour tissues and are engineered to deliver genetic material encoding the pro-inflammatory transgene Interleukin-12 (IL-12). Plasmid DNA encoding the IL-12 transgene is delivered to the patient's cells within the tumor microenvironment, whereupon IL-12 is expressed to stimulate local and systemic anti-tumour immune responses.</description>
