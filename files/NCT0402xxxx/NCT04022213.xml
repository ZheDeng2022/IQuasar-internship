  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test any good and bad effects of the study drug&#xD;
      131I-omburtamab. 131I-omburtamab could prevent the cancer from returning, or delay the cancer&#xD;
      from getting worse, but it could also cause side effects. Researchers hope to learn more&#xD;
      about how 131I-omburtamab works in the body, and how effective it is in treating cancer.&#xD;
      131I-Omburtamab is not approved by the FDA to treat DSRCT or other cancers of the peritoneum.&#xD;
