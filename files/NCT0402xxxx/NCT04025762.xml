    <textblock>
      The main objective of this open-label, multi-centre, randomised, crossover design study is to&#xD;
      determine whether automated day and night closed-loop insulin delivery for 16 weeks under&#xD;
      free living conditions is safer and more efficacious compared to sensor augmented insulin&#xD;
      pump therapy in older adults with type 1 diabetes. The primary outcome is time spent in&#xD;
      target range between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/L (70 and 180 mg/dl) as recorded by CGM. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are the HbA1c, time spent with glucose levels above and below target, as recorded by&#xD;
      CGM, and other CGM-based metrics. Measures of human factor assessments, cardiac arrhythmias&#xD;
      and objective sleep quality assessment will also be evaluated in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No study thus far has specifically evaluated use of closed-loop insulin delivery in older&#xD;
      adults with type 1 diabetes. During our previous closed-loop studies, if there is a&#xD;
      communication failure between the algorithm device and the insulin pump, the pump is set to&#xD;
      deliver pre-programmed basal insulin rates after about 30 to 60 minutes.The main objective of&#xD;
      this study is to determine whether automated day and night closed-loop insulin delivery for&#xD;
      16 weeks under free living conditions is safer and more efficacious compared to sensor&#xD;
      augmented insulin pump therapy in older adults with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, multi-centre, randomised, crossover design study, involving a 4-6 week&#xD;
      run-in period, followed by two 4 months study periods during which glucose levels will be&#xD;
      controlled either by an automated closed-loop system or by sensor-augmented pump therapy in&#xD;
      random order. A total of up to 42 adults (aiming for 36 completed subjects) aged 60 years and&#xD;
      older with T1D on insulin pump therapy will be recruited through diabetes clinics and other&#xD;
      established methods in participating centres. Subjects who drop out of the study within the&#xD;
      first 6 weeks of the first intervention period will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive appropriate training in the safe use of closed-loop insulin delivery&#xD;
      system. Subjects will have regular contact with the study team during the home study phase&#xD;
      including 24/7 telephone support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is time spent in target range between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/L (70 and&#xD;
      180mg/dl) as recorded by CGM. Secondary outcomes are the HbA1c, time spent with glucose&#xD;
      levels above and below target, as recorded by CGM, and other CGM-based metrics. Measures of&#xD;
      human factor assessments, cardiac arrhythmia and objective sleep quality assessment will also&#xD;
      be evaluated in this study.&#xD;
