  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cCHIPS study is a feasibility study for larger scale multi-centre studies and is designed&#xD;
      as a single-centre observational cohort, longitudinal, natural history study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of performing larger scale,&#xD;
      multi-centre studies to evaluate the relationship between CMV shedding in pregnancy with&#xD;
      congenital CMV (cCMV). There is no randomisation involved in this study and all participants&#xD;
      will perform the same study procedures and receive treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary (main) objective is to evaluate the prevalence (percentage of occurrence) of CMV&#xD;
      shedding in saliva, urine and vaginal secretions of CMV seropositive women throughout&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the quantity of CMV shedding in saliva, urine and&#xD;
      vaginal secretions of CMV seropositive women throughout pregnancy, to compare the prevalence&#xD;
      and quantity of CMV shedding in CMV seropositive women between different sources of shedding&#xD;
      (saliva, urine or vaginal secretions) and different gestational stages, to identify risk&#xD;
      factors for CMV shedding in CMV seropositive pregnant women, to evaluate the acceptability of&#xD;
      the study procedures to the participating pregnant women, to evaluate the proportion of women&#xD;
      approached who are recruited into the study and who are completing the study, and to evaluate&#xD;
      the relationship between CMV specific cell mediated immunity (a type of immune protection&#xD;
      following exposure to CMV) and CMV shedding in CMV seropositive pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tertiary objective is to compare the evaluation of CMV specific T cell immune responses&#xD;
      (a type of CMV specific cell mediated immunity) between the two commercially available&#xD;
      CMV-specific T cell immune response assays which are QuantiFERON-CMV and CMV-ELISPOT assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will aim to recruit 200 pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be undertaken in parallel with a separate study called RACE-FIT (REC&#xD;
      reference number 18/SC/0360, IRAS ID 239977), which will have ethical approval to screen&#xD;
      pregnant women with children less than 4 years of age booked for their antenatal care at St&#xD;
      George's Hospital, London, identified during the antenatal combined screening bloods&#xD;
      appointment or the antenatal booking appointment, for their CMV serology status on a sample&#xD;
      of blood collected as part of the screening process. As part of the ethical approval sought&#xD;
      for the RACE-FIT study and the cCHIPS study, the pregnant women screened and found to be CMV&#xD;
      seronegative will be eligible for recruitment into the RACE-FIT study and those screened and&#xD;
      found to be CMV seropositive will be eligible and approached for recruitment into the cCHIPS&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cCHIPS study aim to recruit over a 6 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves four visits (Visit 1, Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4) for each participant. The&#xD;
      total study period for each participant will be between 6 to 8 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The potential participants will be contacted via telephone, email and/or post by the study&#xD;
      team. They will be screened for their eligibility, and if they are interested in&#xD;
      participating, the first study visit (Visit 1) will be arranged where the written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained then before any study related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 will be held as soon as possible following screening, aiming up to 16 weeks and 6&#xD;
      days gestational age (early in pregnancy). Visit 2 will be aimed to coincide with the routine&#xD;
      20 gestational week appointment or any time in second trimester from 17 weeks and 0 days&#xD;
      gestational age to 27 weeks and 6 days gestational age (middle of pregnancy). Visit 3 will be&#xD;
      aimed to coincide with the routine 28 gestational week appointment or any time in the third&#xD;
      trimester from 28 weeks and 0 days gestational age onwards (late in pregnancy), Visit 4 will&#xD;
      be aimed to coincide with the participant's routine admission on the labour ward or postnatal&#xD;
      ward after giving birth, or anytime from the time of birth to 1 week postnatal age&#xD;
      (postpartum period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit, the participants will be performing their own study samples of saliva,&#xD;
      urine and vaginal secretions using the study specific self-sampling instructions provided.&#xD;
      These self-samples will be tested for the presence and quantity of CMV DNA detected via a&#xD;
      molecular technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). If consent is obtained, a blood&#xD;
      sample will also be collected at each study visit to test for cellular mediated immunity. At&#xD;
      the last visit, the participant will be offered to have her newborn baby tested for&#xD;
      congenital CMV by collecting the newborn's saliva sample which will be tested for CMV DNA via&#xD;
      PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit, the participant will complete a short questionnaire on the participant's&#xD;
      contact with their child(ren)'s saliva and urine (to identify risk factors for CMV shedding).&#xD;
      At Visit 1, the participant will complete a background questionnaire (also to identify risk&#xD;
      factors for CMV shedding)and at Visit 4 a feedback questionnaire (to assess feasibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where possible the study visits and blood samples will be aimed to take place alongside the&#xD;
      participants' routine antenatal appointments and routine blood tests respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, up to 20 participants will be invited to take part in a process&#xD;
      evaluation in the form of an interview by phone, skype or face to face to explore in depth&#xD;
      the experiences of participation in the study.&#xD;
