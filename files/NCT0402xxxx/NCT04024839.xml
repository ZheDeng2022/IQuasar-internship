    <textblock>
      This study was intended to compare the immediate, short term and long term effects of active&#xD;
      isolated stretch versus post isometric relaxation on hamstring flexibility in young healthy&#xD;
      adults.35 students were assigned randomly into two groups with 17 and 18 in each group. Group&#xD;
      A was given post isometric relaxation while Group B was Active isolated stretch. 22.2 year&#xD;
      male and female students with tight hamstring were included while any neurological and&#xD;
      orthopedic disorder were excluded. Active Isolated Stretch and Post Isometric Relaxation at&#xD;
      baseline, after first and final exercise session were calculated immediate and short term&#xD;
      effects while long term effects were calculated after two weeks of final session.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hamstring muscle is present on posterior region of thigh starting from gluteal region and&#xD;
      ending in popliteal fossa. Hamstring has three muscles biceps femoris, semitendinosus and&#xD;
      semimembranosus causing flexion at knee joint and help in extension of thigh. Biceps femoris&#xD;
      further consists of two heads (long and short head). Long head is supplied by tibial part of&#xD;
      the sciatic nerve, while short head is supplied by the common peroneal part of the sciatic&#xD;
      nerve. Muscles such as gastro-soleus, tibialis posterior, rectus femoris, iliopsoas, tensor&#xD;
      fasica lata, the hamstrings and hip adductors are more likely to be tightened in lower limbs.&#xD;
      Muscle tightness can cause the muscle shortness and does not allow full passive or active&#xD;
      range of motion. Full active and passive range of motion is only achieved when muscle is&#xD;
      flexible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tightness of hamstring muscle can occur due to many reasons like injury to the muscle,&#xD;
      prolonged sitting hours which are part of different jobs and educational setups. This&#xD;
      tightness could lead to strain of the hamstrings, which is the most common occurring injury&#xD;
      of the lower limbs. Moreover, hamstring tightness is also correlated with low back pain and&#xD;
      lumbar dysfunction. Massage and stretching relax the tightened muscles but cannot normalize&#xD;
      the tone or improve their coordination. To achieve this, investigator retrained muscle memory&#xD;
      by actively using those respective muscles. Simple stretching of different muscle groups&#xD;
      especially hamstrings has been found to improve the extensibility and length of shortened&#xD;
      muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, muscle Energy Techniques (MET) and their related post-isometric relaxation&#xD;
      techniques have demonstrated better results in improving flexibility of the tightened&#xD;
      muscles. Muscle Energy Techniques are used in soft tissue pathologies in which the patient&#xD;
      performs active muscle contraction in specific positions and in specific direction against a&#xD;
      force applied by the therapist. The therapist guides and controls the movement with&#xD;
      instruction. These are manual techniques that use contraction of the specific muscles and are&#xD;
      found to be effective in increasing flexibility of the muscles and improving range of motion.&#xD;
      The underlying mechanism through which improvement in extensibility and length occurs is yet&#xD;
      unclear and thought to be attributed to both mechanical as well as neurological factors.&#xD;
      Firstly MET techniques applied to increase extensibility of the muscles typically involves&#xD;
      following steps: stretching the muscle to the limit of barrier or person's tolerance,&#xD;
      secondly the person performs an active isometric contraction of the muscle being stretched&#xD;
      against a controlled resistance provided by the therapist, additionally the person relaxes&#xD;
      the muscle being stretched while the therapist continues holding the stretched position,&#xD;
      furthermore the therapist takes up the new range produced by muscle and lengthens it up to a&#xD;
      new barrier, and this whole procedure is repeated again according to defined guidelines. The&#xD;
      MET techniques can be modified with variations in different components such as force of&#xD;
      contraction, duration of the contraction, duration of the stretch and repetitions. This whole&#xD;
      process results in increased range of motion and improves flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Isometric Relaxation (PIR) is a type of MET that relaxes the tight muscles with&#xD;
      avoidance of initiating stretch reflex. This in turn results in reduced spasm and improved&#xD;
      ROM. The relaxation is induced due to isometric contraction of the muscles with facilitation&#xD;
      and inhibition. Active Isolated Stretch (AIS) is another type of stretching in which specific&#xD;
      movement is performed for a specific muscle with assistance from a therapist or self-assisted&#xD;
      (with rope or a band) and those particular movements are repeated again and again to induce a&#xD;
      relaxation phenomenon in muscles, fascia and connective tissues. In AIS, movements are&#xD;
      monitored carefully to avoid producing any stretch reflex .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single blind randomized control study was done in Islamabad federal college Islamabad with&#xD;
      the duration of 6 months from Jan 2018 to July 2018.the calculated sample size was 35&#xD;
      students (17 in group A and 18 in group B) through open epi . Non probability random sample&#xD;
      selection method was used on the behalf of inclusion and exclusion criteria. 22.2+ 2.02 year&#xD;
      male and female students of DPT with tight hamstring were included while hamstring injury and&#xD;
      any neurological or orthopedic disorder were excluded. The study was approved by the Ethical&#xD;
      and Research Committee, and all participants signed the informed consents. Group A was given&#xD;
      post isometric relaxation while Group B was given Active isolated stretch for a period of 3&#xD;
      weeks. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, after first and final exercise session to&#xD;
      estimate immediate and short term effects while long term effects were calculated after two&#xD;
      weeks of final session of interventions. Semi structured questionnaire was used for&#xD;
      subjective and objective assessment. AKE score, sit and reach test score and Lower Extremity&#xD;
      Functional Scale questionnaire was used to assess lower extremity functional activities. Sit&#xD;
      and reach test was also used to measure hamstring length.&#xD;

    <description>The objective of the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) is to measure &quot;patients' initial function, ongoing progress, and outcome&quot; for a wide range of lower-extremity conditions. Patients select an answer from the following scale for each activity listed:&#xD;
Extreme Difficulty or Unable to Perform Activity, Quite a Bit of Difficulty, Moderate Difficulty, A Little Bit of Difficulty, No Difficulty,&#xD;
The patient's score is tallied at the bottom of the page. The maximum possible score is 80 points, indicating very high function. The minimum possible score is 0 points, indicating very low function.</description>
