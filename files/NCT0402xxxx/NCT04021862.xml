  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of bermekimab in&#xD;
      patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The primary objective of the study is to&#xD;
      analyze the safety and efficacy of different dose regimens of bermekimab compared to placebo&#xD;
      treatment in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The study is multicenter and will&#xD;
      consist of three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Arm 1: Bermekimab every week (qw)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Arm 2: Bermekimab every other week (q2w)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 3 (Placebo): Placebo every week (qw)&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of patients with EASI-75 (≥75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index Score [EASI]) from baseline at week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD. Four AD disease characteristics will be assessed for severity by the investigator or designee on a scale of &quot;0&quot; (absent) through &quot;3&quot; (severe). In addition, the area of AD involvement will be assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk, arms, and legs and converted to a score of 0 to 6. The EASI assessment tool is provided in the Study Reference Manual.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from baseline to week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>TEAEs are defined as AEs that occurred during the treatment period and were not present during the baseline visit or were present at baseline but worsened in severity during the treatment period.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of patients with ≥4-point improvement (reduction) in the weekly average peak daily Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score from baseline at week 16 in patients with baseline score ≥4.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Pruritus NRS is a simple assessment tool that patients will use to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch) during a daily recall period using a study diary. Patients will be asked to complete the following question:&#xD;
• For maximum itch intensity: &quot;On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being the 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients with ≥4-point improvement (reduction) in the weekly average overall Pruritus Numeric Rating (NRS) from baseline at week 16 in patients with baseline score ≥4.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Pruritus NRS is a simple assessment tool that patients will use to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch) during a daily recall period using a study diary. Patients will be asked to complete the following questions:&#xD;
• For average itch intensity: &quot;On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being the 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch overall (on average) during the previous 24 hours?&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients with ≥4-point improvement (reduction) in the weekly average Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score from baseline at week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) is a unidimensional 11-point measure of pain intensity in adults. Patients will be given a diary to complete each night before bed, in which they will select a number from 0-10 (0 = no pain , and 10 = worst imaginable pain&quot;) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain. Patient diaries will be collected and responses will be assessed weekly until study completion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients with a Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 and a reduction in this measure of at least 2 points at week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA is an assessment scale used in clinical studies to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). The IGA is provided in the study reference manual.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients with EASI-90 (≥90% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index Score [EASI] from baseline) at week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD. Four AD disease characteristics will be assessed for severity by the investigator or designee on a scale of &quot;0&quot; (absent) through &quot;3&quot; (severe). In addition, the area of AD involvement will be assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk, arms, and legs and converted to a score of 0 to 6. The EASI assessment tool is provided in the Study Reference Manual.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) from baseline to week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a 10-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on QOL. The format is a simple response (0 to 3 where 0 is &quot;not at all&quot; and 3 is &quot;very much&quot;) to 10 questions, which assess QOL over the past week, with an overall scoring system of 0 to 30; a high score is indicative of a poor QOL. The DLQI is provided in the study reference manual.</description>

    <measure>Change in Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) (Anxiety) from baseline to weeks 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is an instrument for screening anxiety and depression in non-psychiatric populations; repeated administration also provides information about changes to a patient's emotional state. The HADS consists of 14 items, 7 each for anxiety and depression symptoms; possible scores range from 0 to 21 for each subscale. The following cut-off scores are recommended for both subscales: 7 to 8 for possible presence, 10 to 11 for probable presence, and 14 to 15 for severe anxiety or depression. The HADS is provided in the study reference manual.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) Scores from baseline to week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The POEM is a 7-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess disease symptoms in children and adults. The format is a response to 7 items (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping) based on frequency during the past week (ie, 0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = all days) with a scoring system of 0 to 28; the total score reflects disease-related morbidity. The POEM is provided in the study reference manual.</description>

    <measure>Change in SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score from baseline to weeks 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>SCORAD was developed by the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis. (Severity scoring of Atopic Dermatitis: the SCORAD index), as a measure of disease severity in AD. It includes assessment of the eczema in addition to patient-reported symptoms. Total score ranges from 0 to 103 (no disease to most severe disease, respectively).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Global Individual Signs Score (GISS) from baseline to week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>GISS assesses AD lesions for erythema, excoriations, lichenification and edema/papulation. Each component will be rated on a global basis (over the entire body surface rather than region) using a 4-point scale (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate and 3=severe) according to the EASI grading severity. Total score will range from 0 to 12 (no disease to most severe disease, respectively).</description>

             and/or insufficiently understood disease, may present an unreasonable risk to the&#xD;
             study participant as a result of his/her participation in the study, may make&#xD;
             participant's participation unreliable, or may interfere with study assessments. The&#xD;
