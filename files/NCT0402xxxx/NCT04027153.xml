      The investigators hypothesize that routing algorithm based ART delivery will be acceptable,&#xD;
      efficient and improve health outcomes, specifically through meeting client needs, retaining&#xD;
      HIV-positive persons in care, and achieving high ART resupply and viral suppression. They&#xD;
      also hypothesize that a fee for home delivery will improve retention and viral suppression&#xD;
      among persons willing to pay a fee for ART delivery. The investigators propose to test ART&#xD;
      delivery using routing science and fee for home delivery as strategies that could be&#xD;
      scaled-up to sustain lifelong ART.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa (SA), after an abrupt decline in the 1990s, life&#xD;
      expectancy has dramatically rebounded - all driven by the tremendous progress in earlier&#xD;
      initiation, once daily, and greater access to ART.23 Efficient ART delivery is key for&#xD;
      increasing population coverage and maintaining suppression for life. However, in SA, of the&#xD;
      7.1 million HIV-positive persons, 56% are on ART, and only 45% are virally suppressed (the&#xD;
      key indicator of treatment success). Men are less likely to be suppressed than women, due to&#xD;
      barriers to care including clinic bottle-necks in ART provision. On a given day, up to 70% of&#xD;
      a facility's prescription load is devoted to servicing repeat ART prescriptions.&#xD;
      HIV-associated mortality continues to be high, particularly among hard to reach populations&#xD;
      who do not regularly visit the clinic on a sufficiently frequent schedule to maintain&#xD;
      uninterrupted ART and viral suppression. Over four years, a third of HIV-positive persons in&#xD;
      SA are no longer retained in care. Clinically stable HIV-positive persons can safely and&#xD;
      effectively receive ART resupply and monitoring in the community. In SA, efforts to deliver&#xD;
      medications outside the clinic through the Centralised Chronic Medicines Dispensing and&#xD;
      Distribution (CCMDD), led by Project Last Mile (PLM), are focused in urban areas. Data are&#xD;
      needed on client preferences for modes of delivery in rural areas, as are innovative, high&#xD;
      impact strategies to simplify ART delivery and facilitate life-long ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decentralized ART resupply and monitoring supports successful differentiated service delivery&#xD;
      (DSD). Differentiated service delivery (DSD) for HIV (i.e. a client-centered approach that&#xD;
      simplifies and adapts services to reflect preferences and expectations of clients while&#xD;
      reducing unnecessary burdens on the health system) has the potential to deliver HIV&#xD;
      treatment, remove barriers to care, increase retention on ART, and ultimately prevent&#xD;
      disability and death at a lower cost. DSD may also have the advantage of de-bulking the&#xD;
      clinic allowing providers to focus on clients with medically complex cases. However, there is&#xD;
      a fundamental need to match the demand for ART resupply and monitoring with the ART supply,&#xD;
      accounting for client preferences for resupply from a local mobile van or at home for&#xD;
      convenience and to avoid stigma at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of data-driven delivery algorithms is to match ART supply with demand. Amazon.com,&#xD;
      the largest internet-based retailer globally, uses routing science extensively and is&#xD;
      established in South Africa. Enormous expertise and successful implementation of efficient,&#xD;
      low-cost, on-time delivery in diverse settings have been applied by Amazon to get goods to&#xD;
      the right person at the right time. Amazon is building their capacity for delivery to rural&#xD;
      areas in South Africa, the investigators target geographic location. Since minimal financial&#xD;
      resources are available (NDoH pays ZAR 9.36 = USD 0.75 per refill) delivery optimization is&#xD;
      essential. The classic computer science Travelling Salesman Problem is used to optimize&#xD;
      vehicle routing for delivery through computer algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators propose to adapt vehicle routing algorithms to determine the&#xD;
      placement of mobile vans for ART resupply and monitoring in the community. The study area is&#xD;
      divided into community clusters of HIV-positive persons who require ART resupply and&#xD;
      monitoring. Currently, the study coordinator decides on a weekly basis where the mobile van&#xD;
      should be placed, which may not adequately account for multiple cofactors (distance, travel&#xD;
      time, client availability). A routing algorithm would efficiently match ART demand with the&#xD;
      supply and determine mobile van placement. Importantly, algorithms can use the enrollment GPS&#xD;
      location of clients and do not require formal addresses. Routing science guided delivery has&#xD;
      the potential to increase efficiency and coverage of ART resupply and monitoring, reduce&#xD;
      logistic barriers for clients, and improve the cost efficiency to the health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The theoretical basis for proposing ART delivery to increase retention in care and viral&#xD;
      suppression is implementation intention i.e. a strategy that automates action control such as&#xD;
      planning to collect medication within a given window of availability or having the medication&#xD;
      delivered. A fee for the service of home delivery of ART could also increase commitment to&#xD;
      care through simplifying ART resupply, addressing logistic barriers (transportation costs,&#xD;
      clinic hours), increasing perceived value, and strengthening implementation intentions. To&#xD;
      address this separation between intention and action (unsuccessful intenders), cues and plans&#xD;
      support engagement in health. Meta-analyses have demonstrated that implementation intentions&#xD;
      have medium to large sized effects on behavioral outcomes. Paying a modest fee for home&#xD;
      delivery has the potential to increase implementation intention through immediacy and the&#xD;
      redundancy of further &quot;conscious intent&quot; (i.e. no additional planning required for clinic&#xD;
      collections), simplifying the resupply process. Practically, a fee for home delivery could&#xD;
      offset some of the costs of decentralized delivery, making it more appealing to&#xD;
      government/investors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conceptual model for strengthening ART delivery: Concerns about decentralized ART delivery&#xD;
      include how clients would access clinic care, the need for providers to monitor ART,&#xD;
      implementation challenges, and concerns about disclosure with home ART delivery. To address&#xD;
      these concerns, the investigators are using the evidence integration approach, adapted from&#xD;
      Glasgow and colleagues in the investigators current Delivery Optimization for ART (DO ART)&#xD;
      Study. The investigators are working with key stakeholders at the department of health,&#xD;
      policy makers, clients, and advocates to review evidence and rationale behind decentralized&#xD;
      ART delivery and monitoring and assess how to target strategies for scale-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data: In a series of studies, which demonstrate the investigators capacity to&#xD;
      conduct rigorous evaluation of community-based HIV testing and linkage strategies, and&#xD;
      utilize study results including costs to contribute to policy, the investigators demonstrated&#xD;
      that community-based HIV testing and counseling (HTC) results in &gt;90% knowledge of serostatus&#xD;
      and similarly high linkage rates for HIV-positive persons to HIV clinic, which was&#xD;
      cost-effective. Results from the investigators work supported the World Health Organization&#xD;
      HIV testing guidelines. However, drop-offs in HIV care resulted in only 60% of ART-eligible&#xD;
      persons achieving viral suppression (the Linkages Study). Logistic barriers at the clinic&#xD;
      such as long wait times, inconvenient hours, and multiple visits are barriers to sustained&#xD;
      ART adherence. Preliminary data on spatial analyses: In the Linkages Study the investigators&#xD;
      collected GPS data on the location of households and clinics and road map distances. These&#xD;
      data demonstrate the investigators ability to collect and utilize geospatial data in&#xD;
      statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance summary: the investigators hypothesize that routing algorithm based ART delivery&#xD;
      will be acceptable, efficient and improve health outcomes, specifically through meeting&#xD;
      client needs, retaining HIV-positive persons in care, and achieving high ART resupply and&#xD;
      viral suppression. They also hypothesize that a fee for home delivery will improve retention&#xD;
      and viral suppression among persons willing to pay a fee for ART delivery. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to test ART delivery using routing science and fee for home delivery as strategies&#xD;
      that could be scaled-up to sustain lifelong ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal is highly innovative and creative in three ways. First, while simplified,&#xD;
      decentralized client- centered ART delivery is essential for successful scale-up and lifelong&#xD;
      adherence, current strategies do not use routing science methods and are not client-centered;&#xD;
      they rely on existing businesses for pick-up points in urban areas. Working closely with the&#xD;
      world's largest, successful internet retailer (Amazon.com), the investigators will adapt&#xD;
      highly successful delivery algorithms methods to efficiently supply ART in rural settings&#xD;
      outside of existing formal facilities utilizing client data on resupply needs, delivery&#xD;
      preferences, and availability for pick-up. Second, they will leverage GPS guided delivery in&#xD;
      areas without a formal address system, thus increasing overall coverage for decentralized ART&#xD;
      delivery. Third, a small fee paid by the client could offset costs of home delivery in a&#xD;
      system with an extremely small margin (ZAR 9.36 = USD 0.75 is paid by NDoH for each&#xD;
      medication pick-up conducted by CCMDD in the private urban sector). Testing willingness to&#xD;
      pay for services to simplify delivery is innovative as the strategy could increase funds for&#xD;
      HIV care making home delivery cost neutral.&#xD;
