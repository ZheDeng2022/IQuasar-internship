      This will be a randomized, open-label, usability assessment of intramuscular, intranasal, and&#xD;
      nasal spray administration of naloxone using two different instruction sets by laypersons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design: Single site, open-label, randomized usability assessment of intramuscular,&#xD;
           intranasal, and nasal spray administration of simulated naloxone. A convenience sample&#xD;
           of participants will consent to volunteer in the study at a public venue. Participants&#xD;
           will provide verbal consent and will be randomly assigned a simulated naloxone kit&#xD;
           containing either intramuscular, intranasal, or nasal spray administration materials&#xD;
           with either standard or study team designed instructions for use. Participants will&#xD;
           enter a use scenario station and be asked to assemble and administer the simulated&#xD;
           naloxone kit to a mannequin (intranasal and nasal spray) or simulated flesh pad&#xD;
           (intramuscular). The participant will be instructed to start and will be timed until the&#xD;
           simulated naloxone has been successfully administered or 7 minutes has elapsed. The&#xD;
           participant will be observed by one trained investigator who will assess for successful&#xD;
           administration of the simulated naloxone and critical errors. The environment will&#xD;
           contain distractors.Once the participant has successfully administered simulated&#xD;
           naloxone or 7 minutes elapses the timer will be stopped. Successful administration of&#xD;
           simulated naloxone will be defined as administration of the agent without any critical&#xD;
           errors occurring (defined below). Data collected will include demographics (defined&#xD;
           below), successful administration of simulated naloxone, time to successful&#xD;
           administration of simulated naloxone, and Likert-item data assessing the ease of use of&#xD;
           the device and instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants: adults (18 years of age and older) at a public venue will be asked to&#xD;
           volunteer. Participants with severe visual or hearing impairment (defined as: legally&#xD;
           deaf, legally blind, unable to read print size provided on instructional handout, or&#xD;
           unable to hear video audio), that have previous naloxone administration training, that&#xD;
           are not English proficient, that are pregnant, or that have previously participated in&#xD;
           the trial will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kits:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Intranasal: simulated naloxone vial, bristoject, administration instructions&#xD;
                (standard or study team designed)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Intramuscular: sterile single use needle, sterile single use 3 mL syringe,&#xD;
                simulated naloxone vial, administration instructions (standard or study team&#xD;
                designed)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Nasal spray: simulated naloxone spray, administration instructions (standard or&#xD;
                study team designed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Primary: successful administration of simulated naloxone in the time allowed. A&#xD;
                successful administration will be defined as administration of the simulated&#xD;
                naloxone to the mannequin head of simulated flesh pad within 7 minutes and without&#xD;
                any critical errors (defined below).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Secondary: time required to successfully administer the simulated naloxone and&#xD;
                Likert-item assessment of ease of use of both the device and instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data and Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The usability trial will be conducted using a convenience sample so no power&#xD;
                analysis will be conducted or minimum sample size defined&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Demographics: age, gender, handedness, level of education, and presence or absence&#xD;
                of opioid at risk contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Data: successful administration, time to administration, and Likert-item assessment&#xD;
                of both the device and instructions. Failure to administer the medication due to a&#xD;
                critical use error will be recorded and the specific error reported for all&#xD;
                participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Critical Errors:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Intranasal: failure to remove both yellow caps from bristoject, failure to remove&#xD;
                cap from simulated naloxone, failure to attach atomizer, failure to attach&#xD;
                simulated naloxone, drug leak prior to administration, administration in only one&#xD;
                nostril, and failure to administer within 7 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Intramuscular: failure to attach the needle to the syringe, failure to remove cap&#xD;
                from simulated naloxone, failure to draw up &gt;90% (0.9 mL) of the simulated&#xD;
                naloxone, failure to puncture simulated flesh pad with needle, failure to push&#xD;
                entire volume of fluid in the syringe into the simulated flesh pad, and failure to&#xD;
                administer within 7 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Intranasal: failure to place the tip of the device into one nostril, failure to&#xD;
                depress the device and release the simulated naloxone, failure to administer within&#xD;
                7 minutes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Opioid abuse and addiction is a growing epidemic both in the United States and&#xD;
      globally. It impacts the health, social welfare, and economic stability of those directly&#xD;
      affected and society as a whole. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse there are&#xD;
      approximately 2.1 million people in the United States with substance use disorders related to&#xD;
      prescription opioid medications and another 467,000 addicted to heroin. Data from the Center&#xD;
      for Disease Control National Vital Statistics System demonstrated that the number of drug&#xD;
      poisonings involving opioid analgesics tripled from 2000 to 2014, and in 2010 opioid pain&#xD;
      relievers were responsible for 82.8% of all unintentional deaths in the United States.1 In an&#xD;
      attempt to combat this epidemic many states have implemented community-based opioid overdose&#xD;
      prevention programs aimed at increasing resources to combat addiction and distributing&#xD;
      naloxone to community members. These programs increase knowledge of overdose prevention and&#xD;
      the factors that increase a person's risk for overdose. Evaluations of these programs have&#xD;
      also demonstrated that nonmedical bystanders are able to administer naloxone effectively&#xD;
      after completing training.2 Naloxone can be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or&#xD;
      via inhalation. Opioid overdose prevention programs are typically initiated by local and&#xD;
      state governments, which allows for interprogram variability regarding the route of naloxone&#xD;
      administration used by community members. Pre-hospital data has demonstrated that intranasal&#xD;
      naloxone is a safe and effective alternative to intravenous naloxone.3 A usability assessment&#xD;
      comparing a naloxone auto-injector (EvzioÂ®) to the use of a nasal atomizer suggested that the&#xD;
      route of administration did impact the rate of successful naloxone administration by&#xD;
      nonmedical community members.4 Opioid overdose prevention programs typically utilize&#xD;
      intranasal atomizers, nasal inhalers, or intramuscular administration routes. In 2016 the&#xD;
      investigators conducted a usability assessment of naloxone administered by community members&#xD;
      who received training on how to use the naloxone device that was assigned. Our data supported&#xD;
      that intranasal administration with an atomizer or spray resulted in a higher administration&#xD;
      success rate when compared to intramuscular injection. Recently, New York, along with many&#xD;
      other states, passed legislation allowing individuals to purchase naloxone over-the-counter&#xD;
      without a prescription. This legislation has drastically expanded access to naloxone, but has&#xD;
      reduced the opportunity to train community members purchasing the medication. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to conduct a usability assessment of simulated naloxone in community&#xD;
      members in the absence of training to assess the rate of successful administration and time&#xD;
      to successful administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: The successful administration of simulated naloxone without training. A successful&#xD;
      administration will be defined as administration of the simulated naloxone to the mannequin&#xD;
      head or simulated flesh pad within 7 minutes and without any critical errors (defined below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total time required to successfully administer the simulated naloxone without training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of successful administration with standard and simplified instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of total time required for successful administration with standard and&#xD;
           simplified instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Likert-item assessment of the usability of the simulated naloxone product&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Likert-item assessment of usability of the naloxone administration instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Single site, open-label, randomized usability assessment of intramuscular,&#xD;
      intranasal, and nasal spray administration of simulated naloxone using standard&#xD;
      (package-insert) or simplified (developed by study team) instructions. A convenience sample&#xD;
      of participants will consent to volunteer in the study at a public venue. Participants will&#xD;
      provide verbal consent and will be randomly assigned a simulated naloxone kit containing&#xD;
      either intramuscular standard, intramuscular simplified, intranasal standard, intranasal&#xD;
      simplified, nasal spray standard, or nasal spray simplified administration materials. The&#xD;
      participant will enter a use scenario station and will be asked to assemble and administer&#xD;
      the simulated naloxone kit to a mannequin (intranasal and nasal spray) or simulated flesh pad&#xD;
      (intramuscular). The participant will be instructed to start and will be timed until the&#xD;
      simulated naloxone has been successfully administered or 7 minutes has elapsed. The&#xD;
      participant will be observed by one trained investigator who will assess for successful&#xD;
      administration of the simulated naloxone and critical errors. The environment will contain&#xD;
      distracters to mimic a community based setting. Once the participant has successfully&#xD;
      administered the simulated naloxone or 7 minutes has elapsed the timer will be stopped.&#xD;
      Successful administration of simulated naloxone will be defined as administration of the&#xD;
      agent without any critical errors occurring (defined below). Data collected will include&#xD;
      demographics (defined below), successful administration of simulated naloxone, product&#xD;
      assessment information, instruction assessment information, and time to successful&#xD;
      administration of simulated naloxone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: healthy adults (18 years of age and older) at a public venue will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Participants with severe visual or hearing impairment (defined as:&#xD;
      legally deaf, legally blind, unable to read print size provided on instructional handout, or&#xD;
      unable to hear instructions from a research staff member), that have previous naloxone&#xD;
      administration training, that are not English proficient, that are pregnant, or that have&#xD;
      previously participated in the trial will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods: All data will be analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics software.&#xD;
      Demographics data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics for continuous measures and&#xD;
      percentages for categorical measures. The successful administration of naloxone will be&#xD;
      compared between groups using the Chi-square test and a significant difference will be&#xD;
      defined as a p-value of less than 0.05 for the result. The time to administration between&#xD;
      groups will be assessed using a one-way ANOVA and a significant difference will be defined as&#xD;
      a p-value of less than 0.05 for the result. The Likert-item data will be reported as&#xD;
      percentage of response level and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with a significant difference&#xD;
      defined as a p-value of less than 0.05 for comparison between administration methods and&#xD;
      instruction methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis/Interpretation: As stated above data will be collected to assess both the&#xD;
      successful administration of and time to administration of naloxone. The rate of successful&#xD;
      administration will be reported as a percentage for each of the three groups and analyzed&#xD;
      using the Chi-square test. Successful administration is defined as administration of the&#xD;
      simulated naloxone within 7 minutes without committing any critical errors. Critical errors&#xD;
      are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intranasal (atomizer): failure to remove both yellow caps from bristoject, failure to&#xD;
           remove cap from simulated naloxone, failure to attach atomizer, failure to attach&#xD;
           simulated naloxone, drug leak prior to administration, administration in only one&#xD;
           nostril, and failure to administer within 7 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intramuscular: failure to attach the needle to the syringe, failure to remove cap from&#xD;
           simulated naloxone, failure to draw up &gt;90% (0.9 mL) of the simulated naloxone, failure&#xD;
           to puncture simulated flesh pad with needle, failure to push entire volume of fluid in&#xD;
           the syringe into the simulated flesh pad, and failure to administer within 7 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intranasal (spray): failure to place the tip of the device into one nostril, failure to&#xD;
           depress the device and release the simulated naloxone, failure to administer within 7&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to successful administration will be reported using descriptive statistics (mean time to&#xD;
      administration) and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. Times for participants who commit a&#xD;
      critical error or who do no administer the simulated naloxone within 7 minutes will not be&#xD;
      included in the analysis. The Likert-item data will be reported as a median with an&#xD;
      inter-quartile range and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A route of administration will be considered to be more user-friendly if it demonstrates a&#xD;
      statistically significantly higher rate of successful administration compared to another&#xD;
      route of administration. Additionally, a route or instruction type will be considered user&#xD;
      preferred if the Likert-item data demonstrates a significantly better score on usability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures: No study procedures will be performed on study participants.&#xD;
