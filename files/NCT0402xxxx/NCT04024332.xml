    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        General inclusion criteria for all subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent in the local language prior to any study mandated procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female subjects aged 18 to 85 years (inclusive) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) from 18 to 35 kg/m2 (inclusive) at screening. Body weight at&#xD;
             least 50 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential: Women must have a negative serum pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day -1. They must consistently and&#xD;
             correctly use (during the entire study and 30 days thereafter) a highly effective&#xD;
             method of contraception with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of non-childbearing potential, i.e., postmenopausal, XY genotype, Turner&#xD;
             syndrome, uterine agenesis: no contraceptive requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional inclusion criteria for healthy subjects (Group A):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal renal function as confirmed based on Creatinine Clearance (CLcr) by the&#xD;
             Cockcroft-Gault equation adjusted for age: &gt;= 80 mL/min for subjects &lt;= 50 years of&#xD;
             age; &gt;= 70 mL/min for subjects 51-60 years of age; &gt;= 60 mL/min for subjects 61-85&#xD;
             years of age; CLcr = ([140-age(years)]×weight (kg))/(72×serum creatinine (mg/dL)) (x&#xD;
             0.85 for female subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The CLcr value should be confirmed (± 25%) on Day -1 in case subjects will be dosed&#xD;
             more than 10 days after the day of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis test results not deviating from the&#xD;
             normal range to a clinically relevant extent at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each healthy subject must be matched with one subject with severe renal function&#xD;
             impairment with regard to age (± 10 years difference allowed), body weight (± 15%&#xD;
             difference allowed), and sex, determined by results at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional inclusion criteria for subjects with severe renal function impairment (Group B)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe renal function impairment as confirmed based on CLcr by the Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
             equation: &lt;30 mL/min, not on dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The CLcr value should be confirmed (± 25%) on Day -1 since subjects will be dosed more&#xD;
             than 10 days after the day of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation and urinalysis test results consistent&#xD;
             with severe renal function impairment at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical examination without clinically relevant abnormalities at screening and on Day&#xD;
             -1 (except for those related to severe renal function impairment), which would&#xD;
             interfere with the objectives of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        General exclusion criteria for all subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically relevant history of fainting, collapse, syncope, orthostatic hypotension,&#xD;
             or vasovagal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of renal and/or liver transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic cancer, primary biliary cirrhosis or any form of cholestatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of drugs which might interfere with the PK of ACT-541468 (moderate to strong&#xD;
             CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any circumstances or conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect&#xD;
             full participation in the study or compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional exclusion criteria for healthy subjects (Group A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or clinical evidence of any unstable disease and/or existence of any surgical&#xD;
             or medical condition, which might interfere with the absorption, distribution,&#xD;
             metabolism or excretion of the study treatment (appendectomy, herniotomy, and&#xD;
             cholecystectomy allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intake of any creatine supplement from screening to EOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional exclusion criteria for subjects with severe renal function impairment (Group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
        - End-stage renal disease that requires dialysis.&#xD;
