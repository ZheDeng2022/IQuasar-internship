      Studying in two randomized controlled trials (RCT) the changes induced by early HABIT-ILE in&#xD;
      functional, neuroplastic and biomechanical assessment in children with unilateral and&#xD;
      bilateral CP.&#xD;

      This study aims to evaluate the effect of two weeks of early Hand-arm Bimanual Intensive&#xD;
      Therapy Including Lower Extremities (HABIT-ILE) on bimanual performance in pre-school&#xD;
      children with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP) and on gross motor function in those with&#xD;
      bilateral CP, compared with two weeks of usual motor activity including usual rehabilitation&#xD;
      (control group). We will assess further changes in unilateral performance tests, daily life&#xD;
      activities questionnaires and executive function tests. Neuroplastic changes will be assessed&#xD;
      using brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) and biomechanical changes will be&#xD;
      assessed by using optoelectronic motion capture system with electromyography (EMG), to&#xD;
      determine the effect of HABIT-ILE on movement pattern and quality.&#xD;

For each type of activity, caregivers assess 3 dimensions of the child's participation: frequency (8-point scale; 0-7), level of involvement (5-point scale; 1-5), caregiver's percent desire for change (2-points level (y/n) transformed in percentage; 0-100) and perceived impact of environmental support (3-point scale transformed in percentage; 0-100).

Using a 8-point response scale, parents answer to 20 questions, indicating to what extent they have experienced the events or the situations described. A score of 7 means that they have experienced this aspect to a very great extent, or most of the time. A score of 1 means that they have not experienced this aspect at all. A score of 0 means that the question does not apply to them.&#xD;
There is no total score. However, because the statements are positively worded, higher total scores indicates that needs of the parents are being met to a great extent.</description>

The total score is the average of the scores for perception and satisfaction separately (score from 1 to 10; higher score means better performance/satisfaction)</description>
