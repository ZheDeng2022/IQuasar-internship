  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive decline (SCD) have&#xD;
      greater risk of developing dementia. Cognitive intervention is a topic of great interest in&#xD;
      individuals with MCI and SCD for the purpose of preventing or delaying the occurrence of&#xD;
      dementia. There are many different types of cognitive interventions, which aim to positively&#xD;
      impact the cognitive functioning of an individual and have been classified as cognitive&#xD;
      stimulation, cognitive training, and cognitive rehabilitation. However, most studies used&#xD;
      neuropsychological cognitive measures for outcome evaluation. The impact of cognitive&#xD;
      interventions on daily functional performance among individuals with MCI and SCD were rarely&#xD;
      explored. In addition, cognitive training focusing on specific cognitive outcomes is&#xD;
      suspected to have limited far transfer to everyday measures. Therefore, a multicomponent&#xD;
      intervention which integrates several types of intervention is recommended to reach the&#xD;
      maximum impact on daily function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study are to examine the effects of a multicomponent cognitive&#xD;
      intervention on cognitive and daily functional outcomes in individuals with MCI and SCD, and&#xD;
      to compare the effects between the two groups. In addition, the investigators will also&#xD;
      investigate whether the demographic (e.g., age and educational level, etc.) and clinical&#xD;
      variables (e.g., duration of cognitive complains, level of depression and baseline cognitive&#xD;
      function, etc.) may affect the outcomes of cognitive intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pretest-posttest design. Thirty-five subjects with MCI and 35 with SCD, who&#xD;
      are diagnosed by physicians, will be recruited from the neurology outpatient clinic of&#xD;
      National Taiwan University Hospital. All participants will wait for 16 weeks as a historical&#xD;
      control and then receive the multicomponent cognitive intervention. The intervention is&#xD;
      composed of 14 weekly 1.5-hour group sessions and 2 individual sessions in a 4-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multicomponent cognitive intervention in this study is a combination of several&#xD;
      approaches, including cognitive training, cognitive rehabilitation, lifestyle interventions,&#xD;
      and psychological interventions. Cognitive training is an approach which trains patients by&#xD;
      repeated practicing to optimize or restore cognitive functions. Cognitive rehabilitation is&#xD;
      tailored programs in which therapist usually provides patient strategies focusing on specific&#xD;
      activities of daily life. Lifestyle interventions educate and encourage individuals to make&#xD;
      changes to their life to balance the risk and protective factors. The strategies can include&#xD;
      regular physical exercise, healthy nutrition (i.e., Mediterranean diet), frequent&#xD;
      participation in cognitively-stimulating activities, and reduction of smoking and heavy&#xD;
      alcohol consumption. Psychological interventions target neuropsychiatric symptoms that are&#xD;
      common among individuals with SCD and MCI (e.g., depression, anxiety, fatigue, poor sleep)&#xD;
      and thus include relaxation exercises, mindfulness techniques, skills to manage stress and&#xD;
      poor sleep, and cognitive behavioral techniques. By using the approaches above together, the&#xD;
      investigators hope to improve participants' cognitive and daily function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be assessed at four time points: before waiting period (A0), before the&#xD;
      intervention (A1), right after the 16-week intervention (A2), and 16 weeks after the&#xD;
      intervention (A3). The primary outcomes are the subjective and objective performance of&#xD;
      activities of daily living, and the secondary outcomes are the cognitive performance on the&#xD;
      neurological tests, anxiety, and depression.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention takes place in groups of 6-10 participants and is leaded by one occupational therapist. It includes 16 sessions, 90 minutes each.&#xD;
The first part of each session starts with a 15-minute review of previous homework or relaxation. The second part, which lasts 35 minutes, involves structured training with activity-sheets, board games, role-playing and computerized games. The third part, which lasts 30 minutes, is the lifestyle interventions. The instructor explains the generalization of the previous activities toward daily life, and introduces healthy lifestyles. Through group discussions, the therapist guides participants to develop solutions and strategies for their memory or cognition-related problems and application to daily life. The last 10 minutes are used to suggest homework.</description>
