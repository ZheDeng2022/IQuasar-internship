  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to gain knowledge on the duration of symptom relief of environmental&#xD;
      disorders of the eye as might be present in allergy sufferers after allergen exposure&#xD;
      following application of the study products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the extent of symptom relief as well as tolerability of this topic treatment&#xD;
      will be evaluated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The term disorder describes the general development of physical symptoms without vegetative&#xD;
      or morphologically detectable impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These disorders cause physical symptoms with different severities and different impairments,&#xD;
      e.g. exhaustion, fatigue, headache, stomach and back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eye might also be prone to disorders. These manifest in symptoms like dry eyes, tightness&#xD;
      of the eye lids, foreign body sensation and reddened, burning, itching or watery eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disorders of the eye can be caused by extensive screen and computer work, air condition, dry&#xD;
      heating air or draught, as well as some drugs like birth control pills, or beta blocker.&#xD;
      Other causes are intense solar radiation or allergen exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reduce the symptoms, medical products like artificial tears (with fat additives, if&#xD;
      necessary, and applied as drops, gel or spray) are used to moisten the eyes and the eye lids.&#xD;
      Besides, eye drops and eye sprays (with different supplements) are also used to stabilise the&#xD;
      tear film.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The positive effect of Ectoin® was already proven in many studies: Ectoin® containing&#xD;
      products exhibited a good barrier function and effective protection against dehydration of&#xD;
      the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another formulation of Ectoin® for the use on the eye is Ectoin® Eye Spray Colloidal. This&#xD;
      spray is - in analogy to Tears Again® eye spay - applied to the closed eye lids and moistens&#xD;
      the surface of the eye with an Ectoin® containing liquid film after opening the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This form of application of Ectoin® is also registered as a medical product for dry,&#xD;
      irritated and inflamed eyes as well as the adjacent skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ectoin® Allergy Eye Drops 2% protect against harmful influences of allergens and support the&#xD;
      regeneration of irritated and sensitive conjunctiva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The package leaflet recommends the application of 1-2 drops in each eye several times a day.&#xD;
      In the scope of this study, a one-time application of 1-2 drops in the more affected eye will&#xD;
      be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ectoin® Eye Spray - Colloidal moistens the eye and thus protects the eye against&#xD;
      hyperosmolarity of the tear fluid. The package leaflet recommends the application of 1-2&#xD;
      sprays on the closed eye 3-4 times a day. In the scope of this study, a one-time application&#xD;
      of 1-2 sprays in the more affected eye will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tears Again® is a liposomal eye spray, which stabilises the lipid layer of the tear film and&#xD;
      thus improves the moistness of the surface of the eye: the underlying tear fluid is protected&#xD;
      against quick evaporation or against flow off the lid edge. The summary of product&#xD;
      characteristics recommends the application of 1-2 sprays on the closed eye up to 3-4 times a&#xD;
      day. A more frequent application, especially in cases of severe disorders is possible without&#xD;
      any problems. Within the current study, a on-time application of 1-2 sprays to the more&#xD;
      affected eye will be investigated.&#xD;

    <description>Relief of environmental disorders of the eye will be assessed by determining the time to onset of action using a patient questionnaire. The extent of relief as the degree of effectiveness will be determined using the following variables:&#xD;
• Patient questionnaire&#xD;
The questions from the patient questionnaire are:&#xD;
How do you rate your eyesight at this time? Unimpaired, impaired&#xD;
Do you have difficulties reading normal printed material in the newspaper? (no, a little, strong, stopped trying)</description>

    <description>Relief of environmental disorders of the eye will be assessed by determining the time to onset of action using a patient questionnaire. The extent of relief as the degree of effectiveness will be determined using the following variables:&#xD;
• Digital analysis of the redness of the eye.&#xD;
The redness of the eye is evaluated by means of digital image analysis. The patient's more affected eye is photographed parallel to the entries on the VAS. To capture the images, the same construction for attaching the camera as well as fixed camera settings are used to create comparable conditions. Captured data analyzed by MATLAB V.9.5.</description>

    <measure>Safety: All adverse reactions and adverse events that occur after signing the informed consent form must be reported, even if no investigational medicinal product was taken.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 hours after the application of medical product.</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed using the following variables:&#xD;
• The occurrence of adverse events.&#xD;
Safety: Adverse events and serious adverse events evaluated by physicians. Any side effects that were not present before the visit, and any side effects that reoccur or worsen after the visit. Abnormal clinically relevant results from diagnostic procedures, including out-of-range laboratory testing, should be considered as an AE. If adverse reactions occur after the visit, the patient is encouraged to contact the doctor by telephone.</description>
