      Rationale: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is defined by airway obstruction.&#xD;
      However, the degree of airflow limitation does not adequately describe the complexity of COPD&#xD;
      because significant heterogeneity exists between patients with respect to their clinical&#xD;
      presentation, physiology, imaging, response to therapy, decline in lung function and&#xD;
      survival. Currently, a clear alternative for describing COPD does not exist but the&#xD;
      identification of subgroups of COPD patients based on clinical or genomic and epigenomic&#xD;
      factors (phenotypes) could be useful. The continuous flow of very severe COPD patients to the&#xD;
      UMCG gives the investigators the unique opportunity to perform a study on the phenotypes of&#xD;
      very severe COPD and the underlying gene-environment interaction. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that the findings of this study will lead to an earlier identification of those&#xD;
      subjects who are at risk to develop severe or very severe COPD. In addition, it will lead to&#xD;
      a better clinical characterisation of established COPD, possibly enabling a more tailored&#xD;
      treatment of different COPD subphenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify new clinical phenotypes in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD) using a cluster analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify clinical phenotypes (based on e.g. lung function, clinical, radiologic,&#xD;
           systemic, pathological and immunological parameters) in patients with severe COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify endotypes/ intermediate phenotypes in patients with severe COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  investigate the contribution of (epi)genomics (including genetics and gene expression)&#xD;
           to characterize patients with subsets of severe COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Observational cross-sectional study with a 2 phase design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients with severe COPD who are referred to the UMCG for a consultation&#xD;
      on lung transplantation or bronchoscopic lung volume reduction.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Main study parameters: The main study parameter is the identification of new clinical&#xD;
      phenotypes. The collected data will allow us to identify new phenotypes, clusters of patients&#xD;
      with comparable characteristics. These phenotypes are potentially based on a combination of&#xD;
      lung function, clinical, radiologic, systemic and genomic parameters and endotypes, in&#xD;
      patients with severe COPD.&#xD;
