    <textblock>
      The prevalence of overweight, obesity and T2D among American Indians (AIs) in the Albuquerque&#xD;
      service area of Indian Health Services (IHS) serving all pueblos in New Mexico including&#xD;
      Pueblo of Acoma is disproportionately elevated. Specifically, among AI, adults age 18 and&#xD;
      over in the IHS Albuquerque Service Area, 51% have a BMI &gt; 30, which significantly exceeds&#xD;
      the rate of obesity observed nationally (35.3%) and the Healthy People 2020 target of 30.5%.&#xD;
      Likewise, the rate of T2D (22.8%) among the adult AI population in our Albuquerque service&#xD;
      area is almost double the rate of the U.S. adult population (12.2%), and the age-adjusted&#xD;
      diabetes mortality rate for AIs was 104.7 per 100,000 compared to 23.1 per 100,000 among&#xD;
      non-Hispanic Whites in the region. At the same time, the median age of diagnosis of T2D among&#xD;
      AI adults was much younger (42.2 years) than the national average (53.8 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our major goal of implementing educational interventions to slow the current rate of increase&#xD;
      in diabetes in Native communities is aligned with NIH's (NIGMS) and NM INBRE's vision in&#xD;
      reducing health disparity using innovative interventions. The investigators propose following&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Recruit and Screen 300 community members in Acoma Pueblo, NM to identify incident&#xD;
      cases of pre-diabetes for the proposed study of Home Based Diabetes Care (HBDC);&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Enroll 150 Acoma Natives aged 21-70 years, at risk for T2D (i.e., overweight, obese,&#xD;
      and/or with at least one affected first degree relative or a history of gestational DM) and&#xD;
      conduct HBDC for a 16-week lifestyle intervention in a longitudinal cohort study. Randomize&#xD;
      household in a 1:1 allocation to enter either the intervention arm immediately or after a&#xD;
      12-month waiting list in control arm. Control participants will be treated with usual care.&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the waiting list will enter the intervention group 12 months after&#xD;
      entering the study. Both intervention groups will be followed longitudinally for total of 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with people who will receive &quot;usual care (control group)&quot;, prediabetic participants&#xD;
      receiving 4 months of the HBDC will exhibit improved risk factor profiles for diabetes,&#xD;
      obesity and heart disease, improved Patient Activation Measures, improved adherence with&#xD;
      medical treatment, and improved Quality of Life scores.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a prospective, randomized clinical trial of 'Home Base&#xD;
      Diabetes Care (HBDC)' versus usual care (delayed HBDC beginning 12 months after enrollment)&#xD;
      among 150 Acoma citizens with prediabetes from approximately 60 households. The household&#xD;
      will serve as the unit of randomization to prevent cross-contamination of the study groups.&#xD;
      The investigators hope to demonstrate that HBDC will result in improved patient activation&#xD;
      and adherence, improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and ultimately, improved&#xD;
      diabetes-related health outcomes. Standard, usual care is an appropriate comparison group&#xD;
      because it is widely available in Acoma through IHS and because there are a number of other&#xD;
      existing resources in Acoma that participants can access to achieve their healthcare goals if&#xD;
      they choose to do so. Improved Patient Activation may drive increased utilization of these&#xD;
      existing resources. The study will be non-blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 5-year study with screening and rolling enrollment beginning during the first year.&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the HBDC group will receive 16 weeks of the intervention and will&#xD;
      subsequently have one additional data collection visit 12 months after the intervention&#xD;
      (total participation approximately 16 months). Participants randomized to the usual care&#xD;
      group (delayed HBDC) will begin the HBDC intervention at 12 months. The intervention will be&#xD;
      16 weeks and a final data collection visit will be conducted 12 months after the intervention&#xD;
      (total participation approximately 28 months). During the HBDC intervention, both groups will&#xD;
      receive 8 home visits over 16 weeks (every other week) and 3 text messages per week. Data&#xD;
      analysis and dissemination will be conducted during the final year of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use community health representatives (CHRs) in collaboration with&#xD;
      licensed personnel at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center (UNM HSC) to&#xD;
      provide a comprehensive home-based intervention to prevent diabetes and improve health&#xD;
      through counseling around lifestyle interventions such as diet and exercise. CHRs will make&#xD;
      regularly scheduled home visits and they will have a lap top computer with internet access&#xD;
      and telemedicine contact with personnel at UNM HSC (Dr. Bouchonville, in his role as Medical&#xD;
      Director/Facilitator of the weekly Endo ECHO sessions) for ongoing review of care plans, and&#xD;
      management of prediabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and kidney disease according to&#xD;
      current American Diabetes Association guidelines. In a collaborative manner, the participant&#xD;
      and healthcare team will set appropriately realistic treatment goals. Professional personnel&#xD;
      from UNM Clinical and Translational Science Center (e.g., physicians and bio-nutritionists)&#xD;
      and HSC (Endo ECHO) will serve as consultants to the primary dyad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects randomized to the HBDC arm will be visited by a CHR in their home at least every&#xD;
      two weeks for the duration of the 16 weeks intervention. All enrolled members of a household&#xD;
      unit will attend these visits. Given 25-35 households per study arm (comprising 75&#xD;
      participants each) and two full time CHRs working on the study, each CHR will be responsible&#xD;
      for approximately 15 households and up to 30 home visits per month, although this latter&#xD;
      estimate is high given that rolling enrollment will occur over a 2-3 year period. Each visit&#xD;
      will last one hour and will cover curriculum materials agreed upon by the study team and&#xD;
      prioritized by the participants. Other members of the household who do not have prediabetes&#xD;
      or who are not enrolled in the study will also be allowed to participate in the sessions if&#xD;
      they wish, and all subjects will be encouraged to keep their IHS appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome - To demonstrate that prediabetes risk profiles will improve with HBDC as&#xD;
      compared to usual care: To evaluate the effectiveness of the HBDC intervention, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess between-group changes in the T2D risk profile of study participants&#xD;
      using change in Body Mass Index and A1c as our primary outcome parameters. To reproduce&#xD;
      real-life community healthcare conditions, A1c will be assessed in both study groups with POC&#xD;
      as an indicator of 90 day glucose homeostasis. BMI will be determined using a SECA 876 Floor&#xD;
      Scale (SECA Inc., Chino, CA), and height will be assessed using SECA 217 Portable Stadiometer&#xD;
      with floor scale adapter. Study participants in the intervention arm will be counseled to&#xD;
      lose 5% of their body weight over the course of the 12-month study. This is a reasonable&#xD;
      weight-loss goal based on the following: (1) in our previous extended family-based studies,&#xD;
      45.9% were obese, and all of the randomized participants will have BMI &gt;27 kg/m2; (2) in our&#xD;
      previous study, participants in the lifestyle intervention successfully met weight goals over&#xD;
      a relatively short period of time; and (3) eliminating or expending enough energy to burn 500&#xD;
      calories/day, while making no other changes, will result in a weight loss of up to 0.5 kg per&#xD;
      week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological variables include: (a) T2D incidence determined at each outcome assessment&#xD;
      according to the criteria established by the American Diabetes Association (FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL&#xD;
      and/or A1c &gt; 6.4%); (b) Waist-to-hip ratio following the protocol used in the Diabetes&#xD;
      Prevention Program; (c) Fasting blood glucose (i-STAT system, Abbott Laboratories, Princeton,&#xD;
      NJ); (d) Blood pressure determined using 2 measures after 5 minutes of sitting using an&#xD;
      electronic implement (Prestige Medical, Northridge CA); and (e) Fasting lipid panel (HDL,&#xD;
      LDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides) at baseline, 16 weeks, and 16 months (HBDC group)&#xD;
      and baseline, 12 months, 16 months, and 28 months (Usual Care/delayed HBDC group). Dietary&#xD;
      change will be assessed by comparing the results of a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) from&#xD;
      baseline to month 12 and at post-intervention follow-up. The study will use a FFQ developed&#xD;
      for and validated in American Indians. Participants in the intervention arm will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a three-day food record once per month over the three days before the next home&#xD;
      visit. Weekly activity logs, as well as pedometer data, will be collected over a one week&#xD;
      period prior to assessment at 0, 8, and 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: The PAM is the secondary outcome variable of Aim 2, and a PAM score will&#xD;
      be obtained at 0, 6, and 12 weeks and at 12 month follow-up in all participants. In all&#xD;
      cases, data will be collected within a two week window of the target date, except for the 12&#xD;
      month post-intervention time point, which will occur within a one month window of the 12&#xD;
      month target date. The investigators will use a short version of PAM using a 13-item survey&#xD;
      tool designed to assess a person's knowledge, skill, and confidence in managing his or her&#xD;
      own healthcare. The response options for the 13 PAM questions use a categorical agreement&#xD;
      scale with 4 response options: (i) strongly disagree, (ii) disagree, (iii) agree, (iv)&#xD;
      strongly agree, and N/A. The raw score will be calculated by adding responses to the 13&#xD;
      questions. If all questions are answered (i.e., no &quot;N/A&quot; is used), the range of raw scores&#xD;
      would be 13 to 52. If there is at least 1 item with a response of N/A, the total score will&#xD;
      be divided by the number of items completed and multiplied by 13 to yield a normalized raw&#xD;
      score. A nomogram provided by Dr. Hibbard converts raw scores to an &quot;activation score,&quot;&#xD;
      ranging from 0 to 100. Activation score cut points derived from Dr. Hibbard's preliminary&#xD;
      data will assign participants into 1 of 4 stages of progressive activation: (i) believes an&#xD;
      active role is important; (ii) has the confidence and knowledge to take action; (iii) is&#xD;
      taking action; and (iv) is able to maintain course under stress. The survey has been fully&#xD;
      developed and validated. Higher PAM scores are associated with healthy behaviors, a higher&#xD;
      likelihood of practicing self-management behaviors, and higher medication adherence. Patients&#xD;
      scoring at the lower end of the activation scale may believe that the physician is the one to&#xD;
      &quot;fix&quot; them, while mid-range scores indicate that patients recognize that they must be&#xD;
      involved in their care but lack the knowledge to do so effectively. Patients with high PAM&#xD;
      scores possess confidence in their ability to self-manage and make healthy changes. Thus,&#xD;
      progression in PAM score is an ideal indicator to reflect improvement in health literacy,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and self-determination among at-risk, health-disparate peoples such as the&#xD;
      Acoma. In Aim 2, the investigators will demonstrate that participants in the HBDC group will&#xD;
      advance at least one level in activation as compared to participants in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to treatment is another secondary outcome of Aim 2. Although adherence can be&#xD;
      difficult to measure in a community based study such as this, the investigators will employ a&#xD;
      comprehensive approach to informing patients about the importance of their treatment plans&#xD;
      and to assessing adherence by combining education with behavior modification strategies (24).&#xD;
      Indicators of adherence will include pill counts, process-oriented information (refill&#xD;
      records), sessions attended, appointments kept, and diet and activity log books kept. For the&#xD;
      purposes of data analysis, the investigators have devised a simple three-point system for&#xD;
      determining adherence. Participants will receive one point for each of three benchmarks&#xD;
      achieved: (a) &gt;80% of prescribed medications taken over the past 30 days (medications counted&#xD;
      will include anti-hypertensive medications, lipid-lowering medications, and glucose lowering&#xD;
      medications); (b) &gt;80% of all health-related appointments kept during the past six months;&#xD;
      and (c) 100% of activity log books kept over the past two weeks. Data on &quot;appointments kept&quot;&#xD;
      will include a composite of scheduled IHS clinic appointments.&#xD;
