  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy is a vulnerable period for both a mother and her developing child. The investigator&#xD;
      hypothesizes that diet-induced glucose excursions in the pregnant mother are a key&#xD;
      contributor to unfavourable brain development and epigenetic marks in the developing child.&#xD;
      It is long known that metabolic conditions are influenced by maternal nutrition and that this&#xD;
      can impact the unborn infant. The most prominent example is gestational diabetes (GDM). It is&#xD;
      unclear at what point unfavourable changes in brain development occur during pregnancy.&#xD;
      Unlike many previous trials, we plan to introduce healthy diet early in the first trimester.&#xD;
      Comparative analyses of DNA methylation patterns in the offspring of women with or without&#xD;
      GDM revealed preferentially methylated genes, particularly in pathways linked to metabolic&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NuPreGDM is a randomized, controlled, open label intervention trail. The investigator aims to&#xD;
      assess the effect of individual diet counselling combined with CGM compared to regular diet&#xD;
      on glucose levels and postprandial glycemic excursions during an OGTT in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator wants to assess the effect of dietary counselling combined with continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitoring on GDM risk, glycaemia and pregnancy outcome, starting in the first&#xD;
      trimester. The investigator further hypothesizes that improved glucose levels by a healthy&#xD;
      diet will affect brain activity of the infant and prevent unfavourable epigenetic&#xD;
      modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator plans to include 50 pregnant women within gestational week 4 and 14 after&#xD;
      the last menstruation, with elevated risk for development of (GDM). Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to either &quot;diet modification group&quot; (intervention) or to &quot;standard diet group&quot;&#xD;
      (control). In the current trial, the investigator aims to modulate maternal metabolism with&#xD;
      periodic personalized diet counselling on the basis of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)&#xD;
      compared to regular diet throughout pregnancy. The investigator propose that a reduction in&#xD;
      glucose excursions in the mother will lead to a healthy environment for the developing child&#xD;
      and prevent altered brain activity in utero, which will be assessed by fMEG (fetal&#xD;
      magnetoencephalography) during a 75g OGTT in gestational week 28. The investigator further&#xD;
      planned to examine child's leucocytes from cord blood to assess whether a healthy diet of the&#xD;
      mother prevented epigenetic alterations due to improved maternal glycaemia, as exploratory&#xD;
      endpoint. The development of blood sugar levels of the mother postpartum will be assessed by&#xD;
      an further OGTT 6-12 weeks postpartum.&#xD;
