  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite standardized intervention strategies, weight loss and weight loss maintenance largely&#xD;
      differ from person to person. Factors which may contribute to these individual differences is&#xD;
      current object of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to investigate predictors and barriers for weight management and to investigate two&#xD;
      different dietary interventions and two different digital tools for weight maintenance, the&#xD;
      LION-Study was designed as follows: Step I (screening, baseline phenotyping), step II (weight&#xD;
      loss intervention with formula diet), step III (weight maintenance intervention with 4&#xD;
      intervention groups: low carb/newsletter; low carb/app; low fat/newsletter; low fat/app) and&#xD;
      step IV (follow-up). Participants are required to attend visits at seven time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening (month 0) a telephone-based screening interview takes place, in order to test&#xD;
      eligibility of the potential participant. If the person is eligible, two consecutive baseline&#xD;
      face-to-face visits are planned during step I. After completion of the eight weeks weight&#xD;
      loss intervention (month 3), an additional visit takes place followed by three consecutive&#xD;
      visits in the weight maintenance step (month 6, 9 and 15). The study ends with a final visit&#xD;
      after the follow-up (month 27). Additional contacts (face-to-face and telephone) take place&#xD;
      during the weight loss intervention step. Participants will regularly receive a bag with the&#xD;
      required formula diet meals. During these &quot;pick up&quot; appointments, the study team actively get&#xD;
      in face-to-face contact with participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the different visits, data are collected by questionnaires, medical investigations (e.g.&#xD;
      MRI, motor function, resting metabolic rate), blood withdrawal as well as urine, feces and&#xD;
      saliva sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to evaluate the effect of two diets (low carb/low fat) and two digital&#xD;
      tools (app/newsletter) on long-term weight loss maintenance 12 months after weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective is to identify genetic, epigenetic, physiological, psychological and&#xD;
      lifestyle factors that predict the success of weight loss and weight loss maintenance.&#xD;

      Step I - Screening and baseline phenotyping When a potential suitable participant is&#xD;
      interested, a screening interview to check eligibility will take place by phone after oral&#xD;
      agreement is given. The structured screening interview is carried out by means of a&#xD;
      questionnaire in the format of a Case Report Form (CRF). Suitable persons are provided with&#xD;
      participant´s information and data protection sheet and with the &quot;declaration of consent&quot;.&#xD;
      Sufficient time for consideration is given between the screening interview and visit 1A,&#xD;
      where written consent is signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the telephone-based screening interview, eligible participants are required to provide&#xD;
      written consent. Participants will undergo clinical examinations at two visits (V1A + V1B),&#xD;
      serving primarily for phenotyping as well as for detection of potentially unknown exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. The order of some measurements carried out during V1A and V1B as well as the type&#xD;
      of lipid challenge is randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection V1A:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Blood parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical, lifestyle (nutrition, physical activity), psychological, environmental and&#xD;
           social factors (questionnaires and protocols)&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Optional: Adipose tissue distribution by MRI measurement; parameters for physical&#xD;
           strength, motor function and body static condition; 24h urine collection; fecal samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step II - Weight loss intervention Once participant is still deemed eligible after V1A and&#xD;
      V1B, the formula-based low calorie diet (LCD) starts as weight loss intervention. Formula&#xD;
      products will be provided once per week. An additional daily intake of 200 g raw or cooked&#xD;
      non-starchy vegetables is allowed. Participants fulfill a food diary to record eaten products&#xD;
      including drinks and vegetables and to record well-being or side effects. Furthermore,&#xD;
      participants are phenotyped by a continuous glucose measurement during the first four weeks&#xD;
      of intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Low carb is defined as 30 energy percent from carbs and consist of 20 energy percent from protein.
