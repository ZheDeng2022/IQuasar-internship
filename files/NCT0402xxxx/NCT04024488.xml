    <textblock>
      IMPAACT 2016 is a multi-site, two-arm, individually randomized, controlled study to evaluate&#xD;
      whether an Indigenous Leader Outreach Model (ILOM) of trauma-informed cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy (TI-CBT) delivered by Indigenous Youth Leaders (IYL) is associated with improved&#xD;
      mental health outcomes and ART adherence among youth living with HIV in resource-limited&#xD;
      settings. The intervention is adapted to the local context through advance conduct of focus&#xD;
      groups and pilot testing.&#xD;

      IMPAACT 2016 is a multi-site, two-arm, individually randomized, controlled study to evaluate&#xD;
      whether an Indigenous Leader Outreach Model (ILOM) of trauma-informed cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy (TI-CBT) delivered by Indigenous Youth Leaders (IYL) is associated with improved&#xD;
      mental health outcomes and ART adherence among youth living with HIV in resource-limited&#xD;
      settings. To adapt the intervention for the local context, the trial will be preceded by an&#xD;
      adaption of the TI-CBT intervention at each site using the &quot;ADAPT-ITT&quot; model, which includes&#xD;
      focus groups and pilot tests. In the randomized study, youth will be individually randomized&#xD;
      to either the TI-CBT Intervention Arm or the Discussion Control Arm. Participants will meet&#xD;
      as a group within their randomized arm and receive multiple group sessions within an&#xD;
      eight-week period. Each group will include an average of eight youth for an approximate total&#xD;
      of 192-256 youth in the Randomized Trial (96-128 youth per arm). TI-CBT and Discussion&#xD;
      Control groups in each arm will be mixed-gender unless it is determined necessary to have&#xD;
      single-gender groups during the focus group. Caregivers (as available and with youth&#xD;
      permission) will be assigned to the same study arm as their youth. Caregivers will meet as a&#xD;
      group for two caregiver-specific sessions on two separate weeks and separate from their youth&#xD;
      group sessions. Youth and caregivers will complete a follow-up visit immediately after their&#xD;
      last group session and two additional follow-up visits at six and 12 months. Youth and&#xD;
      caregivers will also receive one two-hour booster group session consistent with their&#xD;
      assigned study arm immediately after the six-month evaluations. The booster sessions are&#xD;
      intended to enhance treatment effects and increase sustainability. Once all participants have&#xD;
      completed their six-month evaluations, data from these evaluations will be analyzed to&#xD;
      determine the short-term effects of the intervention. Additional analyses to assess the&#xD;
      longer-term effects of the intervention, including the effects of the booster group session,&#xD;
      will be performed after the completion of follow-up.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In the Randomized Trial, youth participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio with their caregivers to one of two study arms. One arm is the TI-CBT intervention arm: six 2-hour TI-CBT group sessions lead by Indigenous Youth Leaders (IYL) during weeks 1 - 6 and one 2-hour booster group session at 6-months. The caregivers participating for youth who are enrolled into the TI-CBT arm will receive two 2-hour group sessions led by adult study staff during weeks 1-6 and one 2-hour booster group session at 6-months.&#xD;
The other arm is the discussion control arm consisting of: six 2 hour discussion group sessions lead by IYL during weeks 1-6 and one 2-hour booster discussion group session at 6 months. The caregivers of youth randomized to the discussion control arm will have two 2-hour discussion group sessions led by adult study staff during weeks 1-6 and one 2-hour booster discussion group session at 6 months.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>TI-CBT teaches techniques and ways to manage distress through psychosocial health education, cognitive restructuring, and &quot;mastery of trauma&quot;, which refers to the process by which survivors of psychological trauma work through the traumatic experience in a meaningful way, and are able to move on with life. TI-CBT addresses both the trauma of learning one has HIV and the trauma associated with managing a chronic and stigmatized illness. The intervention highlights links between HIV and traditional gender roles, gender inequities, and gender based violence. Finally, the relaxation training teaches youth strategies to relax and these are integrated at the beginning and end of each session. TI-CBT Youth and Caregiver Intervention Manuals are distributed to sites for translation, backtranslation, and cultural adaptation in preparation for the Randomized Trial.</description>

Discussion topics will be selected by youth and caregivers in the group as applicable. Discussion Control group session will take place at a separate time from TI-CBT youth group sessions in attempt to minimize contamination. To note, participant and caregiver group sessions are always held separately.</description>
