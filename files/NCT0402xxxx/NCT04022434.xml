  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past few decades, fructose consumption has risen significantly in the United&#xD;
      States1. This sugar is increasingly being used as a sweetener in a variety of foods1. Because&#xD;
      there is a limited absorptive capacity for fructose, excessive ingestion of fructose leads to&#xD;
      fructose malabsorption and dietary fructose intolerance (DFI) 2-9, 13. Incomplete absorption&#xD;
      of fructose may lead to a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms, including bloating, pain, gas&#xD;
      and diarrhea 2-9. In tertiary care centers, the prevalence of DFI in subjects with&#xD;
      unexplained GI symptoms has been estimated to range between 11-50 %, when subjects were&#xD;
      assessed with breath tests following administration of 25 grams of fructose 2, 5-7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the main treatment for DFI consists of restricting the intake of&#xD;
      fructose-containing foods 10-12 or limiting the intake of foods with excess &quot;free fructose&quot;&#xD;
      (ie, fructose in excess of glucose) or a high fructan content17. These diet restrictions can&#xD;
      improve symptoms in patients with DFI 10-12,17. However, the diet is very restrictive and&#xD;
      imposes a significant burden on the individual and the family. In one study, 40% of subjects&#xD;
      were unable to comply with dietary restrictions 10. Currently, there are no other therapeutic&#xD;
      agents for treating this condition 14, 15. Apart from promoting intestinal fructose&#xD;
      absorption, an ideal therapeutic agent should be safe, simple to use, inexpensive and have no&#xD;
      calorific value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fructose is mostly absorbed in the small intestine by facilitated diffusion which is mediated&#xD;
      by the GLUT-5 transporter protein. This protein is expressed on the intestinal mucosal&#xD;
      surface. In the presence of glucose, fructose absorption is increased, mostly due to&#xD;
      co-transport with glucose via the GLUT-2 transporter protein. However, the calorie content of&#xD;
      glucose precludes its routine use in patients with DFI. Other compounds that promote fructose&#xD;
      absorption, such as 3 O-methyl glucose and epidermal growth factor (EGF) have significant&#xD;
      side effects and safety issues, making them unsuitable for clinical use in DFI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several amino acids, including alanine, have been also been shown to increase intestinal&#xD;
      fructose absorption 14. The postulated mechanism is as follows: transmucosal Na+-coupled&#xD;
      amino acid transport causes increased water flow through the mucosal apical membrane14. This,&#xD;
      in turn, facilitates fructose absorption by a process of 'solvent drag', caused by an&#xD;
      increase in intraluminal fructose concentration caused by water removal from the lumen14. The&#xD;
      potential benefit of alanine was assessed in a European study in healthy children 14. Ten&#xD;
      subjects underwent H2 breath tests following administration of fructose alone (2g/ Kg body&#xD;
      weight), followed by a combination of fructose and an equi-molar dose of various amino acids&#xD;
      (L-alanine, L-phenylalanine, L-glutamine, L-proline) or glucose. Breath H2 production was&#xD;
      assessed as a marker of intestinal fructose absorption. Subjects were asked to report any&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms during the test. All subjects had a positive (&gt;20 ppm of H2) breath&#xD;
      test (68 ± 38 ppm) with fructose and 6/10 subjects reported either abdominal pain or diarrhea&#xD;
      during the test. Co-administration of alanine caused a significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease in&#xD;
      breath H2 production (3 ± 3 ppm), suggesting increased intestinal fructose absorption.&#xD;
      Furthermore, none of the subjects reported any gastrointestinal symptoms during the test.&#xD;
