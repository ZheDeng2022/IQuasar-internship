    <textblock>
      The Global Registry for COL6-related dystrophies (www.collagen6.org) is a database for&#xD;
      individuals who have been diagnosed with Bethlem Myopathy, Ullrich Congenital Muscular&#xD;
      Dystrophy (UCMD) or an intermediate form of these diseases. The registry team is based at the&#xD;
      John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre at Newcastle University, UK and is part of the&#xD;
      TREAT-NMD alliance global network of registries. The registry has been developed in&#xD;
      partnership with a number of leading neuromuscular researchers and is funded by the Collagen&#xD;
      VI Alliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This patient registry will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Help identify patients for relevant clinical trials as they become available&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Encourage further research into Collagen 6-related dystrophies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide researchers with specific patient information to support their research&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assist doctors and other health professionals by providing them with up-to-date&#xD;
           information on managing Collagen 6- related dystrophies, to help them deliver better&#xD;
           standards of care for their patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators welcome the registration of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      âœ“ All patients, with a diagnosis of a COL6-related dystrophy (Bethlem Myopathy, Ullrich&#xD;
      Congenital Muscular Dystrophy or Intermediate form) , which has been confirmed via genetic&#xD;
      testing or muscle biopsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Global Registry for COL6-related dystrophies (www.collagen6.org) is an international&#xD;
      registry for patients with a COL6-related condition; no experimental intervention is&#xD;
      involved. Patients will receive information on the most up to date standards of care relating&#xD;
      to their disease and may be invited to participate in relevant clinical trials. Their data&#xD;
      will be updated annually and stored indefinitely, or until they request their data to be&#xD;
      removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected via a secure online form and stored on a secure server. Data&#xD;
      collected from patients will include demographic information, diagnosis, current condition&#xD;
      (wheelchair use and motor ability, respiratory function, contractures and scoliosis), family&#xD;
      history and quality of life. Further information collected from patients' doctors will&#xD;
      include genetics, age of onset, lung function, medication, muscle strength, contractures and&#xD;
      muscle MRI findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the purposes of the Global Registry for COL6-related dystrophies is to define the&#xD;
      patient population and disease course, therefore data is collected longitudinally and&#xD;
      participants will be invited to update their records on a yearly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to the database is limited to named individuals, approved by the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator, Professor Volker Straub, and the database curator. The database is password&#xD;
      protected, with different levels of access. All database entries and contacts are traceable&#xD;
      through an audit trail. A SOP has been formulated to cover administration, management and&#xD;
      communication procedures for the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers and Industry may ask specific questions of registry data. These questions may be&#xD;
      to support academic research, feasibility studies for clinical trials or recruitment for&#xD;
      clinical trials. Any enquiries for data will be examined and approved by the registry&#xD;
      steering committee. Data released for approved enquiries would be de-identified aggregate&#xD;
      data. In the case of recruitment for clinical trials when the registry principle investigator&#xD;
      and/or curator believe that a patient meets a trial's inclusion criterion and might benefit&#xD;
      from participation in a trial, the patient will be contacted by the curator with general&#xD;
      information about the upcoming trial and will be asked to contact their local trial/study&#xD;
      centre for more information if they are interested in participating. The patient's name or&#xD;
      any other personal information will not be given to researchers or industry. Clinical trials&#xD;
      will need to have appropriate IRB/ethics board and steering committee approval although the&#xD;
      registry will not endorse any particular trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry participation in voluntary and participants may decline to participate or withdraw&#xD;
      consent for their data to be stored in the Global Registry for COL6-related dystrophies at&#xD;
      any time without prejudice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol, patient information sheets and consent forms, and relevant supporting&#xD;
      information has been reviewed and approved by NHS HRA Research Ethics Committee and Newcastle&#xD;
      University ethics committee.&#xD;
