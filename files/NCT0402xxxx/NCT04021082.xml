  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multinational study of cerdulatinib in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory PTCL dosed with cerdulatinb, designed to (1) Evaluate tumor response, (2)&#xD;
      Assess the safety and tolerability of cerdulatinib, (3) Evaluate duration of response (DUR),&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival(OS), (4) Determine the PK properties of&#xD;
      cerdulatinib, (5) Evaluate the efficacy endpoints based on Lugano criteria per IRC and (6)To&#xD;
      assess the relationship between target expression (e.g., spleen tyrosine kinase [SYK], Janus&#xD;
      kinase [JAK]) and relevant anomalies (e.g., SYK-ITK translocation, mutations in the JAK/STAT&#xD;
      pathway) with clinical response.&#xD;

                  either SD, a PR, or a CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Relapse is defined as progression or recurrence of disease after a prior&#xD;
