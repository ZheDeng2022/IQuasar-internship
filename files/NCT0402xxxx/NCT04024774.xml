  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most diagnostically unsolved rare disease have a genetic cause. These causes have not been&#xD;
      found applying the current methodologies due to technical limitations (e.g. repeat&#xD;
      expansions, changes in non-coding (intronic) regions) or, although methodically recorded,&#xD;
      their pathophysiological significance but not classified as clinically relevant. A re- and&#xD;
      meta-analysis of existing data sets with new algorithms and statistical models as well as the&#xD;
      complementation with other omics technologies followed by functional follow-up studies in&#xD;
      appropriate disease models (e.g. patient cell lines) allows to elucidate additional causes of&#xD;
      diseases and improve the diagnosis of hereditary diseases. In addition to the direct&#xD;
      examination of persons affected, the analysis of healthy family members, for example of&#xD;
      parents, plays an important role in a so-called trio analysis, especially in the efficient&#xD;
      filtering of the extensive data sets for newly created changes, so-called de novo- Variants&#xD;
      (new mutations). In the context of the outlined analyzes, new disease genes can be found and&#xD;
      validated. The gain of scientific knowledge due to a better understanding of basic cell&#xD;
      biological mechanisms can contribute to the development of targeted therapeutic approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the Solve-RD project has been built and financed by the European Union with&#xD;
      the ambitions to solve large numbers of rare disease, for which a molecular cause is not&#xD;
      known yet by sophisticated combined omics approaches, and to improve diagnostics of rare&#xD;
      disease patients. Solve-RD fully integrates with the newly formed European Reference Networks&#xD;
      (ERNs) for rare diseases, and in particular the ERN-RND, -EURO-NMD, -ITHACA, and -GENTURIS.&#xD;
      The AnDDI-Rares network is fully affiliated to the ERN ITHACA network and will actively&#xD;
      contribute to the project, by the ambition of sharing knowledge about genes, genomic variants&#xD;
      and phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will first reanalyse 18.000 negative exomes from the different ERNs performed in&#xD;
      a diagnostic or research context (collection of biomaterial, clinical/phenotypic data plus&#xD;
      next-generation sequencing has already been performed, and the patient/family has agreed&#xD;
      previously in writing that their sample could be used for research related to their disease,&#xD;
      with no study related presence required. The project will also propose new multi-omics&#xD;
      analyses with new samples needed in 500 patients and their parents in total, justifying the&#xD;
      AnDDI-Solve-RD project.&#xD;
