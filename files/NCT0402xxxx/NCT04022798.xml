      This study is to determine the effectiveness of Neural mobilization(NM) technique compared&#xD;
      with lumbar stabilization exercise (LSE) and Radial Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (rESWT)&#xD;
      in the physical therapy management of chronic low back pain (CLBP) with radiculopathy.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned into two groups. Group A (NM, LSE and rESWT) and Group B&#xD;
      (LSE and rESWT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical control trail will be conducted in the North West area of Saudi Arabia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed to have CLBP with radiculopathy at three different hospitals in Saudi&#xD;
      Arabia will be recruited for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned into treatment or control group. Before starting of&#xD;
      the study, the author will designe the treatment and control group treatment program and&#xD;
      instructed the treating physiotherapists in their implementation. An ethical approval was&#xD;
      approved by the ethics committee of the University of Tabuk- Saudi Arabia. Participants in&#xD;
      each group will receive 12 treatment sessions of 45 minutes each, 2 days a week for 6&#xD;
      consecutive weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each group, a menu of a lumbar stabilization program was designed. This program included&#xD;
      8 levels of exercise ( single leg knee to chest stretch, double leg knee to chest, supine&#xD;
      piriformis stretch, supine hamstring stretch, lower trunk rotation stretch, lumbar rotation&#xD;
      stretch, pelvic tilt, pelivic tilt with alternative legs). Exercises were tailored for each&#xD;
      individual ability and, if possible, progressed at each session which would last&#xD;
      approximately 30 minutes. Each single exercise was repeated many times based on the patient's&#xD;
      clinical condition. All sessions were provided by physiotherapists. After finishing of&#xD;
      session of lumbar stabilization program, a shock wave therapy was applied for each&#xD;
      participant in a prone position over the region of low back pain (Figure 2 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only participants in the treatment group were receive neural mobilization technique. This&#xD;
      includes the following: sciatic neural mobilization technique (Figure 3), slump neural&#xD;
      mobilization technique (Figure 4) and self neural mobilization (Figure 5 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASUREMENT TOOLS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were three outcome measures as following: pain, disability and lumbar spine range of&#xD;
      motion. Subjected were tested three times as following: at the baseline (0 week), at the mid&#xD;
      of treatment (3 weeks) and finally at the end of treatment (6 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain Pain was assessed by using NPRS, where 0 represented no pain and 10 represented the&#xD;
           worst pain possible, to indicate the intensity of pain in the lower back (Jensen et al.,&#xD;
           1994). Disability Disability was measured by using the Modified Oswestry Disability&#xD;
           Questionnaire (MODQ) which is a self-rating questionnaire used to evaluate functional&#xD;
           physical disability (Rajfur, et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar flexion range of motion Lumbar flexion range of motion was measured by using&#xD;
           modified Schober method (Philadelphia Panel Members, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simple descriptive statistical analysis was adopted to describe the patient specific&#xD;
      demographic characteristics with respect to outcomes parameters. Within group and between&#xD;
      groups comparison was analyzed using ANOVA and Scheffes' post-hoc tests by using SPSS 20.0.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. The principal investigator will be responsible in check points, meetings, and&#xD;
           coordination with the research team, regular meeting will be set on thursday every after&#xD;
           two weeks and when necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Co-investigator will be assigned as custodian to all data and investigations from the&#xD;
           start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Co-investigator will be assigned to record all financial transaction according to the&#xD;
           policies of sponsoring unit of the university.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Co-investigator will be responsible logistic and making sure all researched needed are&#xD;
           adequate and available when needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A clear communication and coordination scheme will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Co-investigator will be required to submit status accomplish report on regular basis&#xD;
           determined by the team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utilization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of the research will be used to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NM techniques enhance patient outcomes in the management of CLBP with radiculopathy when&#xD;
           added to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NM technique applied by experienced physical therapists combined with LSE and ESWT in a&#xD;
           brief clinical trial might better and earlier than LST and ESWT alone for decreasing&#xD;
           pain, reducing back disability and improving function in patients with CLBP with&#xD;
           radiculopathy symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The findings are interesting and motivate further studies, including long-term follow-up&#xD;
           of large groups, randomized studies and the comparison of this treatment model with&#xD;
           other treatment models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A faster program with fewer hospital visits not only enables the patients to proceed&#xD;
           with most of their daily activities but also decreases the costs of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A NM technique might also be an alternative to conventional physiotherapy in the&#xD;
           treatment of the CLBP patients with radiculopathy symptoms.&#xD;
