  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, open label, single arm phase II trial. A total of 22 patients&#xD;
      will be treated with atezolizumab, PROSTVAC, and pre-operative MVA-BN-Brachyury to confirm&#xD;
      the efficacy of prostatic combination immunotherapy and to measure the relative change in the&#xD;
      number of tumor infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes within the prostate tissue between the paired&#xD;
      biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Here we propose to use a combination of both checkpoint therapy with dual vaccine therapy.&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with an intraprostatic injection of MVA-BN-Brachyury and&#xD;
      subcutaneous PROSTVAC therapy. MVA-BN-Brachyury is a replication-deficient, attenuated&#xD;
      vaccinia virus (Ankara strain) expressing both a CD8+ T-cell epitope from the brachyury&#xD;
      protein and a triad of T-cell co-stimulatory molecules (B7.1, ICAM-1 and LFA-3).&#xD;
      MVA-brachury-TRICOM, upon infection of cells, causes innate and then adaptive immune&#xD;
      responses, antigen cascade, and improved T cell trafficking to the tumor. Vaccine therapy is&#xD;
      one strategy that might increase immune infiltration into the tumor microenvironment.&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is known to have minimal lymphocyte infiltration within the microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This vaccine strategy of direct injection into the tumor in combination with checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors has previously been performed in early phase clinical trials.6 Furthermore, this&#xD;
      approach of potent vaccine vector use can induce systemic effects as seen in a recent&#xD;
      clinical trial of 12 patients with metastatic melanoma.12 In that study, responses were also&#xD;
      observed in non-target lesions. In this case, MVA-BN-Brachyury is preferred as in&#xD;
      intralesional injection agent over other vaccines due to the increased immunogenicity of MVA&#xD;
      compared with fowlpox and improved safety profile for direct injection when compared with&#xD;
      vaccinia, due to replication incompetence. In the prior study with MVA-BN-Brachyury no&#xD;
      patients were observed to have replication of the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T cell mediated tumor cell killing is dependent on specific T cell recognition of a tumor&#xD;
      target antigen, localization of those specific T cells to the tumor, and those T cells&#xD;
      properly functioning within the tumor microenvironment. We hypothesize that these three&#xD;
      primary issues comprise the major causes of most patients receiving no benefit from&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor therapy or with vaccine monotherapy. We hypothesize that these issues&#xD;
      can be addressed with an active intratumoral virus administration approach combined with the&#xD;
      use of a subcutaneously administered vaccine (PROSTVAC) to induce PSA-specific T cell&#xD;
      activation in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor. Combination viral based vaccine plus&#xD;
      immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy will result in exposure of cancer specific antigens and&#xD;
      induce inflammation at the site of the cancer ultimately resulting in significant clinical&#xD;
      antitumor effect. Additionally, we hypothesize that the concurrent administration of&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 moncolonal antibody therapy is necessary to allow those active T cells to achieve&#xD;
      tumor cell killing, and significant overall clinical efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of atezolizumab is likely to provide additional efficacy over vaccine therapy&#xD;
      alone. This is suggested by the induction of PD-1+ T-cells with vaccines.17 Additionally,&#xD;
      PD-1 inhibition with nivolumab18 and pembrolizumab19 have shown clinical activity in&#xD;
      metastatic prostate cancer. We suggest that the combination will provide even greater&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between density of lymphocytes and&#xD;
      prognosis, including overall survival.13-16 Given the very low density of infiltrating&#xD;
      lymphocytes historically in prostate cancer, (Kaur HB, Hum Path 2019) we suggest that the&#xD;
      primary endpoint of the change in CD8+ density is a reasonable pharmacodynamic endpoint for&#xD;
      this exploratory, hypothesis generating study. However, as this study will be the first to&#xD;
      date of the treatment combination, safety will also serve as a co-primary endpoint. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives of PSA responses will help confirm the clinical utility of this approach&#xD;
      in this target population.&#xD;
