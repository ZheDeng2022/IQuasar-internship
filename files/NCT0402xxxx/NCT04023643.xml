  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the present study is that the use of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP) plus PS can accelerate the weaning process and, consequently, shorten the MV. This&#xD;
      multicenter, pragmatic clinical trial aims to compare the use of CPAP + PS versus SIMV + PS&#xD;
      as a method for ventilatory weaning of children, emphasizing the duration of the process.&#xD;
      There are no similar studies in the world.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a widely used practice among Pediatric Intensive Care Units&#xD;
      (PICUs) throughout the world. Data from multicenter studies reveal rates ranging from 20% to&#xD;
      64% use, lasting about 5 to 6 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practice of using artificial methods to provide respiratory care is considered a&#xD;
      revolution in the care of critically ill patients, reducing their morbidity and mortality. On&#xD;
      the other hand, it is widely known that these tools bring with it a myriad of possible&#xD;
      complications, such as Health Care-Associated Pneumonia, upper and lower airway injuries,&#xD;
      risks related to sedation, and cardiovascular instability. Therefore, it is indispensable to&#xD;
      interrupt the MV as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When is spent a lot of time recognizing that the MV is no longer essential, is increased the&#xD;
      risks and costs (up to $ 2,000 a day), and is failed the good medical practice. Currently,&#xD;
      the duration of weaning consumes about 40% of the total MV time. This depends on many&#xD;
      factors, such as fluid balance, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), sedation, pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension and diaphragm function, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that the implementation of a weaning protocol reduces its duration and,&#xD;
      consequently, ventilation in children. There are numerous known weaning techniques, however,&#xD;
      the most commonly used approach is the progressive reduction of ventilatory support already&#xD;
      in use, maintaining the same modes and reducing the parameters. Some professionals choose&#xD;
      synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV), reducing respiratory rate, with or&#xD;
      without Supplementary Pressure (PS) association. Others prefer to perform daily extubation&#xD;
      readiness tests (ERT) or to switch spontaneous breathing methods with full-support&#xD;
      ventilation for respiratory muscle training, this practice is more common in adult ICUs.&#xD;
      Exhorted by recommendations for mechanical ventilation of critically ill children at the 2017&#xD;
      pediatric mechanical ventilation consensus conference (PEMVECC), who concluded with strong&#xD;
      agreement that there is insufficient data to recommend the method for weaning the&#xD;
      investigators decided to study the assertive.&#xD;
