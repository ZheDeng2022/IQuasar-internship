  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will answer the question of whether treating insomnia using Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavior Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) can improve perceived cognitive impairment (PCI) in&#xD;
      cancer survivors compared to a waitlist control group. The investigators will recruit 124&#xD;
      people with insomnia and cognitive complaints who have completed cancer treatment at least 6&#xD;
      months prior to the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial of immediate treatment with&#xD;
      CBT-I compared to a delayed treatment group with 124 cancer survivors who have completed&#xD;
      primary treatment at least 6 months prior and report PCI and insomnia. Participants who are&#xD;
      randomized to the immediate treatment group will receive CBT-I over the course of seven&#xD;
      weekly one hour sessions, after which the delayed treatment group will receive the&#xD;
      intervention. Both groups will complete follow up assessments three and six months after&#xD;
      completing treatment. PCI will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy&#xD;
      - Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog) as the primary outcome. To provide an objective assessment of&#xD;
      cognition, the investigators have included the neurocognitive measures recommended by the&#xD;
      International Cognition and Cancer Task Force. Other measures will include fatigue, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, and work productivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the online CBT-I group will report significantly greater&#xD;
      improvements in perceived cognitive function compared to the waitlist control immediately&#xD;
      post-treatment (primary endpoint). The investigators also hypothesize that these improvements&#xD;
      will be maintained up at 6-months follow up (secondary endpoint).&#xD;

    <measure>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog) version 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 4, Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-Cog will be used as the measure of perceived cognitive impairment. It is a 37-item questionnaire with four cognitive subscales: perceived cognitive impairments, impact on quality of life, comments from others, and perceived cognitive abilities. Responses range from 0, ''never,'' to 4, ''several times a day,'' in the previous 7 days and negatively worded items are reverse scored to create subscale scores. Scores on the PCI subscale can range from 0 to 72 points, with a higher score indicative of better self-reported cognitive functioning and quality of life. A change of 5.9-points has been established as clinically meaningful change on the FACT-Cog PCI subscale</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 4, Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is designed to specifically assess the severity of insomnia symptoms, the impact on daytime functioning, and the amount of associated distress. The ISI has 7 questions, which are summed to compute a total score. The range of the ISI is 0-28 with the higher the value, the more severe the insomnia severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep efficiency measured by The Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 4, Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep efficiency is the percentage of time spent asleep while in bed. It is calculated by dividing the amount of time spent asleep (in minutes) by the total amount of time in bed (in minutes). The unit of measure is a percentage and is averaged over the whole week for the total sleep efficiency score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep-onset latency measured by The Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 4, Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The sleep diary will be used to calculate sleep-onset latency, which is the length of time that it takes to accomplish the transition from full wakefulness to sleep. The unit of measure is minutes and is averaged over the whole week for the total sleep onset latency score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wake after sleep onset measured by The Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 4, Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The sleep diary will be used to calculate wake after sleep onset, which refers to periods of wakefulness occurring after defined sleep onset. The score is reported in minutes and is averaged over the whole week for the total wake after sleep onset.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total sleep time measured by The Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD):</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 4, Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The sleep diary will be used to calculate total sleep time. The score is reported in minutes and is averaged over the whole week for the total sleep time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 4, Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety and Depression will be measured using the HADS, which is a 14-item, self-rated instrument for anxiety (7 items) and depression (7 items) symptoms in the past week and has been extensively used in people with cancer. Scores range from 0-21 with below 7 indicating a non-case and the higher the score indicates greater symptom severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 4, Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be measured using the MFSI-SF, which is a 30 item self-report measure comprised of five subscales (general, emotional, physical, mental, vigor) and a total fatigue score. Each subscale score ranges from 0 to 24. The Total MSFI-SF score is calculated by adding the general, physical, emotional and mental subscale scores and subtracting vigor subscale score. Total MFSI-SF score ranges from -24 to 96 with a higher score indicating higher levels of cancer-related fatigue experienced by the patient.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The HVLT-R is a brief assessment of verbal learning and memory (immediate recall, delayed recall, delayed recognition). When scoring the HVLT-R, the three learning trials are combined to calculate a total recall score; the delayed recall trial creates the delayed recall score; the retention (%) score is calculated by dividing the delayed recall trial by the higher of learning trial 2 or 3; and the recognition discrimination index is comprised by subtracting the total number of false positives from the total number of true positives. These scores are then converted to an age-based T score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The COWAT is a measure of verbal fluency, cognitive and motor speed, cognitive flexibility, strategy utilization, suppression of interference, and response inhibition. The test score is the total number of different words produced for all three letters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Digit Span</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Digit Span test is a subtest of both the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS). Part a of digit span (the forward span) captures attention efficiency and capacity, and part b (the backward span) is an executive task dependent on working memory. The Digit Span subtest will be scored as one summary value. The unit of measure is the total recall.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult (BRIEF-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The BRIEF-A is composed of 75 items within nine non-overlapping theoretically and empirically derived clinical scales. It has 2 broad indexes (Behavioural Regulation and Metacognition), an overall summary score, and three validity scales (Negativity, Inconsistency, and Infrequency). T scores (M = 50, SD = 10) (transformations of the raw scale scores) are used to interpret the individual's level of executive functioning. Traditionally, T scores at or above 65 are considered clinically significant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI questionnaire was developed for the purpose of collecting productivity loss data within clinical trials and is suitable for direct translation into a monetary figure. The WPAI yields four types of scores: 1. Absenteeism (work time missed) 2. Presenteesism (impairment at work / reduced on-the-job effectiveness) 3. Work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism) 4. Activity Impairment. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is designed to measure treatment expectancy and rationale credibility in studies with clinical outcomes. Scores for each question range from 1-9 or 0%-100% with higher scores indicating greater treatment expectancy and credibility.</description>
