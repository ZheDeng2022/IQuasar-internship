    <textblock>
      Open spina bifida or myelomeningocele (MMC) is a devastating congenital defect of the central&#xD;
      nervous system for which there is no cure. The etiology of MMC remains poorly understood.&#xD;
      Primary failure of neural tube closure at the caudal neuropore in the embryonic period&#xD;
      results in exposure of the developing spinal cord to the uterine environment. Without&#xD;
      protective tissue coverage, secondary destruction of the exposed neural tissue by trauma or&#xD;
      amniotic fluid may occur throughout gestation. In order to protect the spinal cord from this&#xD;
      secondary destruction, a fetal surgical repair can be performed between gestational weeks 20&#xD;
      and 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a psychological point of view fetal repair of MMC constitutes a highly stressful event&#xD;
      both for the mother and the fetus. To date, however, stress of mothers and children in case&#xD;
      of prenatal surgery for MMC repair has never been studied. It is therefore unclear, if and to&#xD;
      what extend the procedure and its consequences are associated with stress, and if there are&#xD;
      short- or longer-term consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are threefold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do newborns after fetal surgery for MMC show epigenetic alterations in genes that are&#xD;
           involved in stress regulation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. With which medical and psychosocial variables are epigenetic alterations associated?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At age 3 months, do infants after fetal surgery have a more difficult temperament&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open spina bifida or myelomeningocele (MMC) is a devastating congenital defect of the central&#xD;
      nervous system for which there is no cure. The etiology of MMC remains poorly understood.&#xD;
      Primary failure of neural tube closure at the caudal neuropore in the embryonic period&#xD;
      results in exposure of the developing spinal cord to the uterine environment. Without&#xD;
      protective tissue coverage, secondary destruction of the exposed neural tissue by trauma or&#xD;
      amniotic fluid may occur throughout gestation. In order to protect the spinal cord from this&#xD;
      secondary destruction, a fetal surgical repair can be performed between gestational weeks 20&#xD;
      and 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a psychological point of view fetal repair of MMC constitutes a highly stressful event&#xD;
      both for the mother and the fetus. To date, however, stress of mothers and children in case&#xD;
      of prenatal surgery for MMC repair has never been studied. It is therefore unclear, if and to&#xD;
      what extend the procedure and its consequences are associated with stress, and if there are&#xD;
      short- or longer-term consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are threefold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do newborns after fetal surgery for MMC show epigenetic alterations in genes that are&#xD;
           involved in stress regulation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. With which medical and psychosocial variables are epigenetic alterations associated?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At age 3 months, do infants after fetal surgery have a more difficult temperament&#xD;
           compared to controls?&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: The study will include newborns after fetal surgery for MMC at the University&#xD;
      Hospital Zurich and two control groups. One including healthy newborns and another including&#xD;
      newborns after prenatal exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids (sGC) in pregnancy. Each group&#xD;
      shall include n=30 newborns (i.e. total number of study participants: n=90).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Procedures: Recruitment will take place at the University Children's Hospital&#xD;
      and the University Hospital Zürich and will be continued until the required sample size is&#xD;
      reached. For every MMC-patient, secondary recruitment of a control child for group 2 and 3&#xD;
      will be performed (matched for child sex). Parents of all study groups will be approached by&#xD;
      the responsible study staff after checking for inclusion and exclusion criteria. They will be&#xD;
      informed orally about the study and the study information letter (see encl.) will be&#xD;
      provided. Parents will be contacted again after &gt;24h face to face or by phone by study staff&#xD;
      to answer any questions, if necessary. If the parents agree to participate in the study, they&#xD;
      will provide the signed written informed consent form (see encl.). After inclusion in the&#xD;
      study, the parents will be contacted again in hospital by study staff around 24-36 hours&#xD;
      after birth to re-explain the collection of the saliva samples. The saliva samples will then&#xD;
      be collected between 24 and 72h postpartum. Six weeks and 3 months post-partum, the parents&#xD;
      will receive the study questionnaires by mail and they will be asked to complete and return&#xD;
      them within 1 week. If the questionnaires are not received after 10 days, study staff will&#xD;
      contact the parents by phone for a gentle reminder. Parents are not financially compensated&#xD;
      for taking part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -) DNA and RNA sample collection from the child will take place between 24 and 72 hours of&#xD;
      life during hospitalization by trained research project staff. In order to obtain DNA and&#xD;
      RNA, saliva will be collected using special sponge devices designed for use with infants who&#xD;
      cannot spit independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For DNA, 2x ORAcollect for pediatrics (OC-175; DNA Genotek Inc) will be used to collect&#xD;
      saliva in order to obtain enough DNA sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For RNA, 2x saliva collection devices for pediatrics (CP-190; DNA Genotek Inc) will be used&#xD;
      to collect saliva in order to obtain enough RNA sample from the newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical data: a) Child: Gestational age at birth; gender; birth length and percentile;&#xD;
           birth weight and percentile; head circumference at birth and percentile; Apgar score;&#xD;
           umbilical artery ph and lactate; meconium-stained amniotic fluid; Gestational age at&#xD;
           fetal surgery; time and length of fetal surgery; positioning of the fetus necessary;&#xD;
           transfer to neonatology (group 2 and 3). b) Mother: Maternal age; parity; gestational&#xD;
           age at glucocorticoid treatment; treatment of preterm labour; medications during&#xD;
           pregnancy; surgery and perinatal variables; history in terms of smoking, alcohol,&#xD;
           nicotine, marihuana, other illicit drugs; Indication for ECS (group 2 and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychosocial data: The following variables shall be assessed from mothers by&#xD;
           standardized and validated questionnaires: country of birth (parents, grandparents);&#xD;
           Socio-economic status, maternal and parental education; current job situation (no,&#xD;
           part-time, full-time); maternal and paternal trauma history (Childhood Trauma&#xD;
           Questionnaire - Short Form from Bernstein &amp; Fink, 1998; Karos et al. 2014); significant&#xD;
           life events during the pregnancy (Life Event Scale from Landolt &amp; Vollrath, 1998);&#xD;
           maternal and paternal subjective stress during pregnancy (Perceived Stress Scale PSS-10&#xD;
           from Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein (1983) and Klein et al. (2016); maternal and paternal&#xD;
           mental health both retrospectively during pregnancy and currently at the assessment&#xD;
           points after birth: anxiety and depression by means of two modules of the Patient Health&#xD;
           Questionnaire PHQ from Spitzer, Kroenke, &amp; Williams (1999); posttraumatic stress&#xD;
           disorder by means of the International Trauma Questionnaire ITQ (Cloitre et al., 2018)&#xD;
           and the infant's temperament by means of the Infant Behaviour Questionnaire IBQ - Very&#xD;
           Short Form by Rothbart (1981). All measures are standardized and available in validated&#xD;
           German versions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses: Aim 1 will be examined with ANCOVAs to compare total methylation /&#xD;
      gene-expression (mRNA level) for the studied gene regions across the 3 groups. The&#xD;
      correlation between methylation levels and gene-expression will be investigated, expecting&#xD;
      that hypermethylation induces reduced gene-expression and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 will be examined by (partial) correlational analyses between predictor variables and&#xD;
      total methylation. If requirements are met, multivariate analyses will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 will be examined with ANCOVAs comparing IBQ-scores across the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will not be transformed before analysis. If the data doesn't meet the requirements for&#xD;
      the selected statistical tests, then modified tests (e.g. one-way testing) or appropriate&#xD;
      tests (e.g. non-parametric methods) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed either with the program Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Sciences (SPSS, Version 25) or the statistical program R. Statistical significance will be&#xD;
      set to a significance level of α= &lt;.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: According to a power-analysis calculation with the program G*Power 3.1 (Faul,&#xD;
      Erdfelder, Buchner &amp; Lang, 2009), the required sample size for an ANCOVA with 3 groups, an&#xD;
      effect size of d=0.4 (small effect) and a power of .90 is n=84.&#xD;
