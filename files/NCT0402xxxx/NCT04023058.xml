      Comparison patients with CABG alone vs. CABG+mitral surgery with non-massive ischaemic mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation (IMR) depending on stress echo data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic ischaemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is a frequent complication of coronary artery&#xD;
      disease (CAD), and is associated with a poor prognosis and outcome. The role of concomitant&#xD;
      mitral valve surgery for IMR in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)&#xD;
      remains controversial. After myocardial infarction IMR is associated with poor outcome and&#xD;
      prognosis with double mortality rates, it reduces survival following surgical or percutaneous&#xD;
      revascularization. However, there is no consensus on the cut-off value of IMR. The thresholds&#xD;
      to define severe secondary mitral regurgitation are need to be evaluated with regards to&#xD;
      their impact on prognosis after mitral valve intervention. The European guidelines is defined&#xD;
      effective regurgitant orifice (ERO)-0.2 cm2 and regurgitant volume (RV)-30ml, as the&#xD;
      threshold for severe IMR, because of severe prognosis of this group. Whereas American&#xD;
      guidelines are defined it as ERO-0.4 cm2 and RV-60ml, as it was no evidence to impact&#xD;
      intervention on the IMR with ERO-0.2 cm2 and RV-30ml. Partly it's explained by the dynamic&#xD;
      nature of the secondary MR. About 30% of patients from the group with non-massive&#xD;
      regurgitation at rest, have dramatically increasing it during exercise. However, some patient&#xD;
      have not changes or decreasing IMR during exercise and, probably, they have not such a&#xD;
      negative impact on the hemodynamic by IMR. The pervious comparative studies, that were the&#xD;
      base for recommendations did not differ the patients with and without changes IMR during&#xD;
      exercise. The current guidelines doesn't support the stress echo (SE) exams before operation&#xD;
      for assessing necessity in mitral valve operation. It's due to lack of information that prove&#xD;
      of influence for survival after surgery depending on IMR dynamic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMR study hypothesis: Stress echocardiography data, including ERO, RV, pulmonary pressure&#xD;
      (PA) pressure, beta-lines - B-lines, contractile reserve, could be indications for mitral&#xD;
      valve intervention in patient with CAD and chronic secondary mitral regurgitation, undergoing&#xD;
      CABG. The patients of the group with non-massive (ERO-0.2 cm2 and RV-30ml) IMR have positive&#xD;
      effect by mitral surgery if they have increasing IMR during exercise test. The group with&#xD;
      massive IMR (ERO≥0.4 cm2 and RV≥60 ml) will be better according clinic, echo, stress echo&#xD;
      results in comparison with non-massive non-operated subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To assess the value of stress echo testing for ischemic mitral surgery indication in&#xD;
      patients undergoing CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for all projects are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. IMR, ERO≥0.2 cm2 and RV≥30 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Indication for CABG&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria for all projects are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unwillingness to give informed consent and to enter a regular follow-up program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Contraindications for stress echo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In a prospective multicenter international randomized study, we will recruit patients&#xD;
           whom CABG is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conventional transthoracic echo. Patients will include into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 1 - &quot;Non-massive IMR&quot; - ERO-0.2-0.39 cm2, and RV-30-59ml. Group 2 - &quot;Massive IMR&quot;&#xD;
           - ERO≥0.4 cm2 and RV≥60 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomization of Group 1 (surgery/non-surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Exercise stress echocardiography of all the patients (Group 1 and Group 2). regional&#xD;
           wall motion abnormality (RWMA), ejection fraction (EF), end diastolic volume (EDV), end&#xD;
           systolic volume (ESV), contractile reserve, B-lines, ERO, RV, PA pressure at rest and&#xD;
           during stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 1-year clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 1-year transthoracic echo data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. 1-year stress echocardiography data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. 3-year clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. 3-year transthoracic echo data.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. 3-year stress echocardiography data. Primary end-points: death, myocardial infarction,&#xD;
           new hospital readmission, heart transplant, ventricular assist device implantation,&#xD;
           aborted sudden death, pulmonary oedema (MACE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-points: physical capacity (changes in Watts, minutes of stress&#xD;
      echocardiography), EDV, left atrium volume, EF at rest and during SE, ERO, RV, PA pressure,&#xD;
      B-lines, contractile reserve at rest and during exercise in comparison with pre-operative&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results. Group 1, CABG - subgroup, CABG+mitral surgery subgroup. It's expected the&#xD;
      improvement of physical capacity (changes in Watts, minutes of stress echocardiography), EDV,&#xD;
      left atrium volume, EF at rest and during SE, ERO, RV, PA pressure, B-lines, contractile&#xD;
      reserve at rest and during exercise in comparison with pre-operative data in CABG+mitral&#xD;
      surgery subgroup already in 1-year follow-up. It's expected the improvement of physical&#xD;
      capacity (changes in Watts, minutes of stress echo), EDV, left atrium volume, EF at rest and&#xD;
      during stress echo, ERO, RV, PA pressure, B-lines, contractile reserve at rest and during&#xD;
      exercise in comparison with CABG-subgroup already in 1-year follow-up. It's expected that&#xD;
      more pronounce changes will be in CABG+mitral surgery subgroup with previously increasing&#xD;
      IMR. The worst results are expected in CABG-subgroup with previously increasing IMR during&#xD;
      exercise. There will be clarified which parameters would be more correlate with the clinic&#xD;
      improvement (contractile reserve, B-lines, ERO etc). We expected reduced MACE till 3 year in&#xD;
      CABG+mitral surgery subgroup with increasing IMR in comparison with CABG-subgroup with&#xD;
      increasing IMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2, The group with massive IMR (ERO≥0.4 cm2 and RV≥60 ml) will be better according&#xD;
      clinic, echo, stress echo results in comparison with CABG-subgroup with increasing IMR from&#xD;
      group 1. There will be clarified which parameters would be more correlate with the clinic&#xD;
      improvement (contractile reserve, B-lines, ERO etc).&#xD;
