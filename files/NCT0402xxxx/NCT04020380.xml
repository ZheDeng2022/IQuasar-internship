    <textblock>
      Patients with sarcoidosis need treatment options that effectively control their disease&#xD;
      without causing undesirable side effects. An appealing strategy is to repurpose existing&#xD;
      drugs which possess beneficial immune modulating activity and are safe for long-term use.&#xD;
      Recently, increased activity of the mTOR intracellular signalling pathway in inflammatory&#xD;
      cells has emerged as a key driver of granulomatous inflammation in mouse models and patients&#xD;
      with sarcoidosis. The macrolide antibiotic azithromycin directly inhibits mTOR activity in&#xD;
      inflammatory cells, making it a prime target for drug repurposing in sarcoidosis.&#xD;
      Azithromycin has an acceptable tolerability profile when used for long-term treatment of&#xD;
      other chronic respiratory disease Single centre open label clinical trial of oral&#xD;
      azithromycin 250 mg once daily for 3 months in 20-30 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator have opted for an open label study because this will be the first study of&#xD;
      azithromycin in sarcoidosis. Trial assessments will be performed according to standards of&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice with assessments at baseline, 1, and 3 months. All other clinical&#xD;
      care, investigations, and treatment (if indicated) will remain the responsibility of the&#xD;
      treating physician and based on clinical MDT consensus decisions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disease behavior in sarcoidosis is variable and difficult to predict. Spontaneous improvement&#xD;
      may occur, but even then evidence of persistent low grade granulomatous inflammation is&#xD;
      common and disabling symptoms such as fatigue may persist. Patients with milder chronic&#xD;
      sarcoidosis may suffer significant symptoms and disability, but active monitoring and&#xD;
      supportive care are the only currently suitable management options. Recurrence after&#xD;
      remission is a problem, with some patients suffering from chronic ill health, progressive&#xD;
      disease and fibrosis, potentially leading to organ failure and death or transplantation.&#xD;
      Management is further complicated because some patients with symptomatic, progressive&#xD;
      sarcoidosis have a high burden of granulomatous disease, often affecting the lungs, whereas&#xD;
      other patients have limited disease in a dangerous location such as the heart or nervous&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cure is not a realistic option whilst the cause(s) of sarcoidosis remain unknown. Ideally,&#xD;
      treatment should be aimed at preventing or slowing progression to irreversible fibrosis and&#xD;
      organ failure, reducing symptoms, and improving quality of life. The evidence that currently&#xD;
      used treatments achieve these aims is weak, and the risk of adverse effects is concerning for&#xD;
      patients and may outweigh perceived benefits. Treatment with corticosteroids is suppressive&#xD;
      rather than curative, and guidelines recommend at least 1 years' therapy for patients with&#xD;
      progressive disease. In the BTS sarcoidosis study, long term corticosteroids given to&#xD;
      patients with non-resolving pulmonary disease after six months' initial observation improved&#xD;
      lung function and chest x-ray appearances by a small amount. Importantly, of patients who&#xD;
      were given early steroids for troublesome symptoms, almost half were still taking steroids 5&#xD;
      years later. Yet whether steroids prevent fibrosis or improve clinically meaningful outcomes&#xD;
      that are important to patients in the longer term is unknown. Worryingly, there is evidence&#xD;
      that early steroid therapy may promote more aggressive disease later on. Side effects of&#xD;
      steroid therapy are often distressing and disfiguring, and sometimes serious or fatal. When&#xD;
      sarcoidosis is refractory to steroid treatment, second line immunomodulators such as&#xD;
      methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate are commonly prescribed based on their efficacy&#xD;
      in treating rheumatic diseases, and are recommended in guidelines. In sarcoidosis, the best&#xD;
      evidence is that they are steroid sparing (i.e. permit a lower dose of corticosteroid to be&#xD;
      used). As with steroids, long term benefits have not been demonstrated and liver and bone&#xD;
      marrow toxicity is a concern, requiring regular blood testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst a unifying cause of sarcoidosis remains elusive, it has been established that&#xD;
      inflammatory cells including T lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages become hyper-activated&#xD;
      in the lungs and peripheral blood. Recently, using mouse models it has been shown that&#xD;
      chronic signalling through the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) in macrophages pathway drives the&#xD;
      formation of sarcoid-like granulomas that closely mimic non-resolving sarcoidosis in humans.&#xD;
      mTOR (mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin) links growth factors and availability of&#xD;
      amino acids to protein synthesis and cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. mTOR&#xD;
      activity and gene targets correlating to sarcoidosis progression in lung biopsies have&#xD;
      implicated a potential role for targeting mTOR in human disease. These datasets indicate a&#xD;
      key role for mTOR pathways and the metabolic status of tissue macrophages in triggering and&#xD;
      driving disease pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The macrolide antibiotic azithromycin is immunomodulatory and anti-bacterial, both of which&#xD;
      are plausible beneficial properties in sarcoidosis. Many studies have implicated bacteria as&#xD;
      triggers for sarcoidosis, and although convincing evidence implicating a specific organism is&#xD;
      lacking, improvements in sarcoidosis have been described in antibiotic combination studies&#xD;
      that included azithromycin. Beneficial immunomodulatory properties of macrolides became&#xD;
      apparent in the treatment of Asian diffuse panbronchiolitis, where reduced inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine production in several cell types was demonstrated. Recently, it has been determined&#xD;
      that azithromycin directly suppresses mTOR activity in a subset of T lymphocytes (CD4+&#xD;
      T-cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis need treatment options that effectively modulate disease&#xD;
      activity, reduce risk of disease progression, and improve symptoms and quality of life, with&#xD;
      an acceptable side effect profile. Azithromycin is a cheap, readily available generic drug.&#xD;
      Long term treatment with azithromycin has been shown to be safe in other chronic lung&#xD;
      diseases. Azithromycin is preferable to other macrolide antibiotics because of its safety&#xD;
      data for long term use, once daily administration, and lack of inhibition of liver CYP3A&#xD;
      isoenzymes. The safety profile of azithromycin makes it preferable to non-antibiotic&#xD;
      macrolide mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin (sirolimus, used to treat transplant rejection))&#xD;
      and everolimus (an anti-cancer drug). Whether azithromycin will benefit patients with&#xD;
      sarcoidosis can only be answered definitively by a large multicenter clinical trial. The&#xD;
      Investigators proposed exploratory study aims to facilitate this aim by exploring mechanisms&#xD;
      and evaluating potential blood biomarkers, and assessing feasibility of a subsequent large&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
