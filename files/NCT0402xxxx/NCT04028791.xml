  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The heterozygous form of sickle cell disease is clinically asymptomatic. Nevertheless, it was&#xD;
      observed that, the sickle cell trait is associated with serious medical complications&#xD;
      especially during intense physical efforts. Moreover, the exposure to a hot environment&#xD;
      (tropical climate) is suspected to be a determining factor in the occurrence of these medical&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the relationship between sickle cell trait and death during effort is not well&#xD;
      established. Furthermore, the cascade of events that usually cause sickle cell crisis such as&#xD;
      red blood cells sickling and rhabdomyolysis and which affect microcirculation are not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main objective in this study is to verify whether young healthy active men with sickle&#xD;
      cell trait have reactive hyperemia to their hemoglobinemic condition during exercise; to&#xD;
      identify the contribution of hot environment on these possible disturbances; and to determine&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, disturbances in the regulation of glucose metabolism in healthy subjects under&#xD;
      hot environment have been reported, marked by a significant increase in postprandial blood&#xD;
      glucose. Therefore, this project is also intended to assess the contribution of the&#xD;
      disturbance of glycoregulation during exercise under hot environment in active sickle cell&#xD;
      trait carriers. The imbalance of pro and anti oxidant agents, the adhesion and inflammation&#xD;
      markers will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of this study will allow a better understanding of physio-pathological mechanisms&#xD;
      leading to vascular accidents during exercise under tropical climate in young healthy sickle&#xD;
      cell trait carriers; and to identify physical activity programs and nutritional interventions&#xD;
      adapted to patients with sickle cell disease under hot environment.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin called&#xD;
      hemoglobin S or sickle hemoglobin in red blood cells of subjects. The homozygous form&#xD;
      (hemoglobin SS) causes sickle cell anemia and is the most severe kind of sickle cell disease.&#xD;
      Hemoglobin SC disease and hemoglobin Sβ thalassemia are two other common forms of sickle cell&#xD;
      disease. The sickle cell trait carriers are person who inherited the hemoglobin S from one&#xD;
      parent and a normal hemoglobin A from the other (heterozygous AS). These people are generally&#xD;
      healthy. However, more and more cases of serious complications have been reported, especially&#xD;
      during efforts and stays at high altitude like hemorheological and microcirculatory&#xD;
      disturbances, and rhabdomyolysis. Increased percentage of red cell sicking was observed in&#xD;
      sickle cell trait (AS) carriers compared to normal individual after 45 min of walking at 33°C&#xD;
      of temperature. AS individuals also showed an impairment in red blood deformability at rest,&#xD;
      at the end, and 24 hours after maximal exercise as compared to normal individuals AA, showing&#xD;
      the vulnerability of red blood cells of these seemingly healthy subjects. The stiffness of&#xD;
      red blood cells along with blood viscosity also increased in AS group compared to AA group,&#xD;
      as consequence the risk of vascular accidents increases. In athletes and military&#xD;
      warfighters, an exercise collapse and sudden death associated with sickle cell trait has been&#xD;
      observed. Several cases of sudden death in AS individuals have been reported by many authors&#xD;
      during exercise, however the exact causes remain very poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As constraints related to exercise in tropical climate, it was observed a reduction of power&#xD;
      and volemia due to dehydration, diversion of blood volume to the cutaneous territories. It&#xD;
      was also reported an impairment of carbohydrate metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objectives in this work are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the microvascular response to exercise in a hot environment in sickle&#xD;
           cell trait active young adults,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To highlight biological mechanisms underlying any microvascular response specificities&#xD;
           of the sickle cell trait carriers,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the vascular consequences of postprandial metabolic disturbances induced by&#xD;
           exercise in hot environment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand fasting and post-prandial glucose metabolism at rest, during and after&#xD;
           exercise,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the recovery in a neutral thermal environment (22 °C) as a means of normalizing&#xD;
           post-exercise vascular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty male volunteers (15 healthy: AA and 15 sickle cell trait carriers: AS) non-smoking,&#xD;
      aged 18-30 years, BMI between 19 and 25kg/m2 living in the Caribbean for at least 6 months&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study. All subjects will be in good health physically active (≥&#xD;
      3h/week) with no history of heat stroke during exercise. They are not taking any medications&#xD;
      and are not regularly consume alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be subjected to four experimental sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A familiarization session at fasting in a warm environment (33 °C) in which resting&#xD;
           parameters like reactive hyperemia index, tympanic temperature, heart rate, cerebral and&#xD;
           muscular oxygenation, pulse wave velocity and electrocardiogram (ECG) will be measured.&#xD;
           Then a test of the intensity of exercise (VO2max) will be performed followed by a&#xD;
           medical interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The other 3 sessions will be performed early in the morning at fasting with 45 minutes&#xD;
           of exercise on ergocycle. The exercise includes 15 minutes of warm up, then participants&#xD;
           will be asked to pedal as fast as possible for 6 seconds. The test of 6 seconds will be&#xD;
           repeated twice or more with recovery each time. During exercise, hydration will be&#xD;
           controlled (2.5 ml water / kg every 15 minutes), oxygen consumption will be measured;&#xD;
           and microvascular function and blood samples taken at different times of experiment in&#xD;
           each session (T0, T60, T75, T90, T120). The design of this study is a crossover trial&#xD;
           divided into 3 sessions presented in randomized order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exercise performed in hot environment (33 °C) with recovery in the same environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exercise and recovery performed in a control (thermoneutral) environment (22 °C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Exercise performed in a hot environment (33 °C) with recovery in a thermoneutral&#xD;
           environment (22 °C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each session, a standardized meal will be given to each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines developed in the Declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki, and all procedures were approved by the Committee for the Protection of Persons&#xD;
      East-III. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be use for hemorheological tests (viscosity of blood, stiffness,&#xD;
      aggregability and sickling of red cells etc.) Dosage of creatine kinase (CK-MM, MB),&#xD;
      myoglobin and troponin will be performed to assess the degree of rhabdomyolysis and the&#xD;
      integrity of heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycemia and lactatemia will be determined using strips. Cortisol, insulin, adrenalin,&#xD;
      glucagon and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays will be performed using appropriated kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma inflammatory profile will be determined by measuring markers such as myeloperoxidase&#xD;
      (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitrotyrosin, and&#xD;
      endothelin-1 using appropriated kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and P-selectin will be measured using ELISA kit&#xD;
      from Diaclone or Eurobio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oxidative stress on red blood cells will be assessed by measuring glutathione ratio&#xD;
      GSSH/GSSG, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data will be expressed as means with their standard errors. Statistical&#xD;
      analyses will be performed with SPSS for MAC and p &lt; 0·05 considered statistically&#xD;
      signiﬁcant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data will be analysed by using repeated-measures ANOVA followed by Post hoc&#xD;
      comparisons with the Student's paired t test. The tests of Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Newman Keuls&#xD;
      and Duncan will be applied as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Better understanding of physio-pathological mechanisms leading to severe vascular events&#xD;
           following physical exercise in tropical climate in healthy sickle cell carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Opening of tracks for identification of physical activity programs and nutritional&#xD;
           interventions adapted to sickle cell patients in hot environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understanding of mechanisms leading to disturbances of glucose metabolism under tropical&#xD;
           climate in AA and in AS subjects.&#xD;
