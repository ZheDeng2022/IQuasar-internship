      The present protocol aims to test, whether an approach using (i) a reduced-toxicity TBF&#xD;
      followed by a (ii) Daratumumab maintenance and (iii) prophylactic infusion of donor&#xD;
      lymphocytes (pDLI), will be able to improve progression-free survival of patients with&#xD;
      refractory or relapsed MM. This trial represents the first prospective protocol aiming to&#xD;
      test the use of Daratumumab maintenance after HLA-identical or haploidentical allo-SCT in&#xD;
      patients with MM.&#xD;

      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) Outcomes for&#xD;
      patients with MM who are resistant to proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib) and immunomodulatory&#xD;
      drugs (lenalidomide, thalidomide) are dramatically poor. The median expected overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) in these patients is 9 months. New drugs such as pomalidomide or carfilzomib, when used&#xD;
      in monotherapy, can only offer a median progression free survival (PFS) of 3.8 months and OS&#xD;
      of 11.9 and 13.4 months, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) remains the most reasonable treatment option,&#xD;
      apart from palliative care, in patients with refractory or relapsed MM. No other strategy is&#xD;
      able to offer any chance of cure for a patient at this stage. However, in the context of&#xD;
      standard myeloablative (MAC) allo-SCT, results are limited in terms of feasibility in the&#xD;
      larger patients' population who is in need, and by both a relatively high relapse incidence&#xD;
      (RI) and especially high non-relapse mortality (NRM). Also, in the last decade, the advent of&#xD;
      reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allo-SCT and the improvement in supportive care&#xD;
      management regarding infectious complications allowed a significant reduction of NRM. RIC&#xD;
      expanded the transplant option to those patients who are ineligible for standard MAC allo-SCT&#xD;
      either because of age or because of pre-existing comorbid conditions. While NRM is over 40%&#xD;
      with MAC, relapse incidence remains high with either RIC or MAC. The major reason for&#xD;
      treatment failure after allo-SCT for MM has become relapse, which is between 38% and 55%.&#xD;
      Median PFS ranges from 10% to 32%. Thus, strategies to prevent relapse after allo-SCT for MM&#xD;
      remain an unmet medical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-transplant maintenance therapy Consolidation/maintenance post-transplantation for MM has&#xD;
      demonstrated to not only upgrade but also deepen the response, which translates into improved&#xD;
      PFS. Studies investigated immunomodulatory drugs, thalidomide or lenalidomide, as maintenance&#xD;
      therapy after allo-SCT. The observed activation of natural killer and regulatory T cells&#xD;
      induced by immunomodulatory drugs provides an attractive rationale for its use&#xD;
      post-transplant. But some concerns are raised by a high rate of graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
      (GVHD) induction. In the prospective HOVON 76 trial, 43% patients stopped lenalidomide&#xD;
      maintenance because of development of GVHD, 17% patients because of other adverse events, and&#xD;
      17% patients because of progression. Thus, lenalidomide maintenance after RIC allo-SCT in MM&#xD;
      patients is not feasible, mainly because of the toxicity and the induction of acute GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daratumumab, a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds CD38-expressing malignant cells with&#xD;
      high affinity and induces tumor cell death, has recently shown promising results in a phase 2&#xD;
      trial. Daratumumab was well tolerated, median PFS was 3.7 months and median duration of&#xD;
      response was 7.4 months in patients who were refractory to both proteasome inhibitors and&#xD;
      immunomodulatory drugs. Our first pilot experience, based on 3 patients with refractory MM&#xD;
      suggests that Daratumumab maintenance is feasible. No grade 3-4 toxicities were observed.&#xD;
      None of the patients experienced GVHD. After a median follow-up of 12 months, none of these&#xD;
      patients relapsed. Thus, Daratumumab appears to be the ideal candidate to propose&#xD;
      immunotherapy maintenance and reinforce the post-transplant immunomodulation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusions Given that relapsed or refractory patients are at&#xD;
      very high risk of relapse, prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion (pDLI) is a promising&#xD;
      approach to prevent relapse after allo-SCT. pDLI can improve remission status in 54% of the&#xD;
      patients and result in 5-year PFS of 79%. The incidence and severity of acute GVHD remains&#xD;
      manageable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of donor Haploidentical family donors allow finding a quickly available donor for a&#xD;
      majority of patients. T-cell replete haploidentical allo-SCT has now become feasible with the&#xD;
      use of post-graft Cyclophosphamide, which reduces the risk of GVHD. In patients with relapsed&#xD;
      or refractory hematologic malignancies, studies show no significant difference in terms of&#xD;
      toxicity and outcomes between patients undergoing allo-SCT from a HLA-identical sibling and a&#xD;
      haploidentical donor. Compared with unrelated donors, the outcomes are improved in&#xD;
      haploidentical recipients. Thus, for these advanced patients, one should look first for a&#xD;
      related donor, either matched or haploidentical. Searching for an unrelated donor may delay&#xD;
      the procedure, with a risk of losing the opportunity for transplantation, and may be&#xD;
      associated with worse outcomes compared with haploidentical allo-SCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have reported the outcomes of patients with MM after haploidentical allo-SCT. The&#xD;
      most encouraging results have been reported with the RIC associating thiotepa, busulfan and&#xD;
      fludarabine (TBF) in patients with heavily pretreated MM. The median 18-month PFS, OS and NRM&#xD;
      were 33%, 63% and 10%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present protocol aims to test, whether an approach using (i) a reduced-toxicity TBF&#xD;
      followed by a (ii) Daratumumab maintenance and (iii) prophylactic infusion of donor&#xD;
      lymphocytes (pDLI), will be able to improve progression-free survival of patients with&#xD;
      refractory or relapsed MM. This trial represents the first prospective protocol aiming to&#xD;
      test the use of Daratumumab maintenance after HLA-identical or haploidentical allo-SCT in&#xD;
      patients with MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open, non-randomized Phase II study that will include a&#xD;
      total number of 38 patients included over a period of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population of the study is women and men adults (18-70 years) with refractory or relapsed&#xD;
      multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period will be 12 months Duration of inclusions will be 24 months So, total study&#xD;
      duration (eg. 12 months after inclusion of last patient)will be 36 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive: Daratumumab, 16 mg/kg, once a week for 8 weeks (cycles 1 and 2);&#xD;
      then every 2 weeks for 16 weeks (cycles 3-6), then every 4 weeks thereafter (cycles 7-12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Patient is only eligible if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1 G/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Haemoglobin concentration &gt; 7.5 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platelets &gt; 50 G/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt; 20 mL/min according to CDK-EPI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is free of grade 2-4 acute GVHD since &gt;30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is free of active infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is an interim analysis planned, if yes, list and specify timing(s): no Final study report&#xD;
      timing after Last Patient, Last Visit: 3 months Publication submission timing after final&#xD;
      study report: 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate that PFS at 12 months is higher than 40%. The trial&#xD;
      would be designed to test the hypothesis P &lt; 20% versus P&gt;40% with one sided type I error&#xD;
      rate 5% and power 80%. Using a one step A'Hern procedure, 35 patients should be transplanted.&#xD;
      The analysis will be based on a binomial test comparing the observed 12 months PFS to 40%. In&#xD;
      all, 38 patients will be included (taking into account that after registration, there is a&#xD;
      risk of dropout i.e. patients, who will not receive a transplant due to rapidly progressive&#xD;
      disease, infection or other events occurring after identification of a donor, but before&#xD;
      start of conditioning).&#xD;
