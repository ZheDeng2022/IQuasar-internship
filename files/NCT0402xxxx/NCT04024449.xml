      This case-control multicentre trial was performed from January 1, 2017, to May 31, 2018, in&#xD;
      University of Health Sciences Bakirkoy Dr. Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital and&#xD;
      Hitit University Hospital. Adolescents who were in compliance with the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      were called by telephone for blood collection and ultrasound on the 3rd day of menstruation&#xD;
      after approval from local ethical registration. On days 2-5 of the menstrual cycle, level of&#xD;
      follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), prolactin&#xD;
      (PRL), and AMH were measured from venous blood samples in both groups. Antral Follicle Counts&#xD;
      (AFCs) and ovarian volumes were determined on the same day.&#xD;

      This case-control multicentre trial was performed from January 1, 2017, to May 31, 2018, in&#xD;
      University of Health Sciences Bakirkoy Dr. Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital and&#xD;
      Hitit University Hospital. This study was conducted with approval from the BTRH ethical board&#xD;
      (number: 2018/166). This study covered 20 cases suffered from Celiac Disease and 18 were with&#xD;
      regular menstrual period and healthy adolescent girls. Adolescents who were in compliance&#xD;
      with the inclusion criteria were called by telephone for blood collection and ultrasound on&#xD;
      the 3rd day of menstruation after approval from local ethical registration. Data on age, body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI), levels of antitransglutaminase immune globulins A (IgA), positivity to&#xD;
      antiendomysium IgA were recorded. On days 2-5 of the menstrual cycle, level of follicle&#xD;
      stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), prolactin (PRL), and AMH&#xD;
      were measured from venous blood samples in both groups. The samples were centrifuged at 3,000&#xD;
      rpm for 10 minutes to aliquot the supernatants. Antral Follicle Counts (AFCs) and ovarian&#xD;
      volumes were determined on the same day by the same ultrasound devices. The inclusion&#xD;
      criteria included the following items;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  13 ≤ Age ≤20&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least one year after menarche&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-obesity or malnutrition, Non-Hyperandogenism symptoms, and blood tests, Non-Hyper or&#xD;
           hypothyroidism, Non-Hyperprolactinemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group; with a normal menstrual period, Non-chronic diseases The study had&#xD;
           exclusion criteria such as delayed menarche, early puberty, delayed puberty, delayed&#xD;
           development of secondary sexual characters due to another sexual disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBM SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all data analyses.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics are presented as numbers and percentages (%) for qualitative variables&#xD;
      and as mean ± standard deviation and median (range) for quantitative variables. Normality&#xD;
      distribution of data was evaluated using Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Shapiro-Wilk tests to guide&#xD;
      statistical test choice.&#xD;
