    <textblock>
      The pathogen reduction system for whole blood using amustaline (S-303) and glutathione (GSH)&#xD;
      hast a potential to decrease transfusion-transmitted infection. There is a scientific basis&#xD;
      to hypothesize, that cells containing DNA and RNA such as bacteria, viruses and parasites&#xD;
      that could be present in blood collected from asymptomatic infected donors are inactivated in&#xD;
      the treated whole blood and therefore reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the safety of whole blood treated with amustaline and&#xD;
      glutathione and transfused in patients with anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a first-in-human-subjects study. Whole blood (WB) products treated with the&#xD;
      amustaline (S-303) and glutathione (GSH) pathogen reduction technology have not been&#xD;
      evaluated in human beings. However, red blood cells concentrates treated with amustaline and&#xD;
      GSH have been evaluated in multiple clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study described in this protocol is a randomized, controlled, open-label Phase I clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients will be randomized into either the Test or Control arm in a ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 patients assigned to the Test arm will receive one amustaline/GSH treated whole blood&#xD;
      product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 patients assigned to the Control arm will receive the Standard of Care (SOC), either one&#xD;
      red blood cell (RBC) component or one whole blood product.&#xD;

      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potentially eligible patients at the participating institution will be approached for&#xD;
      study consent prior to study transfusion. Enrolled patients will also be asked for consent to&#xD;
      the storage of their samples for future research on Transfusion Transmitted Infections (TTI).&#xD;
      Illiterate patients can be consented by an impartial witness (see section 2.7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who consent to the study will be assigned a study identification (ID) number and&#xD;
      undergo screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening data collection and procedures will include: Demographics (age, sex), vital signs,&#xD;
      height, weight, indication for anticipated transfusion, medical history including history of&#xD;
      bleeding and transfusion and concomitant medications. A physical examination, including skin&#xD;
      inspection, will be performed. Blood samples will be drawn for a hematological panel&#xD;
      (including complete blood count, blood chemistry, blood type, coagulation (aPTT, PT and/or&#xD;
      INR) and pregnancy test (if applicable). Immunohematology tests will be performed on a&#xD;
      patient's sample at the blood center. This includes a Direct Antibody Test (DAT), immune&#xD;
      reactivity to RBCs that have been processed with amustaline and glutathione, red cell&#xD;
      alloantibody screen (Indirect Antibody Test (IAT) / Indirect Coombs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples (pre/post-treatment) for future research on TTIs will be archived in a biobank&#xD;
      of the Institut Pasteur de Côte d'Ivoire (IPCI) (see section 9.3.3.11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After successful screening, eligible patients will be assigned to a treatment arm by&#xD;
      randomization. Randomization will be performed in the blood center by sequentially selecting&#xD;
      a randomization envelope starting with the lowest number (e.g., 1 for the first eligible&#xD;
      subject in ascending order up to envelope number 20 for the 20th subject).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ratio of patients assigned to the Test and Control group will be 1:1. Each subject will&#xD;
      receive a Test product or an untreated product based on existing SOC. The assigned blood&#xD;
      product number must be noted on the randomization assignment envelope and on the release&#xD;
      form. The product number will also be entered into the case report form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The replacement strategy in this Phase I clinical trial is based on the aim to reach twenty&#xD;
      evaluable patients. &quot;Evaluable patients&quot; is defined as those patients who are randomized and&#xD;
      receive any study transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a randomized subject withdraws or is withdrawn from the study prior to the administration&#xD;
      of any study transfusion, or does not receive any study transfusion through 7-days&#xD;
      post-randomization, this subject will be replaced by the next eligible subject using the same&#xD;
      randomization envelope. If a randomized subject receives a conventional (untreated) blood&#xD;
      transfusion prior to study transfusion, the patient will be replaced as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who received at least one investigational product will be included in the&#xD;
      analysis (i.e., group of 20 evaluable patients) and followed through the final Day 58 study&#xD;
      visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All used and unused randomization envelopes will be kept in the Site File for reconciliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-transfusion visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs, height, weight, skin inspection will be performed, hemoglobin will be assessed,&#xD;
      and urine samples will be taken for detection of blood in urine. If the patient consents to&#xD;
      future research on TTI, a sample will be drawn and sent to the archival biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be transfused with one investigational product or SOC on Day 1. In case he or&#xD;
      she requires further transfusion support to treat anemia, enrolled patients may be treated&#xD;
      with a second study transfusion. A patient who requires a second blood component within the&#xD;
      first 24 hours will receive a second treatment, if available, with an investigational product&#xD;
      from the assigned treatment arm. This patient will be included into the analysis of evaluable&#xD;
      patients and followed up to Day 58, the final study visit. If the patient requires further&#xD;
      transfusions (third transfusion etc.) it will be SOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-transfusion visit(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be hospitalized for 24 hours after each study transfusion to allow close&#xD;
      monitoring and data collection uniquely for the study purpose since their condition would&#xD;
      allow an outpatient treatment. 3 hours and 6 hours after initiating each study transfusion&#xD;
      vital signs and skin inspection will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24-hours post-transfusion vital signs, urine dipstick, concomitant medication/intervention&#xD;
      will be assessed, laboratory blood samples for hemoglobin, coagulation assays (aPTT, PT&#xD;
      and/or INR) and potassium and a sample for determination of residual S-300 will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject consented to future research on TTI, a second blood sample (post-transfusion)&#xD;
      will be collected and archived in the biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case clinical symptoms of transfusion-related bacterial contamination occur, a blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected during the post-transfusion period and microbiological analysis will&#xD;
      be performed according to standard procedures in the IPCI. Those patients will be treated&#xD;
      according to SOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Follow-up visit Day 28 days (+/-3 days) after last study transfusion):&#xD;
&#xD;
      At day 28 (+/-3 days) a physical examination, vitals, urine dipstick and blood samples will&#xD;
      be collected for laboratory analysis of safety variables (e.g., complete blood count,&#xD;
      coagulation, blood chemistry) and urine dipstick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Adverse Events (AE), Transfusion Reactions (TR) and unanticipated adverse device effects&#xD;
      will be reviewed and recorded for the period from the first study transfusion through Day 28&#xD;
      after the last study transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will assess each AE for relation to the study transfusion. Available&#xD;
      clinical diagnostic tools will be used to rule out unrelated AEs and to classify possible,&#xD;
      probable and certain TRs using Swissmedic causality definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final study visit on Day 58 (+/-7 days) after last study transfusion) At the final study&#xD;
      visit, the immune reactivity of patient serum to RBCs treated with amustaline/GSH for&#xD;
      patients in the Test arm and a DAT test for all patients will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be reviewed and recorded for the full study period from&#xD;
      transfusion through to Day 58, which is the day of the final study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will assess each SAE for relation to the study transfusion. As SAEs will be&#xD;
      further evaluated as possible transfusion reactions. SAEs that are determined to be possibly,&#xD;
      probably or certainly related to the transfusion will be classified as TRs.&#xD;
