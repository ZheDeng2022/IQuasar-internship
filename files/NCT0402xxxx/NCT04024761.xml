  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying cytokine induced memory-like natural killer (CIML NK) cells&#xD;
      plus IL-2 in adult patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)&#xD;
      and Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN) who relapse after haploidentical hematopoietic cell&#xD;
      transplantation (haplo-HCT). This study will also study CIML NK cell infusion combined with&#xD;
      IL-2 in pediatric patients (12 years of age or older) with AML, MDS, JMML who relapse after&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation using HLA-matched related donor or related donor haploidentical&#xD;
      stem cells.&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational&#xD;
      intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is&#xD;
      being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved CIML NK Cell Infusion as a&#xD;
      treatment for relapsed disease.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relapse or post-transplant persistence of AML, MDS (including JMML) or MPN (CMML,&#xD;
             myelofibrosis or MDS/MPN). Disease relapse or persistence will be defined as any&#xD;
             measurable disease by morphology, flow-cytometry, validated tests for minimal residual&#xD;
             disease or disease-defining mutations in the bone marrow, or non-immune privileged&#xD;
             extramedullary sites&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistence of disease* within 4 weeks before planned NK cell infusion and at least 2&#xD;
             weeks after completion of immune suppression taper as long as it is &gt; 2 months after&#xD;
             stem cell transplantation for both adult and pediatric patients. If 2 weeks after&#xD;
             completion of the immune suppression taper is still within 2 months of the most recent&#xD;
             stem cell transplant, then chemotherapy with Fludarabine/Cyclophosphamide would need&#xD;
             to start no earlier than at least 2 months after the transplant. For adults, disease&#xD;
             persistence after a second transplant is allowed as long as the most recent transplant&#xD;
             was a haploidentical stem cell transplant. In the pediatric cohort, disease&#xD;
             persistence or recurrence after a second transplant is allowed as long as the most&#xD;
             recent transplant was a haploidentical or matched related donor SCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Disease persistence is defined as the presence of any residual disease using standard&#xD;
             morphological assessment, immunohistochemistry or cytogenetics, or the presence of any&#xD;
             identifiable disease clone using either a high sensitivity flow cytometry or high&#xD;
             sensitivity next-generation sequencing assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Available original donor (same donor as used for the most recent haploidentical stem&#xD;
             cell transplant for adults, or for the most recent matched related donor or related&#xD;
             haploidentical donor for pediatrics) that is willing and eligible for non-mobilized&#xD;
             collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥12 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  T cell chimerism ≥20% donor-derived within the 4 weeks prior to cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with ≤80% bone marrow involvement within 4 weeks prior to cell infusion.&#xD;
             Medications like hydroxyurea, decitabine or cytarabine are allowed to control rising&#xD;
             blasts between study enrollment and cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No systemic corticosteroid therapy for GVHD (≤ 5mg of prednisone or equivalent dose of&#xD;
             systemic steroids for non-GVHD, non-autoimmune indications are allowed) for at least 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to cell infusion. Patients on systemic GVHD prophylaxis medications such&#xD;
             as tacrolimus or sirolimus need to be off these medications for at least 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No other systemic medications/treatments (e.g. ECP) for GVHD for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of the patient or legal guardian to understand and the willingness to sign a&#xD;
             written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function within 2 weeks of NK cell infusion as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin: ≤1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (except&#xD;
                  Gilbert's or disease-related hemolysis, then &lt; 3 x ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT): ≤3 x institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤2.0mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  O2 saturation: ≥90% on room air&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  LVEF &gt;40%. If there is no clinical evidence of a change in cardiovascular&#xD;
                  function from the time of pre-transplantation ECHO, then there is no need to&#xD;
                  repeat it. Otherwise, an ECHO will need to be repeated within 2 weeks of NK cell&#xD;
                  infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential only.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of CIML NK cells and IL-2 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this&#xD;
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after the last IL-2 dose administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Extramedullary relapse involving immuno-privileged sites (e.g. CNS, testes, eyes).&#xD;
             Other sites of extramedullary relapse (e.g. leukemia cutis, granulocytic sarcoma) are&#xD;
             acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had other investigational agents within 4 weeks prior to cell&#xD;
             infusion (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C), or immunotherapy within 8 weeks&#xD;
             prior, or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered&#xD;
             more than 4 weeks prior. Use of hydroxyurea to control counts within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             cell infusion is permitted with study PI approval but would need to be stopped 1 day&#xD;
             prior to administration of Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide preceding the NK cell&#xD;
             infusion. Patients on standard of care FLT-3, IDH1, and IDH2 inhibitors can stay on&#xD;
             this treatment. Therapy with BCR-ABL inhibitors must be stopped 2 weeks before NK cell&#xD;
             infusion and may be resumed after the end of the DLT period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of treatment with anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 pathway therapy, or CD137&#xD;
             agonist therapy for post-transplant relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of severe (grade 3 or 4) acute GVHD, or ongoing active GVHD requiring&#xD;
             systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Solid organ transplant recipient. Prior allogeneic HLA matched or mismatched stem cell&#xD;
             transplant is allowed in the pediatric cohort. Prior HLA matched related donor or HLA&#xD;
             matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant is allowed in the adult cohort. However,&#xD;
             the most recent transplant must be a haploidentical stem cell transplant in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to IL2 or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, including&#xD;
             ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease, are excluded from this study, as are patients&#xD;
             with a history of symptomatic disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic&#xD;
             progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune&#xD;
             vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's Granulomatosis]) and motor neuropathy considered of&#xD;
             autoimmune origin (e.g. Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis). Patients with&#xD;
             Hashimoto's thyroiditis are eligible to go on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who develop a critical illness prior to NK cell infusion that would&#xD;
             contraindicate the administration of Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide conditioning.&#xD;
             Patients who recover from such illness may still be eligible, but this must be&#xD;
             reviewed with the study PI. A repeat bone marrow examination may be required depending&#xD;
             on the timing of recovery. Patients who become critically ill on the planned day of NK&#xD;
             cell infusion are excluded if the NK cell infusion cannot be given within 48 hours of&#xD;
             the planned day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the unknown teratogenic risk of&#xD;
             CIML NK cells and IL-2 and with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects&#xD;
             by Flu/Cy chemotherapy regimen. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for&#xD;
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with CIML NK&#xD;
             cells and IL-2, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
             interactions with anti-retroviral agents used in this study. In addition, these&#xD;
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with active uncontrolled hepatitis B or C, HIV, or HTLV-1 are ineligible&#xD;
             as they are at high risk of lethal treatment-related hepatotoxicity after HSCT.&#xD;
