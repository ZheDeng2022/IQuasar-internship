  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, non-interventional study that will recruit Healthy Volunteers (HV)&#xD;
      and subjects with clinically confirmed Schizophrenia (SZ). The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      establish the mean and variance across the HV and SZ cohorts, sites, and repeated tests of&#xD;
      the electroencephalogram(EEG)/Event-related potentials (ERP) measures.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among the most replicated pathophysiological findings in schizophrenia is the impairment of&#xD;
      Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) recorded during the auditory oddball procedure. In this&#xD;
      procedure, time-locked electroencephalogram (EEG) responses are recorded during auditory&#xD;
      processing of frequent and rare tones differing in pitch or duration. In addition, a smaller&#xD;
      but substantial literature has reported deficits in the auditory steady-state EEG response&#xD;
      (ASSR) to a 40 Hz train of auditory tones in subjects with schizophrenia versus healthy&#xD;
      control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While measurement of ERPs in the drug development setting has shown promise, the instruments,&#xD;
      infrastructure, and standardization of these methods has lagged. New, portable, easy-to-use,&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved devices are now available for the automated&#xD;
      collection and analysis of EEG and ERP data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational, non-interventional, clinical study will recruit healthy volunteer&#xD;
      subjects (HV) and subjects with clinically confirmed schizophrenia (SZ), and will establish&#xD;
      the mean and variance across HV and SZ cohorts, sites and repeated tests, of EEG and ERP&#xD;
      measures collected with a standardized EEG/ERP device. The study will also examine the&#xD;
      relationship between specific EEG/ERP features and measures of positive, negative, and&#xD;
      cognitive symptoms and global function in SZ subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected in this study is intended to replicate published observations of the&#xD;
      magnitude of deficit in ERPs in SZ versus HV subjects, and to support the design of&#xD;
      subsequent interventional studies that will make use of ERPs. Furthermore, these data will be&#xD;
      submitted to support qualification of the ERP biomarkers through the FDA Drug Development&#xD;
      Tools Biomarker Qualification Program.&#xD;

    <description>The testing protocol consists of an auditory oddball Event-Related Potential (ERP) paradigm, 40Hz ASSR, and the collection of 6 minutes of resting electroencephalogram (EEG). During the ERP paradigm a variety of auditory stimuli are played through the system's earphones while voltage potentials are recorded from the subject's scalp. At the end of the ERP session, 6 minutes of EEG data will be recorded while the subject is resting. The entire procedure, including set up, instructions to the subject and actual test is expected to take 60-75 minutes.</description>
