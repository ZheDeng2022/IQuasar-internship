  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to is to determine if a diet (TCM-FMD) which combine&#xD;
      fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) with &quot;dispelling dampness&quot; meal replacement (a meal replacement&#xD;
      made up of traditional Chinese medicine) is the effective dietary strategy for treatment of&#xD;
      phlegm-dampness type overweight/obese patients. A three months randomized trial will be used&#xD;
      to observe weight loss generated by TCM-FMD and FMD. And a group keeping a normal diet will&#xD;
      be set as a blank control. Through comparison, we aim at examining the effects of&#xD;
      interventions on weight and metabolic disease risk factors (plasma lipids, fasting glucose,&#xD;
      blood pressure) The secondary aim of this study is to evaluate the safety of TCM-FMD.&#xD;

      Background:Fasting-mimiking Diet (FMD) is a plant-based diet designed to attain fasting-like&#xD;
      effect, firstly proposed on 2015[1]. It requires people to limit calorie intake for 5&#xD;
      continuous days, and then return to their normal diet after completion about 25 days until&#xD;
      the next cycle. In a clinical trial[2], three FMD cycles reduced body weight, trunk and body&#xD;
      fat, and reduced blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides and total cholesterol.&#xD;
      On the other hand, in the theory of physique of TCM theory, overweight/obesity is usually&#xD;
      considered to be phlegm-dampness type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: We assume that using medicinal-edible plants which was considered to dispel&#xD;
      dampness(such as fuling, shanyao, etc.) as FMD's proprietary formulations can enhance the&#xD;
      effect of FMD on improve people's characteristic features of metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A 12-week, single-center, pilot study will be conducted to test the study&#xD;
      objectives.A new diet is carried. It is a fasting-mimicking diet combined with a &quot;dispelling&#xD;
      dampness&quot; meal replacement. Because the theory of applying traditional Chinese medicine&#xD;
      combined with FMD, we call it TCM-FMD, the main ingredient of the &quot;wet diet&quot; meal package is&#xD;
      millet. Brown rice, oats, purple sweet potato, alfalfa, yam, hazelnut, etc. For comparison,&#xD;
      we also designed FMD to make some cereals (including millet, purple potato, oatmeal, walnut,&#xD;
      etc.) without a moisturizing effect into a &quot;grain package&quot; as a control group. Both groups&#xD;
      were administered using the FMD diet model. At the same time, a group of normal diets was&#xD;
      also designed as a blank control group. The primary outcome measure for the study was weight;&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures included: waist circumference, blood pressure, triglycerides,&#xD;
      total cholesterol and fasting blood glucose, quality of life (evaluated by physical fitness&#xD;
      scale and SF-36); safety indicators included: liver and kidney Features, etc. Both groups&#xD;
      were subjected to caloric restriction (5 days, daily calorie about 800kcal) and normal diet&#xD;
      (dietitian for healthy diet guidance), and the blank control group was given a normal diet.&#xD;
