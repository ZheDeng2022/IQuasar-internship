  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This three-year study will determine the effectiveness of a helmetless tackling training&#xD;
      intervention to decrease head impact exposure in Hawaiian high school football players.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High school football participants are reported to sustain an average of 600, and as many as&#xD;
      2000, head impacts in a single season. Impacts to the top and front of the helmet generate&#xD;
      the greatest forces, and thus pose the highest risk for acute brain and spinal cord injury.&#xD;
      Equally disconcerting is the potential relationship between the accumulation of concussive&#xD;
      and sub-concussive impacts (head impact exposure, HIE) and the risk for developing long-term&#xD;
      conditions such as cognitive impairment, early-onset Alzheimer's, and chronic traumatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy (CTE). Tackling and blocking behaviors using the head as the point of first&#xD;
      contact can be attributed, in part, to the fact that players wear a helmet, which influences&#xD;
      behavior by increasing the perception of safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is such that a football player who regularly practices tackling and&#xD;
      blocking drills without a helmet in a controlled environment will naturally leave the head&#xD;
      out of contact and is likely to continue to do so while wearing the helmet during games and&#xD;
      full-contact practices. This learned motor behavior will reduce the number of head impacts a&#xD;
      football player experiences throughout their playing career and thus reduces the risk of&#xD;
      acute and chronic head and neck injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigation will be a pre-test, post-test quasi experimental design using an&#xD;
      evidence-based helmetless tackling and blocking program (HuTT®) with football players (~200)&#xD;
      recruited from high school football teams in Oahu, Hawaii.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Year 1 will serve as a baseline and entail collecting only head impact data during regular&#xD;
      football participation for two teams. After adding a third team for years 2 and 3, all&#xD;
      subjects will then undergo the HuTT® Program intervention emphasizing proper tackling and&#xD;
      blocking techniques under closely supervised drills where players participate without their&#xD;
      helmets and shoulder pads in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the outset, subjects will use a new Speedflex helmet outfitted with the InSite™ head&#xD;
      impact sensor (Riddell, Co). The helmet and sensor will be worn in all practices and games&#xD;
      and used to record head impact exposure (frequency, location, and magnitude). ImPACT tests&#xD;
      will be conducted at pre- and post-season intervals to measure verbal and visual memory&#xD;
      composite, visual motor speed composite, reaction time composite and symptoms scores. In&#xD;
      addition, player self-efficacy for head-safe behavior will be scored each year using a&#xD;
      self-reported survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A between-subjects ANOVAs will be used to compare outcome measures among teams. Significant&#xD;
      interactions and main effects will be identified by appropriate t-tests with Bonferonni&#xD;
      corrections at an alpha-level of 0.05.&#xD;

    <description>The HuTT® program emphasizes proper tackling and blocking techniques using a progressive series of closely supervised drills. Skill rehearsal is done without helmets and shoulder pads and is the inherent element of HuTT® in order to reinforce behaviors which remove the head as a point of contact. The HuTT® program is modeled after basic tackling/blocking drills familiar to the sport of football. Feedback to confirm or correct proper skill development is provided by coaches trained in the HuTT® technique. HuTT® drills are conducted at an intensity of 50-75% effort and over a period of approximately 10 minutes. The intervention will be conducted 2 times each week throughout the regular season.</description>
