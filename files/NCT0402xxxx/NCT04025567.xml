      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma (FLC) is a rare liver cancer. It most often occurs in&#xD;
      young people who have no history of liver disease. Unresectable FLC most often does not&#xD;
      improve with surgery. Researchers think gut bacteria may affect liver cancer control. They&#xD;
      want to see if a drug that controls a type of bacteria can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if vancomycin is safe and tolerable for and can treat people with unresectable FLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with FLC that isn t responsive to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, blood and urine tests,&#xD;
      and CT or MRI scans. They will provide a tumor sample: If they do not have one, they will&#xD;
      have a biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take vancomycin 3 times a day. They will take the drug by mouth. They will&#xD;
      take the drug in 28-day cycles. They will take the drug daily for the first 3 weeks. They&#xD;
      will not take the drug the last week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a medication diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood and urine tests each cycle. They may provide stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a biopsy before they start treatment. Then they will have one on day 1&#xD;
      of cycle 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have scans on day 1 of cycle 2. Then they will have scans about every 8&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue treatment until their cancer gets worse or they can no longer&#xD;
      tolerate the side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit about a month after they finish treatment. Then they&#xD;
      will be followed every 6 months by phone or email.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a rare liver cancer (0.5-9% of primary&#xD;
           liver cancers), which affects younger age groups and is not associated with underlying&#xD;
           liver disease or elevated serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery, either liver resection (LR) or liver transplantation (LT), is the only&#xD;
           potentially curative treatment for FLC patients with resectable disease. Disease&#xD;
           recurrence after complete resection is high (33-100%). In patients with unresectable&#xD;
           disease, median survival is less than 12 months; with no patient expected to survive&#xD;
           beyond 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The role of systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy is poorly defined, and has been&#xD;
           reported to have only a modest or no therapeutic effect. To date no targeted therapy has&#xD;
           been shown to be of any value in FLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In mouse models, oral vancomycin alters gut commensal bacteria thereby inducing a&#xD;
           liver-selective anti-tumor effect by increasing hepatic CXCR6+ NKT cells via increased&#xD;
           CXCL16 expression of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate the effect of oral vancomycin therapy on the relative CXCR6 gene expression&#xD;
      levels in the liver in paired pre- and on-treatment biopsy samples from hepatic lesions in&#xD;
      patients with unresectable FLC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed FLC, not amenable to potentially curative resection,&#xD;
           transplantation or ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver lesion measurable by RECIST criteria, accessible for biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptable renal and normal liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willingness to undergo pre- and on-treatment biopsies of liver tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase II study of oral vancomycin in patients with unresectable FLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 14 patients will be treated with oral vancomycin 500 mg tid daily (1,500 mg total&#xD;
           daily dose) from days 1 to 21, in a 28-day cycles. After completion of the first cycle,&#xD;
           initiation of concurrent treatment will be allowed. Patients will receive oral&#xD;
           vancomycin until off treatment criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be evaluated for toxicity every 4 weeks by CTCAE v5.0, and for response at&#xD;
           the end of the first cycle and thereafter every 8 (+/-3) weeks by RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
