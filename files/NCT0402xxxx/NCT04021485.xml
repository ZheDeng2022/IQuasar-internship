  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal antenatal corticosteroid therapy is the last major advance in the antenatal&#xD;
      management of fetuses to prevent neonatal complications associated with prematurity.&#xD;
      Long-term neurological outcomes in infants exposed to antenatal steroids have been assessed&#xD;
      in few cohorts and suggest that this therapy is able to prevent some neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      impairments including cerebral palsy. While &gt;85% of neonates born very preterm in Europe have&#xD;
      been exposed to antenatal betamethasone, Cochrane collaborative networks stated that trials&#xD;
      of dosages comparing different regimens of commonly used corticosteroids are most urgently&#xD;
      needed to avoid useless fetal exposure to excessive dosage of corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because a half dosage was associated with maximal benefits on lung function in ewes, a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (BETADOSE, NCT02897076) is currently conducted to demonstrate&#xD;
      that a 50% reduced betamethasone dose regimen is not inferior to a full dose to prevent&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome in preterm neonates. Follow-up of infants born from enrolled&#xD;
      women is mandatory both to investigate the long-term effect of dose reduction and to confirm&#xD;
      the non-inferiority of the dose reduction on neurocognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of BETANINO is that half dose regimen of betamethasone is not inferior to&#xD;
      full dose regimen of betamethasone to prevent neurodevelopmental impairments in these&#xD;
      high-risk children born very preterm.&#xD;

      Maternal antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) therapy is considered to be the last major advance&#xD;
      in the antenatal management of fetuses at risk of preterm birth. It was adopted worldwide to&#xD;
      prevent neonatal death and neonatal complications following preterm birth, including&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis and severe intraventricular&#xD;
      hemorrhage. While short-term benefits of ACS were extensively investigated, long-term&#xD;
      neurological outcomes in infants exposed antenatally to betamethasone have been assessed in&#xD;
      few cohorts only. A recent report from the Cochrane collaborative network suggest that ACS is&#xD;
      able to prevent some neurodevelopmental impairments associated with preterm delivery and&#xD;
      related to postnatal adverse events .&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of today, in Europe and France, more than 85% of neonates born very preterm have been&#xD;
      exposed to antenatal corticosteroids, mostly betamethasone for a total dose of 24 mg.&#xD;
      Cochrane collaborative networks stated that trials of dosages comparing different regimens of&#xD;
      commonly used corticosteroids are most urgently needed. Because a half dosage was associated&#xD;
      with maximal benefits on lung function in ewes, a randomized controlled trial (BETADOSE,&#xD;
      NCT02897076) is currently conducted to demonstrate that a 50% reduced betamethasone dose&#xD;
      regimen is not inferior to a full dose regimen to prevent respiratory distress syndrome in&#xD;
      neonates. Whatever the results of this ongoing clinical trial, follow-up of infants born from&#xD;
      enrolled women is mandatory both to confirm the non-inferiority of the dose reduction on&#xD;
      neurocognition and to assess the long-term effect of dose reduction on survival, on complex&#xD;
      aspects of cognition, on behavioral aspects and on others neurodevelopmental impairments.&#xD;
      Indeed, changes in clinical practices following BETADOSE trials will be depending on both&#xD;
      short- and long-term outcomes. If non inferiority is demonstrated, dramatic changes will&#xD;
      occur in the clinical use of antenatal betamethasone in women at risk of preterm birth in&#xD;
      France and worldwide. If non inferiority is rejected, the neurocognitive follow-up of&#xD;
      enrolled patients will be also of interest to (i) assess the long-term impact of the early&#xD;
      consequences associated with betamethasone dose reduction and (ii) to find out domains of&#xD;
      neurocognitive development sensitive to ACS exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BETANINO study aims at assessing the impact of a 50% dose reduction on neurocognition at 3&#xD;
      years of age in infants born from mothers enrolled in the BETADOSE trial before 32 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation, children that are at highest risk of neurocognitive impairments during childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of this cohort study following a randomized clinical trial is that half&#xD;
      dose betamethasone (12 mg) is not inferior to full dose betamethasone (24 mg) to prevent&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental impairment in children born very preterm.&#xD;
