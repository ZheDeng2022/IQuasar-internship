    <textblock>
      This trial studies the effect of an electronic health (eHealth) support program called PACK&#xD;
      Health on patient reported health outcomes in patients with breast cancer. PACK Health&#xD;
      monitors breast cancer patients' reported side effects and experience of care when receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Participating in the PACK Health coaching program may improve quality of life,&#xD;
      decrease hospital admissions and improve overall health.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of an eHealth coaching program on the self-reported global health&#xD;
      of women with breast cancer, as measured by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Patient&#xD;
      Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health Scale version (v.)&#xD;
      1.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of an eHealth coaching program on the symptom experience of women&#xD;
      with breast cancer as measured by the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Breast (MDASI-Br).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the effect of an eHealth coaching program on physical and mental health of&#xD;
      women diagnosed with breast cancer as measured by the subscales of the PROMIS Global Health&#xD;
      Scale v 1.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the effect of an eHealth coaching program on the symptom experience and&#xD;
      global health outcomes of women by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIa. Disease stage. IIIb. Active treatment type (i.e. surgery, radiation, chemotherapy,&#xD;
      hormonal therapy, immunotherapy or a combination of these methodologies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIc. Time since diagnosis. IV. To evaluate the effect of an eHealth coaching program on the&#xD;
      frequency of emergency room visits and hospital admissions for patients receiving treatment&#xD;
      in the ambulatory setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the relationship between financial toxicity, as measured by the Consumer Score&#xD;
      for Financial Toxicity (COST), and quality of life, as measured by the Functional Assessment&#xD;
      of Quality of Life-Breast (FACT-B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients participate in PACK Health program consisting of weekly contact with an&#xD;
      assigned health coach via text message, phone call, and email for 3 months. After 3 months,&#xD;
      patients continue to be contacted by the health coach at least once monthly for an additional&#xD;
      3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive standard of care support services over 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>Measured by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health Scale version (v.)1.2. PROMIS v1.2 raw scores will be converted to PROMIS v1.2 t-scores prior to any analyses. Because t scores can only be calculated if a participant answers all 10 items, multiple imputation techniques will be used to estimate the values for missing items. Prior to conducting multiple imputation, the data will first be examined to determine whether missing data are missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR) or missing not at random (MNAR). Models will be created separately for physical and mental health. Testing will be 2-sided and conducted with a 0.05 level of statistical significance yielding a family wise Type I error rate of 0.10.</description>

    <measure>Rate of emergency room visits and hospital admissions</measure>
    <time_frame>From day 1 to day 180</time_frame>
    <description>A generalized linear mixed model using a log link function will be used to model the rate of emergency room visits and hospital admissions by intervention and time. The number of emergency room visits and hospital admissions will be recorded for each subject from day 1 through day 180 and summarized to correspond to inventory assessment periods.</description>
