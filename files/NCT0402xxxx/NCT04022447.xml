  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dupilumab is a monoclonal anti-IL-4/13Rα antibody developed for severe asthma (SA). In&#xD;
      France, mepolizumab was commercialized in February 2018. Before this date, many SA patients&#xD;
      had reached a therapeutic dead end, with uncontrolled disease despite maximal available&#xD;
      treatment. Upon the request of lung specialists involved in SA, French health authorities&#xD;
      approved an early access program (temporary Use Authorization) allowing early access to&#xD;
      dupilumab (before EMA's decision) from September 2017 to January 2018, for SA patients&#xD;
      demonstrating unacceptable steroids side effects and/or life-threatening exacerbations,&#xD;
      irrespective of their T2 status.The aim of this retrospective study was to describe the&#xD;
      characteristics of SA patients included in the early access program and to assess changes in&#xD;
      asthma control after a 12 months treatment.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is a worldwide burden affecting more than 300 millions patients. Although the vast&#xD;
      majority of asthma patients suffer from mild to moderate diseases whose symptoms can be&#xD;
      assessed with inhaled corticosteroids (CSI) and bronchodilators, 3.7% of them present with&#xD;
      severe asthma (SA). SA is defined as an asthma remaining uncontrolled despite adherence with&#xD;
      maximal optimized therapy and treatment of contributory factors, or that worsens when high&#xD;
      dose treatment is decreased. SA represents a small proportion of patients but the very heart&#xD;
      of the asthma problem with tremendous health costs, high morbidity and significant mortality.&#xD;
      Thus it has been the center of therapeutic research interest for the past decade and&#xD;
      different treatments have achieved development and reglementary approvals. Among them,&#xD;
      dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the alpha subunit of the interleukin&#xD;
      4 receptor, blocking both IL-4 and IL -13 pathways. It is therefore interacting with the type&#xD;
      2 inflammation response observed in eosinophilic asthma. The French Ministry of Health&#xD;
      therefore opened a window of appeals for TUA from September 2017 to January 2018, allowing&#xD;
      early access to dupilumab for SA patients demonstrating unacceptable steroids side effects&#xD;
      and/or life-threatening exacerbations, irrespective of their T2 status. By that time indeed,&#xD;
      phase 3 randomized clinical trials (RCT) on eosinophilic patients had not yet been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase IV real-life study with no placebo group, the investigators aimed to describe&#xD;
      patients' characteristics and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Dupilumab on&#xD;
      non-selected SA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter retrospective observational real-life study was conducted at 13 public&#xD;
      teaching hospitals across the country. All French SA patients who received dupilumab under&#xD;
      the TUA between September 2017 and January 2018 were included in the survey, as long as they&#xD;
      had received at least one injection and completed at least one follow-up visit in the first&#xD;
      12 months of treatment. No inclusion criteria were required, but patients' files had&#xD;
      previously been screened through by health authorities and validated by Sanofi to allow&#xD;
      dupilumab TUA. Physicians had had to certify that patients had SA with no other treatment&#xD;
      available at that time, and that poor asthma control and/or severe steroid side effects&#xD;
      required scaling up treatment. Patients were not required to have eosinophilia. However,&#xD;
      patients were excluded from the TUA if they presented with previous hypereosinophilia &gt;&#xD;
      1500/mm3, as symptomatic hypereosinophilia has previously been described with dupilumab in&#xD;
      this particular population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators were free to decide on the frequency of visits, blood tests and function&#xD;
      assessments, as to define the tools of control assessment, in adequacy with their usual&#xD;
      practice. On line and paper questionnaires were retrospectively filled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective of the study was to describe asthma control at 12 months and secondary&#xD;
      objectives were descriptive data of the population, efficacy, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      dupilumab treatment. Statistics of patients' characteristics were compiled. Efficacy was&#xD;
      assessed in the per-protocol population, defined as all the patients who completed visits at&#xD;
      3, 6 and/or 12 months. Differences between baseline and follow-up visits were compared by&#xD;
      Wilcoxon signed-rank test and rank-sum test. ACT evolution during study was assessed with a&#xD;
      mixed linear model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response was eventually assessed by each investigator using the GETE score (5 categories,&#xD;
      graded from 1 to 5, respectively defining the disease control as excellent - good - moderate&#xD;
      - poor and worsening). Categories 1 and 2 are considered as good response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical response was defined as gain of ACT score of more than 5 points compared to previous&#xD;
      assessment or ACT &gt; 18. Time to first clinical response was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability were evaluated on the basis of each investigator notifications The&#xD;
      protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of the French learned society for&#xD;
      respiratory medicine - Société de Pneumologie de Langue Française and of the Paris University&#xD;
      Hospitals - Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris. The independent Committee for the&#xD;
      protection of persons (CPP) gave a favourable opinion. All patients provided oral consent to&#xD;
      the collection of their data. As a non interventional retrospective study, no written consent&#xD;
      was required.&#xD;
