      Open-label, dose escalation (Phase I) and dose expansion (Phase IIA) study of patients&#xD;

      (ICI) (Phase I and II)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose escalation (Phase I), and dose expansion (Phase IIA) study&#xD;
      designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of IMSA101 alone or in combination with an ICI&#xD;
      (Phase I and II). Therefore, the study will be conducted in 2 phases. The dose of IMSA101 in&#xD;
      Phase IIA will be based on the monotherapy and combination Recommended Phase 2 Doses (RP2Ds)&#xD;
      from Phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following methodology applies to all patients (unless otherwise indicated):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-treatment screening radiographic tumor assessments will be collected within 30 days&#xD;
           prior to initial dose for all patients. Photographic assessments for&#xD;
           cutaneously-accessible lesions will be performed as detailed in a separate photography&#xD;
           manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment cycles will be 28 days in duration with lesions injected weekly on Day 1 for&#xD;
           the first three weeks of Cycle 1 and then every 2 weeks during cycles 2 and beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A single pre-defined lesion/lesion site (longest diameter ≥ 10 mm and ≤ 35 mm) shall be&#xD;
           injected throughout study duration, if possible. Where the original injection site is&#xD;
           considered by the investigator to become inaccessible, a second lesion/lesion site shall&#xD;
           be selected as a replacement and this shall be used henceforth so long as it is&#xD;
           considered accessible. Subsequent injection sites shall be replaced when they are&#xD;
           considered inaccessible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Where no remaining accessible lesions are present and where benefit of IMSA101 therapy&#xD;
           is, in the opinion of the investigator, being derived by the patient, continued&#xD;
           injections of IMSA101 into the vicinity of an inaccessible lesion or, in the case that a&#xD;
           lesion can no longer be radiographically visualized, into the last known location of the&#xD;
           non-visible lesion shall be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be admitted to the hospital for observation overnight following IT&#xD;
           injection with IMSA101 on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Patients will be followed throughout the&#xD;
           study for drug tolerability and safety by collection of clinical and laboratory data,&#xD;
           including information on adverse events (AEs) using CTCAE v5.0 criteria, serious adverse&#xD;
           events (SAEs), DLTs, concomitant medications, vital signs, and electrocardiograms&#xD;
           (ECGs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be assessed for anti-tumor efficacy based on radiographic assessments and&#xD;
           if applicable, photographic tumor assessments, and analysis of Objective Response Rate&#xD;
           (ORR), Time to Progression (TTP), and Progression Free Survival (PFS) using RECIST&#xD;
           criteria (Appendix 13.2) at screening and the end (≤ 7 days) of even numbered cycles&#xD;
           (Cycle 2, Cycle 4, etc.) after the first dosing.&#xD;
