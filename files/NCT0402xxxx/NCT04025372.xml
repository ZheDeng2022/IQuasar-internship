    <textblock>
      This research study is comparing the use of a new form of hormonal therapy used with&#xD;
      radiation as a possible treatment for intermediate risk prostate cancer. More specifically,&#xD;
      this research would help determine whether this new form of hormonal therapy is as effective&#xD;
      as the standard hormone therapy while also preserving erectile function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking at whether the novel form of hormonal&#xD;
      therapy, called Darolutamide, when paired with radiation therapy will provide the same&#xD;
      quality of care as the current standard treatments available for men with this type of&#xD;
      cancer. Darolutamide prevents testosterone from signaling throughout the body. Although&#xD;
      studies have shown that Darolutamide has activity in more advanced forms of prostate cancer,&#xD;
      the activity of Darolutamide is unknown in intermediate risk prostate cancer treated with&#xD;
      radiation therapy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Darolutamide&#xD;
      as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care treatments available to men with this type of cancer are&#xD;
      radiation therapy with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) involving a gonadotropin&#xD;
      releasing hormone agonist plus bicalutamide (both FDA-approved) or surgery. ADT works by&#xD;
      depriving the body of testosterone which &quot;feeds&quot; prostate cancer cells and weakens prostate&#xD;
      cancer cells from repairing damage caused by radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigator will be assessing erectile function at baseline, during and&#xD;
      after treatment to determine if short-term erectile function can be preserved without&#xD;
      sacrificing long-term disease control.&#xD;
