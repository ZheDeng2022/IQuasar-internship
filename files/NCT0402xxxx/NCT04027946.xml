    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 230,000 new lung cancer cases are diagnosed every year in the U.S. About 80% of lung&#xD;
      cancers are NSCLC. Most people have a more advanced stage of the disease that doesn t respond&#xD;
      well to standard treatment. Researchers want to see if a combination of drugs may be able to&#xD;
      help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out if LMB-100 followed by pembrolizumab can help tumors to shrink in people with&#xD;
      NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with NSCLC that has not responded to standard therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor sample. If one is not available, they will have a biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessments of ability to perform normal activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, heart, and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT and PET scans: They will like in a machine that takes pictures of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take LMB-100 in 21-day cycles for up to 2 cycles. They will take the drug&#xD;
      by injection into an arm vein on days 1, 3, and 5 of each cycle. They will stay in the&#xD;
      hospital 7-10 days each cycle. Then they will get pembrolizumab by injection into an arm vein&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. They may be able to take pembrolizumab an additional year if&#xD;
      their cancer gets worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have repeats of the screening tests throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days and 90 days after they stop treatment, participants will have follow-up visits.&#xD;
      Then they will have visits every 6-12 weeks. They will be followed for the rest of their life&#xD;
      through phone calls and emails.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mesothelin is expressed in approximately half of all lung adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LMB-100 has demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy against several mesothelin expressing tumor&#xD;
           models including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).- Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1)&#xD;
           is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA-4 that has been shown to negatively&#xD;
           regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab, an IgG4 monoclonal antagonist antibody to PD-1, is FDA approved in the&#xD;
           frontline for advanced non-squamous NSCLC as a single agent with high PD-L1 expression&#xD;
           [tumor proportion score (TPS) &gt;=50%] or in combination with platinum-based doublet&#xD;
           chemotherapy (PD-L1 unselected). It also approved in the second-line for high PDL1&#xD;
           expressing tumors (TPS &gt;=1%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combination treatment with LMB-100 plus pembrolizumab results in greater anti-tumor&#xD;
           efficacy in murine lung cancer model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the objective response rate of LMB-100 followed by pembrolizumab in the&#xD;
      treatment of subjects with mesothelin-expressing non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) previously treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous, non-small cell&#xD;
           lung cancer lacking an EGFR sensitizing mutation, ALK or ROS1 gene rearrangement and not&#xD;
           amenable to potentially curative surgical resection or chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor mesothelin expression of at least 25% of tumor cells as determined by the&#xD;
           Laboratory of Pathology at the NCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects must have at least progressed after one prior platinum-based doublet&#xD;
           chemotherapy AND standard immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) with either frontline&#xD;
           single-agent pembrolizumab, or in combination with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy,&#xD;
           or second-line single-agent nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt;= 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is an open-label, single center phase II study of LMB-100 followed by pembrolizumab&#xD;
           in subjects with mesothelin expressing NSCLC who have progressed on standard therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will receive LMB-100 at the single agent MTD (140mg/kg) on days 1, 3 and 5 of a&#xD;
           21-day cycle for up to 2 cycles and pembrolizumab 200 mg on day 1 of cycle 3 of a 21-&#xD;
           day cycle (or cycle 2 if disease progression is observed after 1 cycle) onwards until&#xD;
           disease progression (on or after pembrolizumab) or intolerable toxicity for a maximum of&#xD;
           2 years (unless second course initiated).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The total accrual ceiling for the screening will be set at 100 total patients in order&#xD;
           to treat 23 subjects.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2&#xD;
                  years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or&#xD;
                  immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g.., thyroxine, insulin, or&#xD;
                  physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary&#xD;

               -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory&#xD;
                  abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the&#xD;
                  subject s participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best&#xD;
                  interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating&#xD;
                  investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
                  cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to start of&#xD;
                  study therapy. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative,&#xD;
                  a serum pregnancy test will be required. Note: In the event that 72 hours have&#xD;
                  elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and the first dose of study&#xD;
                  treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed and must be&#xD;
                  negative in order for subject to start receiving study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within&#xD;
                  the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through&#xD;
                  180 days after the last dose of trial treatment. Pregnant women are excluded from&#xD;
                  this study because LMB-100 + pembrolizumab are agents with the potential for&#xD;
                  teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential&#xD;
                  risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother&#xD;
                  with LMB-100 + pembrolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother&#xD;
                  is treated with LMB-100 + pembrolizumab. These potential risks may also apply to&#xD;
                  other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). HIV positive patients&#xD;
                  will be excluded due to a theoretical concern that the degree of immune&#xD;
                  suppression associated with the treatment may result in progression of HIV&#xD;
                  infection. (Note: No HIV testing is required)&#xD;
