      This is a randomized phase II study examining nivolumab alone versus radiation therapy with&#xD;
      nivolumab in subjects who did not have disease progression to initial therapy with the&#xD;
      combination of FOLFOX and Nivolumab. Subjects with advanced unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
      gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma are eligible. All subjects will receive FOLFOX + nivolumab&#xD;
      therapy. Subjects who demonstrate at least stable disease, as per RECIST 1.1, on their first&#xD;
      imaging assessment at two months will receive one additional month of FOLFOX + nivolumab (3&#xD;
      months total), and then will be randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to receive either nivolumab&#xD;
      alone or nivolumab plus radiation therapy. Radiation therapy fields and technique will be&#xD;
      approved by central review. Radiation will be planned at 4Gy x 5 doses (20 Gy total), given&#xD;
      concurrently with nivolumab. After 4 months of therapy, patients who remain on study will&#xD;
      receive nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks. Subjects will be on study (intervention + follow-up)&#xD;
      for approximately 24 months. The projected end date of the study, including data analysis, is&#xD;
      February 2026.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Nivolumab 240 MG</intervention_name>
    <description>Nivolumab (OpdivoTM) is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAB) designed to block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Cancer cells are able to send a signal to the PD-1 via the PD-L1 molecule, tricking the T-cell into recognizing the cancer cell as normal. Nivolumab is designed to disrupt that signal and expose the cancer cell to the immune system. Nivolumab is given intravenously over a 60-minute period, usually every two weeks.</description>
