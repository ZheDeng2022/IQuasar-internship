  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parental substance use is the second leading cause of foster care placement. As a result,&#xD;
      nearly 100,000 Ohio grandparents, family, friends, and neighbors are providing kinship care&#xD;
      for children. Kinship caregivers are more likely to be of lower socioeconomic status, report&#xD;
      less warmth and respect in their parenting attitudes, and exhibit higher levels of&#xD;
      caregiver-child conflict, relative to traditional foster parents. These characteristics, in&#xD;
      addition to the trauma associated with exposure to parental drug use, contribute to a&#xD;
      significant risk for reading difficulties and lower overall academic achievement for affected&#xD;
      children. The objective is to pilot an evidence-based reading intervention in a group of&#xD;
      kinship caregivers and children affected by parental opioid use. This work is significant&#xD;
      because the investigators aim to improve reading outcomes of children who may otherwise&#xD;
      experience substantial difficulty with reading development, and to support kinship caregivers&#xD;
      who may otherwise have few resources to promote the reading skills of children placed in&#xD;
      their care. The approach will use a randomized (1:1) waitlist controlled trial design to&#xD;
      examine the effects of a 15-week kinship caregiver-implemented Sit Together and Read (STAR)&#xD;
      intervention for 4-5 year old children being raised by kin as a result of parental opioid&#xD;
      use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parental substance use is the second leading cause of foster care placement, with nearly 50%&#xD;
      of cases involving children under age five years. Fifty percent of all Ohio children taken&#xD;
      into child protective services experienced parental drug use, with rates higher than 75% in&#xD;
      some Ohio counties. Approximately 100,000 Ohio grandparents and relatives are providing&#xD;
      kinship care for children affected by parental drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAR is an evidence-based home-based shared book reading intervention designed to improve the&#xD;
      foundational reading skills of preschoolers who are at risk for reading disabilities. The&#xD;
      potential for STAR to positively impact the kinship family is multi-faceted. STAR was&#xD;
      developed to accelerate the early reading development of vulnerable children, including those&#xD;
      in kinship care. The investigators expect STAR to promote positive caregiver-child&#xD;
      interactions and improve kinship caregivers' sense of self-efficacy with respect to&#xD;
      supporting the child's reading development. The implementation of the STAR intervention is&#xD;
      innovative because it will provide tangible and important financial and material resources&#xD;
      that have been effective in improving short- and long-term academic outcomes for children&#xD;
      living in low SES environments that may not otherwise be available to kinship families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal is to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of an evidence-based&#xD;
      reading intervention in a group of kinship caregivers and children affected by parental&#xD;
      opioid use. In this pilot implementation, investigators will enroll up to 50 kinship&#xD;
      caregivers and the 4 to 5 year old children in their care to determine the feasibility of the&#xD;
      STAR intervention in this population (Aim 1). The investigators will determine the extent to&#xD;
      which STAR imparts positive and significant effects on children's foundational reading skills&#xD;
      (Aim 2). The investigators will examine the extent to which participation in STAR, and the&#xD;
      associated training and supports provided, are associated with positive changes in kinship&#xD;
      caregivers' self-efficacy with respect to supporting the reading development of the children&#xD;
      in their care (Aim 3). Investigators will meet the objectives of this work by using a&#xD;
      randomized (1:1) waitlist controlled trial design. The randomization scheme will be prepared&#xD;
      prior to any participant enrollment by a statistician not affiliated with the project.&#xD;
      Successful implementation of this work will provide financial and material resources to&#xD;
      families in need, while simultaneously engaging kinship families in an evidenced-based&#xD;
      intervention that is proven effective at improving young children's reading trajectories.&#xD;
