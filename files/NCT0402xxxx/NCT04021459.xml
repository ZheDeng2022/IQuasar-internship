  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the spread of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC)&#xD;
      during surgery in endometrial cancer. Although this cancer is often discovered at early&#xD;
      stage, the risk of recurrence is estimated at 6 to 21%, according to grade. Early stage tumor&#xD;
      is accessible for curative surgical treatment by laparoscopy but this kind of surgery may&#xD;
      induce CTCs spread, and could be an explanation of this recurrence. Through this study,&#xD;
      concordance between two blood punction sites, peripheral vein and ovarian vein, will be&#xD;
      evaluated to detect these cells during surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this single-center clinical trial is to determine the best blood punction site to&#xD;
      observe the spreading of CTC during surgery in endometrial cancer. CTCs are very rare events&#xD;
      on blood and their detection require extremely sensitive technologies. This pilot study will&#xD;
      investigate CTC spread during surgery on 10 patients with endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to compare venipuncture site for detection of CTCs in endometrial&#xD;
      cancer during surgery. Blood samples are collected on a simple sampling (arm) compared to&#xD;
      sampling as close as possible to the tumor (ovarian vein).&#xD;
