  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational clinical case series investigation will be conducted on approximately five&#xD;
      (5) enrolled subjects at one (1) site in the US. Treatment of subjects encompasses all steps&#xD;
      to fabricate new dentures for maxilla and/or mandible. The subjects will be followed 7-10&#xD;
      days after final delivery of the denture&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is undertaken to evaluate the workflow and concomitant products to create&#xD;
      full dentures by using additive manufacturing (AM) technology, i.e. Digital Light Processingâ„¢&#xD;
      Technology (Carbon 3D) to restore fully edentulous jaws. The assessment includes quality of&#xD;
      materials provided by Dentsply Sirona Lab by using printers for AM (M series, Carbon 3D 1089&#xD;
      Mills Way, Redwood City, CA 94063). This assessment will be done by clinical review of the AM&#xD;
      dentures on fit and quality. In addition, the evaluation includes a patient survey to assess&#xD;
      current dentures and the new AM dentures with a subjective comparison of both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target subjects are male or female, 18 years and older with the need of a full denture in&#xD;
      one or both jaws, being completely edentulous. The newly fabricated denture is to replace an&#xD;
      existing full denture. For this descriptive study, no minimum number of patients is defined,&#xD;
      but to achieve a reasonable subject number, a minimum of five (5) and a maximum of ten (10)&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled, i.e. ten to twenty (10-20) denture arches will be fabricated&#xD;
      within this study.&#xD;
