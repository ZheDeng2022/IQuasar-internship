      This study will address if red blood cells transfused to a sickle cell patient from a donor&#xD;
      with a glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme deficiency have a different lifespan&#xD;
      as measured by the percentage of red blood cells that survive post-transfusion compared to&#xD;
      red blood cells transfused to a sickle cell patient from a donor without a G6PD enzyme&#xD;
      deficiency.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This prospective, phase II, crossover, single-blind, randomized transfusion order study will&#xD;
      address if red blood cells from donors with a G6PD enzyme deficiency have a different&#xD;
      lifespan once transfused into a patient with sickle cell disease than red blood cells from an&#xD;
      otherwise normal donor. Results of this critical study will guide future research and donor&#xD;
      testing policies to ensure that patients receive the most appropriate units of blood for&#xD;
      their condition. Each patient randomized to the study will receive 2 blood transfusions, one&#xD;
      from a G6PD deficient donor and one from an otherwise normal donor. Half the patients (8)&#xD;
      will receive G6PD deficient blood first while the other half (8) will receive non-G6PD&#xD;
      deficient blood first. Patients will have a wash-out period of at least 4 months before&#xD;
      receiving the opposite type of blood transfusion. The blood transfusion order will be&#xD;
      randomized. There is currently no standard of testing in place to screen blood donations for&#xD;
      G6PD enzyme deficiency. It is believed that up to 10% of the antigen-matched donors for&#xD;
      patients with sickle cell disease are G6PD deficient, and the lifespan is unknown in the&#xD;
      sickle cell population.&#xD;
