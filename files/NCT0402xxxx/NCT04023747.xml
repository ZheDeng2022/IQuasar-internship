  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OxPLoreD is an observational cohort study to identify clinical, genomic and immunological&#xD;
      predictive markers of progression to malignant disease. Open to individuals diagnosed in the&#xD;
      last 3 years with high count MBL, Binet Stage A CLL, Immunoglobulin G/A/M (IgG, IgA, IgM)&#xD;
      MGUS, asymptomatic WM not requiring treatment and smouldering myeloma not requiring&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to monitor patients with early stage lymphoproliferative&#xD;
      disorders not meeting criteria for treatment, including early stage Chronic Lymphocytic&#xD;
      Leukaemia (CLL), Monoclonal B-cell Lymphocytosis (MBL), Monoclonal Gammopathy of Uncertain&#xD;
      Significance (MGUS), asymptomatic Waldenstroms Macroglobulinaemia (WM) and Smouldering&#xD;
      Myeloma (SM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of these disorders has a pre-cancerous phase when abnormalities can be seen in the&#xD;
      blood, however treatment may not be required. A minority of people with early stage&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative disorders will go on to need treatment for blood or bone marrow cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the investigators do not have a reliable way to predict which of these individuals&#xD;
      with these disorders are more likely to develop a blood or bone marrow cancer. By studying a&#xD;
      large group of individuals over time we hope to discover more about what factors might&#xD;
      predict progression.The investigators may be able to identify markers which identify&#xD;
      individuals who are more or less likely to develop blood or bone marrow cancer. These markers&#xD;
      might be particular symptoms, gene changes called mutations or levels of particular molecules&#xD;
      or cells in the blood or bone marrow. In the longer term this may enable us to identify those&#xD;
      people who would benefit from certain types of treatment or from receiving treatment at an&#xD;
      earlier stage and also to confidently reassure those who will never progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be studied for up to 5 years with blood, bone marrow and saliva samples taken&#xD;
      at key time-points to help answer these questions. In addition to looking for these markers&#xD;
      we will also collect information about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What it is like to live with one of these conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many people with these conditions develop other significant medical conditions, such&#xD;
           as serious infections, thrombosis (blood clots) or other types of cancer.&#xD;
