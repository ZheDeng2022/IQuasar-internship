      STUDY DESIGN: Phase I Clinical Trial The researchers set out to assess the effectiveness of&#xD;
      transdermal iontophoretic administration of Vitamin B12 (V.B12) under three different skin&#xD;
      preparatory conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING: James J. Peters Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Bronx, NY) BACKGROUND: Poor skin&#xD;
      permeability precludes the use of transdermal route from being used in common clinical&#xD;
      practice for rapid and precise administration of medications through intact skin that are&#xD;
      expected to have a systemic effect. The researchers determined the relative effectiveness of&#xD;
      an unconventional transdermal iontophoresis technique for the administration of Vitamin B12&#xD;
      (V.B12) under three different skin preparatory conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: During this study, Vitamin B12 (V.B12) was administered through the skin of&#xD;
      volunteer human research subjects. Iontophoresis was used as transdermal medication delivery&#xD;
      modality after pre-treatment of the skin in 3 different ways. The sequence of skin&#xD;
      preparations was arranged in a random order for each subject. Method 1 was called &quot;No Prep&quot;,&#xD;
      serving as the control approach; method 2 was called &quot;Oleic Acid&quot; application to the skin for&#xD;
      40 minutes; and method 3 was hair &quot;Epilation&quot; (e.g. hair removal by plucking). Fifteen&#xD;
      milligrams of aqueous solution of V.B12 was administered through intact, previously unused&#xD;
      skin of an anterior thigh during all 3 tests. Chemoluminescence, on an automated laboratory&#xD;
      reader Advia Centaur-XP, was used to determine the serum concentration of V.B12 prior to and&#xD;
      after transdermal iontophoretic delivery. All 3 experiments were performed on the same day&#xD;
      within an hour of each other. The subject's blood was drawn prior and 10 minutes after the&#xD;
      20-minute long sessions of transdermal V.B12 iontophoresis. We were able to calculate the&#xD;
      increase in serum V.B12 concentration and based on estimated blood volume, the total quantity&#xD;
      and percent dose delivered systemically.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In order to quantify the changes in skin permeability to drugs delivered by ION under three&#xD;
      different preparatory conditions, we used V.B12 as a model substance. Its choice was dictated&#xD;
      by its inherent safety, positive charge and quantification of serum concentration readily&#xD;
      available through our clinical laboratory. We compared the effects of unprepared skin (No&#xD;
      Prep), oil-soaked skin [ref. 9-12] (Oleic Acid) and skin from which hair have been plucked&#xD;
      out of (Epilation), on the serum concentrations of V.B12 before and after administration via&#xD;
      ION.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Veterans and non-Veterans without SCI were recruited for the study comparing the three skin&#xD;
      preparation methods. This prospective, skin preparatory method sequence-randomized study was&#xD;
      approved by the Institutional Review Board of the James J. Peters VA Medical Center&#xD;
      (JJPVAMC). The ION equipment used was a standard FDA-approved wired ION controller unit (IBOX&#xD;
      by Dynatronics) and 4mL ION electrodes by (ionto+ by Richmar). The skin was prepared using 1&#xD;
      of the 3 techniques, performed in a random order. Each subject was assigned a 2-digit&#xD;
      sequential number. A random-numbers table was used to assign the sequence of methods to each&#xD;
      subject. A single positive electrode patch containing 4mL of a water-based solution with 15mg&#xD;
      of V.B12 was used per experiment. One negative electrode patch was also used to complete the&#xD;
      circuit. Blood was drawn prior to the first administration. Thirty minutes after the start of&#xD;
      the ION delivery of the V.B12 through the skin of anterior thigh, the blood was drawn again.&#xD;
      The blood was centrifuged for 5 minutes and delivered to the clinical laboratory for testing&#xD;
      without delay. Serum concentration of V.B12 was measured using chemoluminescence on an&#xD;
      automated laboratory reader Advia Centaur-XP. The experiments were conducted sequentially in&#xD;
      a timely fashion, performed on the same day and within a span of 3 hours. Blood was drawn for&#xD;
      a total of 4 times per subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;No Prep&quot; technique was performed by simply wiping the two skin surfaces on an anterior&#xD;
      thigh, where the electrodes were later attached, with two-70% isopropyl alcohol prep. pads.&#xD;
      The skin surface destined for positive electrode application was sprayed with a thin layer of&#xD;
      20% Benzocaine (Americaine aerosol spray can) and covered with an occlusive plastic film for&#xD;
      10 minutes. The film was then removed and the skin was cleansed with water-moistened paper&#xD;
      towel, followed by one alcohol prep. pad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Oleic Acid&quot; technique involved first wiping the two skin patches and later soaking the&#xD;
      skin patch, where the positive electrode was going to be placed, with oil called oleic acid&#xD;
      for 40 minutes. The oil was then wiped off with a paper napkin and an alcohol pad. That same&#xD;
      skin area was sprayed with a thin layer of 20% Benzocaine (Americaine aerosol spray&#xD;
      container) and covered with an occlusive plastic film for 10 minutes. The film was then&#xD;
      removed and the skin was cleansed with water-moistened paper towel, followed by one alcohol&#xD;
      prep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Hair Epilation&quot; technique involved first wiping the two skin patches with 2-70%&#xD;
      isopropyl alcohol skin preps and sprayed with a thin layer of 20% Benzocaine (Americaine&#xD;
      aerosol spray container) and covered with an occlusive plastic film for 10 minutes. The film&#xD;
      was removed and the skin was cleansed with de-ionized water followed by alcohol prep. Hair&#xD;
      removal, using an epilator machine (Remington EP 7030), was performed by clearing an area of&#xD;
      5x5cm or 2x2 inch square. The epilated area was then covered with a thin layer of 0.2% Sodium&#xD;
      Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) in de-ionized water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each of the skin preparations and without delay, 15mg of methylcobalamin dissolved in&#xD;
      4mL of de-ionized water soaked into the anode patch reservoir was applied to the designated&#xD;
      skin of the proximal anterior thighs. The 7x7cm skin area under the negative electrode was&#xD;
      wiped with an alcohol pad and 0.5mL of 1% citric acid dissolved in 0.9% normal saline&#xD;
      solution was applied to the negative electrode's skin contact surface. The return (negative)&#xD;
      electrode was then attached to the skin 10cm from the positive electrode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An elevated room temperature of 73-78 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius) was maintained&#xD;
      in the room for the purposes of maintaining adequate blood flow in the peripheral dermal&#xD;
      capillaries. No exclusion criteria for diseases that decrease capillary perfusion such as&#xD;
      diabetes have been utilized. As a result, 2 of the 10 subjects who participated in this study&#xD;
      had a diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus type 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBOX ION device was attached to the electrodes by way of wire leads and a multimeter was&#xD;
      attached to the electrodes in parallel in order to record the skin's electrical resistivity&#xD;
      prior to and after ION. Throughout the 20-minute ION session, voltage exerted by the IBOX was&#xD;
      recorded at regular intervals. The voltage was automatically adjusted by the IBOX to deliver&#xD;
      a pre-set constant electrical current of 4mA/minute. Throughout the procedure subjects were&#xD;
      asked about the presence of any sensations associated with the ION including effects of the&#xD;
      medication being administered.&#xD;
