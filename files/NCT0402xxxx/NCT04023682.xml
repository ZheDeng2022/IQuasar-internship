  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether Provodine, an FDA approved product, provides&#xD;
      long-lasting protection on the hands of staff who provide anesthesia for patients. If this&#xD;
      product does provide long-lasting protection, it could be used for hand hygiene in the&#xD;
      operating room and it could help prevent infections after operations. Fifteen anesthesia&#xD;
      providers (15 main operating room [MOR] and 5 ambulatory surgery center [ASC]) who agree to&#xD;
      participate will participate in the pre-intervention and intervention periods. During the&#xD;
      pre-intervention or baseline period, the investigators will do bag broth cultures of&#xD;
      anesthesia providers' hands just before the start of their first case of the day . The&#xD;
      participants will then rinse and dry their hands to remove the culture medium. The&#xD;
      investigators will also obtain cultures after the first case of the day, and after the second&#xD;
      case. During the intervention period (ProvodineTM; usual hand hygiene practice), the&#xD;
      investigators obtain hand cultures from the same anesthesia providers at the beginning of the&#xD;
      day. The participants will then then do a hand scrub with ProvodineTM. The investigators will&#xD;
      obtain a second hand culture at this point and participants will rinse and dry their hands to&#xD;
      remove the culture medium and then apply a small amount of ProvodineTM as a hand rub. The&#xD;
      investigators will obtain cultures after the first case of the day, and after the second case&#xD;
      of the day. If participants are still providing anesthesia to their second case 6 hours after&#xD;
      they applied ProvodineTM, the participants will apply a small of ProvodineTM amount as a hand&#xD;
      rub at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For anesthesia providers in the ASC, the investigators will use the same protocol with the&#xD;
      following exception. Because cases are likely to be shorter, the investigators will obtain&#xD;
      the final cultures after the last case of the day or after the case that ends closest to 6&#xD;
      hours after ProvodineTM was applied in the morning.&#xD;

      During the pre-intervention or baseline period, the investigators will do bag broth cultures&#xD;
      of anesthesia providers' hands just before the start of their first case of the day (n =25).&#xD;
      The participants will then rinse and dry their hands to remove the culture medium. The&#xD;
      investigators will also obtain cultures after the first case of the day (n = 25), and after&#xD;
      the second case (n = 25). During the intervention period (ProvodineTM; usual hand hygiene&#xD;
      practice), the investigators obtain hand cultures from the same anesthesia providers at the&#xD;
      beginning of the day (n =25). The participants will then then do a hand scrub with&#xD;
      ProvodineTM. The investigators will obtain a second hand culture at this point and&#xD;
      participants will rinse and dry their hands to remove the culture medium and then apply a&#xD;
      small amount of ProvodineTM as a hand rub (n =25). The investigators will obtain cultures&#xD;
      after the first case of the day (n = 25), and after the second case of the day (n = 25). If&#xD;
      participants are still providing anesthesia to their second case 6 hours after they applied&#xD;
      ProvodineTM, the participants will apply a small of ProvodineTM amount as a hand rub at this&#xD;
      time. For anesthesia providers in the ASC, the investigators will use the same protocol with&#xD;
      the following exception. Because cases are likely to be shorter, the investigators will&#xD;
      obtain the final cultures after the last case of the day or after the case that ends closest&#xD;
      to 6 hours after ProvodineTM was applied in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study procedures will occur on two different work days for the participants: one for the&#xD;
      control day and one for the intervention day. The study procedures will be done by the end of&#xD;
      these two working days. There is no long-term followup.&#xD;
