  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is a noninvasive local therapy with proven&#xD;
      efficacy in a number of solid tumor types. However, colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases&#xD;
      have been shown to be particularly resistant to SBRT, and often are found to have&#xD;
      significantly worse rates of control compared with other histologies. Higher SBRT dose was&#xD;
      recently shown to improve local control in CRC pulmonary metastases, however, increasing dose&#xD;
      delivery with SBRT has been limited based on the risk of toxicity to adjacent structures, and&#xD;
      the ability to visualize them during treatment. This is particularly relevant in treating&#xD;
      liver tumors, as tumor and small bowel movement can often make tumor targeting and&#xD;
      organs-at-risk (OAR) avoidance especially difficult. MRI-guided SBRT for liver tumors is both&#xD;
      safe and feasible and offers an as yet unprecedented opportunity to achieve the highest&#xD;
      possible safe dose to liver tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to identify a safe maximum tolerated dose level for MRI-guided&#xD;
      SBRT treatment of bowel and liver metastases, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be on study for up to 12 months.&#xD;
