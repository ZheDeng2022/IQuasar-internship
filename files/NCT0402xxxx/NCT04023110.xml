  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of a risk-guided&#xD;
      cardioprotective treatment strategy with carvedilol, as compared to usual care, in breast&#xD;
      cancer patients undergoing treatment with doxorubicin, trastuzumab, or the combination.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized clinical trial that seeks to determine if a risk guided&#xD;
      treatment strategy that initiates carvedilol in high risk breast cancer patients prior to&#xD;
      doxorubicin and/or trastuzumab is safe, tolerable, and feasible. Subjects who are identified&#xD;
      as having elevated CTX Risk by an internally validated clinical risk score (exceeding a&#xD;
      pre-specified risk threshold) will be randomized to individually-dosed, open-label carvedilol&#xD;
      or usual care. Investigators will use a stratified randomization according to trastuzumab&#xD;
      therapy (yes/no) to ensure balance across treatment regimen. Clinical, echocardiographic, and&#xD;
      biomarker data will be collected on all patients at baseline and standardized time intervals&#xD;
      during and after therapy at approximately 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months.&#xD;
