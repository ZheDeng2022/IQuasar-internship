  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of Stage 1 is to evaluate the safety of nivolumab consolidation after&#xD;
      completion of HD-MTX containing induction chemotherapy in older subjects with PCNSL in terms&#xD;
      of a tolerated dose (based on dose-limiting toxicities) for the expansion phase of the study&#xD;
      (Stage 2).The primary objective of Stage 2 is to evaluate the efficacy of nivolumab&#xD;
      consolidation after completion of HD-MTX containing induction chemotherapy in terms of the&#xD;
      2-year progression-free survival rate and compare to relevant historical controls&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-stage phase 1B study of nivolumab consolidation following completion of HD-MTX&#xD;
      containing induction chemotherapy in older (≥ 65 years old) patients with previously&#xD;
      untreated primary CNS lymphoma. Stage 1 is designed to evaluate the safety of nivolumab&#xD;
      consolidation. We plan to use 3+3 design and start at the FDA approved single agent dose of&#xD;
      nivolumab 480 mg intravenously every 4 weeks. Stage 2 is designed to evaluate the safety as&#xD;
      well as efficacy of nivolumab consolidation after HD-MTX containing induction chemotherapy in&#xD;
      an expansion cohort.&#xD;

             3.0 g/m^2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Recovered from all reversible acute toxic effects of prior therapy (other than&#xD;
             alopecia) to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Measurable disease at the time of diagnosis (i.e. prior to pre-study HD-MTX containing&#xD;
             induction chemotherapy) including lesions that can be accurately measured in 2&#xD;
             dimensions by CT or MRI of brain and with a greatest transverse diameter of ≥ 1 cm.&#xD;
             The following disease assessments must have been obtained prior to initiation of&#xD;
             pre-study HD-MTX containing induction chemotherapy: MRI of the brain with contrast&#xD;
             (and spine with contrast if indicated)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Deemed poor candidate for whole brain irradiation (WBI) or autologous stem cell&#xD;
             transplant (ASCT) due to advanced age, ECOG performance status of 2, or in the opinion&#xD;

&#xD;
               7. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: since subjects are not enrolled until study treatment is initiated, any labs&#xD;
             drawn prior to initiating study treatment on Cycle 1 Day 1 need to meet eligibility&#xD;
             criteria since the subject will still be in screening at the time of the lab draw.&#xD;

         11. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 3 days prior to day 1 of treatment. NOTE: Females are considered of child&#xD;
             bearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy,&#xD;
             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are postmenopausal (at least&#xD;
             12 consecutive months with no menses without an alternative medical cause).&#xD;

             with low user dependency are preferable but not required.&#xD;
