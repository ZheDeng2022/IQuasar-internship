  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polyganics BV (Groningen, The Netherlands), in close collaboration with University&#xD;
      Hospital-Eppendorf (UKE) Hamburg, has developed the Sealing Device for use in&#xD;
      hepato-pancreato-bilary (HPB) surgery to reduce leakage of fluids from the site of surgery&#xD;
      into the abdominal cavity and as an adjunctive hemostatic device to control minimal to&#xD;
      moderate bleeding at the surgical site. The Sealing Device has been challenged in&#xD;
      pre-clinical testing (laboratory and in-vivo work), but has not been evaluated for safety and&#xD;
      performance in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation will be conducted to clinically assess the safety and performance of&#xD;
      Sealing Device as a means to reduce bile and pancreatic juice leakage in&#xD;
      hepato-pancreato-bilary (HPB) surgery. Secondarily, the control of minimal to moderate&#xD;
      bleeding will be assessed. To achieve adequate representation of the primary objective, the&#xD;
      study will contain two separate surgical patient groups: Liver and Pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate safety and performance in reducing&#xD;
      intra- and post-operative leakage (bile and pancreatic juices) by using the Sealing Device in&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective hepatic resection or distal pancreatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study with a 16 months&#xD;
      follow up. Up to 80 patients (40 liver and 40 pancreas patients) will be enrolled at up to 7&#xD;
      sites in Europe.&#xD;
