      The primary purpose of this project is to evaluate the safety of a laryngeal pacemaker device&#xD;
      to provide a new treatment termed bilateral laryngeal pacing for the treatment of bilateral&#xD;
      vocal fold paralysis (BVFP) (Aim 1). Outcome measures related to voice and ventilation will&#xD;
      also provide initial insights into the efficacy of bilateral (Aim 2) and unilateral (Aim 3)&#xD;
      stimulation of the implanted device for the treatment of BVFP.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances in medicine, rehabilitation of the paralyzed larynx remains a complex&#xD;
      clinical problem. Based on national health statistics, it is anticipated approximately 7,000&#xD;
      patients will be diagnosed with BVFP in the United States each year. BVFP is a serious and&#xD;
      often life-threatening clinical condition. The recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) carries motor&#xD;
      fibers that innervate both the abductor muscle (posterior cricoarytenoid muscle) and adductor&#xD;
      muscles of the vocal folds. Damage to the nerve compromises both of these functions and&#xD;
      arrests the vocal folds in a near-closed position. With BVFP, voice tends to be functional,&#xD;
      but airway compromise is often severe enough to warrant tracheotomy to relieve inspiratory&#xD;
      stridor and dyspnea. If spontaneous recovery does not occur within one year, it is likely&#xD;
      that the patient's vocal folds will be chronically paralyzed. In such instances, long-term&#xD;
      tracheostomy can be considered. Unfortunately, permanent tracheostomy is associated with&#xD;
      complications such as tracheal stenosis, chronic infection, and psycho-social impairment. For&#xD;
      this reason, laryngeal surgery is usually recommended to enlarge the airway and restore&#xD;
      breathing through the mouth. Procedures such as arytenoidectomy, cordotomy, or repeated Botox&#xD;
      injections, regarded as the standard of care for enlarging the airway, also have inherent&#xD;
      complications. Specifically, they impair voice and compromise airway protection during&#xD;
      swallowing. The limitations associated with these current treatments have prompted&#xD;
      investigation into a more physiologic, dynamic approach to rehabilitation: reanimation of the&#xD;
      paralyzed PCA muscle by functional electrical stimulation (FES). Ideally, stimulation should&#xD;
      be applied during the inspiratory phase of respiration to abduct the vocal folds. This has&#xD;
      been termed &quot;laryngeal pacing&quot;. During non-inspiratory phases, stimulation would cease, and&#xD;
      the vocal folds would passively relax to the midline to allow for normal voice production and&#xD;
      airway protection. Previously, our clinical trial of unilateral pacing demonstrated a&#xD;
      significantly greater return of ventilation without any compromise of voice or swallowing.&#xD;
      However, the level of ventilation was only marginally better than that associated with&#xD;
      cordotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current project, we will investigate the safety of a novel intervention (laryngeal&#xD;
      pacing) for BVFP (Aim 1). The overarching hypothesis is that neuromuscular activation of the&#xD;
      PCA muscles bilaterally reestablishes bilateral glottal opening and ventilation through the&#xD;
      mouth without alteration of voice or swallowing, compared to a sham-operated control (Aim 2).&#xD;
      The ventilation from bilateral pacing should be significantly greater than from unilateral&#xD;
      pacing and allow the patient to engage in a normal pre-paralysis activity level (Aim 3).&#xD;

PIF: One member of the research staff will be unblinded and control the pacer programmer. The testing condition will be programmed prior to start of test. Both patient and staff administering the test will be blinded to testing condition.&#xD;
CAPE-V: Clinically-certified SLPs involved in perceptual ratings of voice quality will be blinded to experimental testing condition and data collection timepoint.&#xD;
NGA: NGA is analyzed from stills of the glottis collected during endoscopy. These images will be randomized and de-identified before analysis to blind the rater.&#xD;
X-Tol: One member of the research staff will be unblinded and control the pacer programmer. The testing condition will be programmed prior to start of test. Both patient and staff administering the test will be blinded to testing condition.&#xD;
