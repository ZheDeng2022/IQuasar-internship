      Biomedical implant metals are reactive when in contact with body fluids. Some reactions may&#xD;
      adverse the biocompatibility character of the material and should be studied. This can be&#xD;
      achieved by direct measurement through electrochemical, gravimetric, spectrophotometric and&#xD;
      surface analysis of reaction occurring at the interface between functionalized metal samples&#xD;
      and body fluids (synovia) directly extracted from patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general aim of this project is to contribute to develop a comprehensive vision of&#xD;
      interfacial reactions occurring on biomedical alloy surfaces exposed to human synovial fluid&#xD;
      and to link them to clinical data&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most widely used biomedical materials are polymeric, ceramics and metals. Among these&#xD;
      materials, metals exhibit a unique combination of mechanical strength, toughness, wear&#xD;
      resistance and forming easiness. Metals are chemically reactive when in contact with body&#xD;
      fluids. While some of the reactions are welcome, such as the surface oxidation providing&#xD;
      corrosion protection, other reactions may adverse the biocompatibility character of the&#xD;
      material.The understanding of these reactions is the object of several studies. Corrosion&#xD;
      scientists try to characterise the corrosion response of metals when in contact with&#xD;
      simulated body fluids in order to verify the occurrence of hypothetical mechanisms.&#xD;
      Biologists look at specific reaction products expected to be released by cells when set in&#xD;
      contact with structured or functionalized surfaces. These approaches are necessary but also&#xD;
      time consuming due to the complexity of possible reaction mechanisms. As complement to these&#xD;
      deductive approaches we propose here an inductive one based on direct measurement through&#xD;
      electrochemical, gravimetric, spectrophotometric and surface analysis of reaction occurring&#xD;
      at the interface between functionalized metal samples and body fluids (synovia) directly&#xD;
      extracted from patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general aim of this project is to contribute to develop a comprehensive vision of&#xD;
      interfacial reactions occurring on biomedical alloy surfaces exposed to human synovial fluid&#xD;
      and to link them to clinical data. This will be achieved through a collaboration between&#xD;
      surgeons and corrosion scientists. The synovial fluid will be extracted form patients using&#xD;
      an established procedure and transferred to a portable sterile corrosion laboratory located&#xD;
      close to the surgery room. There, surface reaction will be characterized using&#xD;
      electrochemical methods already successfully applied in recent studies carried out by the&#xD;
      same team. We will be integrating in-situ quartz crystal microgravimetry and in-situ Raman&#xD;
      spectroscopy as well as ex-situ methods. Further, metal surfaces will be chemically&#xD;
      functionalized (wettability, oxidation, surface charge) in order to selectively influence&#xD;
      specific reactions of body fluid components (i.e. adsorption depends on surface energy and&#xD;
      wettability while Redox reactions are influenced by the oxidation state of the surface. The&#xD;
      acquired information will be compared to the clinical state of the patient in order to&#xD;
      establish possible correlations between interface reactivity and patient state.&#xD;
