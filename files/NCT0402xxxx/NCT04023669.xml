    <textblock>
      SJELIOT is a phase 1 trial that aims to explore the combination of prexasertib with&#xD;
      established DNA-damaging agents used in medulloblastoma to evaluate tolerance and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics in recurrent or refractory disease. Additionally, a small expansion cohort&#xD;
      will be incorporated into the trial at the combination MTD/RP2D (maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose/recommended phase two dose) to detect a preliminary efficacy signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum A: Prexasertib and Cyclophosphamide&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability and estimate the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
           (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of combination treatment with prexasertib and&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide in participants with recurrent/refractory Group 3 and Group 4&#xD;
           medulloblastoma and recurrent/refractory sonic hedgehog (SHH) medulloblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of prexasertib in combination with&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the rate and duration of objective response and progression free survival&#xD;
           (PFS) associated with prexasertib and cyclophosphamide treatment in this patient&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide and metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum B: Prexasertib and Gemcitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability and estimate the MTD/RP2D of combination&#xD;
           treatment with prexasertib and gemcitabine in participants with recurrent/refractory&#xD;
           Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of prexasertib in combination with gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the rate and duration of objective response and PFS associated with&#xD;
           prexasertib and gemcitabine treatment in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Participants will be stratified by the biological characteristics of their tumor to one of&#xD;
      two treatment strata:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATUM A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combination Treatment: prexasertib and cyclophosphamide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient population: Participants with recurrent/refractory Group 3 and Group 4 (G3/G4)&#xD;
           medulloblastoma, recurrent/refractory sonic hedgehog (SHH) medulloblastoma and&#xD;
           medulloblastoma participants with Indeterminate molecular subgroup&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATUM B&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combination Treatment: prexasertib and gemcitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient population: Participants with recurrent/refractory Group 3 and Group 4&#xD;
           medulloblastoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a diagnosis of G3/G4 medulloblastoma who qualify for both treatment strata&#xD;
      will be assigned per slot availability as well as institutional PI preference. If slots are&#xD;
      available in both stratum A and stratum B, patients will be assigned to the dose level&#xD;
      nearest completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rolling 6 design will be used separately in each stratum to estimate the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase two dose (RP2D). Therapy will be administered in&#xD;
      cycles of 28 days and may be continued for up to 24 months (26 cycles) in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive doublet therapy in cycles of 28 days. The dose-limiting toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT)-evaluation period will consist of the first cycle until day 1 criteria of cycle 2 has&#xD;
      been met. Participants will be evaluated at least once a week during the DLT-evaluation&#xD;
      period and at regular intervals thereafter. Standard tests (i.e. physical exams, blood tests,&#xD;
      and disease evaluations) will be undertaken at regular intervals. Research-associated&#xD;
      evaluations (i.e. pharmacokinetic studies, etc.) will also be carried out during therapy.&#xD;
      Treatment may be continued for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is empirically defined as the highest dose level at which six patients have been treated with at most one patient experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the next higher dose level has been determined to be too toxic. The MTD estimate will not be available if the lowest dose level studied is too toxic or the highest dose level studied is considered safe. In the latter case, the highest studied safe dose may be considered as the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The MTD estimation will be limited to evaluable patients and toxicity assessments from course 1 (28 days).</description>
