    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will first aim to test the safety of PS101-mediated Acoustic Cluster&#xD;
      Therapy (ACT) in any patient with hepatic metastases in order to identify the recommended&#xD;
      dose and schedule that can be taken forward in combination with standard of care&#xD;
      chemotherapy, as well as standardising the ultrasound administration and imaging&#xD;
      requirements. Following this an expansion part in patients with hepatic metastases from&#xD;
      colorectal cancer will be started to test for evidence of ACT efficacy. Based on the emerging&#xD;
      data from these patients, if indicated, a cohort of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)&#xD;
      patients with hepatic metastases will be enrolled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The suboptimal delivery of an anticancer agent to the target cancer cells represent a&#xD;
      significant problem in many solid tumours, as it compromises the effectiveness of established&#xD;
      therapeutics. If the amount of drug that reached any tumour could be increased without&#xD;
      changing the amount administered systemically, it should be possible to increase the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the treatment without adding to systemic toxicity. Acoustic Cluster Therapy&#xD;
      (ACT) can potentially increase the uptake of an anticancer agent over the US targeted area.&#xD;
      The preclinical development of PS101 mediated ACT suggests that this therapy may be of&#xD;
      meaningful benefit while significant additional toxicity is not anticipated.&#xD;
