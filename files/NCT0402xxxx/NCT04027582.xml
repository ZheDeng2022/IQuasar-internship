    <textblock>
      Thirty residents in Anesthesia, year one and year two ,and Emergency Medicine Residents, and&#xD;
      Family Practice Anesthetists and Emergency residents will undergo teaching in fiber-optic&#xD;
      intubation. One half of the group will be randomized to a low fidelity simulator which&#xD;
      consists of a wooden block with a series of holes, and the other to a high fidelity&#xD;
      simulator, called the ORSIM , which provides a computerised model of the airway. They will&#xD;
      practice the procedural skill of fiber-optic intubation on their assigned simulators.&#xD;
      Cumulative sum method (CUSUM) learning curves and procedural Entrusted Professional&#xD;
      Activities will be obtained for each resident on their assigned simulator. Following this ,&#xD;
      all residents will undergo a procedural entrusted professional activity with regard to&#xD;
      fiber-optic intubation on a low risk , consented patient. The results of the learning curves,&#xD;
      Simulator entrusted professional activity and Patient entrusted professional activity will be&#xD;
      compared to assess if there is a difference between the low fidelity and high fidelity&#xD;
      simulator groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fiber-optic intubation(FOI) involves using a thin flexible scope to navigate a breathing tube&#xD;
      into a patient's trachea. It is an important skill, as it is required in situations where the&#xD;
      breathing tube cannot be inserted using traditional methods. It is a lifesaving skill in&#xD;
      terms of securing the 'the difficult airway', in emergency and elective situations. The&#xD;
      National Audit Project 4 (NAP4, the largest study on major airway complications in the&#xD;
      operating room, emergency department and intensive care unit) have identified the omission of&#xD;
      FOI when indicated as a major contributor to airway morbidity and mortality . Recommendations&#xD;
      from NAP4 included ensuring anesthesiologists are trained in the use of FOI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical training in Canada and globally is undergoing a major transformation to&#xD;
      competency-based medical education (CBME). Within the next decade, all residency programs in&#xD;
      Canada will be following a competency-based curriculum, as mandated by the Royal College of&#xD;
      Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (Royal College) and the College of Family Physicians of&#xD;
      Canada. CBME emphasizes the demonstration of competence in skills and abilities deemed&#xD;
      essential for future practice and de-emphasizes time and duration .&#xD;
&#xD;
      While competence is assessed by several metrics in CBME, the entrustable professional&#xD;
      activities (EPAs)framework is one approach to assessment. EPAs are specific tasks in the&#xD;
      clinical environment that a supervisor will delegate to a resident once sufficient competence&#xD;
      has been demonstrated .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Competency-based medical education(CBME) requires residents to demonstrate competency in key&#xD;
      skills; simulators have an important role in facilitating this learning in a safe environment&#xD;
      without harming patients. Currently, little is known on the role of simulators on acquiring&#xD;
      competence of Fiber-optic intubation and assessment of simulator-based Entrusted Professional&#xD;
      Activity (EPA) and transfer-ability to patient -based EPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus of the study is the learning aspect with regards to fiber-optic intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that simulator-based EPA is transferable to clinical-based EPA and that&#xD;
      clinical performance is better after training with a high -fidelity simulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 2-arm comparison study to be conducted at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After written informed consent, resident participants will be randomized to the low fidelity&#xD;
      simulator (LFS n=15) and the high- fidelity simulator (ORSIM, n=15). Participants consist of&#xD;
      anesthesia 1st - 2nd year residents in the Competency-based Medical Education Anesthesia&#xD;
      Residency program, Emergency Medicine Residents, Family Practice Anesthetists and Emergency&#xD;
      Medicine Residents, with less than five prior experiences in fiberoptic intubations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resident will undergo a teaching intervention consisting of a didactic Power-point&#xD;
      presentation and video on FOI, {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDLrRHS7Urw}, followed with&#xD;
      hands-on practice on the LFS or ORSIM. The didactic teaching will be group based, but the&#xD;
      hands-on simulator practice will be one to one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generating Learning Curve (CUSUM) for Competence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the teaching session, the resident participant will generate a learning curve for a&#xD;
      series of fiberoptic intubations on the respective simulator using the cumulative sum method&#xD;
      (CUSUM).The resident will be allowed 20 attempts. Residents will be considered&#xD;
      simulator-competent if they reach 90% success rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulator-based Entrusted Professional Activity (EPA) Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within one week later the resident will be assessed to complete an EPA on fiber-optic&#xD;
      intubation using their assigned simulator. Each performance will be video-recorded for data&#xD;
      analysis by the research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfer to Clinical-based EPA Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter and within two weeks, the resident will then perform a fiber-optic intubation on&#xD;
      an anesthetized patient in the Operating Room. The fiberoptic intubation on a patient will be&#xD;
      limited to a maximum of 8 minutes since this is the apnea time where desaturation (hypoxia)&#xD;
      will occur in a patient induced with general anesthesia and muscle paralysis who underwent&#xD;
      adequate pre-oxygenation. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained from each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performance of the Simulator based EPA and clinical EPA will be video-recorded. No&#xD;
      patient or resident identifiers will be recorded, the patient's eyes will be covered with a&#xD;
      surgical green towel, leaving the mouth and nose exposed to bag mas ventilate, the camera&#xD;
      will focus on the resident's hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two experienced observers will grade the intubations using a validated checklist and global&#xD;
      rating scale. They will be blinded to the group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An experienced anesthetist not involved in the study will be present in the operating room to&#xD;
      assist the resident and take over the intubation if they deem necessary for patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total time commitment for the resident will be a maximum of 2 hours.&#xD;
