  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heavy and oncological surgery is undergoing a major evolution. Some surgical dogmas are&#xD;
      falling and care is better rationalized. The interactions between the patient and the&#xD;
      caregivers on the other hand, and from the caregiver to the caregiver are favored. Thus was&#xD;
      born, about 10 years ago, the principle of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      But recovery has improved in the patient in the best possible shape in the operating room,&#xD;
      and, during the gesture, minimize the negative effects of surgery and anesthesia. Finally,&#xD;
      postoperatively, to re-empower the patient as quickly as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest of this study is the benefit of the quality of life of the patient being treated&#xD;
      for cystectomy as part of an enhanced recovery program. This is to argue the diffusion of&#xD;
      this program and the care teams for its realization.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>An overall quality of life questionnaire adapted to each pathology, on a five-level Likert scale, will make it possible to estimate the percentage of patients whose quality of life will be &quot;good or very good&quot;.&#xD;
The quality of life will be estimated globally through repeated measurements at each visit. It will be considered that if more than 80% of the answers are &quot;good or very good&quot;, the quality of life variable will be &quot;good or very good&quot;.</description>
