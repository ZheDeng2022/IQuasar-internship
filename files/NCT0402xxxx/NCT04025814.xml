  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop, refine and preliminarily test a novel and scalable digital health&#xD;
      solution designed to address parent adherence barriers in daily life contexts and increase&#xD;
      parent's sustained use of evidence-based parenting strategies.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes the following 3 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Discovery phase: During the Discovery phase, we will conduct 1-hour focus groups at&#xD;
           school sites with parents (N=8) and school mental health providers (N=4), who are&#xD;
           considered major stakeholders and potential users of the dHealth tool. The purpose of&#xD;
           these groups is to obtain feedback and guidance on features and procedures in order to&#xD;
           maximize the usability and feasibility of the dHealth tool. This design includes&#xD;
           participants who have completed a parenting skills treatment (CLS) and thus would be&#xD;
           better informed to comment on needs for the augmented treatment. Stakeholders will be&#xD;
           queried about their preferences regarding the application layout, tools, content, and&#xD;
           features (e.g., reminders, badges). Recorded focus group sessions will be transcribed&#xD;
           and coded for themes related to usability and feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Design and Build phases: Feedback from the discovery phase will be incorporated into the&#xD;
           design and build phases, during which time prototypes will be put through proof of&#xD;
           concept testing with parents and school clinicians who had participated in the discovery&#xD;
           phase. Qualitative data will be collected at 2 time points during the design and build&#xD;
           phases. Quantitative data will be gathered using the System Usability Scale (SUS) for&#xD;
           each component prototype (e.g., description of skill, video examples, interactive&#xD;
           activities). A fully functioning application will be completed at the end of the build&#xD;
           phase and ready for the test phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test Phase: The test phase is a 2-month pilot open trial of the dHealth tool with&#xD;
           parents. We will provide the dHealth tool to parents who participated in the prior&#xD;
           phases (N=8) as well as a new sample of parents who will have just completed CLS but who&#xD;
           did not participate in the prior phases (N=8). Inclusion of these latter parents will&#xD;
           allow for an assessment of the generalizability of the tool components to a new group of&#xD;
           parents right after they complete in-person treatment. Parents will use their own device&#xD;
           or will be provided with a study tablet. Parents will be advised to use the tool daily&#xD;
           to record parenting strategy use and to access information/training as needed.&#xD;
           Qualitative semi-structured interviews during and after the trial will assess reactions&#xD;
           to the platform (usability, feasibility, acceptability) to inform refinements and&#xD;
           identify barriers and facilitators relating to use. Primary outcomes focus on usage&#xD;
           metrics with the tool (e.g., frequency of use, module and activity completion, time,&#xD;
           repeat activity), reported daily parenting skills use on the tool, and measures of&#xD;
           feasibility and acceptability. Application usage analytics will be collected by the&#xD;
           mobile application, providing objective descriptives including how often and for how&#xD;
           long individuals access the application and each component, as well as how users&#xD;
           navigate through the application. This data will be analyzed for patterns associated&#xD;
           with tool satisfaction ratings, feasibility, and acceptability ratings and reported&#xD;
           skill utilization. Secondary outcomes of parent knowledge, motivation and confidence in&#xD;
           using EBT skills; parenting practices, ADHD symptoms and functional outcomes will be&#xD;
           assessed before and after tool usage.&#xD;
