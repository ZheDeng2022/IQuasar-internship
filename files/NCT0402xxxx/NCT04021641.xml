      INTRODUCTION: Speech recognition in noise is an important aspect of human communication.&#xD;
      One's speech recognition ability in noise is inevitably affected by any hearing impairment,&#xD;
      and may only be quantified with specific language at an appropriate difficulty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a niche among clinically available test materials between word recognition and 10-&#xD;
      syllable sentence recognition in noise in Cantonese Chinese. Ten-syllable sentence items are&#xD;
      commented to be too challenging to young children and elderly population. An assessment tool&#xD;
      for pediatric patients, and the whole spectrum of patients with significant hearing&#xD;
      impairment, compromised language or cognitive abilities, is deemed necessary. Both the&#xD;
      research and clinical audiology communities need a valid and reliable outcome measurement&#xD;
      tool for sentence recognition abilities in noise of the specific population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open-set sentence speech recognition in noise test in Cantonese Chinese, which is&#xD;
      applicable on children and adults with hearing impairment, is proposed to be developed in&#xD;
      this project to bridge the gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Thirty three participants with typical hearing, from each of the 5 age groups from&#xD;
      their 6 years of age to adulthood, will be recruited to contribute to the normative data of&#xD;
      the proposed test. One hundred participants with various degree of hearing impairment will be&#xD;
      recruited for the validation of the proposed new test as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sentence pool of at least 150 sentence items will be constructed based on the basic&#xD;
      sentence syntax in Cantonese Chinese. Each sentence item will be 7 syllables in length on&#xD;
      average. The words used in the sentences will be words frequently used in daily life by both&#xD;
      persons with typical hearing and hearing impairment. A 4-talker babble in Cantonese Chinese&#xD;
      will be generated as the competing noise in this proposed new test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES: By Rasch modelling, sentence items with high probability of consistently and&#xD;
      accurately estimating sentence recognition ability in noise across different participants&#xD;
      will be selected and distributed to a few parallel lists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rater and test-retest reliability of the test items and lists will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content-related and construct-related evidence of validity of lists will also be supported by&#xD;
      psychometric analyses as well as expert consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APPLICATION: A valid and reliable assessment tool, of sentence recognition ability in noise&#xD;
      in Cantonese, applicable to persons with hearing sensitivity ranging from profound impairment&#xD;
      to typical, in both the research and clinical audiology fields, will be constructed.&#xD;
