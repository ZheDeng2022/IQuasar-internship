      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      intervention on the distribution and variability of pain level before and after intervention&#xD;
      receipt among people with co-occurring chronic pain and Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) over a&#xD;
      three-month follow-up period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project is an open trial of the CBT intervention for 20 adults receiving detoxification&#xD;
      treatment with comorbid pain. Participants will be screened for pain and other conditions by&#xD;
      completing a self-report survey questionnaire. Eligible participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a baseline assessment. A trained research therapist will conduct individual therapy&#xD;
      with participants twice a week for 2-4 weeks. Participants will be re-assessed at 1- and&#xD;
      3-month post-intervention follow-ups to track changes in their pain, functioning, and&#xD;
      substance use.&#xD;
