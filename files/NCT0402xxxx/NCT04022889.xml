  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that INTERCEPT Platelets in 100%&#xD;
      plasma stored for 5 or more days (up to 7 days) after apheresis collection retain sufficient&#xD;
      viability for therapeutic transfusion efficacy. The post infusion recovery and survival of&#xD;
      radiolabeled 7, 6 or 5- day INTERCEPT platelets (Test) stored in 100% plasma will be measured&#xD;
      in comparison to their &quot;fresh&quot; radiolabeled platelet (Control) according to FDA guidance for&#xD;
      platelet testing (FDA 1999).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will consist of healthy subjects who meet the FDA, AABB, and&#xD;
      site-specific research donor eligibility criteria for an apheresis platelet collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apheresis platelets (single or double) will be collected in 100% plasma on the Trima Accel®&#xD;
      Automated Blood Collection system. Each study apheresis collection will be processed using&#xD;
      the INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets; apheresis platelets containing a platelet dose of&#xD;
      3.0 to 7.9 x10e11 platelets in 300 to 420 mL of plasma will be processed using the INTERCEPT&#xD;
      Dual Storage (DS) processing set. The INTERCEPT process will begin on either the day of&#xD;
      collection (Day 0) or the day following collection (Day 1); illumination must occur within 24&#xD;
      hours after the end of collection. Test platelet components will be stored for up to 7 days,&#xD;
      after collection, in 100% plasma. In vitro platelet function will be evaluated on Days 0/1&#xD;
      (pre-treatment) and at end of storage (Day 7, 6 and/or 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of storage, an aliquot of Test platelets will be aseptically removed from each&#xD;
      subject's INTERCEPT platelet storage container and prepared for radiolabeling. The in vitro&#xD;
      quality of the Test platelet sample used for radiolabeling will be assessed prior to and&#xD;
      following the pre-radiolabeling platelet sample preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recovery and survival for Test platelets will be compared against the fresh platelet&#xD;
      Control. Recovery and survival of INTERCEPT platelets will be assessed after Day 7, 6 or 5&#xD;
      days of storage for up to 24 evaluable subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test and Control will be randomly radiolabeled with either 51Cr as sodium radiochromate&#xD;
      (Na251CrO4) or 111In as indium oxine, depending upon randomization period and assignment.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized with equal probability to the radiolabeling sequences (111In/51Cr&#xD;
      vs. 51Cr/111In) for Test/Control. After radiolabeling, the autologous Control and Test&#xD;
      platelet samples will be simultaneously infused into the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be drawn immediately before infusion and for radioactivity measurements at&#xD;
      1 hour ± 15 min and 2 hours ± 15 min post-infusion (Day 0), and 6 more samples will be drawn&#xD;
      at 1, 2, 3, 4 (or 5 or 6), 7 (or 8), and 11±1 days post-infusion (DPI), at approximately the&#xD;
      same time of day as the radiolabeled platelet infusion was administered (±4 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be monitored for safety (adverse events) from the first apheresis procedure&#xD;
      until after the last DPI blood sample is drawn.&#xD;

    <description>Stage 1 is a randomized, 2-period crossover design. Test platelets stored for 7 days will be radiolabeled using either the BEST or Variant 1 methods (depending on the period and randomization scheme for the Test platelets) for 12 healthy subjects. The recovery and survival for Test platelets prepared with the BEST and Variant 1 methods will be compared with each other and against the fresh platelet Control.</description>

    <description>Stage 2 is a single arm study in which all Test platelets will be prepared for radiolabeling using the Variant 1 methodology. The recovery and survival for Test platelets will be compared against the fresh platelet Control. Recovery and survival of INTERCEPT platelets will be assessed after Day 7, 6 or 5 days of storage for up to 24 evaluable subjects. The storage duration of the Test platelet components will be determined by Cerus based on the outcome of Stage 1.</description>
