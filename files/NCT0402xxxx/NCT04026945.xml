  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are testing a new formulation of lidocaine for its&#xD;
      suitability in managing chronic scrotal pain (CSCP). The new formulation ST-CP is a lidocaine&#xD;
      sustained-release formulation and is expected to provide pain relief over 4 weeks. Currently,&#xD;
      the drug lidocaine is not available as an injectable slow-release formulation and chronic&#xD;
      scrotal pain patients are often left untreated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if a new polymeric, water-free formulation of&#xD;
      lidocaine is safe and can provide effective, long-lasting pain relief in chronic scrotal pain&#xD;
      (CSCP) patients. This new formulation ST-CP is injected into the spermatic cord of patients&#xD;
      in a very comparable way that the currently available lidocaine solution (Lidocaine HCl 1%&#xD;
      USP) is administered. The only difference is that the polymer solution stays in the area of&#xD;
      injection longer by forming a soft implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore hypothesize that the polymer formulation of lidocaine will&#xD;
      release the drug over an extended period of time and will not dissolve away like the&#xD;
      currently used lidocaine solution (Lidocaine HCl 1%, USP). This will lead to long-lasting&#xD;
      pain relief for CSCP patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' primary objective is to determine if the single injection of our polymeric&#xD;
      lidocaine formulation is well tolerated by patients with CSCP. Secondary objectives are to&#xD;
      determine the duration and extent of pain relief, the impact of ST-CP on pain-related quality&#xD;
      of life and the systemic exposure to lidocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study is conducted at the Vancouver Prostate Centre. Potential participants will&#xD;
      undergo a screening period to determine basal pain levels over 7 days and test their ability&#xD;
      to respond to a spermatic cord block with a standard lidocaine injection (Lidocaine HCl 1%,&#xD;
      USP). Up to 15 men will receive our ST-CP study formulation and will be monitored over the&#xD;
      the following 4 weeks. Follow-up procedures will include blood draws, daily pain evaluations&#xD;
      and standard questionnaires on scrotal pain and erectile function. Up to 3 dose levels are&#xD;
      planned but dose escalation will only occur once the previous cohort (3 patients) has&#xD;
      completed the follow up and safety assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary descriptive statistics (including mean and standard deviation, median, range,&#xD;
      proportion) will be provided for important parameters and outcome measures. These include&#xD;
      subject demographics, subject disposition, subject compliance, pharmakokinetic laboratory&#xD;
      test outcomes, overall adverse events, adverse events related to lidocaine and adverse events&#xD;
      related to study procedure. Pain scores and questionnaires will be summarized by score and&#xD;
      pre- and post- treatment levels will be compared.&#xD;

    <description>This study uses a dose-escalating approach in the active treatment arm. There is no comparator product. All qualifying patients receive the active treatment ST-CP as an injection in the region around the spermatic cord. The following dosing cohorts will be used:&#xD;
I: 1 x 2 mL of 140 mg/mL ST-CP (= 280 mg lidocaine) II: 1 x 3 mL of 140 mg/mL ST-CP (= 420 mg lidocaine) III: 1 x 4 mL of 140 mg/mL ST-CP (= 560 mg lidocaine)</description>
