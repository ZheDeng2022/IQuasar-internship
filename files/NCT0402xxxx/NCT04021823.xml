  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational, non-invasive clinical study different neurobiological analyses will be&#xD;
      performed in a group of patients with severe treatment resistant major depression&#xD;
      participating in an efficacy study of deep brain stimulation of the superolateral branch of&#xD;
      the medial forebrain bundle (slMFB) - FORESEE III.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a sub-project of the FORESEE III study (Controlled Randomized Clinical Trial to&#xD;
      assess Efficacy of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the slMFB in Patients with Treatment&#xD;
      Resistant Major Depression). The FORESEE III study itself is a randomized, sham-controlled,&#xD;
      double blind (patient and observer blinded) clinical trial to assess the antidepressant&#xD;
      effect of DBS compared to sham.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this sub-project is to analyze the time-course of biological correlates of&#xD;
      treatment resistant major depression as well as neurobiological markers of treatment response&#xD;
      to treatment with DBS in a well-characterized patient population during 12 month of DBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific neurobiological analyses include testing of&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. epigenetic markers (DNA methylation in candidate genes of depression and epigenome-wide&#xD;
           association studies, EWAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. markers of neuroinflammation (cytokines, neuropeptides and other immune factors)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. micro RNAs and transcriptome signatures&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. markers of neurodegeneration (neurofilament light protein)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. metabolomic analyses and&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. endocrinological parameters including glucose tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All markers will be tested in blood samples (and urine samples for metaboloic profiling)&#xD;
      before neurosurgery as well as at several time points during DBS and sham condition&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally hemodynamic parameters will be analysed at test stimulation of the slMFB during&#xD;
      neurosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be correlated with clinical and other biological response parameters of the&#xD;
      FORESEE III study and are hypothesized to indicate treatment response as well as allowing&#xD;
      prediction of response to DBS. All neurobiological analyses will be linked in a tightly&#xD;
      integrated and comprehensive translational approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, a volunteer group of healthy controls will be recruited and tested for blood-markers&#xD;
      of neurodegeneration (neurofilament light protein, 4.) as well as metabolomic analyses in&#xD;
      blood and urine (5.).&#xD;
