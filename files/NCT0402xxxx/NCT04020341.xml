  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the therapeutic response of oral gepotidacin&#xD;
      compared to oral nitrofurantoin for uncomplicated UTI in adolescent and adult female&#xD;
      subjects. In this study, subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either&#xD;
      oral gepotidacin or oral nitrofurantoin. The study will enroll approximately 2000 subjects&#xD;
      with uncomplicated UTI. The duration of the study will be approximately 28 days.&#xD;
