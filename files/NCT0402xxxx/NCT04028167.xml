      This study evaluates a novel regimen of induction chemotherapy using a combination of&#xD;
      docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and leucovorin, with short term infusional 5-FU (FLOT), given prior&#xD;
      to chemoradiotherapy with concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel, as neoadjuvant therapy prior&#xD;
      to definitive surgical resection for patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical outcomes following standard of care therapy for resectable esophageal and&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma are suboptimal, with low rates of pathologic&#xD;
      complete response (pCR) to current neoadjuvant treatment strategies. Although significant&#xD;
      progress has been made by incorporation of neoadjuvant chemoradiation or perioperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy, most patients will ultimately develop disease recurrence, with both&#xD;
      locoregional and distant recurrence representing a significant component of failure. For&#xD;
      patients receiving preoperative chemoradiation, a regimen consisting of concurrent&#xD;
      carboplatin and paclitaxel with radiotherapy has been established as a standard of care based&#xD;
      on the Chemoradiotherapy for Esophageal Cancer Followed by Surgery Study (CROSS). In the long&#xD;
      term results of CROSS, locoregional progression was noted in 22% of patients receiving&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy, with distant progression in 39%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have also suggested perioperative chemotherapy as a potential alternative&#xD;
      strategy for selected patients, based on results of the MAGIC trial, which included a subset&#xD;
      patients with esophageal/GE junction tumor location, and demonstrated improved survival for&#xD;
      patients receiving perioperative epirubicin, cisplatin, and infusional 5-fluorouracil (ECF)&#xD;
      compared to surgery alone. The FLOT4-AIO trial has subsequently demonstrated a further&#xD;
      overall survival benefit to a perioperative regimen of docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and&#xD;
      leucovorin, with short term infusional 5-FU (FLOT) compared to ECF. A regimen of&#xD;
      perioperative FLOT is currently being compared to preoperative chemoradiotherapy using the&#xD;
      CROSS regimen in the ongoing ESOPEC trial (NCT02509286).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the significant risk of recurrence either with the CROSS preoperative chemoradiation&#xD;
      regimen, or the perioperative FLOT regimen, it is plausible that selected patients may&#xD;
      benefit from a combination of intensified systemic therapy using the FLOT backbone, in&#xD;
      combination with sequential preoperative chemoradiation due to the known risk of locoregional&#xD;
      recurrence in this population. This study evaluates the proposed neoadjuvant regimen of&#xD;
      induction FLOT followed by neoadjuvant chemoradiation in patients with resectable cT3/T4 or&#xD;
      node positive adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction.&#xD;
