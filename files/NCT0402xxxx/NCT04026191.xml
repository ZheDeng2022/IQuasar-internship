  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the residual risk of OrthoVisc-T (OVT) for the treatment of chronic lateral&#xD;
      epicondylosis (Tennis Elbow). This trial will provide clinical data on a subject population&#xD;
      not previously researched which have failed prior treatments for lateral epicondylosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orthovisc-T is a sterile viscoelastic preparation supplied in a disposable glass syringe&#xD;
      containing 2.0 mL of sodium hyaluronate (15 mg/mL) dissolved in physiological saline. The&#xD;
      Orthovisc-T device is intended to relieve pain and restore function in tendons affected by&#xD;
      chronic lateral epicondylosis. The hyaluronic acid solution provides extracellular&#xD;
      supplementation of the elbow with lateral epicondylosis, lubricating and hydrating the&#xD;
      affected site, thereby providing the ideal environment for healing of the damaged tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the residual risk of two peri-osteotendinous&#xD;
      injections of Orthovisc-T spaced one week apart for the relief of elbow pain and to restore&#xD;
      function in patients with lateral epicondylosis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of chronic lateral epicondylosis defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Pain reproducible on palpation of the lateral epicondyle / common extensor&#xD;
                  origin, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Pain reproducible during resisted wrist extension&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Failed prior treatment for lateral epicondylosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Able and willing to provide signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject must be willing to abstain from other peri-articular treatments of the elbow&#xD;
             for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject is willing to discontinue all analgesics including NSAIDs, except&#xD;
             acetaminophen/paracetamol, at least seven days before the treatment injection and&#xD;
             through the completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject is willing to use only acetaminophen/paracetamol (up to a maximum of 4.0 grams&#xD;
             per day per the package insert) for the treatment of joint pain for the duration of&#xD;
             the study. At least forty-eight hours prior to the Baseline Visit and each follow-up&#xD;
             visit, the subject is willing to discontinue use of acetaminophen/paracetamol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the hyaluronan&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Infection or skin disease in the area of the injection site or elbow joint&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject received a peri-articular injection of Hyaluronic Acid (HA) and/or steroid in&#xD;
             either elbow within 6 months of signing the informed consent form (ICF). A subject&#xD;
             will be excluded if they are planning to receive an HA or steroid injection (other&#xD;
             than the study injection) in either elbow during the course of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known inflammatory or autoimmune disorders, or other pre-existing medical conditions&#xD;
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, could impact healing or affect the ability&#xD;
             of the subject to complete the study and comply with the study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is taking medications at the time of signing the ICF which could interfere&#xD;
             with the treatment procedure, healing and/or assessments. This includes but is not&#xD;
             limited to oral or injectable anticoagulant treatments, anti-aggregant platelet&#xD;
             treatment, chronic opioid analgesics. Low dose aspirin used for cardiovascular&#xD;
             protection is allowed if a stable regimen is maintained for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who had an oral, intramuscular, intravenous, rectal suppository or topical&#xD;
             (excluded in index elbow only) corticosteroid within 30 days of signing the ICF are&#xD;
             excluded. Topical corticosteroid use at any site other than the index elbow is&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject is a woman who is pregnant or breastfeeding at the Screening Visit or a woman&#xD;
             of child bearing potential who refuses to use effective contraception during the&#xD;
             course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject was involved in any other research study involving an investigational product,&#xD;
             or a new application of an approved product, within 60 days of signing the ICF.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject is receiving or in litigation for worker's compensation.&#xD;
