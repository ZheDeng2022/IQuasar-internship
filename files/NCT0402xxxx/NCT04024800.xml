      This study will look to establish the recommended biologic dose of AE37 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab that will enhance the tumor-specific immune response and demonstrate efficacy&#xD;
      in patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in two parts. Stage 1 will be the safety cohort (13 patients) to&#xD;
      determine the recommended dose of AE37 vaccine that can safely be administered with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. Stage 2 will be an expansion cohort (16 patients) that will consist of the&#xD;
      recommended dose of AE37 determined in Stage 1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FB-14 is an open label, phase II study using pembrolizumab in combination with AE37&#xD;
      peptide vaccine (AE37) in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have a Simon two-stage design. In Stage I (safety cohort), 13 patients will&#xD;
      receive combination therapy of AE37 vaccine (without granulocyte macrophage-colony&#xD;
      stimulating factor [GM-CSF] adjuvant) 1000 micrograms in two split intradermal injections on&#xD;
      Day 1 of cycles 1 through 5 and pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenous infusion (IV) given Day 1 of&#xD;
      each cycle for 2 years (1 cycle equals 21 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients (safety and expansion cohorts) will receive two delayed type hypersensitivity&#xD;
      inoculations (DTH): the first within one week prior to beginning study therapy, which must&#xD;
      meet the parameters of negative inoculation site assessment for eligibility as described in&#xD;
      the protocol; and the second approximately 42 days after the last AE37 vaccine dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a safety run-in, the first 3 patients will be closely followed for 6 weeks following&#xD;
      the first dose of study therapy (2 cycles) without further accrual of patients. If one or&#xD;
      less of the first 3 patients experience greater than or equal to Grade 3 systemic dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity (DLT) attributable to study therapy during the observation period, the&#xD;
      safety run-in portion of the study will proceed with enrollment at the proposed study therapy&#xD;
      dose (AE37 1000 micrograms and pembrolizumab 200 mg IV infusion). If there are two or more&#xD;
      patients in the safety run-in with DLT during Cycle 1, the dose of AE37 will be decreased to&#xD;
      dose level -1 (500 micrograms) to complete stage I accrual. The definition of a DLT is found&#xD;
      in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If DLT is observed during the safety run-in or in greater than 25% (4 or more) of patients in&#xD;
      stage I, the AE37 dose will be de-escalated to 500 micrograms (dose level -1) for all&#xD;
      patients to complete stage I accrual. If systemic toxicity occurs in greater than or equal to&#xD;
      3 patients at dose level -1, accrual will be halted and the toxicity reviewed by the study&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
