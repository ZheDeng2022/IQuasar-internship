    <description>GPNC participants will attend 11 group sessions total: 10 during pregnancy and one postpartum. Each session will be 90-100 minutes long. Groups will collectively identify the preferred time of day for these sessions. Groups of 10 women will be led by a locally trained, Samoan nurse-midwife with the study Project Director as a co-facilitator. At each of the visits participants will engage in self-assessments of weight and blood pressure, including learning to take their blood pressure with a digital cuff, calculating BMI, and plotting their weight gain on a graph), receive short individual clinical examinations from a midwife, and participate in group discussions about prenatal care, childbirth preparation, and their postpartum care. The session at 6-weeks postpartum will allow women to introduce their babies to the group and share childbirth stories.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥18 years of age. We will exclude younger pregnant women because adolescents may still&#xD;
             be experiencing their own growth and development, which would be a source of&#xD;
             confounding for our study outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-reported Samoan ethnicity. Based on all four grandparents (of the participant)&#xD;
             being reported as Samoa. Other ethnic groups make up approximately 2% of the American&#xD;
             Samoan population but we are specifically interested in determining the efficacy of&#xD;
             this intervention fro Samoan women, who have considerably poorer health outcomes in&#xD;
             this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English speaking. The intervention will be delivered primarily in English, as is usual&#xD;
             for standard prenatal care in this setting, with some Samoan language likely to be&#xD;
             used in group discussions. Take home materials will be provided in both English and&#xD;
             Samoan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planning to reside in American Samoa for the duration of pregnancy and until at least&#xD;
             6 weeks postpartum. Some women travel from the neighboring country of Samoa&#xD;
             (Independent/Western Samoa) to receive prenatal care at LBJTMC. These women will be&#xD;
             excluded based on the need to receive all intervention sessions and a postpartum&#xD;
             follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Singleton, viable pregnancy. A twin pregnancy reduced to singleton before 140 weeks by&#xD;
             project gestational age is acceptable. An ultrasound must be conducted before&#xD;
             randomization that shows a fetal heartbeat; there must be no evidence of more than one&#xD;
             fetus on the most recent pre-randomization ultrasound. Including multiple pregnancies&#xD;
             would confound study outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed LBJTMC prenatal care enrollment visit. Participants must have enrolled in&#xD;
             standard prenatal care and received a standard of care physical exam, ultrasound,&#xD;
             confirmation of pregnancy dating, pregnancy history, and preliminary gestational&#xD;
             diabetes screen to ensure that no pregnancy health-based exclusion criteria (see&#xD;
             below) are met. Participants must obtain written documentation from their provider of&#xD;
             this visit, and permission from them to participate in the GPNC study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gestational age at randomization no earlier than 11 weeks 0 days and no later than 14&#xD;
             weeks 0 days based on an algorithm that compares the last menstrual period date and&#xD;
             data from the enrollment ultrasound. This will ensure that each participant is exposed&#xD;
             to the intervention for the same amount of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index ≥ 26kg/m2 based on measured weight at enrollment and on measured&#xD;
             height. The earliest weight measurement before randomization, measured specifically&#xD;
             for the study will be used. A BMI cutpoint of 26 kg/m2 is used in line with the usual&#xD;
             upward-adjusted criteria for overweight in populations of Polynesian descent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age less than 18 years because of the potential for growth during pregnancy and the&#xD;
             need for participant informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of diabetes prior to pregnancy or an HbA1C ≥ 6.5% or other glucose tolerance&#xD;
             test result suggestive of pre-pregnancy diabetes. All potential participants will have&#xD;
             HbA1C or an alternative test performed prior to randomization at their standard&#xD;
             prenatal care enrollment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gestational diabetes or preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known fetal anomaly/pregnancy health condition known to require specialist&#xD;
             monitoring/treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned termination of pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past history of anorexia or bulimia by medical history or patient report. Binge eating&#xD;
             disorder (BED) is not an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current eating disorder diagnosed by a clinician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior bariatric surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of one or more of the following medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Metformin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Antipsychotic agents (e.g. Abilify, Haldol, Risperdal, Seroquel, Zyprexa)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Anti-seizure medications or mood stabilizers that would be expected to have a&#xD;
                  significant impact on body weight (e.g Depakote, Lamictal, Lithium, Neurontin,&#xD;
                  Tegretol, Topamax, Keppra)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Medications for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) including&#xD;
                  amphetamines and methylphenidate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Continued use of weight loss medication including Over The Counter (OTC) and dietary&#xD;
             supplements for weight loss (e.g. Adipex, Suprenza, Tenuate, Xenical, Alli, conjugated&#xD;
             linoleic acid, Hoodia, Green tea extract, Guar gum, Hydroxycut, Sensa, Corti-Slim,&#xD;
             Chromium, Chitosan, Bitter Orange)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications to aerobic exercise in pregnancy specified by the American College&#xD;
             of Obstetrics and Gynocology (ACOG) committee Opinion #267, 2002 (re-affirmed 2009)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another interventional study that influences weight control&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants unwillingness or inability to commit to a six-week postpartum follow up&#xD;
             of herself or her child, including planning to move away&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreated medical or psychiatric condition (e.g. depression, bipolar disorder) that&#xD;
             could impede study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hospitalization for hyperemesis&#xD;
