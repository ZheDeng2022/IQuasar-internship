      This phase IV study is a prospective open-label multi-center study to investigate the effect&#xD;
      of a temporary individualized poly-pharmaceutical De-escalation treatment with the target to&#xD;
      regenerate ß-cell function over 12 weeks on the disease stage and glycemic control in&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes. This is an uncontrolled pilot study to collect data for later&#xD;
      confirmatory trials.&#xD;

      During the screening visit the patient will arrive at the study site and written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained by the investigator. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      controlled and blood will be drawn for HbA1c, the efficacy and the safety parameters. A POCT&#xD;
      pregnancy test will be conducted in women of childbearing age. Patient demographics and&#xD;
      history will be collect and a physical examination will be performed. The patient will&#xD;
      complete a QoL questionnaire and will receive training about the de-escalation therapy&#xD;
      approach. After all necessary biomarker results of the screening visit are accessible for the&#xD;
      selection of the De-escalation treatment the treatment initiation visit will be performed.&#xD;
      During this visit the investigator will use these results to determine a most optimal&#xD;
      personalized treatment combination for regeneration of the pancreatic ß-cells within the next&#xD;
      three months. An ECG will be recorded and the patient will be informed about his/her&#xD;
      personalized treatment and its execution. The patient will receive the drugs in the volume&#xD;
      required until the next visit. During the next two visits the patient will arrive at the&#xD;
      investigational site at the agreed time-point and information regarding potential adverse&#xD;
      events will be collected. Vital signs will be measured, and blood will be drawn for&#xD;
      assessment of the efficacy parameters. Information about hypoglycaemia will be collected, and&#xD;
      the patient will receive drug supply that lasts until the next visit. The patient will be&#xD;
      instructed to stop the anti-diabetic medication 3 days before the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the final visit (visit 5) the patient will arrive at the investigational site after an&#xD;
      overnight fast and information regarding potential adverse events and hypoglycaemic events&#xD;
      will be collected. Vital signs will be measured, and blood will be drawn for assessment of&#xD;
      the efficacy parameters. An oral glucose challenge with 75 g of glucose will be conducted&#xD;
      with blood draws for assessment of glucose and other biomarkers at time-points 0, 1h and 2h.&#xD;
      The investigator will give a recommendation for the consecutive follow-up treatment&#xD;
      requirements based on the results of the glucose challenge test. The patient will complete a&#xD;
      QoL questionnaire (DTSQ) and this concludes study participation for the patient.&#xD;
