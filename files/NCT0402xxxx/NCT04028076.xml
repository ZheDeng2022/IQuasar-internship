  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burden of diabetes is higher among African Americans (AAs) in Wisconsin as&#xD;
      hospitalization rates for diabetes complications such as stroke and amputations are four&#xD;
      times higher than whites and has worsened by 334% since 2011. The most important&#xD;
      self-management behavior for improving diabetes outcomes is medication adherence, i.e.,&#xD;
      taking medicines as recommended by providers. Poor adherence to diabetes medications is&#xD;
      common among AAs and contributes to disproportionally worse outcomes. While the reasons for&#xD;
      nonadherence are multifactorial, health beliefs, lack of self-efficacy, social support, and&#xD;
      limited health literacy, are critical factors for AAs. Due to discrimination experiences and&#xD;
      provider distrust, AAs may have health beliefs that do not align with biomedicine. Existing&#xD;
      adherence interventions designed for general populations may be ineffective for AAs because&#xD;
      they do not adequately address these fundamental factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is peer-led, such that AAs who have diabetes and are adherent to their&#xD;
      medicines (Peer Ambassadors- (PAs)) are paired with AAs who have diabetes and are nonadherent&#xD;
      (Peer Buddies- PBs)).Throughout the 8-week program, PAs actively support and teach PBs about&#xD;
      self-advocacy in patient-provider relationships, as well as sharing their experiences&#xD;
      managing diabetes, providing social support, enhancing health literacy, patient activation&#xD;
      (engagement and empowerment) and self-efficacy. PAs help deliver the intervention via initial&#xD;
      face-to-face and phone/app follow-ups with PBs, in addition to structured group education&#xD;
      delivered to PBs by a physician, pharmacist, and diabetes educator separately. The&#xD;
      investigator's aim is to use a community-engaged design to pilot the intervention, assessing&#xD;
      the feasibility of gathering pre/post outcomes including culturally-informed diabetes-health&#xD;
      beliefs, self-efficacy, patient activation, medication adherence (using surveys), and A1c,&#xD;
      and further refine the intervention via feedback from an advisory board comprised of the PAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will be feasible for AAs with diabetes.&#xD;
      This study uses a collaborative approach involving patient stakeholders throughout the&#xD;
      research process by directly engaging AAs with diabetes to utilize their experience,&#xD;
      knowledge and advice. This project advances the development of culturally-appropriate&#xD;
      medication adherence interventions for AAs with diabetes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, diabetes affects 3.7 million African Americans (AAs) who are more&#xD;
      likely to be diagnosed compared to non-Hispanic whites and are at a greater risk for&#xD;
      diabetes-related death and disability. Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in&#xD;
      Wisconsin, incurring an estimated $3.9 billion annually in health care and lost productivity&#xD;
      costs. Each year, more than 1,300 people in Wisconsin die from diabetes and many more suffer&#xD;
      diabetes-related complications such as heart disease and amputations. This burden is higher&#xD;
      among African Americans (AAs) whose hospitalization rates for diabetes-related complications&#xD;
      are four times higher than whites. The most important self-management behavior for improving&#xD;
      diabetes outcomes is medication adherence, i.e., taking medications according to provider&#xD;
      recommendations. Poor medication adherence places a significant economic burden on US&#xD;
      healthcare systems, resulting in $290 billion in costs. A nonadherent patient requires three&#xD;
      extra medical visits per year, leading to $2000 increased treatment costs annually. In&#xD;
      diabetes, the estimated US cost savings due to improving poor adherence is $1.16 billion.&#xD;
      Nonadherence is thus a critical societal problem with negative economic consequences and&#xD;
      detrimental effects on health and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor adherence to diabetes medicines is common among AAs and contributes to disproportionally&#xD;
      worse diabetes outcomes for AAs. AAs have a 25% lower adherence to diabetes medications than&#xD;
      non-Hispanic whites. While the reasons for nonadherence are multifactorial, health beliefs,&#xD;
      lack of social support, and limited health literacy, are critical factors for AAs. Due to&#xD;
      limited access to high quality healthcare, discrimination experiences, and distrust in&#xD;
      providers, AAs may have health beliefs that do not align with biomedicine. Existing adherence&#xD;
      interventions designed for general populations may be ineffective for AAs because they do not&#xD;
      adequately address these fundamental psychosocial factors. The proposed work builds on the&#xD;
      investigator's studies of AAs' diabetes experiences and medication adherence. The&#xD;
      investigator's previous research showed that AAs felt a loss of autonomy because of diabetes&#xD;
      and believed that diabetes was caused by exposure to certain medications. Navigating the&#xD;
      healthcare system seemed difficult. Some AAs did not take their medicines because they did&#xD;
      not know how to ask their provider questions. AAs wanted peers to support/teach self-advocacy&#xD;
      and positive empowerment in patient-provider relationships. Hence, the investigators worked&#xD;
      with community/patient stakeholders to develop a prototype 8-week peer-led culturally&#xD;
      appropriate intervention to address identified psychosocial/ sociocultural issues and enhance&#xD;
      diabetes medication adherence for AAs, called Peers Supporting Health Literacy,&#xD;
      Self-Efficacy, Advocacy and Adherence (Peers LEAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically, peer support occurs through group, nurse and community health worker visits;&#xD;
      however, these require expensive professional staff. Peers LEAD offers an innovative,&#xD;
      culturally appropriate and more informal, low-cost means of providing peer support with&#xD;
      similar benefits. The long-term goal is to decrease diabetes-related morbidity among AAs&#xD;
      through culturally appropriate interventions to increase medication adherence. The study&#xD;
      objective is to pilot Peers LEAD using a community-based participatory design to examine for&#xD;
      feasibility, outcomes including culturally-informed diabetes-health beliefs, diabetes and&#xD;
      medication self-efficacy, patient activation (a measure of engagement/empowerment),&#xD;
      medication adherence, and blood glucose, and refine Peers LEAD via participant feedback. The&#xD;
      central hypothesis is that Peers LEAD will be feasible and effective for AAs with diabetes,&#xD;
      leading to improved outcomes in self-efficacy, activation, adherence, and blood glucose. The&#xD;
      study aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To pilot PEERS LEAD to test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention&#xD;
      intended to shift negative diabetes-health beliefs to positive, enhance diabetes&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and improve adherence, and blood glucose levels. In conjunction with an&#xD;
      interdisciplinary team of a physician, pharmacist and diabetes educator who will provide&#xD;
      structured education, Peer Ambassador Board (PAB) members will help deliver Peers LEAD, via&#xD;
      initial face-to-face and phone/messaging app follow-ups, serving as peer ambassadors (PAs).&#xD;
      Peer buddies (PBs) (AAs 30-65 years old with type 2 diabetes and poor medication adherence)&#xD;
      will participate in the program, with a target of 10 20 PBs each in Madison and 10 PBs in&#xD;
      Milwaukee. PBs will complete surveys and glucose tests assessing changes in outcomes.&#xD;
      Interviews and focus groups will be conducted with all PBs and PAs respectively to get&#xD;
      feedback on the intervention. The investigators hypothesize that PA/PB feedback will lead to&#xD;
      a feasible intervention showing improvement in adherence and glucose levels for the PBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To refine PEERS LEAD for AAs with diabetes using feedback from Peer Ambassador Boards&#xD;
      and Peer Buddies. The investigators will: (1) establish two PABs, (2) train PAB members as&#xD;
      PAs, (3) elicit feedback to refine Peers LEAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study uses a collaborative approach involving patient stakeholders throughout the&#xD;
      research process by directly engaging AAs with diabetes to utilize their experience,&#xD;
      knowledge and advice. This is the first study to enhance peer support for AAs with diabetes&#xD;
      using phone/messaging app technology. This project advances the development of innovative&#xD;
      interventions for AAs with diabetes and focuses on social and behavioral constructs&#xD;
      identified from the investigator's prior work to influence medication adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Study Design: This pilot research will be conducted in 2 phases using an intervention&#xD;
      mixed methods design in which the investigators will test the 8-week Peers Supporting Health&#xD;
      Literacy, Self-Efficacy, Advocacy and Adherence (Peers LEAD) intervention in Phase 1, and&#xD;
      then examine specific intervention elements for refinement in Phase 2. The rationale for this&#xD;
      design is that neither quantitative nor qualitative methods are sufficient in explaining the&#xD;
      outcomes of the intervention. Mixing both methods gives a more complete analysis of Peers&#xD;
      LEAD. Qualitative results collected during and after the intervention will allow the&#xD;
      investigators to further explain the outcomes, examine participant's experiences and modify&#xD;
      the methods in a follow-up and/or dissemination study.&#xD;

    <description>An 8-week culturally appropriate educational behavioral intervention that consists of structured group diabetes education and follow-up peer support with PAs. There will be 3 separate group education sessions led by a physician, AA pharmacist and AA diabetes educator. All PAs will attend each group session to learn together with their PBs and build social interactions. Weeks 1 and 2 consist of 2-hour group education between the participants and diabetes educator, and participants and pharmacist, respectively. Pre-test intervention data including A1c will be collected in Week 1. In Weeks 3-7, PAs will deliver the intervention content to PBs over the phone as well as help them set a goal towards getting healthy. An existing video/text messaging app, called WhatsApp® will be offered as an option to use to further enhance PA-PB interaction.</description>
