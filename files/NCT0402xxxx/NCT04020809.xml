    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see whether using atezolizumab before surgery is&#xD;
      safe and does not cause side effects that delay surgery in participants with cutaneous&#xD;
      melanoma that has not spread to other areas of the body (non-metastatic) and can be removed&#xD;
      by surgery (resectable) but has a higher risk of coming back after surgery (high-risk).&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of using atezolizumab before surgery in&#xD;
      participants with cutaneous melanoma that has not spread to other areas of the body&#xD;
      (non-metastatic) and can be removed by surgery (resectable) but has a higher risk of coming&#xD;
      back after surgery (high-risk). Cutaneous melanoma in its earliest stages before it has&#xD;
      spread to other areas of the body can usually be cured with surgery alone. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      some cutaneous melanomas have a greater likelihood of coming back after surgery. Your immune&#xD;
      system is normally your body's first defense against threats like cancer. But sometimes&#xD;
      cancer cells produce signals that allow them to hide from attack by the immune system. One&#xD;
      such signal is called programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Atezolizumab is a drug that&#xD;
      blocks PD-L1. By blocking PD-L1, atezolizumab may boost your immune system to keep your&#xD;
      cutaneous melanoma from coming back after surgery.&#xD;
