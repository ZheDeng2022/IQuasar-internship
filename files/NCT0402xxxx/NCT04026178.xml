  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MYALEPT™ (metreleptin) has been approved as an adjunct to diet as replacement therapy to&#xD;
      treat the complications of leptin deficiency in patients with congenital or acquired&#xD;
      generalized lipodystrophy (MYALEPT Prescribing Information). This study is a multicenter,&#xD;
      open-label, Phase 4 trial to provide an assessment of the immunogenicity associated with&#xD;
      metreleptin and of any major potential risks due to development of antibodies to metreleptin.&#xD;
      The study is being conducted to comply with a postmarketing requirement.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures. If &lt;18 years of&#xD;
             age, has a parent or guardian able to read, understand, and sign the Informed Consent&#xD;
             Form (ICF) and a Child Assent form, communicate with the Investigator, and understand&#xD;
             and comply with protocol requirements. Adolescent patients must also read and&#xD;
             understand the Child Assent Form. If the child is too young or unable to read, then&#xD;
             the Child Assent form must be explained to the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Female and/or male patients ≥1 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Physician-confirmed diagnosis of congenital or acquired generalized lipodystrophy and&#xD;
             will begin treatment with MYALEPT for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) for female patients of childbearing&#xD;
             potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female patients of childbearing potential must be 1 year postmenopausal, surgically&#xD;
             sterile, or be willing to use an acceptable method of contraception (an acceptable&#xD;
             method of contraception is defined as a barrier method in conjunction with a&#xD;
             spermicide) for the duration of the study (from the time they sign consent). In&#xD;
             addition, oral contraceptives, approved contraceptive implant, long-term injectable&#xD;
             contraception, intrauterine device, or tubal ligation are allowed. Oral contraception&#xD;
             alone is not acceptable; additional barrier methods in conjunction with spermicide&#xD;
             must be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Male patients must be surgically sterile or be willing to use an acceptable method of&#xD;
             contraception (defined as barrier methods in conjunction with spermicides) for the&#xD;
             duration of the study (from the time they sign consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who are blood donors should not donate blood during the study and for 3&#xD;
             months following their last dose of metreleptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both Aegerion&#xD;
             staff and/or staff at the study site.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previous treatment with metreleptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the&#xD;
             last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with prior severe hypersensitivity reactions to metreleptin or to any of the&#xD;
             product components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known to have tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus, are immunocompromised,&#xD;
             or are receiving immunomodulatory drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Known history of drug or alcohol abuse within 1 year of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min using institutional standards:&#xD;
&#xD;
             e.g., calculated using Cockcroft-Gault formula for patients ≥18 years of age;&#xD;
             calculated using Schwartz equation for patients &lt;18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For women only - currently pregnant (confirmed with positive pregnancy test) or&#xD;
             breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any condition where, in the opinion of the Investigator, participation in this study&#xD;
             may pose a significant risk to the patient or could render the patient unable to&#xD;
             successfully complete the study.&#xD;
