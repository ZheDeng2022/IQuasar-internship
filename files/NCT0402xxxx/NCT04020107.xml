  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the absence of a medical consensus, the current management of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome&#xD;
      hypermobility type (hEDS) remains very speculative That's why investigators want in this&#xD;
      study to demonstrate the beneficial contribution of an innovative therapeutic strategy&#xD;
      combining reprogramming and substitution somatosensory. This therapy is based primarily on&#xD;
      the somesthetic substitution provided by compression garments(VC). Indeed, the VC port&#xD;
      associated with stimulation of the somesthetic system via a specific program of physiotherapy&#xD;
      (e.e. centered on body awareness through movement) could potentiate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      care, and therefore enhance its long-term beneficial effect. The patient could thus regain&#xD;
      his mobility, his functional independence, and thus considerably increase its quality of&#xD;
      life. Thereafter, the practice of an adapted physical activity (APA), by the sensory&#xD;
      stimulation induced and its playful nature, will allow patients to preserve and sustain the&#xD;
      benefits of taking load previously carried out. Validation of this therapeutic approach would&#xD;
      offer an effective solution may subsequently be proposed to the entire medical profession as&#xD;
      reference support in the treatment of the hEDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to include, over a period of two years, 40 patients with hypermobile&#xD;
      Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and 40 healthy volunteers controls. Patients will be followed for a&#xD;
      period of one year divided into 3 periods of 4 months, between which they will be evaluated&#xD;
      in order to quantify the impact of the intervention performed at each stage of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will benefit successively: from a classic care, over a period of 2 to 4 months,&#xD;
      then will be treated with compressive garments or with low compressive garment during the&#xD;
      next 4 months in association with proprioceptive physical therapy. Finally, the 4 last&#xD;
      months, patient will participate in an APA with both dance sessions strengthening the body&#xD;
      diagram and stretching sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this work is therefore to evaluate the effect of a treatment specifically oriented&#xD;
      towards somatosensory remediation.&#xD;
