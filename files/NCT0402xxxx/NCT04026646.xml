      In this randomized trial, the aim of study is compare acute and chronic effect of&#xD;
      Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation stretching and static stretching in individuals&#xD;
      with shortness hamstring in proprioception and performance. The primary outcome measurement&#xD;
      is proprioception (position sense and motion sense), the secondary outcome measurements are&#xD;
      physical performance evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All exercises will be performed by the same physiotherapist in 8 weeks and 3 times a week.&#xD;
      Exercises will be performed bilaterally and data from the dominant lower extremity will be&#xD;
      used in the analysis. Exercises and assessments to reduce the effects of circadian variation&#xD;
      will be performed at the same times during the research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Joint proprioception can be defined as the body's ability to determine position and detection&#xD;
      movement without vision perception. Proprioception is provided from the stimulation of&#xD;
      specialized nerve endings and mechanoreceptors located in and around the joints, such as&#xD;
      muscles, tendons, fascia, joint capsule, and ligaments. The muscle spindle and golgi tendon&#xD;
      organ are the most important receptors involved in the proprioceptive sensation of the knee&#xD;
      joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, there are studies have investigated the effect of static stretching&#xD;
      exercises on the sense of position. Some of these studies showed an improvement on position&#xD;
      sense, while one study showed no effect. There are a limited number of studies have&#xD;
      investigated the effects of Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) stretching&#xD;
      techniques on proprioceptive senses. However, the effects of static stretching and PNF&#xD;
      stretching on kinesthesia have not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare acute and chronic effect of PNF stretching and static&#xD;
      stretching in individuals with shortness hamstring in proprioception and performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis of research&#xD;
&#xD;
      H01: The acute effects of static stretching and PNF stretching exercises on the results of&#xD;
      proprioceptive sensation are similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H02: The chronic effects of static stretching and PNF stretching exercises on the results of&#xD;
      proprioceptive sensation are similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H03: The acute effects of static stretching and PNF stretching exercises on the results of&#xD;
      physical performance are similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H04: The chronic effects of static stretching and PNF stretching exercises on the results of&#xD;
      physical performance are similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Universe and Sample of the Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size calculation was performed using the G* Power software (version 3.1.9.2), taking&#xD;
      into account the statistical tests to be used in the analyses, and the conventional effect&#xD;
      size values proposed by Cohen. It was estimated that 27 subjects would be needed in each&#xD;
      group (α=0.05, β=0.20, and Cohen d=0.8) in order to detect statistically significant&#xD;
      difference in a Mann Whitney U test. Considering the samples that could not complete the&#xD;
      study, this first sample size was increased by 10% and the final sample size was calculated&#xD;
      as 30 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include volunteer sedentary male subjects aged between 20-29 years. The study&#xD;
      will be carried out in the athlete's lab of the Eastern Mediterranean University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study who have signed a voluntary consent form will be informed about the&#xD;
      study. Then, the evaluation starts with the socio-demographic data of the participants (age,&#xD;
      gender, height, weight, dominant side). Evaluations will be performed as knee extension&#xD;
      angle, proprioceptive sense, flexibility assessment, balance, explosive power tests and&#xD;
      muscle strength assessment. Individuals will be divided into two groups by minimization&#xD;
      randomization method. 30 seconds contract-relax-antagonist-contract method (CRAC) of&#xD;
      Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation stretching exercises for hamstring muscle will be&#xD;
      performed to Group 1 and 30 seconds static stretching exercises for hamstring muscle will be&#xD;
      performed to Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the acute effect, exercise will be performed after the first assessment and then&#xD;
      all assessments will be repeated. To investigate the chronic effect, all exercises will be&#xD;
      performed in 8 weeks and 3 times a week. After 6 weeks follow-up period, all participants&#xD;
      will be evaluated again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations in the Research&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee Extension Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual's hip will be stabilized at 90 degrees flexion with 1 hand supporting the&#xD;
      subject's distal thigh and the other hand cupping the heel. Physiotherapist passively&#xD;
      extended the knee until the individual feels mild tension in hamstring muscle. At this point,&#xD;
      it will measured the angle using a goniometer. Full knee extension would be equivalent to an&#xD;
      angle of 180°. The angle missing from the full knee extension will be recorded as 'degree'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proprioceptive Sensory Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isokinetic dynamometer will be used to evaluate the knee joint proprioceptive sense of&#xD;
      subjects. The subjects will placed in a 90° hip flexion sitting position. Subjects will be&#xD;
      informed about the tests. Before the test, a trial will be performed. Between the three tests&#xD;
      30 seconds rest period will be given. The difference between the target angle and the&#xD;
      measured angle will be registered as absolute error. Averages of three measurements will be&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For motion sense measurements, 10° knee flexion position was selected for kinesthesia&#xD;
      measurements. The subjects will be instructed to press the dynamometer lock button as soon as&#xD;
      they will perceive any movement in the knee joint. 45° knee flexion position will be used in&#xD;
      the measurement of position sense. The knee will be started in the 90° flexion position and&#xD;
      before the test, target knee position will be taught during 5 seconds. Afterwards, the knee&#xD;
      will be placed to starting position. Subjects will be asked to push the warning button as&#xD;
      soon as they feel they will reach the target angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Room temperature will be kept at 25°C during the tests. Air splints will be used to eliminate&#xD;
      the tactile sense. While care will be taken to preserve the silence of the environment,&#xD;
      subjects will be dressed in headphones at the same time to prevent the sound coming from the&#xD;
      isokinetic dynamo-meter that will affect the measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flexibility Measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be evaluated using the sit and reach test. Individuals will be asked to reach the as&#xD;
      far as possible they can reach by extending their arms to the forward and stand still for 1-2&#xD;
      seconds at the last point without bending participants' knees. The distance will be recorded&#xD;
      in 'cm' and the best value will be used in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flamingo Balance Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Static balance will be measured by Flamingo Balance Test. The subjects stood on the beam&#xD;
      which was 50 cm long, 5 cm height and 3 cm wide. While balancing on the dominant leg, the&#xD;
      free leg was flexed at the knee and the foot of this leg held close to the buttocks. Then the&#xD;
      instructor will be started the stopwatch and the subjects tried to stand in this position for&#xD;
      one minute. The stopwatch will be stopped each time the subjects lost the balance during 60&#xD;
      second. The number of falls of the individual will be recorded. The test will be repeated 3&#xD;
      times and a rest interval of 60 seconds will be given between repetitions. The best result&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Y-Balance Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic balance will be measured with Y-balance test. Individuals will be asked to place one&#xD;
      foot on the starting point on the center and both hands on the waist. Individuals will be&#xD;
      reach the farthest point possible in the anterior, posteriomedial and posteriolateral&#xD;
      directions with the free limb. The farthest point of the free limb will be measured with the&#xD;
      tape measure. There will be 3 trials in each direction. In addition, the lower extremity&#xD;
      length measurement will be used for scoring. (Spina Iliaca Anterior Superior-Medial&#xD;
      Malleoli). The mixed reach distance will be calculated based on best value [(max anterior +&#xD;
      max posteriomedial + max posteriolateral) / (3 x Lower Limb Length)] x100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaerobic Power Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vertical Jump Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explosive force of lower extremities will be evaluated using the counter movement vertical&#xD;
      jump test. The tape measure will be placed and fixed on the wall in the vertical direction.&#xD;
      The individuals will be positioned on the side of the wall. In this position, the arm will be&#xD;
      extended and the point at which the longest finger reaches will be recorded. The subject will&#xD;
      be started with their hands on their hips, they will then instructed to sink (approximately&#xD;
      120 knee angle) as high as possible. The distance between the touched point and jumped points&#xD;
      on the tape measure will be measured and recorded in 'cm'. The test will be repeated 3 times&#xD;
      and a rest interval of 60 seconds will be given between repetitions. The best result will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Horizontal Jump Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explosive force of lower extremities will be evaluated using the counter movement horizontal&#xD;
      jump test. The tape measure will be placed horizontally and fixed on the hard ground. The&#xD;
      individuals will be positioned on the '0' point of the tape measure. In this position, the&#xD;
      arm will be extended and the point at which the longest finger reaches will be recorded. The&#xD;
      subject will be jump with their hands on their hips (approximately 120 knee angle) as forward&#xD;
      as possible with the double leg. The distance between the '0' point and jumped points on the&#xD;
      tape measure will be measured and recorded in 'cm'. The test will be repeated 3 times and a&#xD;
      rest interval of 60 seconds will be given between repetitions. The best result will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle Strength:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of quadriceps and hamstring muscle concentric strength will be evaluated with&#xD;
      the isokinetic dynamometer. Before the measurements, the bike will be used for warming for 5&#xD;
      minutes without resistance. The test will be performed 5 times at 120 ̊/sec angular speeds.&#xD;
      The peak torque values of the results will be recorded in 'N / m'.&#xD;
