    <textblock>
      Pilot study to understand the impact of a digital health system, including a phone app and a&#xD;
      vaginal probe to treat fecal incontinence in women&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria at screening will complete training in&#xD;
      behavioral therapy for the treatment of fecal incontinence and training in the use of the&#xD;
      Leva pelvic digital health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then participate in 10 weeks of at home pelvic floor muscle training using the&#xD;
      leva device twice daily for 2 ½ minutes of training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to the training protocol will be observed digitally, and subjects will receive&#xD;
      phone calls every other week from research assistants reviewing their adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are expected to participate in at least 80% of the weekly exercises (11 weekly).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to clinic at 5- and 10-weeks during the study to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires. At 5-weeks, subjects will review the use of the device with the study&#xD;
      assistant, who will answer any questions and repeat training if the subject desires&#xD;
      additional training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following 10 weeks of training, subjects will be free to pursue any additional therapies, but&#xD;
      will also retain the leva device and may continue its use if desired. Adherence will be&#xD;
      monitored for one additional year, with follow up surveys to be completed by mail or&#xD;
      digitally at 6- and 12-months&#xD;
