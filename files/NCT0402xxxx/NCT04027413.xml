  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common smoking-related lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) is a six-week supervised group exercise and education class. PR&#xD;
      is an effective intervention in COPD to reduce symptoms, improve exercise performance and&#xD;
      prevent exacerbation. Exercise intolerance/limitation is one of the commonest issues with&#xD;
      COPD patients and this may be compounded by reduced muscle mass and malnutrition. COPD&#xD;
      patients lose body weight and skeletal muscle mass which leads to muscle weakness and&#xD;
      dysfunction, thus impacting functional ability and quality of life. Muscle weakness is caused&#xD;
      by a prolonged sedentary lifestyle and voluntary immobilization. Importantly, being&#xD;
      under-weight is associated with an increased risk of mortality in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional supplementation have been used to overcome malnutrition in COPD patients. It has&#xD;
      been shown that nutritional support integrated with exercise training can improve exercise&#xD;
      activity, decreased the risk of mortality, and improve muscle strength in undernourished COPD&#xD;
      patients. However, uptake of nutritional supplementation during pulmonary rehabilitation,&#xD;
      where the potential benefit may be greatest, has been limited by the absence of rigorous&#xD;
      evidence-based studies supporting use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators want to investigate the effect of a nutritional supplement during a PR program&#xD;
      on exercise capacity in COPD patients. Investigators will collect demographic data,&#xD;
      distribute questionnaires, measure exercise performance, and some additional measurements.&#xD;
