  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent acute pancreatitis and recurrent relapses of inflammation in chronic pancreatitis&#xD;
      are an important problem. In some cases, prevention of these acute flares of inflammation is&#xD;
      not possible. Population-based studies and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      suggest that statins may decrease the incidence of acute pancreatitis. SIMBA aims to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of simvastatin on the incidence of new episodes of pancreatitis in&#xD;
      recurrent acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis. This is a non-profit,&#xD;
      researcher-driven placebo-controlled multicenter (27 Spanish centers) randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute pancreatitis (AP) is the 3rd cause of hospital admission due to gastrointestinal&#xD;
      disease. Approximately 20% of the patients will relapse after a first episode of AP. The low&#xD;
      frequency of relapse in biliary AP is due to the high effectiveness of cholecystectomy but a&#xD;
      first episode of AP due to alcoholic or other etiologies is associated with relapse in one&#xD;
      every four patients. Currently, besides counselling for alcohol and tobacco abstinence, there&#xD;
      is no specific medical treatment that changes the natural history of recurrent AP. Recurrent&#xD;
      AP is an intermediary stage in the pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis (CP) and a subset of&#xD;
      recurrent AP patients during their natural course transition to CP (one every three&#xD;
      patients). Forty-five percent of patients with CP experience intermittent flares of pain.&#xD;
      Simvastatin has been associated to a decrease in the incidence of AP in a population-based&#xD;
      study (Wu et al, Gut. 2015) and in a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (Preiss et&#xD;
      al, JAMA 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of SIMBA (SIMvastatin in the prevention of recurrent pancreatitis, a triple&#xD;
      Blind rAndomized controlled multicenter trial) is to compare the recurrence rate of&#xD;
      pancreatitis in patients with established recurrent pancreatitis (acute pancreatitis and&#xD;
      acute flares in chronic pancreatitis) consuming simvastatin versus placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are 1) to compare in patients with recurrent AP at the end of follow-up&#xD;
      period the progression to chronic pancreatitis on imaging (calcifications and/or dilated&#xD;
      ductal system), as well as endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function; 2) to compare the&#xD;
      severity of recurrent pancreatitis between both treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: SIMBA is a triple-blind randomized placebo-controlled, parallel-group, superiority&#xD;
      multicenter (27 Spanish centers) trial. This final protocol (version 4) was finished on June&#xD;
      20th 2018.&#xD;
