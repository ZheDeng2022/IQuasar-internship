      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect on driving performance of a single dose of&#xD;
      amphetamine extended-release tablets (20 mg/tablet) compared with placebo at 45 minutes and&#xD;
      10 hours post-dose in young adults with ADHD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At a single US-based study site, a driving simulation will be used to assess the effect on&#xD;
      driving performance for the co-primary endpoints, study subjects' driving performance at 45&#xD;
      minutes and 10 hours post-dose, compared with placebo. Eligible subjects will be prescreened&#xD;
      for ADHD but otherwise healthy, aged 18-25 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Driving simulations that simulate common driving events to which the study subject must&#xD;
      react. The reactions to each event will be assessed. Using a parallel-group design, subjects&#xD;
      will be assessed while on study drug, and while on placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse events and&#xD;
      vital signs at 4 hours post-dose.&#xD;
