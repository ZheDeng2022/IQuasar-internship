    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, non-blinded, research study undergoing robotic-assisted&#xD;
      laparoscopic prostatectomy at the University of Missouri/Ellis Fischel Hospital. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion. Data also will be tracked on those who are&#xD;
      post-operatively stratified by cancer grade and addition of radiation therapy (XRT) as XRT&#xD;
      after surgery is dependent on participant pathology therefore would not be able to be&#xD;
      determined in advance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be broken up into four phases, as described in detail below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urologic oncology team will consist of a urologic oncologist/surgeon, urologic nurse,&#xD;
           and oncology nurse navigator practicing in a specialty oncology hospital which is part&#xD;
           of a large regional hospital network in the Midwest section of the United States. A&#xD;
           pelvic health physical therapist will be an additional member of this team practicing&#xD;
           primarily in outpatient based clinics affiliated with a with the same large regional&#xD;
           hospital network.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrollment will be offered during first hospital visit with urologic oncology team&#xD;
           confirming diagnosis of prostate cancer in and decision for robotic radical&#xD;
           prostatectomy. Enrollment goal will be at least 40 men but caps at 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The capture of participants for enrollment will be limited to a 12 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consent is obtained and the participant is enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the time of enrollment, all participants will have baseline measurements taken to&#xD;
           obtain baseline physical assessment, complete baseline quality of life questionnaires,&#xD;
           and receive education on exercises to begin as prehabilitation protocol prior to&#xD;
           surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Baseline questionnaires include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. National Institute of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Beck's Depression Index (BDI)&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After obtaining written consent, subjects will be randomized to receive post-operative&#xD;
           pelvic health physical therapy (Rehab group) or no post-operative intervention&#xD;
           (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both groups will be given pre-operative prehabilitative exercise program and education&#xD;
           of continence behavioral training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the time of enrollment, all participants the will receive the same educational packet&#xD;
           and home exercise program education from the urologic oncology team.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Home exercise (prehabilitative) protocol: transverse abdominus activation training,&#xD;
           deep diaphragmatic breathing, urinary continence behavioral training and training for&#xD;
           pelvic floor muscle proper activation using cues of &quot;shorten the penis&quot; for isolation of&#xD;
           the muscles of urinary continence and &quot;tighten around the anus&quot; for posterior pelvic&#xD;
           floor activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perioperative care, surgery and anesthesia, for all subjects will be per standard&#xD;
           hospital protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the preoperative visit (1-2 week prior to surgery), both Rehab and Control group&#xD;
           participants will meet with a physical therapist who specializes in orthopedic and&#xD;
           pelvic health interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group will not meet with a physical therapist at the preoperative visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o No additional education, teaching or rehabilitative intervention will be implemented&#xD;
           outside of enrollment visit for the control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective measurements to be assessed by pelvic health physical therapist may include:&#xD;
           Pelvic floor observation (ability to contract, relax and resting tone); pelvic floor&#xD;
           manual muscle testing (MMT) for strength assessment using internal and RUSI measuring&#xD;
           power, endurance and &quot;quick flick ability&quot;; abdominal wall mobility and scar/incision&#xD;
           mobility (once adequately healed); core muscle activation mechanics and strength&#xD;
           (including transverse abdominus, oblique and rectus abdominus); breathing mechanics;&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Subjective measurements to be assessed by pelvic health physical therapist may include:&#xD;
           pain rating, number of pads/diapers used daily, sexual activity and function, bowel&#xD;
           consistency and frequency, urinary urgency and frequency, and level of urinary&#xD;
           incontinence or leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will see physical therapist 1 time total prior to surgery to review deficit&#xD;
           areas, review pelvic floor muscle activation/strengthening exercises and educate on&#xD;
           expected deficits post-prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radical robotic prostatectomy (RALP) will be performed by Urologic Oncologist. If the&#xD;
           surgical intervention plan is altered so that participant is no longer eligible for RALP&#xD;
           or additional surgical interventions are needed, participant will be excluded from&#xD;
           further study enrollment and hence dismissed from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will be discharged from hospital based on surgeon discretion and&#xD;
           appropriateness. Foley catheter will stay in place 14 days (+/- 7 days).&#xD;

        -  Only the Rehab group participants will meet with a physical therapist who specializes in&#xD;
           orthopedic and pelvic health interventions, Control group will do no formal physical&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group will be administered repeat baseline questionnaires via email, mail or&#xD;
           phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Re-evaluation of all baseline measurements and questionnaires will be repeated for the&#xD;
           randomly assigned Rehab group and implementation of customized exercise plans to improve&#xD;
           post-operative deficit areas will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Outpatient physical therapy intervention may include but not be limited to spinal&#xD;
           stabilization activities, pelvic floor muscle re-education using digital/proprioceptive&#xD;
           training as well as rehabilitative ultrasound imaging (RUSI), manual therapy&#xD;
           (scar/myofascial mobilization), patient education and urinary continence behavioral&#xD;
           training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biofeedback training will be utilized with digital/manual and RUSI only; there will be&#xD;
           no passive internal probe biofeedback based training utilized in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rehab group participants will be seen by the same physical therapist once a week for 12&#xD;
           weeks (8-12 sessions, 45 minutes each).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Appropriate re-evaluative objective and subjective measurements will be taken at 6 weeks&#xD;
           post-operatively and 12 weeks post-operatively during final physical therapy visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the 3 month follow-up with urologic oncology team, a pelvic health physical&#xD;
           therapist will re-assess baseline subjective and objective measurements for Control&#xD;
           groups and Rehab group as needed (if not obtained at 12 week final physical therapy&#xD;
           visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both Rehab group and Control groups will be given repeat baseline questionnaires at 3&#xD;
           month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will follow up with urologic oncologist and nurse navigator for regular&#xD;
           prostate cancer check-ups at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months,&#xD;

      RECRUITMENT PLAN Participants will be recruited from the practices of the Division of&#xD;
      Urologic Oncology, Department of Surgery at the University of Missouri/Ellis Fischel&#xD;
      Hospital. The study will be introduced to every eligible patient scheduled for robot assisted&#xD;
      laparoscopic prostatectomy by the participating consenting urologic oncologist from the&#xD;
      Department of Surgery-Urology Division and a written consent obtained prior to surgery by the&#xD;
      consenting research personnel. Candidate subjects will be provided time to consider the&#xD;
      study, to read the informed consent document at their convenience, and discuss the study with&#xD;
      family and others, as desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRETREATMENT EVALUATION This study does not require any additional pretreatment evaluations&#xD;
      other than those which are part of current clinical care standards for a patient undergoing&#xD;
      RALP at University of Missouri. Preoperative evaluations follow recommendations from the&#xD;
      NICE.47, 48&#xD;
&#xD;
      For RALP these include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine history and physical examination to include documentation of any comorbidities,&#xD;
           medications (including complementary and alternative medications), family history,&#xD;
           social history (alcohol and tobacco usage), height, body weight, Karnofsky performance&#xD;
           status within 30 days of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest X-ray or CT scan of the Chest within 30 days of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-operative laboratory investigations: CBC, BMP, urinalysis (dipstick, microalbumin,&#xD;
           creatinine, microscopic evaluation if indicated), urine culture if indicated within 30&#xD;
           days of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline EKG&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGICAL INTERVENTION PLAN The technique of surgery will be robotic assisted laparoscopy&#xD;
      based on the discretion of the surgeon and participant. None of the techniques utilized in&#xD;
      the study are considered experimental and all are considered standard therapeutic options for&#xD;
      the patient with prostate cancer concerning for cancer amenable to prostatectomy,&#xD;
      respectively. Participant medications will be recorded from the home medications list and&#xD;
      managed perioperatively per institutional standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operating team will consist of the Medical Director and Urologic Oncologist on faculty at&#xD;
      University of Missouri Department of Surgery-Urology Division. The procedures are performed&#xD;
      under standardized general anesthesia with standard intraoperative vital sign monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVALUATION DURING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION This protocol does not require any additional&#xD;
      evaluations after the subject is admitted for surgery other than those routinely part of&#xD;
      clinical care for a patient undergoing robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy other than&#xD;
      inquiring for subjects' satisfaction on postop day one and monitoring for signs severe&#xD;
      adverse effects during inpatient hospitalization. If severe adverse effects are suspected the&#xD;
      appropriate treatment will be given per the standard of care at University of Missouri/Ellis&#xD;
      Fischel Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine evaluation and management for those undergoing robot assisted laparoscopic&#xD;
      prostatectomy include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ASA classification, assigned by the anesthesiologist&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis per standardized pathway&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated blood loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of intraoperative fluids (crystalloid, colloid, blood products)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT If the surgery is aborted for any reason&#xD;
      before attempted excision of the mass fails for any reason, the participant will be removed&#xD;
      from the study and replaced. Based on past experience these issues are rare events. If any&#xD;
      robotic procedure converts to an open procedure, the participant will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study. The postoperative period is defined as the period from the extubation to the study&#xD;
      endpoint at 24 month post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY Participants will be withdrawn from the study if a desire is&#xD;
      expressed to do so, if it is determined to be in the participant's best interest to do so, or&#xD;
      if the individual does not undergo initiation of their surgical procedure as stipulated&#xD;
      previously. If surgery is converted from robotic assisted to open the subject will be&#xD;
      excluded from analysis. Occurrence of new cancer onset, or metastasis that requires&#xD;
      additional surgical intervention or unpredicted treatments, participants will be withdrawn&#xD;
      from the study. Participants who are not evaluable for the study primary endpoint by failure&#xD;
      to obtain data for the primary endpoint will be excluded from the study and further analysis&#xD;
      will not be performed.&#xD;
