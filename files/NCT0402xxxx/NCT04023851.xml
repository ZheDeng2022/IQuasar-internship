  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to evaluate the impact of mobile application on management and&#xD;
      knowledge acquisition in patients with epilepsy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators assess the general and personal knowledge of epilepsy, compliance of&#xD;
      antiepileptic drugs (AED), and self efficacy scale. Participants be asked to use the mobile&#xD;
      application (Brain4U) and record seizure type, frequency of seizures, aggravating factors,&#xD;
      and adverse events related to antiepileptic drugs for 2 month period.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of knowledge acquisition in epilepsy</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline and 2 month Timepoint scores from questionnaires are assessed. Improvement in knowledge acquisition and self-efficacy by using questionnaire.&#xD;
Genetal knowledge (G) Questionnaire:&#xD;
There are total 10 questions (1 point score for each question) to evaluate general knowlege about epilepsy.&#xD;
Score reported as (mean, SD), higher scores are better. Score ranges 0 to 10.&#xD;
Persional knowledge (P) questionnaire:&#xD;
There are total 4 questions (1 point score for each question) to evaluate knowlege about individual's epilepsy.&#xD;
Score reported as (mean, SD), higher scores are better. Score ranges 0 to 4.&#xD;
Self-efficacy scale (SE): There are 4 questions (1 point score for each question) to evaluate self-efficacy scale.&#xD;
Score reported as (mean, SD), higher scores are better. Score ranges 0 to 4.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>AED compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline and 2 month Timepoint AED compliances are reported.&#xD;
Assess improvement of AED compliance by comparing &quot;Days with AED per month&quot; before and after using mobile application.&#xD;
Count the &quot;Days with AED&quot; in a month and converted to the percentage.&#xD;
Percentage ranges 0 to 100%. The high percentage means good compliance which means less AED skipping in a month.</description>
