  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soft tissue sarcoma is a relatively rare malignant tumor with an incidence of about&#xD;
      1-2/100,000. The best way to obtain evidence-based medical evidence is to participate in&#xD;
      clinical trials with new drugs (especially targeted drugs and immunotherapy). Chidamide, an&#xD;
      oral subtype-selective histone deacetylase inhibitor monotherapy was effective on the&#xD;
      patients with hematological tumors by inhibiting HDAC activity and other ways, showing good&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) may also reverse drug resistance&#xD;
      or inefficiency of immunoassay inhibitors, and combination therapy has shown preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy in a variety of tumors.Because of the poor prognosis of advanced soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcoma, there is no standard second-line treatment. Therefore, we think it is necessary to&#xD;
      explore the feasibility of combination of chidamide and Toripalimab monoclonal antibody in&#xD;
      advanced, refractory and progressive soft tissue sarcoma after failure of standard treatment,&#xD;
      and look forward to further improving the efficacy of soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) can inhibit many kinds of hematological tumors by&#xD;
      inhibiting HDAC activity and other ways, showing good anti-tumor activity. Chidamide is a new&#xD;
      chemical structure benzamide HDAC inhibitor developed independently in China. It has the&#xD;
      selectivity of HDAC subtypes and unique efficacy. In a phase II clinical study of Chidamide&#xD;
      in the treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma in China in 2009, 79 patients with recurrent&#xD;
      or refractory lymphoma had ORR of 27.9%. The 2016 edition of the Chinese Expert Consensus on&#xD;
      Chidamide in the Treatment of PTCL discussed in detail the treatment of Chidamide alone or in&#xD;
      combination with other drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The representative drug of immunological checkpoint inhibitors is programmed death 1&#xD;
      (PD-1/PD-L1). PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy activates the body's own immune system to attack&#xD;
      cancer cells by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway with drugs. Immunotherapy show its long-term&#xD;
      control of cancer and its effectiveness in a variety of cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a multicenter phase II clinical trial, 80 patients with bone and soft tissue sarcoma were&#xD;
      treated with single drug of PD-1 antibody Pembrolizumab. The results showed that all the&#xD;
      patients with soft tissue sarcoma achieved therapeutic effect were undifferentiated&#xD;
      pleomorphic sarcoma and liposarcoma. The overall objective remission rate was 18% (7/40),&#xD;
      suggesting that Pembrolizumab alone does not fully activate suppressed T cells, and may need&#xD;
      to be combined to improve the efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that combination of epigenetic regulators, such as histone&#xD;
      deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), can overcome some major drug resistance constraints and&#xD;
      ensure patient safety. Pre-clinical data based on mouse models strongly support the&#xD;
      feasibility and effectiveness of combination therapy. In vitro and in vivo studies, combined&#xD;
      use of pan- or class I selective HDACi can benefit further. Chidamide is mainly targeted at&#xD;
      subtypes 1, 2, 3 and 10 of HDAC class I and class II B. It has a regulatory effect on the&#xD;
      abnormal epigenetic function of tumors. By inhibiting the related HDAC subtypes to increase&#xD;
      the acetylation level of chromatin histone, chromatin remodeling is initiated, which changes&#xD;
      the gene expression of multiple signal transduction pathways (i.e. epigenetic changes),&#xD;
      thereby inhibiting the cell cycle of tumors, inducing apoptosis of tumors, and having overall&#xD;
      regulatory activity on cellular immunity. Induction and enhancement of natural killer cells&#xD;
      (NK) and antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) mediated tumor killing. Chidamide can also&#xD;
      enhance the mechanism of dendritic cells presenting and maturing tumor antigens, inhibiting&#xD;
      regulatory T cells (Treg) and MDSC cells, and promote the anti-tumor immune function through&#xD;
      regulating the micro-environment of tumor immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the poor prognosis of advanced soft tissue sarcoma, there is no standard treatment&#xD;
      for second-line treatment. Therefore, we think it is necessary to explore the feasibility of&#xD;
      combination of chidamide and Toripalimab in advanced, refractory and progressive soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcoma after failure of standard treatment, and look forward to further improving the&#xD;
      efficacy of soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;
