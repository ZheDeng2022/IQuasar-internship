      Background/Aims: Diabetes, which affects 420 million people worldwide with a continuously&#xD;
      rising incidence, is defined by a state of chronic hyperglycemia; a criterion referring to a&#xD;
      heterogeneous group of diseases with various etiologies and distinct therapeutic options.&#xD;
      Besides the two main forms of diabetes (i.e., type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D)), there are rare&#xD;
      subtypes of the disease called monogenic diabetes (or formerly MODY) that are hardly&#xD;
      diagnosed because of their resemblance to T1D or T2D. Since these monogenic diabetes may&#xD;
      appear early in life, a consortium of expert pediatric clinical centers was created under a&#xD;
      clinical research initiative (the GENEPEDIAB study) to develop tools for accurate diagnosis&#xD;
      of rare diabetes and to propose appropriate care to these children and adolescents wrongly&#xD;
      assigned to T1D or T2D cohorts. The GENEPEDIAB study was initiated in the context of a&#xD;
      broader collaborative project (DiaType) with the objective to develop personalized diabetes&#xD;
      medicine and better patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: For discrimination of patients with monogenic diabetes from those with classical&#xD;
      forms of diabetes using the MODY probability calculator, patients enrolled in the GENEPEDIAB&#xD;
      study are phenotyped and genotyped for T1D risk (anti-islet antibodies and HLA). Patients&#xD;
      fulfilling sufficient criteria are then genotyped using the routine MODY panel, before being&#xD;
      proposed a thorough gene analysis. More comprehensive genetic tests will be conducted in&#xD;
      patients without anomalies found after the MODY gene-sequencing test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective: the GENEPEDIAB study will enable the investigators to adapt treatment to&#xD;
      diabetes etiology and help to provide genetic counseling to patients and their family&#xD;
      members. The investigators anticipate that its broad genetic analyses will provide them with&#xD;
      important information about the genetic susceptibility of these subgroups of patients with&#xD;
      atypical diabetes.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes currently affects 420 million people worldwide, a number that is expected to&#xD;
      increase to 642 million in 2040. This disease is responsible for a high morbidity rate and an&#xD;
      overall mortality equivalent to 5 million deaths per year. In Belgium, the prevalence of&#xD;
      diabetes is estimated at 8% in adults over 35 years of age, the risk of diabetes being 3 to 5&#xD;
      times higher in populations with high consanguinity, mainly due to the susceptibility to&#xD;
      generate recessive genetic variants, which are characteristic of atypical forms of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although diabetes is linearly defined by a state of chronic hyperglycaemia, this criterion&#xD;
      refers to a heterogeneous group of diseases of various aetiologies and distinct therapeutic&#xD;
      options. Ten to 15% of diabetic patients have insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes (T1D),&#xD;
      attributed to autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells, while 80% of patients&#xD;
      have type 2 diabetes (T2DM), treated - inter alia - with oral antidiabetic drugs. Despite the&#xD;
      diagnosis of T1D is confirmed by the determination of specific antibodies, DT1 and T2D are&#xD;
      clinically characterized by the phenotypic type and evolution of the patient, without&#xD;
      recourse to specific etiological and/or pathognomonic criteria. Recently, subtypes of T1D and&#xD;
      T2D have been categorized to help the clinician choose the best therapeutic interventions for&#xD;
      the patient (i.e., dietary approach, physical activity, oral antidiabetic drugs, insulin,&#xD;
      combined therapies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monogenic causes of diabetes are less common (up to 5% of all cases) and of recent discovery,&#xD;
      their molecular basis having been established in the 1990s, under the name &quot;maturity onset&#xD;
      diabetes of the young&quot; (MODY). The diagnosis of a genetic origin of diabetes has multiple&#xD;
      consequences, primarily at therapeutic level. Despite the implications of a monogenic&#xD;
      diabetes diagnosis, this form remains largely underdiagnosed, and it is accepted that 2 to 3%&#xD;
      of active patients within diabetes conventions of care suffer from undetected genetic forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening, using routinely diagnostic tools, of monogenic forms of diabetes in cohorts of&#xD;
      paediatric patients with atypical forms of diabetes, who are followed in conventions of care&#xD;
      for diabetic patients. After diagnosis of monogenic forms of diabetes, screened patients will&#xD;
      be monitored and treated according to international recommendations applied to specifically&#xD;
      recognized forms of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of GENEPEDIAB study is to improve the diagnosis of atypical forms of diabetes in&#xD;
      children and adolescents, and not to evaluate the effects of treatment modification following&#xD;
      genetic screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Retrospective analysis of data from active and historical diabetic patients within&#xD;
           diabetes care conventions of paediatric endocrinology services; screening of patients&#xD;
           with atypical diabetes; use of clinical routine tests to allow genetic diagnosis of the&#xD;
           condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prospective analysis of the evolution of new diabetic patients followed in paediatric&#xD;
           diabetes care conventions; screening of patients with atypical diabetes; use of clinical&#xD;
           routine tests to allow genetic diagnosis of the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Screening of patients with atypical diabetes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The monogenic diabetes probability will initially be assessed using the MODY&#xD;
                probability calculator (old terminology for monogenic diabetes), which identifies&#xD;
                at risk patients based on clinical history (age, sex, body mass index, HbA1C, type&#xD;
                of therapy, presence of diabetes in the family). This calculator is available on&#xD;
                Internet at www.diabetesgenes.org.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In addition, other clinical criteria will be used to improve the sensitivity and&#xD;
                specificity of screening for monogenic diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Genetic diagnosis of the condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The diagnosis of T1D will first be completed based on factors currently recognized&#xD;
                by the International Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD): anti&#xD;
                islet antibodies and at risk HLA genotype. Residual insulin secretion will be also&#xD;
                evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects that are detected using criteria described above will be screened using&#xD;
                the routine MODY gene sequencing test, which includes GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B,&#xD;
                KCNJ11, ABCC8, and INS gene sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  More comprehensive genetic tests will be conducted in patients without anomalies&#xD;
                found after the MODY gene-sequencing test.&#xD;
