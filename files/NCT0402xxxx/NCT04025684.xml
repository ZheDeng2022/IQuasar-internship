  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical methodology development study will evaluate the plaque removal efficacy of four&#xD;
      marketed manual toothbrushes, with differing bristle types and brush head designs, in healthy&#xD;
      dentate participants. Changes in supra-gingival plaque accumulation will be assessed after&#xD;
      first use and following 1-and 4-weeks treatment (twice-daily brushing), using two different&#xD;
      clinical measures of dental plaque. Study participants will abstain from oral hygiene for a&#xD;
      period of 12-18 hours prior to each assessment visit. Data generated will inform the design&#xD;
      of future clinical studies investigating the plaque removal efficacy of manual toothbrushes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, 4-week, randomized, controlled, examiner-blind, four-treatment&#xD;
      arm, parallel design, clinical methodology development study to investigate the plaque&#xD;
      removal efficacy of marketed manual toothbrushes in healthy, dentate participants. Changes in&#xD;
      plaque level will be evaluated after first brushing, after two further single brushing events&#xD;
      (Days 7 and 28) and following 7 and 28 days usage (twice daily brushing with assigned&#xD;
      toothbrush treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supra-gingival plaque levels will be assessed using two established clinical measures: the&#xD;
      Rustogi Modified Navy Plaque Index (RPI) and the 6-site Turesky Modified Quigley and Hein&#xD;
      Plaque Index (TPI). Participants will abstain from oral hygiene for a period of 12-18 hours&#xD;
      prior to each assessment visit. Participants with Day 0 pre-brushing mean RPI overall ≥ 0.6&#xD;
      will be stratified by their Day 0 pre-brushing RPI score (lower: mean RPI overall ≥ 0.6 to ≤&#xD;
      0.8; higher: mean RPI overall; 0.8 to 1.0) and randomized to study treatment (Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To standardize oral hygiene practice, eligible participants will complete a lead-in period&#xD;
      (minimum 5 days) prior to Visit 2 during which they will brush with the toothbrush and&#xD;
      regular fluoride toothpaste provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and oral tolerability of each study toothbrush will be monitored after first use&#xD;
      and over the 28-day usage period by review of reported treatment emergent adverse events&#xD;
      (TEAEs).&#xD;

    <time_frame>At Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Supra-gingival plaque was assessed on the facial and lingual surfaces of the teeth (7-7 each arch) using RPI. Each tooth surface was divided into 9 zones, for a total of 18 sites per tooth (A to I facial with 9 sites and lingual with 9 sites separately); A to C along gingival margin; D to F directly above A to C (D and F being inter-proximal zones); G to H across middle of tooth; and I covered incisal area. Plaque was disclosed and presence or absence of plaque in each zone was recorded as per scoring criteria: 0-Plaque absent, 1-Plaque present; where lower score represents better result. An average score for a participant was generated by averaging across all sites and surfaces of all teeth assessed. Change from pre-brushing = (post-brushing score - pre-brushing score). Overall mean calculated for all participants was reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Pre to Post Brushing in Overall Mean Rustogi Modified Navy Plaque Index (RPI) After a Single Brushing Event at Day 0</title>
        <description>Supra-gingival plaque was assessed on the facial and lingual surfaces of the teeth (7-7 each arch) using RPI. Each tooth surface was divided into 9 zones, for a total of 18 sites per tooth (A to I facial with 9 sites and lingual with 9 sites separately); A to C along gingival margin; D to F directly above A to C (D and F being inter-proximal zones); G to H across middle of tooth; and I covered incisal area. Plaque was disclosed and presence or absence of plaque in each zone was recorded as per scoring criteria: 0-Plaque absent, 1-Plaque present; where lower score represents better result. An average score for a participant was generated by averaging across all sites and surfaces of all teeth assessed. Change from pre-brushing = (post-brushing score - pre-brushing score). Overall mean calculated for all participants was reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Pre to Post Brushing in Overall Mean Turesky Modified Quigley &amp; Hein Plaque Index (TPI) After a Single Brushing Event at Day 0</title>
        <description>Supra-gingival plaque accumulation was assessed on facial and lingual surfaces of teeth (7-7 in each arch) using TPI. Plaque was assessed with each tooth being divided into 6 areas including mesiofacial, facial, distofacial, mesiolingual, lingual and distolingual surfaces and scored for each site on a scale of 0 to 5: 0-No plaque, 1-Slight flecks of plaque at cervical margin of tooth, 2-Thin, continuous band of plaque (1millimetre [mm] or smaller) at cervical margin of tooth, 3-Band of plaque wider than 1mm but covering less than 1/3 of area, 4-Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of area, 5-Plaque covering 2/3 or more of crown of tooth; where lower score represents better result. An average score for a participant was generated by averaging across all sites and surfaces of all teeth assessed. Change from pre-brushing = (post-brushing score - pre-brushing score). Overall mean calculated for all participants was reported.</description>

        <description>Supra-gingival plaque was assessed on the facial and lingual surfaces of the teeth (7-7 each arch) using RPI. Each tooth surface was divided into 9 zones, for a total of 18 sites per tooth (A to I facial with 9 sites and lingual with 9 sites separately); A to C along gingival margin; D to F directly above A to C (D and F being inter-proximal zones); G to H across middle of tooth; and I covered incisal area. Plaque was disclosed and presence or absence of plaque in each zone was recorded as per scoring criteria: 0-Plaque absent, 1-Plaque present; where lower score represents better result. An average score for a participant was generated by averaging across all sites and surfaces of all teeth assessed. Change from Day 0 pre-brushing at Day 7/28 = (post-brushing score at Day 7/28- pre-brushing score at Day 0). Overall mean calculated for all participants was reported.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline (Day 0 Pre-Brushing) to Post-Brushing in Overall Mean Turesky Modified Quigley &amp; Hein Plaque Index (TPI) at Day 7 and Day 28</title>
          <description>Supra-gingival plaque accumulation was assessed on facial and lingual surfaces of teeth (7-7 in each arch) using TPI. Plaque was assessed with each tooth being divided into 6 areas including mesiofacial, facial, distofacial, mesiolingual, lingual and distolingual surfaces and scored for each site on a scale of 0 to 5: 0-No plaque, 1-Slight flecks of plaque at cervical margin of tooth, 2-Thin, continuous band of plaque (1mm or smaller) at cervical margin of tooth, 3-Band of plaque wider than 1mm but covering less than 1/3 of area, 4-Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of area, 5-Plaque covering 2/3 or more of crown of tooth; where lower score represents better result. An average score for a participant was generated by averaging across all sites and surfaces of all teeth assessed. Change from Day 0 pre-brushing at Day 7/28 = (post-brushing score at Day 7/28- pre-brushing score at Day 0). Overall mean calculated for all participants was reported.</description>

          <description>Supra-gingival plaque accumulation was assessed on facial and lingual surfaces of teeth (7-7 in each arch) using TPI. Plaque was assessed with each tooth being divided into 6 areas including mesiofacial, facial, distofacial, mesiolingual, lingual and distolingual surfaces and scored for each site on a scale of 0 to 5: 0-No plaque, 1-Slight flecks of plaque at cervical margin of tooth, 2-Thin, continuous band of plaque (1mm or smaller) at cervical margin of tooth, 3-Band of plaque wider than 1mm but covering less than 1/3 of area, 4-Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of area, 5-Plaque covering 2/3 or more of crown of tooth; where lower score represents better result. An average score for a participant was generated by averaging across all sites and surfaces of all teeth assessed. Overall mean calculated for all participants was reported.</description>
          <population>mITT comprised all randomized participants who had a postbaseline plaque assessment. Here, number analyzed indicates participants with available data for each category.</population>

          <title>Gingival Margin Sites Mean Rustogi Modified Navy Plaque Index (RPI) Pre- and Post-brushing at Day 0, Day 7 and Day 28</title>
          <description>Supra-gingival plaque accumulation was assessed for gingival zone A to C. Plaque was disclosed and presence or absence of plaque in each zone was recorded as per scoring criteria: 0-Plaque absent, 1-Plaque present; where lower score represents better result. An average score for a participant was generated by averaging across all sites and surfaces of all teeth assessed. Mean calculated for all participants was reported.</description>
          <population>mITT comprised all randomized participants who had a postbaseline plaque assessment. Here, number analyzed indicates participants with available data for each category.</population>

        <title>Inter-Proximal Sites Mean Turesky Modified Quigley &amp; Hein Plaque Index (TPI) Pre- and Post-brushing TPI at Day 0, Day 7 and Day 28</title>
        <description>Supra-gingival plaque accumulation was assessed for inter-proximal zones D to F. Plaque was disclosed and scored for each site on a scale of 0 to 5: 0-No plaque, 1-Slight flecks of plaque at cervical margin of tooth, 2-Thin, continuous band of plaque (1mm or smaller) at cervical margin of tooth, 3-Band of plaque wider than 1mm but covering less than 1/3 of area, 4-Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of area, 5-Plaque covering 2/3 or more of crown of tooth; where lower score represents better result. An average score for a participant was generated by averaging across all sites and surfaces of all teeth assessed. Mean calculated for all participants was reported.</description>

        <population>mITT comprised all randomized participants who had a postbaseline plaque assessment. Here, number analyzed indicates participants with available data for each category.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Day 0 Pre-Brushing) in Overall Rustogi Modified Navy Plaque Index (RPI) at Day 7 Pre-brushing and Day 28 Pre-brushing</title>
        <description>Supra-gingival plaque was assessed on the facial and lingual surfaces of the teeth (7-7 each arch) using RPI. Each tooth surface was divided into 9 zones, for a total of 18 sites per tooth (A to I facial with 9 sites and lingual with 9 sites separately); A to C along gingival margin; D to F directly above A to C (D and F being inter-proximal zones); G to H across middle of tooth; and I covered incisal area. Plaque was disclosed and presence or absence of plaque in each zone was recorded as per scoring criteria: 0-Plaque absent, 1-Plaque present; where lower score represents better result. An average score for a participant was generated by averaging across all sites and surfaces of all teeth assessed. Change from Day 0 pre-brushing at Day 7/28= (pre-brushing score at Day 7/28- pre-brushing score at Day 0). Overall mean calculated for all participants was reported.</description>

        <description>Supra-gingival plaque accumulation was assessed on facial and lingual surfaces of teeth (7-7 in each arch) using TPI. Plaque was assessed with each tooth being divided into 6 areas including mesiofacial, facial, distofacial, mesiolingual, lingual and distolingual surfaces and scored for each site on a scale of 0 to 5: 0-No plaque, 1-Slight flecks of plaque at cervical margin of tooth, 2-Thin, continuous band of plaque (1mm or smaller) at cervical margin of tooth, 3-Band of plaque wider than 1mm but covering less than 1/3 of area, 4-Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of area, 5-Plaque covering 2/3 or more of crown of tooth; where lower score represents better result. An average score for a participant was generated by averaging across all sites and surfaces of all teeth assessed. Change from Day 0 pre-brushing at Day 7/28= (pre-brushing score at Day 7/28- pre-brushing score at Day 0). Overall mean calculated for all participants was reported.</description>
