  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activating mutations in the fms like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene are observed in&#xD;
      approximately 30% of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Addition of&#xD;
      the multitargeted kinase inhibitor midostaurin to standard chemotherapy prolongs event-free&#xD;
      survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with a FLT3 mutation. Gilteritinib is a&#xD;
      more potent and more specific inhibitor of mutant FLT3 in comparison to midostaurin and has&#xD;
      shown promising clinical activity in AML.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AML and MDS-EB2 are malignant diseases of the bone marrow. The standard treatment for these&#xD;
      diseases is chemotherapy. A subgroup of these diseases is characterized by a specific error&#xD;
      in the DNA of the leukemic cells. This is the FLT3 mutation, which leads to a change of a&#xD;
      certain protein (FLT3) on the blasts. This altered protein plays an important role in the&#xD;
      development of leukemia and the survival of leukemic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FLT3 can be inhibited by the drug midostaurin. Adding midostaurin to chemotherapy leads to&#xD;
      better treatment results in patients with AML. Therefore, the standard treatment for AML or&#xD;
      MDS-EB2 with a FLT3 mutation (FLT3-AML) is a combination of chemotherapy and midostaurin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gilteritinib is also a drug that inhibits FLT3. In laboratory studies, gilteritinib was found&#xD;
      to be significantly more specific and potent than midostaurin in inhibiting FLT3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gilteritinib has subsequently been studied in patients with AML, who relapsed after previous&#xD;
      treatment with chemotherapy. This resulted in a much larger number of complete remissions&#xD;
      than previously seen when comparable patients were treated with midostaurin.&#xD;
