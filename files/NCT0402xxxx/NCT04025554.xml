      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS). People who have MS&#xD;
      may have lesions that form on parts of the CNS, such as the brain. Some of these lesions may&#xD;
      be inflamed for a long time. This causes MS to progress. There is no treatment for these&#xD;
      lesions. Researchers believe that a drug that decreases inflammation can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if a drug called anakinra can help clear inflammation in MS brain lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 and older with MS and at least one white matter lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with one or more Neuroimmunology Clinic protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical history and physical exam. They will have blood and urine&#xD;
      tests. They will have a lumbar puncture. For this, a needle is inserted between the bones in&#xD;
      the back, and cerebrospinal fluid is removed. They will also have an MRI of the brain. The&#xD;
      MRI scanner is a cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. Participants will lie on a&#xD;
      table that slides in and out of the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will repeat the above procedures throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get their first dose of anakinra at the clinic. They will administer the&#xD;
      rest of the doses themselves, by injection under the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will track their daily dosage electronically or in a written drug diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 4 visits while taking the drug. At each visit, sharps boxes and empty&#xD;
      vials will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 follow-up visits after completing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last 28 weeks.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and radiological&#xD;
      efficacy of up to 12 weeks of subcutaneous injection of anakinra in people with multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis and evidence, by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), of chronic active (also known as&#xD;
      smoldering ) lesions in the white matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 people with progressive or stable MS, at least one paramagnetic rim lesion on 7-tesla MRI,&#xD;
      and no new white matter lesion formation for at least 3 months or clinical relapse for at&#xD;
      least 12 months, will complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this open label, dose escalation study, participants will receive up to 12 weeks of&#xD;
&#xD;
      subcutaneous anakinra with initial dose of 100 mg daily up to a target dose of 300 mg daily.&#xD;
      Study visits will occur every 4 weeks while on treatment, with 2 follow-up visits at 4 and 12&#xD;
      weeks after treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is disappearance of one or more paramagnetic rims from white&#xD;
      matter lesions identified at baseline. Secondary outcomes include safety and tolerability,&#xD;
      clinical and radiological outcomes. Exploratory serological and CSF measures will also be&#xD;
      obtained to investigate mechanism of action of anakinra and for biomarker development.&#xD;
