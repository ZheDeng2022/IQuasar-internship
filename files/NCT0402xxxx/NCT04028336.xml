  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary recruitment maneuvers open these lung areas and appropriate adjustment of positive&#xD;
      expiratory pressure (PEP) helps to stabilize recruitment and reduce the stress associated&#xD;
      with alveolar opening and closing. Its beneficial effects in the lung affected by Acute&#xD;
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) remain unclear. The hypothesis is that there is a&#xD;
      heterogeneous effect of the recruitment maneuver according to the phenotype of ARDS. It is&#xD;
      important to be able to define responder patients from non-responders to this recruiting&#xD;
      maneuver.&#xD;

      It will be a prospective interventional study in resuscitation patients with severe or&#xD;
      moderate ARDS. This study will be multicentric between the University Hospital of Amiens and&#xD;
      intensive care of Lens, intensive care of Bethune and intensive care of Arras. All patients&#xD;
      in intensive care and severe, moderate ARDS will be included in this study. All patients will&#xD;
      benefit from Lung ultrasound (LUS) with a mapping of each lung looking for normal or&#xD;
      pathological lung profiles, as well as a measurement of esophageal pressure (Peso) at rest. A&#xD;
      &quot;PEP titration pulmonary opening&quot; (PEP-OP) test using a recruitment maneuver was then&#xD;
      performed in all patients followed by a new LUS and Peso measurement.&#xD;
