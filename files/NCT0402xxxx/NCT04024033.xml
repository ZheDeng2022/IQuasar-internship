  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The medicinal properties of pinecones have been used for years to treat a variety of&#xD;
      illnesses. In the mouse model, an extract of pine cones, poly-phenylpropanoid-polysaccharide&#xD;
      complex (PPC), has been shown to reduce total serum IgE levels as well as decreased&#xD;
      production of IL-4, a cytokine associated with allergic disease. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to determine the effects that PPC will have on total serum IgE levels in&#xD;
      adult subjects with perennial rhinitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a parallel two-arm, double-blind design. The 80% power calculation was&#xD;
      based upon preliminary data showing a greater than 30% reduction of total serum IgE in PPC&#xD;
      recipients. This power calculation concluded that each arm will need a population of 18&#xD;
      subjects. These subjects will be recruited from a clinical practice of 4 academic&#xD;
      allergists/immunologists. Seasonal allergy information will be recorded but the data will be&#xD;
      analyzed for each group without any correction for seasonal effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruited subjects will sign the consent form, undergo a complete physical exam, and have&#xD;
      skin testing repeated if historical skin tests data within three years is unavailable. The&#xD;
      historical skin tests must have been performed using the same techniques as those used in the&#xD;
      study. A prick skin test method using commercially available extracts will be used and the&#xD;
      results graded according to standard criteria with measurements of the wheal and flare&#xD;
      compared to the results of a positive control with histamine and a negative control of&#xD;
      saline. A positive skin test will be defined as a wheal diameter 3 mm larger than the&#xD;
      negative control with a flare of greater than or equal to 10 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nasal mucosal sample will also be obtained from the inferior turbinate with a plastic&#xD;
      device (rhinoprobe). This sample will be frozen at the time of collection for future&#xD;
      analysis. This procedure will be optional for subjects; if they consent it will be performed&#xD;
      at each visit After screening, patients will be randomized to either of the two arms&#xD;
      (placebo, or 32mg PPC/d). Patients will be instructed to take one capsule via oral route&#xD;
      daily for 8 weeks. Subjects will be treated for two months with measurements of total serum&#xD;
      IgE at the initial screening/randomization visit and following two months of treatment.&#xD;
      Physical examination will be repeated at each visit. A variance of 5 days will be permitted&#xD;
      for follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue treatment with oral, non-sedating antihistamine will be permitted and number of doses&#xD;
      will be recorded at each follow up visit. No nasal sprays will be allowed during the study.&#xD;
      If symptoms are extreme, the study subject will be discontinued from the trial.&#xD;
