  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although physiologic gingival hyperpigmentation is not a pathologic condition, it is&#xD;
      considered one of the main esthetic problems in dentistry. It was found that the attached&#xD;
      gingiva is the most frequently pigmented intraoral tissues followed by the papillary gingiva&#xD;
      and the alveolar mucosa&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to all of the previously mentioned actions of vitamin C, it was found to be&#xD;
      involved in depigmentation due to several factors that not only depend on its direct effect&#xD;
      on melanin and melanocytes but also due to the overall effect on the applied tissues. Melanin&#xD;
      is one of the main reservoir for ROS, copper and calcium in the tissue cells . Once vitamin C&#xD;
      is introduced to the target tissue, it binds efficiently to melanin due to the ROS, calcium&#xD;
      and copper content which causes intracellular deficiency of these items and the inability of&#xD;
      the cells to produce melanin. Calcium deficiency causes failure of melanocytes to perform&#xD;
      cellular adhesion to keratinocytes as calcium is essential to form cadherins . Adhesion to&#xD;
      keratinocytes is important stimulator to melanocytes in order to produce melanin, format&#xD;
      dendrites and transfer the produced melanin to neighboring cells . Shortage of the&#xD;
      intercellular copper limits the formation of tyrosin, tyrosinase enzyme and peroxidase enzyme&#xD;
      which in turn stops the melanin production .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of the present study is to compare the clinical efficiency of the&#xD;
      non-surgical intraepidermal injection of vitamin C in comparison to the gold standard&#xD;
      surgical technique (scalpel technique) for gingival depigmentation.&#xD;
