  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has increased to alarming levels in the world. Currently it is estimated that it&#xD;
      occurs in a third of the world's population and it is expected that by 2030, 20% of the&#xD;
      world's adult population will suffer from obesity and 38% will be overweight, and it is&#xD;
      important to highlight that Mexico is among the first in obesity in adults and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity leads to the development of diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 2, dyslipidemias,&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, heart problems, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment for obesity in the first instance are changes in lifestyle, changes in diet and&#xD;
      exercise that have shown, in most patients, have little long-term adherence. There are also&#xD;
      drugs that promote weight loss by modifying the appetite or absorption of macronutrients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dapagliflozin plus metformin XR is a medicine composed with an oral antidiabetic of the group&#xD;
      of inhibitors of SGLT2 that has shown to have significant side effects in the weight&#xD;
      reduction and visceral adiposity in people with obesity and in patients with diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus type 2, it is also composed with metformin which also has effects on weight loss in&#xD;
      people with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, evaluating this compound drug in people with obesity could provide high&#xD;
      impact information as a complement for the treatment of this condition when compared to the&#xD;
      effects produced by monotherapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomized clinical trial of three pharmacological groups in 33 patients with&#xD;
      a diagnosis of grade 1 obesity in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) without&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be assigned randomly three groups of 11 patients, each one will receive 10 mg of&#xD;
      dapaglizflozin (Forxiga, Astra Zeneca), 1000 mg of metformin XR or 10/1000 mg of&#xD;
      dapagliflozin plus metformin XR, one time per day before having break-fast during 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body weight, body mass index (BMI), adiposity %, visceral adiposity, fat mass, lean mass,&#xD;
      waist circunference,waist-hip index, arterial pressure, and laboratory parameters as a&#xD;
      glucose, triglicerides, cholesterol, High density lipoprotein (c-HDL), low density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (c-LDL), uric acid, creatinin, C reactive protein, adiponectin and interleukin&#xD;
      10, leptin and TNF-∝will be measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is already approved by the local ethics committee and written informed consent&#xD;
      it's going to be obtained from all volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be presented through measures of central tendency and dispersion,&#xD;
      average and deviation standard for quantitative variables; frequencies and percentages for&#xD;
      variable qualitative. Qualitative variables will be analyzed by X2, will be used for&#xD;
      differences inter-group Kruskal-Wallis Test and Wilcoxon Test for the within-groups&#xD;
      differences. It will be considered statistical significance p ≤0.05.&#xD;
