  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-center clinical trial is being conducted to demonstrate that the Sponsor's&#xD;
      product does not statistically or clinically worsen eczema scores in children aged 6 months&#xD;
      through 7 years after 4 weeks of treatment compared to baseline scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and efficacy will be assessed through clinical grading at baseline and week 4.&#xD;
      Efficacy will also be assessed through Corneometer and Tewameter measurements at baseline and&#xD;
      week 4. Microbiome skin swab sampling will be performed at baseline and week 4.&#xD;
      Parents/guardians will complete Patient Oriented Eczema Measure and Family Dermatology&#xD;
      Quality of Life Index at baseline and week 4.&#xD;

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is no worsening of the clinical appearance of atopic dermatitis/eczema as measured by the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) at week 4 from baseline. ranges from 0 (no eczema) to 72.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary endpoint is that the sponsors test materials will be well tolerated and well perceived by subject parents/guardians according to the Family Dermatology Quality of Life Index (FDQLI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Parent/Guardian Quality of Life as evaluated through subject parents/guardians according to the Family Dermatology Quality of Life Index (FDQLI). Scores range from 0-30. Measurement conducted at week 4 from baseline.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>No increase in transepidermal water loss values measured at Week 4 from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Transepidermal Water Loss. Tewameter measurements will be performed at baseline and week 4. A decrease in TEWL values reflects an improvement in the barrier properties of the skin.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>No decrease in corneometry values at Week 4 from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Corneometer measurements will be performed at baseline and week 4. The measurement has no units, but is proportional to the dielectric constant of the surface layers of the skin, and increases as the skin becomes more hydrated.</description>
