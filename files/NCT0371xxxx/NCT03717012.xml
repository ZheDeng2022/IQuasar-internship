      The main objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the difference in change from baseline in Six Minute Walk Distance (6MWD) when&#xD;
           pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is added to stable underlying nintedanib therapy in&#xD;
           patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the difference in change in Quality of Life (QoL) when pulmonary&#xD;
           rehabilitation (PR) is added to stable underlying nintedanib therapy in patients with&#xD;
           idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if there is an enduring effect in 6MWD, QoL and lung function from pulmonary&#xD;
           rehabilitation (PR) when pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is added to stable underlying&#xD;
           nintedanib therapy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)&#xD;

    <description>Absolute change from baseline in the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at 12 and 24 weeks. The SGRQ is a widely used disease specific questionnaire evaluating health related quality of life. The SGRQ Total Score is measured using patient self-reported question on disease impact on symptoms, patient activity, and daily life. SGRQ scores are calculated using weights attached to each item of the questionnaire which provides an estimate of the distress associated with the symptoms or state described in each item. The total score for SGRQ ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more limitations.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a randomised, open-label, prospective, Phase IV clinical trial of pulmonary rehabilitation during the first 12 weeks of a 24-week treatment period, compared with no pulmonary rehabilitation, in patients already taking nintedanib for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were screened for eligibility prior to participation in the trial. Subjects attended a specialist site which ensured that they (the subjects) strictly met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. Subjects were not to be allocated to a treatment group if any of the entry criteria were violated.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Nintedanib 150 mg</title>
          <description>Subjects were required to be treated on a stable (up to 30 months) dose of nintedanib 150 milligram (mg) twice a day (BID) administered per prescribing instructions and to continue on this dose throughout the trial. Patients who recently started nintedanib 150 mg BID and have started by the day of randomization must be on nintedanib 150 mg BID a minimum of 10 days by the first day of pulmonary rehabilitation. Patients that have had an interruption in nintedanib treatment or a temporary dose reduction can be entered into the trial when they have returned to a dose of 150 mg BID and their condition is determined to be stable by the investigator and temporary dose reductions to treat adverse events is permitted during the trial.</description>

        <description>Absolute change from baseline in the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at 12 and 24 weeks. The SGRQ is a widely used disease specific questionnaire evaluating health related quality of life. The SGRQ Total Score is measured using patient self-reported question on disease impact on symptoms, patient activity, and daily life. SGRQ scores are calculated using weights attached to each item of the questionnaire which provides an estimate of the distress associated with the symptoms or state described in each item. The total score for SGRQ ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more limitations.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in the University of California, San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD-SOBQ) total score at 12 and 24 weeks. The UCSD-SOBQ is a 24-item questionnaire that assesses self-reported shortness of breath while performing a variety of activities of daily living, scores for each item range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating more limitations. Total score is calculated as the sum of all individual scores. Scores range from 0 to 120, with higher scores indicating more limitations.</description>

        <description>Absolute change from baseline of forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted at 12 and 24 weeks. Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) is the volume of air (measured in milliliter) which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. For predicted normal values, different sites may use different prediction formulas, based on the method used to measure diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco). In any case, the method used must be in compliance with the European Respiratory Society (ERS)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) guideline on DLco measurements, and the prediction formula appropriate for that method.</description>

        <title>Relative Change From Baseline of Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) at 12 and 24 Weeks</title>
        <description>Relative change (unitless) from baseline of forced vital capacity (FVC) at 12 and 24 weeks. Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) is the volume of air (measured in milliliter) which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. FVC is measured in milliliter (mL). Its relative change from baseline at 12 (24) weeks is calculated as: (FVC measured at 12 (24) weeks - FVC measured at baseline)/ FVC measured at baseline *100%.</description>

        <description>Relative change (unitless) from baseline of forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted at 12 and 24 weeks. Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) is the volume of air (measured in milliliter) which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. For predicted normal values, different sites may use different prediction formulas, based on the method used to measure diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco). In any case, the method used must be in compliance with the European Respiratory Society (ERS)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) guideline on DLco measurements, and the prediction formula appropriate for that method. The relative change from baseline of FVC % predicted at 12 (24) weeks is calculated as: (FVC % Predicted measured at 12 (24) weeks - FVC % Predicted measured at baseline)/ FVC % Predicted measured at baseline *100%.</description>

        <title>Absolute Categorical Change of Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)% Predicted up to 12 and 24 Weeks (Decrease by &gt;10%, Increase by &gt;10%, and Change Within ≤10%)</title>
        <description>Absolute categorical change of forced vital capacity (FVC)% predicted up to 12 and 24 weeks, the following three categories were defined: decrease by &gt;10%, increase by &gt;10%, and change within ≤10%. Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) is the volume of air (measured in milliliter) which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. For predicted normal values, different sites may use different prediction formulas, based on the method used to measure diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco). In any case, the method used must be in compliance with the European Respiratory Society (ERS)/American Thoracic Society(ATS) guideline on DLco measurements, and the prediction formula appropriate for that method.</description>
