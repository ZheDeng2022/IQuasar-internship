  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefits of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet&#xD;
      (ketogenic diet) in up to 50 subjects with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), a&#xD;
      chronic neuro-inflammatory disease. The primary aim of this study is to provide evidence of&#xD;
      tolerability of the ketogenic diet in patients with RRMS. The principal investigator&#xD;
      hypothesizes that the diet may prove beneficial for participants disease state in multiple&#xD;
      potential ways.The study consists of 5 visits over a 12 month period. During these visits&#xD;
      subjects will undergo fasting lab work, micro-biome sampling, neurological testing, body&#xD;
      composition analysis, meeting with dietitian, and will be asked to complete surveys as well&#xD;
      as a diet recall log.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to see if a high fat, low carbohydrate diet is safe and how it&#xD;
      effects post trial diet habits, physique, and disease course in patients with relapsing&#xD;
      remitting multiple sclerosis. In particular, multiple sclerosis is a neurodegenerative&#xD;
      disorder that is characterized by inflammation, microglial inflammation, and hypoxia in its&#xD;
      relapsing-remitting form.1 One of the hypothesized therapeutic mechanisms of ketogenic diets&#xD;
      is related to its effect on decreasing glycolysis, decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS),&#xD;
      and increasing ATP production by mitochondria. Production of ROS and macrophage activation&#xD;
      have been directly correlated with demyelination and axonal injury in multiple sclerosis.2,3&#xD;
      In mouse models with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model disease in mice&#xD;
      that has many similar properties to that of MS in humans, experiments have demonstrated that&#xD;
      impairment of memory and spatial learning are directly correlated with increased cytokine and&#xD;
      chemokine expression and ROS production. In EAE mice fed a ketogenic diet, there were noted&#xD;
      improvements in motor disability, memory dysfunction, and CNS inflammation - which on the&#xD;
      whole are suggestive that a ketogenic diet may have a multitude of benefits in patients with&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study goal is to recruit 50 young adult or adult patients with relapsing-remitting&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis that show interest in starting and maintaining a ketogenic diet for six&#xD;
      months. Prior to initiating the diet, the study team will characterize each patient's disease&#xD;
      by analyzing multiple factors - including baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS)&#xD;
      and annualized relapse rates (ARR). Throughout the course of the 12 month study participants&#xD;
      will be asked to complete several patient reported outcomes, an online food diary recall, and&#xD;
      track their diet compliance using urinary ketone testing strips provided by the study&#xD;
      daily.In addition, the study team will also draw serum lab work every 3 months that we&#xD;
      anticipate may be affected by the diet (including hemoglobin A1C, lipid panel, and cytokine&#xD;
      profiles). Rectal swabs will be requested during the study to look at effects of the diet on&#xD;
      the microbiome both pre and post diet. Additionally, activity monitors (accelerometers) will&#xD;
      be worn by each subject for 1 week prior to initiation of the diet to provide evidence of&#xD;
      pre-diet activity levels and at various times throughout the study for comparison.&#xD;
      Participating patients will receive education on starting, maintaining, and stopping the 6&#xD;
      month diet by a nutritionist. The nutritionist will meet with patients at scheduled office&#xD;
      visits and will be available for questions during the duration of the patients participation.&#xD;
      Subjects will also undergo anthropometric assessments with a bodpod used to measure body mass&#xD;
      as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measures will be compared with statistical analyses, utilizing both pre and post diet&#xD;
      values to help determine benefit of the diet on various aspects of the patient's overall&#xD;
      health and wellness.&#xD;
