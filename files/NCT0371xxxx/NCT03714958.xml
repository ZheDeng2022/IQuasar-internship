  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent preclinical studies suggest that combining MEK and MDM2 inhibition synergize to induce&#xD;
      apoptosis in RAS/BRAF-mutant and TP53 wild-type CRC models. In vitro, in RKO cell lines&#xD;
      (poorly differentiated colon carcinoma cell line resistant to single agent targeting MDM2 and&#xD;
      MEK and BRAF inhibition), the MDM2 plus MEK inhibitor combination generated a synergistic&#xD;
      increase in apoptotic index. In vivo, in mice harboring human RKO colon tumor xenografts the&#xD;
      combination of MDM2 plus MEK inhibition elicited 93% decreases in tumor volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is to conduct a single-center, Phase 1 dose escalation study of trametinib&#xD;
      combined with HDM201 (a HDM2 inhibitor) in patients with advanced/metastatic RAS/RAF mutant&#xD;
      and TP53 wt CRC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This trial is a Phase I dose escalation study aiming to evaluate the safety of a combined&#xD;
      treatment associating HDM201 (escalating doses) with Trametinib (fixed dose). This study will&#xD;
      utilize sequential and adaptive Bayesian design using the method of Time-to-event Continual&#xD;
      Reassessment Method (CRM) to guide dose escalation and estimate the MTD.&#xD;
