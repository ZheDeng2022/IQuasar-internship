  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Millennium Development Goal of reducing the maternal mortality ratio by 75 % by 2015 will&#xD;
      remain beyond our reach unless we prioritize the prevention and treatment of postpartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage(PPH) in low-resource countries. Consequently, the administration of uterotonic&#xD;
      drugs during cesarean section (CS) and in the third stage of labor for vaginal delivery has&#xD;
      become essential to diminish the risk of PPH and improve maternal safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxytocin is regarded as the gold standard uterotonic agent but only has a half-life of 4-10&#xD;
      min; therefore, at cesarean section oxytocin must be administered as a continuous intravenous&#xD;
      infusion to attain sustained uterotonic activity throughout the surgical procedure and&#xD;
      immediate postpartum period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analog proven in several randomized controlled trials to be&#xD;
      effective in preventing PPH because of its strong uterotonic effects. In addition,&#xD;
      misoprostol is inexpensive, stable at room temperature, and easy to administer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Misoprostol has been broadly studied in the prevention and treatment of PPH after vaginal&#xD;
      delivery; however, its use in conjunction with CS has not been investigated as much.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The buccal route is recognized as having the greatest benefit due to its rapid uptake,&#xD;
      long-acting effect, and greatest bioavailability compared with other routes of misoprostol&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbetocin is a long-acting synthetic analog of oxytocin that can be administered as a&#xD;
      single-dose injection; intravenously administered carbetocin has a half-life of approximately&#xD;
      40 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single intravenous bolus of carbetocin produces a tetanic uterine contraction within 2 min&#xD;
      and persists for an average of 60 min following injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of combined buccal misoprostol and IV&#xD;
      tranexamic acid (TA)with intravenous carbetocin for prevention of PPH in patients with risk&#xD;
      factors during cesarean section.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible and consenting participants were randomized via a computer-generated random number&#xD;
      sequence into one of two groups: one group received a pre-prepared sealed and opaque packet&#xD;
      containing 400 μg of misoprostol (2 tablets of 200 μg), 2 ampoules of TA. The other group&#xD;
      received similar packets containing two placebo tablets, two placebo ampoules (distilled&#xD;
      water) and separate carbetocin ampoule (100 μg) for slow intravenous injection. The&#xD;
      misoprostol and placebo tablets were similar in size, shape, and color, and ampoules of TA&#xD;
      and carbetocin will be also similar to placebo. Randomization was done by the resident&#xD;
      doctors immediately before transfer to the theater, whereas preparation of packets and&#xD;
      confidential record maintenance was done by the labor room nursing staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug administration Group 1 100 μg carbetocin ampoule will be diluted in 10 mL normal&#xD;
      saline and administered slowly (over 30-60 s) intravenously by the anesthetist after the&#xD;
      birth of the baby&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 400 μg buccal misoprostol (2 tablets of 200 μg) will be given after spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      and few minutes before skin incision in addition to 1 gm tranexamic acid in 100 mL of&#xD;
      intravenous solution infusion over 15 min.&#xD;
