  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      6-minute walk test (6MWT) is widely used in cardiopulmonary surgery as a prognostic marker.&#xD;
      This prospective cohort study aims to find whether 6MWT will be a good prognostic factor for&#xD;
      patients who will undergo laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery.The investigators will enroll&#xD;
      patients awaiting elective laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery in this study. After&#xD;
      informed consent was obtained, the participants will be evaluated through 6MWT. Preoperative&#xD;
      assessment and conditions during operation will be recorded. The investigators will analyze&#xD;
      the correlation between preoperative 6MWT's result and outcomes after laparoscopic&#xD;
      gastrointestinal surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational cohort study, which focus on the prognostic value of&#xD;
      6-minute walk test (6MWT) in patients who will undergo laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is an optimized program which help patients accelerate&#xD;
      recovery and improve outcomes by integrating evidence-based protocols and guidelines. With&#xD;
      the rapid development of ERAS, the preoperative clinical data of patients are paid more and&#xD;
      more attention to evaluate the risk of perioperative complications and choose an appropriate&#xD;
      time for surgery. A better perioperative evaluation method will lead to lower morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality rates of postoperative complications and shorter time of hospital stay. So, it is&#xD;
      important to find an appropriate evaluation method to predict the outcomes of patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6MWT is a low-cost, easy to operate and well-tolerated test to evaluate exercise tolerance to&#xD;
      predict cardiopulmonary function. It has widely used in cardiopulmonary surgery as a&#xD;
      prognostic marker. Even though massive studies showed that decreased perioperative 6-minute&#xD;
      walk distance (6MWD) related to postoperative complication in patients underwent cardiac or&#xD;
      pulmonary surgery, there are only small numbers of studies with small number sizes presenting&#xD;
      correlation of decreased 6MWD and postoperative complication in abdominal surgery. Even some&#xD;
      studies of upper abdomen got the opposite result. Furthermore, the critical value for 6MWD is&#xD;
      still controversial. Based on these conditions, this study was designed to investigate if&#xD;
      6MWT cloud be used as an accurate assessment with the prognostic value in patients who will&#xD;
      undergo laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery to improve the ERAS program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators decide to enroll 200 patients awaiting elective laparoscopic&#xD;
      gastrointestinal surgery in this study at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. After&#xD;
      informed consent was obtained, the patients will be comprehensively evaluated from&#xD;
      demographic characteristics, complications of systems and organs, laboratory tests results,&#xD;
      6MWT, metabolic equivalents (METs), psychological states assessed by hospital anxiety and&#xD;
      depression scale. Outcomes will be assessed according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification of&#xD;
      Surgical Complications. Operative name, operation date, operative method, blood loss,&#xD;
      situation of blood transfusion, operation time, duration of anesthesia, whether return to ICU&#xD;
      or not (treatment time and tubulization time), drainage flow of within 24 hours after surgery&#xD;
      will be recorded. Other outcome measures include the mortality rate within 30 days after&#xD;
      surgery, second operation without plan, rehospitalized rate without plan, postoperative&#xD;
      hospitalization time, patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis, univariate analysis, multivariate analysis and establishment of&#xD;
      complication prediction model will be used to analyze the correlation between preoperative&#xD;
      6MWD and outcomes.&#xD;
