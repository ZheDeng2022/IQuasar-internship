  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The issue of uncorrected Presbyopia is an emerging health and livelihoods problem in&#xD;
      Bangladesh. Presbyopia is easily corrected with an appropriate pair of reading glasses.&#xD;
      Non-governmental organizations and government agencies have been working in many emerging&#xD;
      markets, including Bangladesh, to increase eyeglass coverage among low-income adults by&#xD;
      introducing basic vision screening and the dispensing of reading glasses at the community&#xD;
      level. While vision screening is typically considered a health intervention, the primary&#xD;
      motivation of these organizations and government agencies is to correct blurry vision with&#xD;
      the intention of improving adults' income earning potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VisionSpring and BRAC (previously known as Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee) are two&#xD;
      such NGOs who are partnering to implement a &quot;Reading Glasses for Improved Livelihoods&quot;&#xD;
      program. VisionSpring is a social enterprise with a mission to increase access to affordable&#xD;
      eye care and glasses in low-income settings. BRAC is an international development&#xD;
      organization dedicated to alleviating poverty by empowering the poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VisionSpring and BRAC have initiated a Randomized Control Trial to assess the economic and&#xD;
      social impact that reading glasses may have on individuals that earn less than $4 a day. The&#xD;
      study hypothesizes that post-intervention, the adoption of reading glasses will increase&#xD;
      productivity related to paid work, and will enhance the vision-related quality of life of&#xD;
      adults with Presbyopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This experimental trial is designed to test the aforementioned hypotheses. In March 2017 a&#xD;
      census survey was conducted in 59 villages of adults aged ≥35 and ≤65 years old in order to&#xD;
      identify individuals with uncorrected presbyopia who would be eligible for enrollment in the&#xD;
      study intervention. Following household visual acuity screenings, study participants were&#xD;
      selected for enrollment. Randomization was conducted at the household level. Based on the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, a total of 824 random households were surveyed at the baseline. Following&#xD;
      completion of the baseline survey, in August 2017 the treatment group was given reading&#xD;
      glasses free-of-cost. The endline survey will be conducted in March 2018, eight months from&#xD;
      the baseline. Although some income-related outcomes may take more time to manifest, it is&#xD;
      anticipated that the wearing of glasses precipitates changes in a relatively short time&#xD;
      frame. The control group will receive reading glasses at the conclusion of the endline&#xD;
      survey.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BRAC (previously known as Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee) has conducted a study on&#xD;
      the Assessment of the Impact of Reading Glasses on Livelihoods and Quality of Life in the&#xD;
      Context of Rural Bangladesh in 2017 with financial and technical assistance from&#xD;
      VisionSpring. The goal is to assess the impact of reading glasses on economic return and&#xD;
      social angles for people in rural areas in Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BRAC and VisionSpring have developed an experimental trial to test the effects of reading&#xD;
      glasses. The study will utilize both pre and post-intervention data to identify the causal&#xD;
      effects. A randomized control trial is considered to be the most rigorous method of&#xD;
      determining whether a causal relationship exists between an intervention and outcome. This is&#xD;
      a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) conducted at the household level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, investigators selected 59 villages in Bangladesh where the BRAC/VisionSpring&#xD;
      distribution of reading glasses has not been present. A census survey was carried out in the&#xD;
      59 villages to identify those suffering from Presbyopia who were eligible for glasses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, participants were recruited through a household Presbyopia screening of individuals&#xD;
      over 35 years old and less than 65 years old. Participants with chronic eye diseases that&#xD;
      require regular and intensive treatment were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A structured questionnaire was used at the census survey where demographic information,&#xD;
      income, and occupation were asked. Randomization was taken place after the census survey, and&#xD;
      a study sample was selected based on the inclusion criteria of the study which are: (1) Over&#xD;
      35 years of age, (2) Presbyopia positive, (3) Have never used reading glass, (4) Selective&#xD;
      occupation (tailor, barber, self-employed artisan etc), (5) Willing to provide contact&#xD;
      information and give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study proposal defines two rounds of data collection to be conducted; baseline data&#xD;
      collection was completed in August 2017 and follow-up data will be conducted in March 2018. A&#xD;
      quantitative questionnaire was distributed at the baseline survey in order to understand the&#xD;
      livelihoods and quality of life before the intervention began. Skilled interviewers were&#xD;
      recruited for this study, and a three-day intensive training was held to reinforce the goals&#xD;
      of the study. The training module was developed in Bangla to guide the interviewers in the&#xD;
      field. Questions related to socio-demographic characteristics, economic status of the&#xD;
      household (e.g. monthly income), the productivity of the respondent and quality of life were&#xD;
      collected during baseline, and the same questionnaire will be used in the baseline survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multi-stage simple random sampling technique has been used in this study. The sample size&#xD;
      of the study is pre-determined through a power calculation, the inclusion criteria of being a&#xD;
      Presbyopic patient. As our primary outcome is income, a non-normally distributed parameter,&#xD;
      it is better to compare proportions falling in various quartiles for sample size&#xD;
      calculations. With a two-sided significance level of p=0·05 and power of 80%, to detect a 10%&#xD;
      between-group difference in the proportion in the highest quartile of income (35% versus&#xD;
      25%), corresponding to an odds ratio of 1.6, 349 participants would be needed in each group.&#xD;
      Assuming a 15% rate of attrition based on previous studies in this population, a total sample&#xD;
      of 822 persons (411 in each group) would be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study is randomized at the individual level, there is a possibility to have the&#xD;
      spillover effect. To minimize the spillover effect, one participant was selected from each&#xD;
      household. There is a risk that members of the control group may see the benefits experienced&#xD;
      by others in their community and buy a pair of reading glasses during the study. In an&#xD;
      attempt to mitigate this risk, members of the control group were promised free glasses at the&#xD;
      end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will use a difference-in-difference analysis to estimate the impact of the&#xD;
      reading glasses study based on monthly income (primary outcome), and near vision-related&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the quality of life, investigators will use a standardised instrument to look at&#xD;
      respondents' perceptions of their facility with caregiving, household work, ability to (for&#xD;
      those who are literate) mobile phone use, personal hygiene, and dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in baseline characteristics by study group will be analysed using the t-test or&#xD;
      Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables with or without normal distribution&#xD;
      respectively, the Chi-squared or Fisher's exact test (with cell frequency&lt;5) for binary&#xD;
      categorical variables, and ordinal logistic regression for ordinal categorical variables.&#xD;
      Normality will be checked using histograms and Q-Q plots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for the primary outcome will be presented as median and inter quartile range due to lack&#xD;
      of normality, The change in self-reported monthly income will be categorized by quartiles and&#xD;
      the unadjusted and adjusted intervention effects, odds ratio and 95% CI estimated using&#xD;
      ordinal logistic regression. Unadjusted and adjusted mean between-group differences will be&#xD;
      estimated for the secondary outcomes using linear regression. All variables with P&lt;0.05 in&#xD;
      the simple regression analysis will be included in multiple regression models. All&#xD;
      statistical analyses will be performed using a commercially available software package (Stata&#xD;
      15.1, StataCorp, College Station TX, USA).&#xD;
