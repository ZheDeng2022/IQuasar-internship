    <textblock>
      FDA approved drugs to treat patients with relapsed or refractory anaplastic large cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (ALCL) has a median progression free survival of 20 months. Majority of patients&#xD;
      relapse in 2 years. This study will evaluate overall response rate of next generation ALK&#xD;
      inhibitor brigatinib in ALK positive ALCL patients by overcoming mechanisms of resistance to&#xD;
      ALK inhibitors on cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although patients with ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), a type of peripheral&#xD;
      T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), are considered to have a favorable prognosis, relapse is not uncommon&#xD;
      if multiple International Prognostic Index (IPI) risk factors, age ≥ 40, and beta-2&#xD;
      microglobulin ≥ 3 mg/L are present at diagnosis. For patients older than 40 years at&#xD;
      diagnosis and beta-2 microglobulin ≥ 3 mg/L, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) is less than 50% at 2.5 years when treated with standard anthracycline-based&#xD;
      induction therapy. Patients with ALK+ ALCL with 3 or more IPI risk factors have a 5-year PFS&#xD;
      rate of only 20% to 30%. In total, approximately 40 to 65% of patients with ALCL develop&#xD;
      recurrent disease after front-line chemotherapy and at relapse, the disease is historically&#xD;
      resistant to conventional chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current FDA approved for treatment of relapsed or refractory PTCLs have a median PFS of 20&#xD;
      months and majority of patients relapse within 2 years. Despite ALK tyrosine kinase being an&#xD;
      attractive target for management of relapsed or refractory ALK+ ALCL, ALK gene rearrangement&#xD;
      makes cancer resistant to first and 2nd generation ALK inhibitors. Brigatinib is a next&#xD;
      generation inhibitor with broad activity aganst a broad spetrum of resistant ALK mutants.&#xD;
      Brigatinib has been shown to overcome mechanisms associated with resistane to 1st and 2nd&#xD;
      generation ALK inhibitors. It is approved as 2nd line of treament in non small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer patients. and is being tested in patients with relapsed or refractory ALK-positive&#xD;
      ALCL.&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
