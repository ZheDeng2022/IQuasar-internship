  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TP-3654 is an oral PIM inhibitor. This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation, safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic study, with a purpose of determining the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of oral TP-3654 in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of oral&#xD;
      TP-3654 in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of orally administered TP-3654&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe patients for any evidence of antitumor activity of TP-3654 by objective&#xD;
           radiographic assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the pharmacodynamic effects of TP-3654 therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for future studies with TP-3654&#xD;
