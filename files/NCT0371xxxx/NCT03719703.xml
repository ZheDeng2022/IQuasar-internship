    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the metabolic and cardiovascular health in&#xD;
      children aged 6-8 years born after in-vitro fertilization with frozen embryo transfer&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to conduct a clinical follow-up study of three groups of children:&#xD;
      Exposed children conceived by ART(assisted reproductive technology) after frozen embryo&#xD;
      transfer (FET) and two unexposed control groups; (1) Children conceived by ART after fresh&#xD;
      embryo transfer and (2) Naturally conceived children. All children will be identified via&#xD;
      their mother's CPR number in the in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and medical birth registry.&#xD;
      Only singletons 6-8 years of age (birth year 2009-2011) born in hospitals in the Capital&#xD;
      Region will be included. Access to maternal postal addresses will be retrieved through the&#xD;
      CPR registry. The investigators will contact the mothers by an invitation letter by post&#xD;
      including the patient information and the information for the child. The invitation letter&#xD;
      and patient information will be similar for study and control groups. The mothers can reply&#xD;
      via sms, email or telephone. If they do not reply within 2 weeks, the investigators will send&#xD;
      them one postal reminder. In case they respond, the investigators will schedule the visit.&#xD;
      The investigators will start contacting and examining the oldest children. Children of&#xD;
      mothers with preexisting diabetes (type 1 or type 2) or gestational diabetes will be excluded&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Singletons conceived by ART after FET (N=200)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Singletons conceived by ART after fresh embryo transfer (N=200). (N~1000 mothers will be&#xD;
           contacted, 40% of eligible ART subjects are expected to participate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Singletons born after natural conception (N=200). A random sample of naturally conceived&#xD;
           children matched with FET children on month and year of birth and child sex (N~ 670, 30%&#xD;
           of eligible subjects are expected to participate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical examinations of the children will be carried out in the Clinic of Growth and&#xD;
      Reproduction and Clinic of Cardiology at Rigshospitalet. The investigators aim that each&#xD;
      child attends all examinations at the same day and the full examination will last no longer&#xD;
      than 30-40 minutes. The participants meet fasting in the morning and a fasting blood sample&#xD;
      will be collected. Local anesthetic cream will be sent to all participants prior to the&#xD;
      examination. The fasting blood sample will be analyzed for: Glucose profile: glucose,&#xD;
      insulin, c-peptid (calculation of HOMA-IR), HbA1c - Lipid profile: Total cholesterol, LDL,&#xD;
      HDL, Triglycerides - Growth factors: IGF-I and IGFBP-3 - Androgen status and Anti Müllerian&#xD;
      Hormone (AMH) - Lipids and cytokines (CRP, IL-6, adiponectin, leptin, inkretin) - Biobank&#xD;
      sampling The clinical examination includes determination of: Height, weight, waist and hip&#xD;
      circumference - Skinfold measurements (Harpenden Skinfold Caliper) - Pubertal staging&#xD;
      (Tanner) - Blood pressure (systolic, diastolic) measured by FINA press device (valid&#xD;
      continuous measurements)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a subset of children n=50 in each group (in total 150 children) the investigators will&#xD;
      perform a cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR):&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) determined diastolic and systolic function of cardiac&#xD;
      chambers and large vessels of the thorax, and measurement of epi- and pericardial fat tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific objective I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of risk of obesity and metabolic disease in children conceived by ART with FET&#xD;
      compared to children conceived after fresh embryo transfer and after natural conception. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is overweight and obesity as determined by BMI (SDS for age). Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures are fat percentage measured by skinfolds and abdominal circumference,&#xD;
      visceral fat (MRI) and calculation of insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR) as a risk marker of&#xD;
      altered metabolism and epigenetic changes of metabolic pathways, growth factors and andrenal&#xD;
      androgens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific objective II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of markers of cardiovascular risk in children whose mothers conceived by FET&#xD;
      compared to children conceived after ART fresh embryo transfer and after natural conception.&#xD;
      Cardio-vascular outcome measures will be left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV)&#xD;
      myocardial mass and function, pulmonary artery and aortic distensibility and estimation of&#xD;
      epi- and pericardial fat tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous outcome measures will be compared between the three groups using multiple linear&#xD;
      regression with adjustment for potential confounding factors and child sex. In case of&#xD;
      pronounced skewness, logarithmic transformation will be applied prior to analysis. Binary&#xD;
      outcomes will be compared between the three groups using multiple logistic regression with&#xD;
      adjustment for potential confounders and child sex. Additional multiple regression analysis&#xD;
      with further inclusion of potential mediators will be performed to identify maternal/fetal&#xD;
      and neonatal predictive factors for the different outcomes. Background characteristics will&#xD;
      be compared between the three groups using one-way ANOVA for normally distributed data, the&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis test for non-normally distributed continuous data, and the chi-square test for&#xD;
      categorical data. P-values from secondary and explorative data analyses will be adjusted for&#xD;
      multiple testing by controlling the false discovery rate to 5% as recommended for health&#xD;
      science studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific objective I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMI was chosen as our primary endpoint and the investigators calculated the age specific BMI&#xD;
      based on the Tinggard cohort.30 Childhood and adolescent BMI show dose-dependent association&#xD;
      with adult mortality, with an increase in 1 SD in BMI z-score at age 8 years showing a HR of&#xD;
      1.13 of a fatal cardiovascular event in adulthood. The minimal clinically important&#xD;
      difference in BMI was set as 0.3 SD scores, corresponding to an increased HR of 3.4%. Thus,&#xD;
      with equal size groups, a significance level of 5% and power 90% there should be 191 children&#xD;
      in each group to detect the minimal relevant difference. With 200 children in each group the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate that the sample size will be sufficiently large to compensate for&#xD;
      degrees of freedom lost due to adjustment for confounding factors (as in particular the&#xD;
      inclusion of the confounders will imply a reduction of the residual variance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific objective II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation for the right heart study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The previously found differences in hypoxic vasoconstriction were not evidenced by an&#xD;
      increased systolic pressure of the right ventricle at rest perhaps because the right&#xD;
      ventricle is thin-walled and accommodating. Considering that pre-pubertal children may vary&#xD;
      slightly in absolute heart size from adults, the investigators use the ratio of RVEDV/LVEDV&#xD;
      for the power calculation. Thus, while normally close to 1.0, with poor run-off for the RV&#xD;
      into the pulmonary circulation the investigators expect an increase in the RVEDV/LVEDV ratio&#xD;
      &gt;1.2 corresponding to a &gt;20% increase in RVEDV in comparison with the LVEDV (that now acts&#xD;
      like an &quot;internal comparator&quot;). With a conservative estimate for the common SD for the&#xD;
      difference of 0.35, with an alpha of 0.05 and power (1-beta) of 0.80 the investigators will&#xD;
      be able to detect a difference between groups of RVEDV/LVEDV from 1.0 to 1.20 with 36&#xD;
      children in each group (double-sided). The investigators aim for 50 children in each group to&#xD;
      allow for drop-outs including non-analysable scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation for the left heart study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With impaired flow-mediated vasodilatation in IVF children, the investigators expect arterial&#xD;
      distensibility to decrease. With age (and disease) arterial distensibility decreases. To be&#xD;
      clinically meaningful the investigators have based our power calculations on children aged 10&#xD;
      years born after IVF having stiff aortas comparable to &quot;being 5-years older&quot;. With a&#xD;
      conservative estimate for the common SD for the difference of 1.5 mm2/mmHg, with an alpha of&#xD;
      0.05 and a beta of 0.80 the investigators will be able to detect a difference between groups&#xD;
      of aortic distensibility from 8.9 to 8.0 mm2/mmHg (based on data from 10 and 15-year old&#xD;
      boys, respectively with 44 children in each group (double-sided). The investigators aim for&#xD;
      50 children in each group to allow for drop-outs including non-analysable scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation for the epicardial and pericardial fat tissue study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent MRI and echocardiographic studies have demonstrated that children with obesity and&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome may have more than two-fold as much epicardial and pericardial fat tissue&#xD;
      than lean children, and that this is related to cardiac remodelling including left&#xD;
      ventricular hypertrophy and impaired left ventricle longitudinal strain. In this study,&#xD;
      anticipating smaller changes, we expect a &gt;20% higher epicardial as well as pericardial fat&#xD;
      tissue to be present in children born after IVF. With a conservative estimate for the common&#xD;
      SD for the difference of 30% of the mean, with an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.80 the&#xD;
      investigators will be able to detect a difference between groups of aortic distensibility of&#xD;
      20% with 36 children in each group (double-sided). The investigators aim for 50 children in&#xD;
      each group to allow for drop-outs including non-analysable scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approvals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has been approved by the Scientific Ethics Committee in the Capital Region,&#xD;
      Denmark and by the Danish Data Protection Agency (Datatilsynet). Data from patient files will&#xD;
      not be used in the study. The study will be conducted in accordance with the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration and according to the Danish law on person identifiable data.&#xD;
