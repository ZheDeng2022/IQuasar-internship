  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gingival thickness plays a key role not only in the etiology but also in the treatment of&#xD;
      gingival recessions. a thin marginal tissue lining the hard periodontal tissues seems to be&#xD;
      one of the main risk factor for the onset of gingival recession ; more recently, authors&#xD;
      reported that as the gingival thickness decreases, the gingival recession severity increases&#xD;
      . When gingival inflammation occurs, if the tissue is thin the consequent destruction can&#xD;
      quickly produce a gingival recession (GR) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      When treating a gingival recession, the clinician should aim not only to completely cover the&#xD;
      exposed root surface but also to prevent a future recession recurrence Currently, CAF&#xD;
      associated with graft is considered as the gold standard for exposed root coverage; this&#xD;
      technique has demonstrated high rates in gingival recession reduction and positive&#xD;
      predictability in obtaining complete root coverage . However, some disadvantages about this&#xD;
      surgical approach can be easily highlighted: patients experience more discomfort, longer&#xD;
      chair-time it's necessary and a second wound area is created . On the other hand, CAF&#xD;
      procedure alone does not require a second surgical site, with better post-operative course,&#xD;
      also reducing the surgical time. However, long term-studies report lower probability of&#xD;
      complete root coverage when using the CAF technique without a simultaneous increase of the&#xD;
      gingival thickness as compared to CAF+graft treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this scenario, The Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) could be a valuable alternative treatment of&#xD;
      gingival defects. It's a platelet concentrate, obtained by a fast and simple procedure that&#xD;
      does not require anticoagulant and bovine thrombin . It can also be categorized as a live&#xD;
      tissue thanks to platelets, leukocytes, growth factors and stem cells trapped in a&#xD;
      polymerized fibrin mesh. PRF is used in various fields of regenerative medicine; It promotes&#xD;
      stabilization and revascularization of the flaps, contributes to soft tissue wound healing&#xD;
      and reduces post-operative discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical study will be to determine if the combination of platelet rich&#xD;
      fibrine membrane with a modified coronally advanced flap (MCAF) improved the gingival biotype&#xD;
      compared to CAF + graft or CAF alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized and controlled clinical trial will compare three modalities of&#xD;
      treatment of Miller's class I-II recession: CAF with PRF versus CAF with Sub-epithelial&#xD;
      tissue graft (SCTG) versus CAF. From each patient a single recession on a single tooth&#xD;
      located in the upper arches will be selected, in patients with multiple gingival defects will&#xD;
      be included the deepest one. Clinical parameters will be evaluated at base-line and after 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol is approved by the &quot;G. D'Annunzio&quot; University Ethical Committee. This study is&#xD;
      in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975. Patients will be recruited from the&#xD;
      Unit of Periodontology, Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, &quot;G.&#xD;
      D'Annunzio&quot; University of Chieti-Pescara, Italy. All the volunteer candidates will sign a&#xD;
      written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial director will be responsible for randomly assigning patients to treatment after&#xD;
      enrollment and will not involve with the clinical interventions or the study measurements. A&#xD;
      computer-generated table will be used to make the random assignment, known only to the trial&#xD;
      director. An opaque envelope will conceal group allocation and will be opened just before the&#xD;
      intervention surgery. Matching between group and treatment will be performed by a figure&#xD;
      extraneous to the experimentation, responsible even for keeping and breaking the blinding,&#xD;
      and known only to him.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood draw, needed for the CAF+L-PRF treatment, will be done to all patients. Patients and&#xD;
      examiners will be masked to group membership; clinical examiners will be blinded to each&#xD;
      other. The study analyst will be also blind to group membership. The analyst will receive the&#xD;
      data by groups labeled as A and B. The blind will not be broken until after study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and 6 months after surgery, the following clinical measurements will be recorded&#xD;
      on the mid-buccal point of exposed root surface: Gingival thickness (GT) will be determined&#xD;
      at a mid-buccal location about 1 mm apical to the pocket depth (PD) level with a #15&#xD;
      endodontic reamer with a silicon disk stop. The soft tissue will be gently pierced at a 90°&#xD;
      angle, until hard tissue will be felt. Once the silicon disk will be in contact with the soft&#xD;
      tissue surface, it will be fixed by a drop of cyanoacrylate adhesive. After the careful&#xD;
      removal of the reamer, the distance between the reamer tip and the stop will be measured with&#xD;
      a calliper accurate to the nearest 0.1 mm. The other measurements will be taken with a&#xD;
      periodontal probe and will be recorded to the nearest millimetre as follows: Gingival&#xD;
      recession (GR) will be measured as the distance from the cement-enamel junction (CEJ) to the&#xD;
      mid-buccal point of the gingival margin. PD and Clinical attachment level (CAL) will be&#xD;
      measured as the distance between the bottom of the pocket and the gingival margin and CEJ,&#xD;
      respectively. Keratinized tissue (KT) will be recorded from the mid-buccal point of the&#xD;
      gingival margin to the mucogingival junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical parameters will be measured by the same investigator. To avoid a calibration&#xD;
      probing bias, 60 recession defects will be measured twice within 72 hours. When 90% of the&#xD;
      measurements of Gingival thickness will be within 0.3 mm and within 0.5 mm for measurements&#xD;
      of GR , calibration will be successfully accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 ml of blood samples will be collected in 10-ml tubes without anticoagulant and promptly&#xD;
      centrifuged at 3,000 revolutions per minute for 10 minutes. The acellular plasma formed in&#xD;
      the upper layer will be washed out. The clot, positioned in the middle of the vial, will be&#xD;
      cut off from the lower red corpuscles part. Each PRF clot will be folded onto itself in order&#xD;
      to double the thickness, and two membranes placed one over the other (quadruple L-PRF layer)&#xD;
      represented the L-PRF graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The connective tissue graft will be harvested from the palatal area on the opposite side of&#xD;
      the gingival defect according to Zucchelli et al12. Briefly, two horizontal and two vertical&#xD;
      incisions will delimitate the donor area. The graft will be separated from the underlying&#xD;
      tissues by the scalpel's blade oriented parallel to the palatal surface to obtain an about 2&#xD;
      mm thick graft. Then, the graft will be de-epithelialized by a 15c blade and the fatty tissue&#xD;
      will be eliminated until obtaining a graft with a thickness of about 1,5 mm. measured by a&#xD;
      standard caliper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposed and intrasulcular root surface will be accurately scaled using curets. A modified&#xD;
      coronally advanced flap technique (MCAF) will be used to treat the recession defect. The ﬂap&#xD;
      will be elevated as follows: an intrasulcular incision will be performed around the selected&#xD;
      tooth, the incision moves on contiguous papillae area, avoiding the gingival margin of&#xD;
      adjacent teeth. From each side, from coronal to apical, an oblique incision will be carried&#xD;
      out. A split-full-split dissection will be undertaken until the CEJ could be passively cover&#xD;
      by the flap. Both papillae will be de-epithelialized. The PRFs and the SCTGs will be placed&#xD;
      over the exposed root surface of the Test group and Control 1 group respectively. The&#xD;
      gingival defect will be fully lined by grafts that mildly cover the neighbouring sub-papillae&#xD;
      areas. The grafts will be fixed applying suture to the periosteum below. In each group, ﬂap&#xD;
      will be coronally positioned and sutured over the enamel in a tension-free position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive 2 g/day amoxicillin+clavulanic acid for 6 days for post-operative&#xD;
      infection prevention; 400 mg of oral ibuprofen, twice daily, will control the pain; 0.12%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine rinses, twice daily for 3 weeks, will be prescribe to the patients. Sutures&#xD;
      will be removed after 14 days. Only 2-4 weeks after sutures removal, respectively, cautious&#xD;
      brushing by a soft toothbrush and interdental brushing will be recommend; meantime, the&#xD;
      patients use a 1% chlorhexidine gel twice daily. Weekly supragingival professional hygiene&#xD;
      and motivational reinforcement will be administer to the patients for 6 weeks.&#xD;
