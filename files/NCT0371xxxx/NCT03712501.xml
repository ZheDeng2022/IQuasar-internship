  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will investigate the effect of prior walking on postprandial metabolism and&#xD;
      endothelial function in healthy South Asian and White European women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete two, 2-day trials in a random, crossover design separated by at&#xD;
      least 3 weeks to control for the menstrual cycle phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1, participants will either rest or complete a 60 minute walk at 60% maximal oxygen&#xD;
      uptake. On day 2, participants will arrive at 08:00 having fasted overnight and a baseline&#xD;
      venous blood sample and endothelial function measurement will be taken. Participants will&#xD;
      consume a high-fat breakfast and lunch and 12 subsequent venous blood samples will be taken&#xD;
      throughout the day at standardised intervals to measure a variety of coronary heart disease&#xD;
      risk markers. A second endothelial function measurement will be completed 2 hours after the&#xD;
      breakfast. Blood pressure will be measured every hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the South Asian participants will have impaired metabolism and&#xD;
      endothelial function compared to their European counterparts but the bout of exercise&#xD;
      performed on day 1 will mitigate these responses.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      South Asian individuals have a higher-than-average risk of coronary heart disease. The&#xD;
      reasons for this are unclear, but physical inactivity and/or poor responsiveness to exercise&#xD;
      may play a role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research from our laboratory has shown that coronary heart disease risk markers in&#xD;
      the postprandial period are elevated in South Asian men, but acute exercise was equally, if&#xD;
      not more, effective for reducing these risk markers in South Asian than White European men.&#xD;
      However, the effect of acute exercise on coronary heart disease risk markers has not been&#xD;
      examined in South Asian women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to compare the effect of acute exercise on&#xD;
      endothelial function and coronary heart disease risk markers in women of South Asian versus&#xD;
      White European descent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On visit 1, participants will attend the laboratory to undergo preliminary assessments and to&#xD;
      be familiarised with the laboratory environment and study procedures. Specifically, health&#xD;
      status, habitual physical activity, dietary habits and anthropometric data (height, weight,&#xD;
      waist and hip circumference, body fat) will be collected. Two preliminary exercise tests will&#xD;
      be performed as follows: 1) submaximal-incremental treadmill walking test and 2) incremental&#xD;
      treadmill running test to exhaustion to measure maximal oxygen uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On visit 2, participants will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to quantify&#xD;
      regional body composition comprising abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose&#xD;
      tissue, liver fat percentage, thigh intramuscular adipose tissue and thigh muscle volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On visits 3-6 participants will complete two, 2-day trials in a random, crossover design&#xD;
      seperated by at least 3 weeks to control for the menstrual cycle phase. On day 1 of both&#xD;
      trials, participants will arrive fasted at 08:00 and a baseline blood sample, blood pressure&#xD;
      and endothelial function measurement will be taken. Participants will consume a standardised&#xD;
      high fat breakfast at 09:00 and lunch at 13:00. At 15:30 the participants will walk for 60&#xD;
      minutes at 60% maximal oxygen uptake and complete a second endothelial function measurement&#xD;
      at 16:45. Participants will leave the laboratory with a standardised evening meal to consume&#xD;
      before 22:00. The control trial will be the same, except no exercise will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 2, participants will arrive at 08:00 having fasted overnight for 10h (except plain&#xD;
      water). A cannula will be inserted into the antecubital vein for collection of venous blood&#xD;
      samples. Blood pressure will be measured at 08:00 (0h) and again at hourly intervals&#xD;
      throughout the day. Endothelial function will measured at 08:15 (0.25h) and again at 3h. At&#xD;
      0h, a fasting blood sample will be collected. Subsequent venous blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected at 1.5, 1.75, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.5, 5.75, 6, 7, 8 and 9h. Participants will consume a&#xD;
      standardised high fat breakfast at 1h and a standardised high fat lunch at 5h. The meals&#xD;
      consist of 57% fat, 32% carbohydrate and 11% protein. The meals provide 14.3 kcal per kg of&#xD;
      body mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will rest in the laboratory throughout day 2 of both the exercise and control&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
