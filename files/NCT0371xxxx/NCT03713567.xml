      The objective of this study is to evaluate, through clinical, microbiological and&#xD;
      immunological tests, the changes during the experimental gingivitis and mucositis model,&#xD;
      between teeth and implants, and between patients with a history of aggressive periodontitis&#xD;
      and healthy individuals.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to evaluate, through clinical, microbiological and&#xD;
      immunological tests, the changes during the experimental gingivitis and mucositis model,&#xD;
      between teeth and implants, and between patients with a history of aggressive periodontitis&#xD;
      and healthy individuals. 20 patients will be include, 10 healthy and 10 with a history of&#xD;
      aggressive periodontitis. All patients must present the same type of implant and abutments,&#xD;
      with prostheses in function for more than 6 months. They should also have a tooth located in&#xD;
      the contralateral hemi-arch in a similar position, allowing a comparison with the implant.&#xD;
      They will be submitted to the plaque-induced inflammation by suspension of oral hygiene only&#xD;
      in the tested areas (tooth / implant), protected by a personalized stent made of plastic,&#xD;
      according to the experimental gingivitis and mucositis model of 21 days of duration.&#xD;

    <description>0 - Absence of plaque&#xD;
- A thin layer of plaque adhered to the free gingival margin and adjacent to the dental surface. The plaque can be seen in situ only after the use of an evidentiary solution or through the passage of the periodontal probe through the dental surface.&#xD;
- Moderate accumulation in the periodontal pocket, dental surface or gingival margin, seen with the naked eye.&#xD;
- Abundance of plaque in the periodontal pocket and / or on the dental surface and gingival margin.</description>
