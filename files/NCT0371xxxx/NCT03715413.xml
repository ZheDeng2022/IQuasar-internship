      Background: Breast pain, mastalgia or mastodynia, is recognized as an organic benign breast&#xD;
      disease. Mastalgia may be bilateral, may be in only one breast or part of one breast, and may&#xD;
      radiate to the axilla and down the medial aspect of the upper arm. This study aimed to&#xD;
      evaluate the additional pulsed radiofrequency of 2nd , 3rd and 4th thoracic dorsal root&#xD;
      ganglia to the routine regimen treatment of mastalgia tamoxifen 10 mg daily may improve&#xD;
      breast pain severity and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Patients was randomly classified into two groups:Group A (n=13): they was received&#xD;
      Tamoxifen 10 mg daily. Group B (n=13): they was received Tamoxifen 10 mg daily and pulsed&#xD;
      radiofrequency of 2nd , 3rd and 4th thoracic dorsal root ganglia. The following parameters&#xD;
      were monitored: Primary outcome: VAS after injection and at interval two weeks, 1, 2 and 3&#xD;
      months after injection. Secondary outcome:1-Immediate complications for ex. Hematoma,&#xD;
      neurological deficits or respiratory insufficiency (dyspnea or pneumothorax).2-Need for&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast pain, mastalgia or mastodynia, is recognized as an organic benign breast disease . It&#xD;
      can be severe enough to cause disturbances in normal quality of life rating which leads to&#xD;
      disorders in sexual, physical, and social activities. When compared with other conditions, it&#xD;
      will be similar to chronic cancer pain in the mean pain-index .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast pain is classified into three main categories: cyclical, non-cyclical and&#xD;
      extra-mammary mastalgia. Cyclical pain is the commonest and it has a temporal association&#xD;
      with the menstrual cycle. Pain characteristically starts in the days before menstruation and&#xD;
      gradually increases. It tends to subside once menstruation has started and often disappears&#xD;
      after a few days. Pain in these women usually abates after the menopause. These factors&#xD;
      suggest a hormonal aetiology, high level of estrogen, low level of progesterone, and&#xD;
      imbalance in estrogen to progesterone ratio are assumed among its causes, as well.&#xD;
      Furthermore, many women associate the onset and resolution of cyclical mastalgia with a&#xD;
      hormonal event, such as pregnancy or taking the oral contraceptive pill .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, there is no relationship to the menstrual cycle with non-cyclical mastalgia.&#xD;
      Non-cyclic breast pain may result from pregnancy, mastitis, trauma, thrombophlebitis,&#xD;
      macrocysts, psychologic disturbance, benign tumors, or cancer. However, only a minority of&#xD;
      breast pain is explained by these conditions. Most non-cyclic breast pain arises for unknown&#xD;
      reasons. Typically, it presents at a later age; most women are in the fourth or fifth decade&#xD;
      of life at diagnosis. Many women are postmenopausal at onset of symptoms. Unfortunately, the&#xD;
      course of both cyclical and non-cyclical mastalgia may be long and last many years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The origin of extra-mammary pain is variable. Referred pain from cardiac, pulmonary and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal causes, such as angina, pneumonia and oesophagitis, respectively, need to be&#xD;
      excluded. A common cause of extra-mammary mastalgia arises from inflammation of the&#xD;
      costochondral junctions of the chest wall (Tietze's disease). This condition usually resolves&#xD;
      with rest and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mastalgia may be bilateral, may be in only one breast or part of one breast, and may radiate&#xD;
      to the axilla and down the medial aspect of the upper arm. The affected breast is often&#xD;
      extremely tender to touch and pain may be accompanied by swelling and congestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of medical therapies such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),&#xD;
      vitamin B2, B6, E and C, diuretics, progesterone, thyroxin, Tamoxifen, Bromocriptine,&#xD;
      Danazol, and plant extracts like evening primrose oil (EPO) and vitexagnus castus have been&#xD;
      recommended for treatment of mastalgia. Unfortunately, Non-cyclic mastalgia responds poorly&#xD;
      to medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological reassurance and active life style play a role to decrease the pain and low-fat,&#xD;
      high-carbohydrate diet can also effect an improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the female breast supplied its innervation from the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches&#xD;
      of the second to the sixth intercostal nerves .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tamoxifen is one of the medical treatment of mastalgia and considered as a first medication&#xD;
      line. Tamoxifen 10 mg daily is effective in the treatment of mastalgia. It has side effects&#xD;
      commonly observed in short-term treatment as weight gain, nausea, hot flashes (10%), bloating&#xD;
      (5% or less), menstrual irregularity, amenorrhea (10%) and vaginal dryness. Thromboembolic is&#xD;
      a rare but serious side effects of tamoxifen so it is contraindicated in women with a history&#xD;
      of thromboembolic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) has recently been developed with widely usage by pain&#xD;
      practitioners as alternative therapeutic technique for relief of chronic pain .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, the investigators aim that the additional pulsed radiofrequency of 2nd , 3rd&#xD;
      and 4th thoracic dorsal root ganglia to the routine regimen treatment of mastalgia tamoxifen&#xD;
      10 mg daily may improve breast pain severity and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposal: Is to find that pulsed radiofrequency of 2nd , 3rd and 4th thoracic dorsal root&#xD;
      ganglia may improve breast pain severity and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of additional pulsed&#xD;
      radiofrequency (2nd , 3rd and 4th thoracic dorsal root ganglia) to the routine regimen&#xD;
      treatment of mastalgia tamoxifen 10 mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Management of non cyclic mastalgia is a challenging issue needing more&#xD;
      appropriate method to reach the best result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recharge Gap: To our knowledge, there is a no researches discuss this issue and how to manage&#xD;
      it in best way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approval of the local ethics committee (Mansoura university), twenty six patients&#xD;
      complain from non-cyclic mastalgia aged from 18 to 60 with VAS &gt; 4 was enrolled in this&#xD;
      prospective study who were recruited from outpatient pain clinic in Oncology Center Mansoura&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was assessed using G-power analysis. Assuming α (type I error) = 0.05 and β (type II&#xD;
      error) = 0.2 (power = 80 %) and effect size (δ) = 0.6 yielded a total sample size of 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients was randomly classified into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (n=13): they was received Tamoxifen 10 mg daily. Group B (n=13): they was received&#xD;
      Tamoxifen 10 mg daily and pulsed radiofrequency of 2nd , 3rd and 4th thoracic dorsal root&#xD;
      ganglia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: cyclical mastalgia, extra-mammary mastalgia patients refusal, suspicion&#xD;
      of malignancy, acute inflammatory breast conditions, presence of polycystic ovarian diseases&#xD;
      or cervical hyperplasia, pregnant patients and patients during lactation period, coagulopathy&#xD;
      disorder, sepsis at the side of injection, history of thromboembolic disease, mental disorder&#xD;
      and who was not willing or cannot finish the whole study, disturbed anatomy (congenital,&#xD;
      traumatic, and postsurgical), which increase the intervention difficulty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in group B will inform about the procedure and its possible consequences.&#xD;
      Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intravenous cannula was inserted and secured. All suitable resuscitation equipment and&#xD;
      drugs will available. Vital signs, heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation will&#xD;
      monitored throughout the procedure and up to 1 hour after the block performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resuscitation equipment must be readily available including endotracheal tubes of different&#xD;
      sizes, ambu bag, ventilator, druges eg. atropine and adrenaline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures were performed on a 64 MDCT scanner (Brilliance 64-Philips). The CT&#xD;
      acquisition parameters were 200 mAs, 120 kVp, 512 × 512 matrix, 1.172 pitches, 64 × 0.625 mm&#xD;
      section collimation, and 4 mm slice thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were lying prone. First, a level of T2, 3, 4 disc was detected then the target 2nd,&#xD;
      3rd and 4th thoracic nerve roots were identified. After marking the entry points, adequate&#xD;
      sterilization of the skin was achieved using bovidone iodine then the skin was anasthesied by&#xD;
      2 ml lidocaine 2% at each entry point. The Baileys radio frequency (RF) 22G, 10 cm, sharp&#xD;
      needles with 10 mm active tip was introduced to face the 2nd, 3rd and 4th thoracic nerve&#xD;
      roots. If the lung or the pleura are within the needle path injection of saline in order to&#xD;
      push the lung or the pleura away from the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When confirm the place of the needles tips, the sensory and motor stimulations were done by&#xD;
      the RF generator to get sensory paresthesia along T2, T3 and T4 dermatomes at 0.4-0.8 V and&#xD;
      intercostal fasciculation were obtained at double the sensory amplitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PRF course was carried out at 42°C for 120 s twice at each level followed by injection of&#xD;
      1 ml lidocaine 2% and 1 ml dexamethasone 4 mg at each level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After intervention, All patients were transferred to a recovery room for observation and&#xD;
      record any complication.&#xD;
