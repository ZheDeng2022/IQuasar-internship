      This study determined the effects of different iodine intake on the maternal and infant&#xD;
      health and provide evidence for studying the RNI and UL of iodine in pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The study of effect on mothers and their infants of the lack of iodine at different&#xD;
           gestation in adequate iodine area.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The purpose of this study was to detect the maternal thyroid function, growth and&#xD;
           neuropsychological development of infants in different pregnancy women with diverse&#xD;
           iodine intake levels, and to make a clear evaluation for the influence of iodine&#xD;
           deficiency during different pregnancy by following up iodine suitable early pregnancy&#xD;
           women and mild iodine deficient three pregnancy women as well as their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The study of recommended iodine intake (RNI) for healthy pregnant women in three&#xD;
           pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Different pregnancy women with different iodine intake levels were recruited and carried&#xD;
           out iodine balance experiment in the case of not interfering with their diet. In&#xD;
           addition, the iodine intake of the pregnant women when they reached &quot;zero iodine&#xD;
           balance&quot; was calculated, that was EAR of iodine in pregnant women. In conclusion, the&#xD;
           iodine balance experiment in pregnant women at different pregnancy improved the sample&#xD;
           collection methods and evaluation criteria and was more scientific and reasonable than&#xD;
           the classic iodine balance experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The study of effect of different levels of high iodine exposure on pregnant women,&#xD;
           delivery women and their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we made a prospective study of the early pregnancy women and their infants&#xD;
      exposed to different high iodine levels in high water iodine areas. At first we defined the&#xD;
      effects of long-term iodine excess exposure on the health of the mother and the infants by&#xD;
      combining with the reference index of the normal value of the thyroid function in different&#xD;
      maternal and postpartum periods, the level of growth and development of the offspring and the&#xD;
      assessment of the level of neuropsychological development. Furthermore the harmful effects of&#xD;
      different high levels of iodine exposure on pregnant women was synthetically analyzed. This&#xD;
      study obtained the safe intake level of iodine for pregnant women and provided scientific&#xD;
      basis for the formulation of iodine UL in pregnant women in China.&#xD;

      1. The relationship between iodine deficiency during pregnancy and maternal offspring health&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening of pregnant women with iodine deficiency:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A prevalence survey of pregnant women was conducted in iodine-sufficient area, combined&#xD;
           with the results of single spot urinary concentration, 24h urinary iodine concentration&#xD;
           and thyroglobulin level, screening out pregnant women with iodine deficiency during&#xD;
           first, second and third trimester of pregnancy. There are 60 pregnant women in each&#xD;
           group. At the same time, 60 pregnant women with iodine-sufficient during early pregnancy&#xD;
           were selected, and the total number of the four groups is 240.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Effects of iodine deficiency on pregnant women during different pregnancy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pregnant women with iodine deficiency were gived nutritional guidance, and were advised&#xD;
           to take iodine supplements. Follow-up with regularly collecting fasting venous blood,&#xD;
           dried whole blood and single spot urine was conducted, in order to dynamically grasp the&#xD;
           iodine nutritional status and thyroid function of pregnant women during different&#xD;
           pregnancy, and clarify the influence of iodine deficiency on pregnant women in each&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Effects of iodine deficiency on offspring during different pregnancy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The offspring of follow-up pregnant women were observed, collecting the heel blood at&#xD;
           birth for measuring TSH, and performing physical examination. Assessment of&#xD;
           neuropsychological development in offspring for two years after delivery was performed ,&#xD;
           in order to clarify the effects of iodine deficiency on the neuropsychological&#xD;
           development of offspring in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normally distributed variables were reported as the mean Â± standard deviation, comparison&#xD;
      between groups were analyzed with the use of t-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA), and&#xD;
      Pearson linear correlation was used for correlation analysis; Urinary iodine level is&#xD;
      lognormal distribution, so it was converted into logarithmic form and then analyzed.&#xD;
      Non-normally distributed variables were presented as median and interquartile range. The&#xD;
      Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for comparison between groups, and correlation analysis was&#xD;
      performed using the Spearman rank correlation test. The chi-squared test was adopted for the&#xD;
      comparison of enumeration data. P values below 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Study the RNI of iodine on pregnant women during different pregnancy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening of pregnant women during different pregnancy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A prevalence survey of pregnant women was conducted in iodine-sufficient area, based on&#xD;
           24h urinary iodine concentration, thyroglobulin level, related health check and medical&#xD;
           history query results, screening out pregnant women who meet the requirements of this&#xD;
           study during first, second and third trimester of pregnancy. Each group has 20 pregnant&#xD;
           women, and the total number is 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reasearch of the iodine EAR of pregnant women during different pregnancy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Iodine balance studies were performed on healthy pregnant women during first, second and&#xD;
           third trimester of pregnancy to evaluate the daily iodine intake and excretion,&#xD;
           including collecting and testing 24h dietary iodine intake, 24h urinary iodine and fecal&#xD;
           iodine excretion of subjects. The daily respiratory iodine intake and excretion of&#xD;
           subjects was assessed by measuring the iodine content in the air and exhaled breath. In&#xD;
           addition, according to the positive correlation between iodine balance value and iodine&#xD;
           intake, a scatter plot was drawn and curve fitting was performed. According to the&#xD;
           results of iodine balance experiment, the iodine balance regression curves of first,&#xD;
           second and third trimester of pregnancy were established , in order to determine the&#xD;
           level of iodine intake when the pregnant women reach the iodine balance, which is the&#xD;
           estimated average requirement (EAR) of pregnant women during different pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research of iodine RNI on pregnant women during different pregnancy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the obtained EAR values of iodine for different pregnancy and the 20% coefficient of&#xD;
      variation (CV), according to the formula: RNI=EAR+2CV=1.4EAR, the iodine RNI values of&#xD;
      pregnant women in different gestation were derived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Study on the relationship between iodine excess and maternal offspring health and iodine&#xD;
      UL of pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prospective study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pregnant women during early pregnancy who were exposed to different excessive water&#xD;
           iodine intake were enrolled in a large-scale epidemiological prospective study, in order&#xD;
           to assess the levels of iodine intake by collecting and testing random urinary iodine&#xD;
           and 24h urinary iodine levels, and to detect the thyroid function indicators under&#xD;
           different iodine intake levels to evaluate the health effects and harms of different&#xD;
           high iodine intake on pregnant women. At the same time, the growth and development of&#xD;
           the offspring and the level of neuropsychological development were evaluated to&#xD;
           determine the long-term iodine excess exposure to the health of pregnant women and&#xD;
           offspring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Discussion on iodine UL of pregnant women:&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to the urinary iodine level during pregnancy, the subjects were divided into&#xD;
           groups with different iodine intakes, with the TSH abnormal rate of pregnant women &gt; 5%&#xD;
           and the increase of FT3/FT4 as the end point, comprehensively determining the harmful&#xD;
           effects of different iodine intake on pregnant women and offspring, analyzing the iodine&#xD;
           safety intake level suitabled for pregnant women, and exploring the iodine UL of&#xD;
           pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epi-data was used to enter survey data. Univariate statistical analysis was used to analyze&#xD;
      the differences in evaluation indicators between different iodine intake levels..&#xD;
      Multivariate statistical analysis methods were used to analyze the safety of each iodine&#xD;
      intake level under multiple factors.&#xD;
