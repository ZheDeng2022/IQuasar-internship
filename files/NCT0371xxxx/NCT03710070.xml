    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases remain the number one cause of death globally, primarily consequence&#xD;
      of myocardial infarction. Although widely used in stable coronary artery disease (CAD),&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has not been shown to reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      myocardial infarction or death. In contrast, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)&#xD;
      significantly reduces rates of death and myocardial infarction compared to PCI, but at a&#xD;
      higher rate of stroke. Similarly, coronary collaterals exert a protective effect by providing&#xD;
      an alternative source of blood flow to a myocardial territory potentially affected by an&#xD;
      acute coronary occlusion. Coronary collaterals represent pre-existing inter-arterial&#xD;
      anastomoses and as such are the natural counter-part of surgically created bypasses.&#xD;
      Sufficient coronary collaterals have been shown to confer a significant benefit in terms of&#xD;
      overall mortality and cardiovascular events. In this regard, the concept of augmenting&#xD;
      coronary collateral function as an alternative treatment strategy to alter the course of CAD,&#xD;
      as well as to control symptoms, is attractive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While a multitude of interventions has been shown to be effective in collateral growth&#xD;
      promotion, so far, the effect of current interventions is only temporary, and therefore,&#xD;
      repeated application is necessary to sustain the level of collaterals. The prevalent in vivo&#xD;
      function of natural internal mammary arteries (IMA)-to-coronary artery bypasses and their&#xD;
      anti-ischemic effect has been recently demonstrated by the investigators' research group.&#xD;
      Levels of collateral function and myocardial ischemia were determined in a prospective,&#xD;
      open-label clinical trial of permanent IMA device occlusion. In this study, coronary&#xD;
      collateral function, has been shown to be augmented in the presence vs the absence of distal&#xD;
      permanent ipsilateral IMA occlusion. These findings have been corroborated by the observed&#xD;
      reduction in ischemia in the intracoronary ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary functional changes observed in response to permanent distal IMA occlusion have so&#xD;
      far, not been related to clinical outcome parameters. Therefore, a controlled, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind comparison of clinical efficacy between a group of patients receiving permanent&#xD;
      IMA occlusion vs. a sham-procedure will be consequently performed. Since single antianginal&#xD;
      agents have been demonstrated to increase exercise time in comparison to placebo, an&#xD;
      improvement of the physical performance due to the increased blood flow by the permanent&#xD;
      distal IMA occlusion is expected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite considerable advances in medicine, cardiovascular diseases remain the number one&#xD;
      cause of death globally. In industrialized countries, coronary artery disease (CAD) is the&#xD;
      leading cause of death, consequence of myocardial infarction (MI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with acute coronary syndrome, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been&#xD;
      shown to improve outcomes. For chronic stable CAD, a recent meta-analysis including more than&#xD;
      93'000 patients has concluded that there may be &quot;evidence for improved survival with new&#xD;
      generation drug eluting stents but no other percutaneous revascularization technology&#xD;
      compared with medical treatment&quot; . Conversely, a current review of recently published&#xD;
      meta-analyses and the detailed analyses of 3 widely quoted individual studies indicate no&#xD;
      difference exists among stable CAD patients between PCI and medical therapy regarding&#xD;
      nonfatal myocardial infarct or all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. A very recently&#xD;
      published randomized controlled trial among patients with stable, single-vessel CAD, the so&#xD;
      called ORBITA trial, has found that PCI of the stenotic lesion did not prolong exercise time&#xD;
      by more than the effect of a sham procedure during the short observation period of 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was superior to PCI in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes and multivessel CAD. CABG significantly reduced rates of death and myocardial&#xD;
      infarction compared to PCI, but at a higher rate of stroke. Furthermore, in patients with&#xD;
      advanced CAD, rates of myocardial infarction were more than 60% lower with CABG compared to&#xD;
      PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conceptually, the benefit of CABG over PCI is not surprising as PCI targets significant&#xD;
      coronary lesions thought to be responsible for causing ischemia. However, the deleterious&#xD;
      effects of atherosclerosis are not typically preceded by significant luminal vascular&#xD;
      narrowing. The vulnerable plaque eventually becoming the culprit plaque (causing myocardial&#xD;
      infarction or sudden cardiac death) has typically a relatively mild stenosis. Furthermore,&#xD;
      due to being multifocal and widespread, plaque vulnerability is not a target for, nor&#xD;
      amenable to PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversely, artificial - or natural - bypasses exert a protective effect by providing an&#xD;
      alternative source of blood flow to a myocardial territory potentially affected by an acute&#xD;
      coronary occlusion. Coronary collaterals represent pre-existing inter-arterial anastomoses&#xD;
      and as such are the natural counter-part of surgically created bypasses. Sufficient coronary&#xD;
      collaterals have been shown to confer a significant benefit in terms of overall mortality and&#xD;
      cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, the concept of augmenting coronary collateral function (i.e. coronary&#xD;
      arteriogenesis) as an alternative treatment strategy of revascularization to alter the course&#xD;
      of CAD is attractive. In particular, promotion of natural coronary bypasses is an appealing&#xD;
      concept for patients with CAD not or not entirely treatable by the conventional coronary&#xD;
      revascularization methods of PCI and CABG. According to an analysis by Williams et al, 142 of&#xD;
      493 patients with chronic stable CAD (29%) belonged to the group with incomplete coronary&#xD;
      revascularization (partial and no revascularization plus the so called no-option group), and&#xD;
      this group showed reduced survival during the 3-year follow-up period. Coronary collateral&#xD;
      function promotion from any source could, thus, contribute to the completeness of myocardial&#xD;
      revascularization. Incomplete coronary revascularization in chronic CAD has been shown in a&#xD;
      very large (n=35'993 patients), recently published registry-based study to reduce overall&#xD;
      survival according to the number of vessels not treated by PCI and according to the severity&#xD;
      of stenoses left untreated. Coronary arteriogenesis, i.e., the growth of pre-existing&#xD;
      collateral vessels has to occur well in advance of acute atherothrombotic coronary artery&#xD;
      occlusion in order to limit infarct size. The source of blood supply via natural coronary&#xD;
      bypasses (collateral arteries) to a circulatory area at risk for infarction can be within the&#xD;
      coronary circulation, but also via extracardiac paths, e.g., via internal mammary arteries&#xD;
      (IMA; also termed internal thoracic arteries). Extracardiac coronary artery supply is&#xD;
      conceptually related to the term coronary collateral circulation because of its known&#xD;
      anatomical structure as arterial anastomoses between, e.g., IMA, the pericardium and coronary&#xD;
      arterial branches. In an editorial, Kern and Seto recently commented the concept of&#xD;
      &quot;Stimulating extracardiac collaterals&quot; as follows: &quot;To be clinically relevant, coronary&#xD;
      collaterals should be a sustainable and sufficiently large source of myocardial perfusion and&#xD;
      reduce ischemia in daily life. It is conceivable that improved extracardiac collateral flow&#xD;
      has the potential to be exactly that.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is relevant due to its primary clinical in addition to surrogate marker efficacy&#xD;
      testing, which has not been performed so far for this new technique of coronary&#xD;
      arteriogenesis. If proven useful to extend physical exercise time in the context of mitigated&#xD;
      angina pectoris, a further option of myocardial revascularization for patients with CAD not&#xD;
      treatable by PCI or surgical bypass or not rendered asymptomatic by medical therapy would be&#xD;
      available. The catheter-based technique of IMA device occlusion is simple and safe, and if&#xD;
      shown efficacious, its action would be potentially sustainable due to the durability of&#xD;
      occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical Evidence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy to augment blood flow via the IMA as naturally existing extracardiac bypasses&#xD;
      has been shown in experimental studies in dogs. Bilateral IMA ligation has led to an acute&#xD;
      average increase in total coronary flow of about 6-10 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalent in vivo function of natural IMA-to-coronary artery bypasses and their&#xD;
      anti-ischemic effect has been recently demonstrated during temporary IMA balloon occlusion by&#xD;
      the investigators' research group. 180 pairs of measurements were performed in 120 patients&#xD;
      electively referred for coronary angiography. Levels of collateral function and myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia were determined during two coronary balloon occlusions, the first with, the second&#xD;
      without distal IMA balloon occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary collateral function, as determined by collateral flow index (CFI) has been&#xD;
      consistently increased in the presence vs the absence of distal ipsilateral IMA balloon&#xD;
      occlusion. These findings have been corroborated by the observed reduction in ischemia as&#xD;
      assessed by intracoronary ECG (icECG). Conversely, with distal contralateral IMA occlusion,&#xD;
      collateral function and ECG signs of ischemia have remained unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Evidence to Date:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical trials in humans on the effect of bilateral IMA ligation on angina pectoris were&#xD;
      carried out in the late 1950ies among a total of close to 500 symptomatic CAD patients.&#xD;
      Transthoracic access to the IMAs was performed under local anesthesia by a small incision&#xD;
      between the 2nd and 3rd rib. The primary endpoint of the clinical trials was angina pectoris,&#xD;
      and inconsistently, ECG signs of myocardial ischemia. While the uncontrolled trials reported&#xD;
      favourable results in terms of symptomatic relief of angina pectoris, the subsequently&#xD;
      performed sham-controlled, but very small trials of bilateral ligation showed similar&#xD;
      improvement in the sham as in the verum group. A major limitation of these studies lies in&#xD;
      the rather insensitive endpoints used, which preclude conclusions about the efficacy of IMA&#xD;
      ligation on extracardiac coronary collateral function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective, open-label proof-of-concept trial, the investigators' laboratory occluded&#xD;
      the right IMA (RIMA) permanently using a 4-5mm vascular plug in 50 CAD patients. As primary&#xD;
      study endpoint, CFI was obtained during ostial, 1-minute balloon occlusion of the untreated&#xD;
      right coronary artery (RCA) at baseline before RIMA device occlusion and 6 weeks later. CFI&#xD;
      changed from 0.071±0.082 at baseline to 0.132±0.117 (p&lt;0.0001) at follow-up examination. The&#xD;
      increase in RCA CFI was accompanied by a decrease in signs of myocardial ischemia during the&#xD;
      brief coronary occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently a controlled trial on the effect of permanent RIMA occlusion is ongoing, whereby&#xD;
      100 patients with chronic stable CAD (single-blinded for the procedure) are randomly&#xD;
      allocated (1:1) to the occlusion or to a sham control group. The study endpoints (CFI and&#xD;
      icECG and clinical signs of myocardial ischemia during RCA occlusion) as well as the&#xD;
      follow-up duration of 6 weeks are identical in the current and the previous proof-of-concept&#xD;
      trial. An interim analysis among the first 50 patients included in the trial has documented a&#xD;
      change in CFI among the patients of the RIMA occlusion group of +0.025±0.015 (p=0.008 vs the&#xD;
      sham control group), i.e., the amount of augmentation is similar as the CFI change found&#xD;
      during temporal RIMA occlusion with simultaneous ostial RCA occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acute functional changes observed by the investigators' study group in response to&#xD;
      temporary distal IMA balloon occlusion as well as the improvement of collateral function in&#xD;
      the right coronary artery with permanent distal IMA occlusion support the hypothesis that&#xD;
      extracardiac coronary collateral supply can be augmented by this intervention. However, the&#xD;
      effect of permanent IMA occlusion on clinical outcome in chronic stable CAD has not been&#xD;
      studied yet.&#xD;
