  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is an unresolved health problem. A sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle and a low cardiorespiratory condition both increase the risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, at a similar extent as that promoted by traditional risk factors, such as smoking,&#xD;
      high blood pressure or dyslipidemia. The scientific evidence regarding the effect of the&#xD;
      promotion of an active lifestyle on primary cardiovascular prevention is limited. Several&#xD;
      studies have shown that structured training programs (TP) are effective at short term, but at&#xD;
      the medium or long term their efficacy is still unknown. There are very few randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials, and there are almost no studies conducted in the primary care setting&#xD;
      which analyze the long-term effects of this type of program on primary cardiovascular&#xD;
      prevention. The investigators performed in primary care a previous quasi-experimental study&#xD;
      without control group demonstrating the short-term effectiveness in the improvements of both&#xD;
      physical condition and in the practice of physical exercise of this TP, the shortest so far&#xD;
      analyzed in primary care. With the current study the investigators also want to demonstrate&#xD;
      its short-term efficacy in the promotion of moderate-high physical activity and in the&#xD;
      practice of physical exercise, through a high-evidence design such as a randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial with a control group, also the extension of such efficacy in the medium and long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy of a supervised 2 month TP on short-term (1 month post-TP),&#xD;
      medium-term (6 months post-TP) and long-term (12 months post-TP) promotion of moderate-high&#xD;
      physical activity and practice of physical exercise, in a sedentary population with high&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk, attending primary care centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A parallel, randomized, intervention study, with a control group. Inclusion criteria: Men and&#xD;
      women of an age between 35 and 70 years, attending a primary care center in hospital&#xD;
      reference area, with high cardiovascular risk. Sedentary lifestyle defined by a score &lt;2 in&#xD;
      the brief Physical Activity Questionnaire for care consultations primary adapted to measure&#xD;
      the frequency of physical exercise and with a total result in the International Physical&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-long version ≤1500 METs x minutes/week, who agree to&#xD;
      participate and commit to compliance with the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomized (automated list generation) to a control group, consisting in&#xD;
      conventional management or to an intervention group (TP 2 months, 3 times / week). Both&#xD;
      groups received an educational talk about cardiovascular risk, healthy diet habits and&#xD;
      cardio-healthy exercise at the beginning of TP. Assessments were performed at baseline, and&#xD;
      at 3, 8 and 14 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Main outcome measure: differences between groups in the proportion of participants with&#xD;
           an &quot;Effective response in Physical Activity &quot;. This effective response was considered if&#xD;
           there was an increase ≥ 240 METs x minutes / week in the moderate-high physical activity&#xD;
           (measured by IPAQ-long version) in the final evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary outcome variables: differences between groups in the change in:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Physical exercise: quantitatively (measured by the sum of the results obtained in&#xD;
                items 22-25 of the IPAQ-long version), frequency (Physical Activity Questionnaire&#xD;
                for care consultations primary adapted to measure the frequency of physical&#xD;
                exercise), and intention (Questionnaire of Stages of Change of Exercise&#xD;
                (QSCE)-Short Form).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Global physical activity (measured with the total result in the IPAQ-long version).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Physical condition: ergometric variables (Peak Oxygen Consumption, exercise&#xD;
                duration, anaerobic threshold moment)) and 6 Minute Walk Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Other efficacy and safety variables: differences between groups in the changes in:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Anthropometric variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Biochemical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Mediterranean diet (simplified version of the questionnaire ¨Adherence to the&#xD;
                Mediterranean Diet¨).&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Quality of life (questionnaire SF36-long version).&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION The primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the main cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in most Western countries, is a priority. A sedentary lifestyle and a&#xD;
      low cardiorespiratory condition increase the risk of CVD with the same impact as the presence&#xD;
      of Cardiovascular Risk Factors (CVRF) such as smoking, high blood pressure or dyslipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the interventions aimed at promoting Physical Activity (PA), there are supervised&#xD;
      Training Programs (TP). In Primary Cardiovascular Prevention (PCVP), supervised TP appear to&#xD;
      be effective in the short term in improving cardiorespiratory fitness, glycemic control,&#xD;
      cardiovascular (CV) risk profile and in promoting a more active lifestyle. The effect of&#xD;
      these TPs in the medium-long term in PCVP is still unknown. In primary care, the ideal&#xD;
      context in which to apply interventions aimed at the promotion of a cardio-healthy lifestyle,&#xD;
      the few randomized controlled trials (RCT) conducted on the effects of this type of&#xD;
      interventions in the medium-long term obtain contradictory results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aims to analyze the short, medium and long term efficacy of a supervised&#xD;
      TP, performed in primary care and with the shortest duration so far contemplated (2 months),&#xD;
      in the promotion of moderate-high PA and in practice of physical exercise, in a sedentary&#xD;
      population with high CV risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Main objective: To determine the short, medium and long term efficacy in the field of&#xD;
           primary care of a supervised TP in the promotion of moderate-high PA, measured with the&#xD;
           variable &quot; Effective response in PA &quot; that is defined as an increase in moderate-high PA&#xD;
           (measured by the sum of the results in the moderate PA dimension and vigorous PA&#xD;
           dimension of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-long version of at&#xD;
           least 240 METs x minute/week (METs x min/wk), in a sedentary population with high CV&#xD;
           risk .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives: Determine the short, medium and long term efficacy in the primary&#xD;
           care area of a supervised TP in:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The practice of regular physical exercise, measured with items 22-25 of the&#xD;
                IPAQ-long version, with the Short Physical Activity Questionnaire for Primary Care&#xD;
                Consultations (PAQCCP) adapted to measure the frequency of exercise and with the&#xD;
                Questionnaire of Stages of Change of Exercise-Short Form (QSCE-Short form).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The overall PA measured with the total result obtained in the IPAQ-long version.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The cardiorespiratory condition measured with the Six Minute Walking Test (6MWT)&#xD;
                and the Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) variables Peak Oxygen Consumption&#xD;
                (VO2peak), exercise duration and Anaerobic Threshold (AT) moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The evolution of the main CVRF (smoking, body mass index, abdominal circumference,&#xD;
                systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glycaemia, glycated haemoglobin, total&#xD;
                cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c), low-density lipoprotein&#xD;
                cholesterol (ldl-c), triglycerides) and in the composition of the diet measure with&#xD;
                the simplified version of the questionnaire ¨Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet¨.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. The quality of life quantified with the questionnaire SF36-long version and in the&#xD;
                state of mind with the Beck Depression Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS, SCOPE AND CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION TO THE STUDY: Participants aged 35 to 70 years old&#xD;
      from the ¨Rambla¨ primary care center in the reference area of the Mutua Terrassa University&#xD;
      Hospital, sedentary and with high CV risk who agreed to participate and were committed to a&#xD;
      fulfillment of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedentary was considered one with a score in the PAQCCP (Puig A et al., Aten Primaria 2012;&#xD;
      44 (8): 485-93), adapted to measure the frequency of physical exercise, less than 2 and with&#xD;
      a result in the total IPAQ-long version ≤1500 METs x min /wk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high CV risk was defined by the presence of any of the following conditions: Diabetes&#xD;
      Mellitus type 2; Metabolic syndrome, defined by the criteria of the National Cholesterol&#xD;
      Education Program (NCEP) / American Heart Association (AHA); and / or Hypertension with at&#xD;
      least one associated CVRF (smoking, dyslipidemia, obesity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Last ambulatory visit performed in a period greater than one year at the&#xD;
      time of inclusion, pregnant women, comorbidities that prevent the patient from doing the TP,&#xD;
      not autonomy for a commitment to program compliance and / or previous CV events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PERIOD: after the inclusion period and the completion of an educational talk, the&#xD;
      participants were followed a total of 14 months. The total duration of the study was 36&#xD;
      months to complete all the groups and their follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLING AND TOTAL SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.20 in a bilateral contrast, 73&#xD;
      participants in the control group and 73 in the intervention group were required to detect a&#xD;
      clinically relevant difference between groups of at least 20% in the proportion of&#xD;
      participants with &quot;Effective response in PA&quot;. This response has been defined as the increase&#xD;
      in the moderate-high PA measured with the sum of the results in the moderate PA dimension and&#xD;
      vigorous PA dimension of the IPAQ-long version, of minimum 240 METs x min /wk. A proportion&#xD;
      of responding participants was assumed in PA of 11% in the control group and 31% in the&#xD;
      intervention group. A follow-up loss rate of 15% was estimated. The ARCOSENO approach was&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling was carried out by a simple randomization in an automated way, assigning to the&#xD;
      participants an identifier number corresponding to the control or intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE, INSTRUMENTATION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The family doctor of the primary care center made a first selection of candidates. After&#xD;
      receiving all the necessary information about the study and signing the informed consent, the&#xD;
      family doctor referred participants to the rehabilitation doctor. In the initial assessment&#xD;
      of the rehabilitation doctor a socio-demographic, anthropometric, analytical variables&#xD;
      (haemoglobin, lipid profile, glycemia, glycated haemoglobin and creatinine), systolic and&#xD;
      basal diastolic blood pressure, baseline heart rate, pathological history and CVRF and&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment were collected. In addition, the PAQCCP, the QSCE-Short Form, the&#xD;
      IPAQ-long version and the Beck Depression Index. All the questionnaires used in the study&#xD;
      were translated and validated into Spanish. 6MWT and CPET were performed. If the CPET was&#xD;
      clinically and /or electrically positive, the participants was not included in the study&#xD;
      until it was assessed by the Cardiologist of the program, and the latter would rule out the&#xD;
      presence of established CVD. After the assessment, the inclusion in the study of the selected&#xD;
      participants was confirmed and they were assigned to the control group or intervention group&#xD;
      as it corresponded to the automated randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant was assigned to the intervention group he received the following&#xD;
      attention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An educational talk about CV risk, diet and cardio-healthy exercise, given by the nurse&#xD;
           and the physiotherapist. The nurse gave the participant the information leaflet on&#xD;
           heart-healthy lifestyles and administered the simplified version of the questionnaire&#xD;
           ¨Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet¨ and the SF36 questionnaire-long version.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control visit by nurse, family doctor and rehabilitation doctor per month, at 6 months&#xD;
           and 12 months post-TP (coinciding in time with 3, 8 and 14 months of the day of the&#xD;
           educational talks common to the control group). In each visit the same variables were&#xD;
           collected as in the initial assessment and also possible pharmacological changes,&#xD;
           incidences, consultations with Cardiologist and medical tests performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant was assigned to the control group, he received the same attention as the&#xD;
      intervention group except that he did not perform the TP. The controls by nursing, family&#xD;
      doctor and rehabilitation doctor were carried out at 3, 8 and 14 months of the day of the&#xD;
      educational talks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An action protocol was followed for the control group and for the intervention group, so that&#xD;
      in the event that during the follow-up the CPET was clinically and / or electrically&#xD;
      positive, it was evaluated by the Cardiologist and if established CVD was confirmed, the&#xD;
      participant left the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VARIABLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Variable main result: differences between groups in the percentage of participants that&#xD;
           achieve an &quot; Effective response in PA &quot; defined by an increase in moderate-high PA&#xD;
           measured with the sum of the results in the PA dimension moderate and vigorous PA&#xD;
           dimension of the IPAQ-long version, of minimum 240 METs x min / wk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary outcome variables: differences between groups in the changes in the amount of&#xD;
           physical exercise measured by the sum of the results obtained in items 22-25 of the&#xD;
           IPAQ-long version, in the frequency of physical exercise (PAQCCP adapted), and in the&#xD;
           exercise intention (QSCE-Short form), changes in the global PA measured with the total&#xD;
           result in the IPAQ-long version, change in the physical condition variables (ergometric&#xD;
           variables (VO2peak, exercise duration, AT moment) and 6MWT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Other secondary variables: differences between groups in the changes in the analytical&#xD;
           and anthropometric variables, in blood pressure, in the simplified version of the&#xD;
           questionnaire ¨Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet¨, in the questionnaire SF36-long&#xD;
           version and in the Beck Depression Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collecting the variables, the data has been entered into a relational Access database&#xD;
      designed ad-hoc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this moment the debugging, consistency and quality control of the data are being carried&#xD;
      out, together with the first statistical analyzes at the post-program month (3 months&#xD;
      post-talks) through the Stata vs 13.0 program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison of results between control group and intervention group will be made at 3, 8&#xD;
      and 14 months of the day of the talks.&#xD;

    <description>The ¨Effective response in Physical Activity¨ is defined as an minimum increase of 240 METsxmin / wk in moderate-vigorous Physical Activity measured with the sum of the results in the moderate and vigorous Physical Activity dimension of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Long version.&#xD;
The International Physical Activity Questionnaire- long version (27 items) collects data in different domains and intensities (moderate, vigorous,walking) and includes sitting time. The units of measurement are METsxmin/week. The amount of physical activity is recorded by intensity (moderate, vigorous, walking) and the amount of total physical activity obtained by adding the records in each dimension according to intensity . A category of low physical activity is considered a result in the total physical activity below 600 METsxmin / week, moderate between 600 and 3000 METsxmin / week and high above 3000 MEtsxmin / week.</description>
