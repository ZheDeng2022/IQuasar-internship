    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter single arm phase II clinical trial. All eligible patients will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carboplatin (AUC 5) i.v. day 1 plus pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) i.v. day 1 plus atezolizumab 1200&#xD;
      mg i.v. day 1 plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg i.v. day 1 every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with non-PD after 4 cycles will be permitted to continue with maintenance therapy&#xD;
      with pemetrexed plus atezolizumab plus bevacizumab every 3 weeks until the time of disease&#xD;
      progression or intolerable toxicities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The hypothesis of this study is that the addition of Atezolizumab (an anti-PD-L1 antibody),&#xD;
      to the combination of Carboplatin plus Pemetrexed plus Bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with stage IV non-squamous,&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will improve progression free survival (PFS) compared with&#xD;
      a historical control of carboplatin plus pemetrexed plus bevacizumab.&#xD;

                  is chosen contraception method.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A barrier method may be used as the second contraceptive method. The reliability&#xD;
                  of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the&#xD;
                  clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic&#xD;
                  abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods)&#xD;
                  and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;

             a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men must&#xD;
             remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 120 days after&#xD;
             the last dose of study treatment to avoid exposing the embryo. Men must refrain from&#xD;
             donating sperm during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration&#xD;
             of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and&#xD;
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;

             anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during the course of&#xD;
             the study, with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who received acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant medication or a&#xD;
                  one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., 48 hours of&#xD;
                  corticosteroids for a contrast allergy) are eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids&#xD;
                  for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or low-dose&#xD;
                  corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are eligible&#xD;
                  for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with denosumab (a RANKL inhibitor) within 4 weeks prior to initiation of&#xD;
             study treatment. Patients receiving denosumab prior to enrollment must be willing and&#xD;
             eligible to receive a bisphosphonate during atezolizumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies&#xD;
             or fusion proteins&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or to any component of&#xD;
             the atezolizumab formulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known active Hepatitis B or C. Active Hepatitis B is defined as a known positive&#xD;
             HBsAg result. Active Hepatitis C is defined by a known positive Hep C Ab result and&#xD;
             known quantitative HCV RNA results greater than the lower limits of detection of the&#xD;
             assay. For patients with past HBV infection or resolved HBV infection (defined as the&#xD;
             presence of hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb] and absence of HBsAg), the patient is&#xD;
             only eligible if they are negative for HBV DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active tuberculosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known interstitial lung disease or history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,&#xD;
             organizing pneumonia (e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis, or&#xD;
             idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed&#xD;
             tomography (CT) scan; history of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field&#xD;
             (fibrosis) is permitted. Lymphangitic spread of the NSCLC is not exclusionary.&#xD;
