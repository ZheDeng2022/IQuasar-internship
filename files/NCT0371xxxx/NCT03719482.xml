      The overall goal of this protocol is to evaluate the biodistribution of [18F]MNI-1054 as a&#xD;
      LSD1 targeted radiopharmaceutical. The specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the radiation dosimetry of [18F]MNI-1054&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of [18F]MNI-1054&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Whole body tomographic PET images will be obtained for 6 healthy volunteers, and reviewed visually for assessment of body organ distribution of radioactivity. Volumes of Interest (VOI) will be placed on the visually identified source organs, and subsequently used for all the study PET frames. Activity within these volumes of interest is expressed in units of total radioactivity (kBq).&#xD;
Radioactivity will be corrected for body attenuation, but not for decay.</description>

             and laboratory tests at screening and prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are a current nonsmoker who has not used tobacco- or nicotine-containing products (eg,&#xD;
             nicotine patch) for at least 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug or first&#xD;
             invasive procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are a female subject of nonchildbearing potential, documented by medical records or&#xD;
             physician's note to be either surgically sterile (by means of tubal ligation only) or&#xD;
             post-menopausal for at least 1 year (i.e. 12 consecutive months with no menses without&#xD;
             an alternative medical cause) or, if they are of childbearing potential, must commit&#xD;
             to use two methods of contraception, one of which is a barrier method for the duration&#xD;
             of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are a male subject who is sterile or agrees to use an appropriate method of&#xD;
             contraception, including a condom with or without spermicidal cream or jelly, from the&#xD;
             first dose of study drug until 30 days after the last dose of study drug. No&#xD;
             restrictions are required for a vasectomized male subject provided the subject is at&#xD;
             least 1-year post bilateral vasectomy procedure prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
             A male subject whose vasectomy procedure was performed less than 1 year prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of study drug must follow the same restrictions as a nonvasectomized man.&#xD;
             Appropriate documentation of surgical procedure should be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must not donate sperm for the study duration and for 30 days following&#xD;

             wine [118 mL/4 oz], or distilled spirits [29.5 mL/1 oz] per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject consumes excessive amounts, defined as greater than 6 servings (1 serving&#xD;
             is approximately equivalent to 120 mg of caffeine) of coffee, tea, cola, energy&#xD;
             drinks, or other caffeinated beverages per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive pregnancy test result using serum beta-HCG, if female.&#xD;
