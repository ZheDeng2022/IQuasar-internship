  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 600,000 hysterectomies are performed in the United States each year, making it the&#xD;
      most common non-obstetric major surgery performed on women1. Estimates suggest that at least&#xD;
      30% of hysterectomies are performed laparoscopically or robotically with an increasing trend&#xD;
      toward minimally invasive approaches2. While a minimally invasive approach certainly provides&#xD;
      improved recovery, patients still experience substantial pain and most require opiate&#xD;
      medications for pain control. Incorporating a multimodal approach to postoperative pain&#xD;
      management through the use of field nerve blocks is potentially an ideal way to enhance&#xD;
      recovery and minimize the need for narcotic pain medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decade, the use of Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) blocks as an adjunct for&#xD;
      postoperative pain management has gained in popularity. First described in 2001 by Dr. Rafi&#xD;
      of Limerick3, Ireland, TAP blocks are now typically performed by an anesthesiologist with the&#xD;
      use of ultrasound guidance. The transversus abdominis plane is the neurovascular plane&#xD;
      between the aponeurosis of the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles. Herein lie&#xD;
      the afferent nociceptor nerve endings of T7-L1. Injection of a 20-30cc volume of anesthetic&#xD;
      into this plane causes a sensory nerve block to the ipsilateral antero-abdominal wall from&#xD;
      the costal margin to the symphysis pubis4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials have documented the validity of using TAP blocks for both open and&#xD;
      laparoscopic procedures and verified their use for postsurgical pain relief. Studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that TAP blocks for both open and laparoscopic hysterectomies are safe and&#xD;
      efficacious5, 6. In 2011, De Oliveira et al. demonstrated improved quality of recovery for&#xD;
      women undergoing preoperative ultrasound guided TAP infiltration with ropivacaine at the time&#xD;
      of laparoscopic hysterectomy7.&#xD;

      The primary goal of our study is to demonstrate that laparoscopically assisted bilateral&#xD;
      Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) block using liposomal bupivacaine is superior to&#xD;
      pre-incisional injection of bupivacaine in terms of peri-operative opiate use, pain scores&#xD;
      and overall patient satisfaction up to one week following surgery. Our recent research has&#xD;
      already demonstrated the safety of performing Laparoscopic assisted TAP blocks using&#xD;
      liposomal bupivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will evaluate the efficacy of laparoscopic TAP blocks with liposomal bupivacaine&#xD;
      by using VAS/numeric pain scores at rest and with cough in recovery at 1 and 2 hours post-op.&#xD;
      The trial will also utilize an OBAS patient survey, document peri-operative opioid pain&#xD;
      medication used intraoperatively, in PACU and overnight (if admitted), and assess length of&#xD;
      time in PACU and same-day discharge versus admission. Opioid pain medication use at home up&#xD;
      to one week will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES/SPECIFIC AIMS The goal of this research project is to prove that a&#xD;
      laparoscopically delivered TAP block using a combination of Liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel)&#xD;
      and Bupivacaine is an effective and feasible means for decreasing post-operative pain from&#xD;
      the immediate post-operative period up to one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research aims to demonstrate that TAP blocks, when delivered laparoscopically and by&#xD;
      using Liposomal bupivacaine will show a 20% benefit in post-operative QoR-15 scores on&#xD;
      post-operative days 1,2 and 7. Other objectives of our study will be to evaluate&#xD;
      peri-operative narcotic medication dosing, VAS/Numeric pain scores with cough at 1 and 2&#xD;
      hours in PACU, overnight narcotic use for patients who are admitted and narcotic pain pill&#xD;
      use at home up to 7 days. Finally, the study aims to confirm that this technique is simple to&#xD;
      perform, easy to implement and would offer a multi-modal anesthetic alternative to the&#xD;
      excessive use of post-operative opioid pain medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for laparoscopic or robotic hysterectomy are screened in the&#xD;
      pre-anesthesia care unit and if eligible are invited to enroll in the trial. Primary&#xD;
      Attendings for each surgery will advise patients of the option for the trial at pre-operative&#xD;
      appointments. Patients who agree to enrollment are appropriately consented and then&#xD;
      randomized to either control (pre-incisional anesthetic) or study (TAP) group. The patient&#xD;
      remains blinded to the arm of the study, but OR personnel are advised so as to prepare&#xD;
      medications and syringes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following induction of anesthesia, the patients in the TAP block arm are prepared and draped&#xD;
      for surgery allowing for mid-axillary access along the flank bilaterally. Once&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum and a port for the laparoscope were established, TAP block is performed&#xD;
      bilaterally by first palpating the external landmark within the Triangle of Petit, 2 cm above&#xD;
      the iliac crest. A 21-gauge Stimuplex Â® A insulated needle (Braun, Melsungen, Germany) is&#xD;
      used to enter the transversus abdominis neurovascular plane. Bilaterally, TAP block patients&#xD;
      receive 10cc of liposomal bupivacaine combined with 10cc of 0.25% bupivacaine and 10cc normal&#xD;
      saline. Patients in the pre-incisional injection arm of the study receive a total of 20cc of&#xD;
      0.25% bupivacaine total, equally distributed between the incisions. All patients receive&#xD;
      routine general anesthesia with opiate use adjusted as determined by the anesthesia provider.&#xD;
      The anesthesia team is neither blinded nor given specialized protocol instructions. At the&#xD;
      end of each case, narcotic dosage used is documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the patients will receive phone calls on post-operative days 1,2 and 7. They will be&#xD;
      asked their opiate pain medication usage, number of pills used and &quot;Overall Benefit of&#xD;
      Anesthesia&quot; (OBAS) scores will be obtained. The OBAS is a simple quality assessment&#xD;
      instrument shown to reliably measure benefit from post-operative pain therapy16 (Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;

           PRELIMINARY WORK IRB protocol #14-132 was discontinued 12/14/15 due to a protocol&#xD;
           violation. Because the study could not be completed with its original objectives, we are&#xD;
           seeking to repeat the study with a very similar protocol. While talking with patients&#xD;
           during the audit of their post-operative phone calls, it became clear that the&#xD;
           experimental arm of the study might, in fact, have had a beneficial impact on&#xD;
           post-operative recovery. As we do not have that portion of the data, we are seeking to&#xD;
           repeat the study with a few minor modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
           METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Study Design Proposed study design is for a Prospective Single blinded Randomized&#xD;
                Clinical Trial. The study aims to evaluate two arms and compare them: All patients&#xD;
                would undergo laparoscopic total hysterectomy or Robotic assisted laparoscopic&#xD;
                total hysterectomy with or without removal of adnexa. Patients would not be&#xD;
                excluded for having other simultaneous procedures such as appendectomy, excision of&#xD;
                endometriosis or pelvic lymph node dissection. Patients in one arm of the study&#xD;
                would receive a bilateral Laparoscopic Assisted TAP block with 10cc Liposomal&#xD;
                bupivacaine, 10cc 0.25% bupivacaine and 10cc normal saline each bilaterally at the&#xD;
                beginning of their surgery. The patients in the control arm of the study would&#xD;
                receive pre-incisional injections at the trocar incision sites using a total of&#xD;
                20cc 0.25% bupivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Study Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Women undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy or robotic assisted laparoscopic&#xD;
                hysterectomy with or without removal of adnexa would be eligible. Patients will be&#xD;
                randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Inclusion Criteria: Women undergoing TLH at Erlanger Hospital. They must be 18&#xD;
                years or older due to restrictions on Exparel. Women undergoing simultaneous lymph&#xD;
                node dissection, appendectomy, adhesiolysis or other incidental procedures would&#xD;
                not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Exclusion Criteria: Patient refusal. Soft tissue infection of the abdominal wall&#xD;
                and skin. Abnormality at the needle insertion site. Chronic opiate use within 3&#xD;
                months prior to surgery. Age less than 18 years. Anticipated need for extension of&#xD;
                incision greater than 2cm. Hepatic or renal impairment, current pregnancy or BMI&#xD;
                &gt;50.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c. Sample Size: 100 patients, 50 in each arm of the study. The sample size calculation&#xD;
           is based on an assumption that a 24% difference in VAS pain scores would be clinically&#xD;
           meaningful. A sample size of 41 patients in each cohort would be able to detect a 20%&#xD;
           difference in post-operative QoR-15 quality of life post-surgery scores with a power of&#xD;
           80%. This calculation was done with the assistance of Jenny Holcomb, PhD (See&#xD;
           accompanying paperwork).&#xD;
&#xD;
           d. Data Collection: Each patient will have paperwork designating name, demographics,&#xD;
           telephone numbers as well as pertinent PHI. Documentation of VAS scores, time-frame to&#xD;
           first request for opiate pain medications, post-operative pill counts and follow-up&#xD;
           phone questionnaire (OBAS) will be collected on accompanying forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           e. Data Handling: A file, with the paper work on each patient, will be handled by the&#xD;
           Principal Investigator, Shanti Mohling, MD and primary Co-investigator, Rayan Elkattah,&#xD;
           MD. Two personnel will be recruited to handle post-operative phone calls. They will be&#xD;
           carefully screened for reliability and phone-calls assessments will be periodically&#xD;
           audited to avoid the concerns occurring with #14-132. The charts will be stored in the&#xD;
           primary investigator's private office or in the research specialist's office (Patricia&#xD;
           Bush) during analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           f. Data Analysis: Following collection of data and collation of all data, the results&#xD;
           will be statistically analyzed with the help of statistician Jenny Holcomb, PhD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           g. Time Frame:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. 12 months for data collection. 2. 18 months time for completion of study including&#xD;
      analysis. h. Strengths/Innovation: Adding a simple technique for post-operative pain control&#xD;
      to the armamentarium of multi-modal anesthesia techniques will greatly enhance the options&#xD;
      for caring for patients around the time of laparoscopic surgery. Currently, I believe the&#xD;
      laparoscopic TAP block is a valuable, yet underutilized tool in the field of Minimally&#xD;
      Invasive Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Limitations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Liposomal bupivacaine is a milky white color and it would have been very difficult to&#xD;
           blind the surgeons infiltrating it as opposed to a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is a learning curve with developing an ability to do the TAP block&#xD;
           laparoscopically, however this technique has now been well practiced by our team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BMI, additional procedures, history of other pain issues, such as fibromyalgia, may all&#xD;
           be confounders to this study. All of these will be documented and hopefully averaged in&#xD;
           the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. RISKS/BENEFITS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Risks and side effects related to the TAP Block with liposomal bupivacaine include&#xD;
           bruising at the site of the injections, soreness, and a rare potential for intravascular&#xD;
           injection causing cardiac arrhythmia. These risks are similar to the risk of routine&#xD;
           bupivacaine in the trocar sites routinely used anyway. Of note, there were no&#xD;
           complications of laparoscopic TAP blocks during the course of our recent trial #14-132.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There are no known direct benefits to study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If the study demonstrates a benefit of the TAP block in controlling post-operative pain&#xD;
           better than simply using pre-incisional injections and decreases patient need for opiate&#xD;
           analgesia this will undoubtedly benefit patients in future.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. There are no potential ethical concerns with this study, especially given that it will&#xD;
           be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BUDGET Primary costs incurred will be files and paper products for VAS scores, charting on&#xD;
      recovery and post-op questionnaires. The cost of the procedural medications will be rolled&#xD;
      into the global surgical charge as pre-incisional anesthetics are already routinely billed&#xD;
      for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT All procedures will all take place at the time of surgery in the&#xD;
      operating room. Patients will receive information on the study in pre-op consultation or at&#xD;
      the time of arrival to the Pre-op arena.&#xD;
