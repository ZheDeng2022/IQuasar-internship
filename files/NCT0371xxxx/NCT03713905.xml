      Dose escalation study: Primary purpose: To investigate the safety and tolerability of GLS-010&#xD;
      in subjects with advanced solid tumors (mainly gastric cancer, esophageal cancer). Secondary&#xD;
      purpose: 1. To characterize the pharmacokinetics(PK) profile of GLS-010; 2. To determine&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity(DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) for GLS-010; 3. To assess the preliminary anti tumor activity of GLS-010; 4. To assess&#xD;
      programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor occupancy. Exploratory purpose: 1. To investigate the&#xD;
      preliminary relationship between the expression of the ligand of PD-1 (PD-L1) /PD-L2 and&#xD;
      efficacy; 2. To characterize immunogenicity of GLS-010. Expansion study: Primary purpose: To&#xD;
      assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of GLS-010 in subjects with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors(gastric cancer, esophageal cancer); Secondary purpose: 1. To further assess the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of GLS-010; 2. To further assess the safety and tolerability of GLS-010 in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced tumors. Exploratory purpose: 1. To assess PD-1 receptor occupancy of&#xD;
      GLS-010; 2. To assess the relationship between the expression of PD-L1/PD-L2 and efficacy; 3.&#xD;
      To further assess the immunogenicity of GLS-010.&#xD;
