  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this single-arm, one-stage Phase II study, the investigators hypothesize that gut&#xD;
      decontamination with rifaximin will reduce the frequency of hospital admission due to painful&#xD;
      crisis in patients with SCD. The study will accrue 20 SCD patients who had at least two&#xD;
      hospital admissions in the previous 12 months. These patients will receive rifaximin 550 mg&#xD;
      twice a day for a total of 12 months. This following clinical parameters will be measured: 1.&#xD;
      Changes in the annual rate of hospital admissions due to painful crisis; 2. Changes in the&#xD;
      annual rate of days hospitalized; 3. Annual rates of uncomplicated crises; 4. Annual rate of&#xD;
      acute chest syndrome; 5. Changes in the quality of life; and 6). Toxicities. The following&#xD;
      laboratory parameters will be measured: 1. Changes in the number of circulating activated&#xD;
      neutrophils; 2. Changes in the intestinal microbiome diversity; 3. Changes in the urinary&#xD;
      3-indoxyl sulfate levels; 4. Changes in the serum biomarkers of intestinal permeability&#xD;
      (lipopolysaccharides; zonulin, citrulline, and fatty acid binding proteins).&#xD;

      In this single-arm Phase II study, the investigators will accrue 20 SCD patients who had at&#xD;
      least two hospital admissions in the previous 12 months to receive rifaximin 550 mg twice a&#xD;
      day for a total of 12 months. The investigators will measure changes in the annual rate of&#xD;
      hospital admissions due to vaso-occlusive crisis and the annual rate of hospital days. The&#xD;
      investigators will also determine the annual rates of uncomplicated crises and acute chest&#xD;
      syndrome. Quality of life due to the disease and to treatment will be determined using a&#xD;
      questionnaire. This study will be complemented with exploratory laboratory studies to&#xD;
      determine changes in the number of circulating activated neutrophils, intestinal microbiome&#xD;
      diversity, urinary 3-indoxyl sulfate levels and serum biomarkers of intestinal permeability&#xD;
      (lipopolysaccharides; zonulin, citrulline, and fatty acid binding proteins).&#xD;
