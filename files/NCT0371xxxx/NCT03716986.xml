  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The imaging of cerebral oxygenation is an extremely important tool in understanding the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of the tumor and for adaptation of therapies according to hypoxia. Currently,&#xD;
      imaging of cerebral oxygenation is mainly performed by the use of Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography (PET). Thus, the investigators have been able to show that the FMISO radiotracer&#xD;
      can reveal tumor hypoxia (HypOnco study, promotor: Caen University Hospital, main&#xD;
      investigator: J.S. Guillamo). After injection of the radiotracer, increased uptake is&#xD;
      observed in the regions for which the tissue oxygen pressure is less than 10 mmHg (the&#xD;
      healthy brain with a tissue oxygen pressure (ptO2) ≈ 40mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although PET is a reference methodology, it is not widely practiced mainly because of&#xD;
      radioactive sources. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) would bypass the previously mentioned&#xD;
      PET limitations. The investigators have recently shown that a measure of local oxygen&#xD;
      saturation could be obtained by MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This methodology has also been implemented at a clinical scale on lower field MRI magnets,&#xD;
      but its formal validation in a clinical situation remains to be demonstrated with respect to&#xD;
      FMISO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major advantage of this methodology is that MRI is already performed in routine practice&#xD;
      for patients. Measuring tissue oxygenation with MRI (SatO2-MRI) would not add additional&#xD;
      examination for the patient. In addition, MRI is a non-ionizing methodology with a very good&#xD;
      spatial resolution compared to PET, this should help to better understand intratumoral&#xD;
      heterogeneity. Similarly, in preclinical studies, the investigators have shown in a context&#xD;
      of mild hypoxia that SatO2-MRI may be more sensitive than PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a study to compare in patients with glial tumors, images obtained&#xD;
      by 3 Tesla MRI of SatO2-MRI to the hypoxia maps obtained by FMISO PET. These imaging studies&#xD;
      will be confronted with studies carried out in immunohistochemistry on biopsies / resection&#xD;
      allowing to reveal and to quantify by image analysis the expression of the factors induced by&#xD;
      hypoxia (HIF1, HIF2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study should include 20 patients with glioma (15 high-grade patients and 5 low-grade&#xD;
      patients) in pre-surgery. The aim is to show that SatO2-MRI is a relevant methodology (in&#xD;
      terms of sensitivity, specificity) for assessing intratumoral oxygenation in a context of&#xD;
      brain tumors. This fits perfectly into an era of personalized medicine where functional&#xD;
      imaging finds its meaning.&#xD;
