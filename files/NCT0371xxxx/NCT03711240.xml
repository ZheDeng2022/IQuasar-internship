    <textblock>
      This single-arm study will evaluate the resection rate of liver metastases in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer and borderline unresectable liver metastases receiving treatment&#xD;
      with bevacizumab in combination with modified-FOLFOXIRI as first line treatment. Patients&#xD;
      will receive bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) plus modified-FOLFOXIRI (irinotecan 150 mg/m2, oxaliplatin&#xD;
      85 mg/m2, leucovorin 200 mg/m2, and fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 as a 46-h continuous infusion)&#xD;
      every 14 days as neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen. This study treatment will continue until&#xD;
      surgery, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study to investigate the efficacy of biweekly bevacizumab in combination&#xD;
      with modified-FOLFOXIRI regimen, as first-line chemotherapy in patients with borderline&#xD;
      resectable colorectal liver metastases. Borderline resectable liver metastases are considered&#xD;
      to have poor-risk diseases infeasible for upfront resection, but own the potential for&#xD;
      resection after down-staging. The primary purpose of the study is to determine the resection&#xD;
      rate of liver metastases in patients receiving this combination regimen. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to determine the response rate, progression free survival, overall survival,&#xD;
      and safety profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive a triplet chemotherapy consisting of bevacizumab (5 mg/kg)&#xD;
      plus modified-FOLFOXIRI (irinotecan 150 mg/m2, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, leucovorin 200 mg/m2,&#xD;
      and fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 as a 46-h continuous infusion) every 14 days as a cycle.&#xD;
      Resectability of primary tumor and liver metastases will be assessed after five cycles of&#xD;
      combination treatment with feasible image exams. Patients with progressive disease will be&#xD;
      discontinued in this study. For patients feasible for tumor resection, the modified triplet&#xD;
      chemotherapy without bevacizumab combination will be continued for one other cycle for&#xD;
      patients before surgery. If patients don't reach both the feasibility of tumor resection and&#xD;
      progressive disease, another four cycles of bevacizumab combined with modified-FOLFOXIRI&#xD;
      could be continued by investigator's judgement. Reassessment of resectability for primary&#xD;
      tumor and liver metastases will be conducted using feasible image exams after a total of 9&#xD;
      cycles of combination treatment in these patients. Similarly, the triplet chemotherapy&#xD;
      without bevacizumab combination will be continued for the other one cycle before surgery for&#xD;
      these patients feasible for tumor resection after reassessment. Bevacizumab should be stopped&#xD;
      at least 4 weeks before the planned day of surgery. Short-course radiotherapy will be allowed&#xD;
      before surgery for patients with rectal cancer. All patients will be discontinued in this&#xD;
      study after tumor resection. Treatment will also be discontinued if the patient requests or&#xD;
      the investigator decides that therapy should be withdrawn. Further tumor treatment after&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation will be decided based on investigator's judgement with the best&#xD;
      knowledge.&#xD;
