      Analyze patient experience of elders admitted to the Emergency Department Elder Friendly Area&#xD;
      (EFA) and determine possible improvement options and potential solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Method: This is a qualitative and quantitative evaluation project. The project will use a&#xD;
      creative problem-solving methodology (Design Thinking) to analyze the care process based on&#xD;
      the experience of Elder Friendly Area (EFA) users and their families. Design Thinking is a&#xD;
      creativity and innovation methodology that compiles tools based on design principles for&#xD;
      problem solving. It is characterized by having the ability to mix convergent and divergent&#xD;
      thinking, reconciling rational and intuitive thinking. This methodology consists of 4 phases:&#xD;
      Mapping, Exploring, Building and Testing. In each of them, the tools and techniques help us&#xD;
      to observe, get involved and immerse ourselves in the patient's ecosystem, with the aim of&#xD;
      designing a solution WITH the user and not just FOR him. Consequently, the error is reduced&#xD;
      and the modifications and improvements of our projects are speeded up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Patients/caregivers attended in the Emergency Department's EFA will participate .&#xD;
      In the first fieldwork, 50-60 patients will participate, conducting a self-completed&#xD;
      interview (prior informed consent, 10 minutes long).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the qualitative research phase, 5-10 patients/caregivers conduct a 30-minute interview&#xD;
      with the Design Thinking professional. The co-creation workshop lasts a couple of hours and 5&#xD;
      to 10 patients/caregivers will participate. In the second fieldwork another 50-60 patients&#xD;
      will participate. In total, between 110 and 140 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics: Patients/caregivers will be provided with a patient information sheet and informed&#xD;
      consent prior to participation. Patient experience data will be collected by Design Thinking&#xD;
      professional on an anonymous basis and will always be handled on an aggregate basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding: The project will be developed in collaboration with Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Spain, with&#xD;
      which there is an agreement signed (Fundaci贸 de Gesti贸 HSCSP - MSD). For the correct&#xD;
      development of it, MSD has hired a company expert in the development of this type of dynamics&#xD;
      (Thinkers&amp;Co) which will participate actively in all meetings and workshops and will be&#xD;
      responsible for collecting the opinion of the patient anonymously and manage this information&#xD;
      in an aggregate way, always with the intention of identifying the points of improvement on&#xD;
      which later health professionals will work with the methodology described. However, no&#xD;
      monetary payment will be made to the hospital, to the emergency department or to the&#xD;
      professionals involved. The collaboration of MSD and Thinkers&amp;Co will not affect the&#xD;
      independent nature of the project.&#xD;
