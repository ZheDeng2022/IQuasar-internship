  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases occurs in up to 50% of patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC. Leptomeningeal&#xD;
      disease is a subset of patients with brain metastases for which there remains an unmet need.&#xD;
      This trial aims to evaluate the role of two dosing schedules of afatinib in management of&#xD;
      leptomeningeal disease in EGFR mutant NSCLC, specifically to determine Central Nervous System&#xD;
      (CNS) penetration of afatinib, as well as clinical activity. Patients will start on daily&#xD;
      dosing initially followed by pulsed intermittent dosing should we observe no clinical&#xD;
      activity. A secondary objective is to identify the resistance spectrum in leptomeningeal&#xD;
      disease. It is anticipated that optimal dosing schedule of afatinib e.g. pulsed dosing may&#xD;
      improve CNS disease control.&#xD;
