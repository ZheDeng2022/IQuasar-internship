  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with sepsis (2 or more systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria and&#xD;
      suspected infection) assessed in the emergency department have blood cultures obtained to&#xD;
      identify potential blood stream infections (BSI). Blood cultures are expensive, sometimes&#xD;
      inaccurate, and only positive about 10% of the time in the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the effect of physician knowledge of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels on&#xD;
      ordering rates of blood cultures in emergency department patients with sepsis. All patients&#xD;
      with sepsis will have CRP levels measured using a point-of-care device, prior to blood tests&#xD;
      being ordered. Half of participants will have their CRP level available to the emergency&#xD;
      physician and half will not. Blood culture ordering rate and safety outcomes will be compared&#xD;
      between these two groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis, which is defined as the presence of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)&#xD;
      in conjunction with a suspected or proven infection, is a significant cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. It is an extremely common presentation in emergency departments. Most sepsis&#xD;
      protocols and guidelines call for blood cultures to be obtained in patients with sepsis, in&#xD;
      order to identify blood stream infections (BSI) which are usually caused by bacteria in the&#xD;
      blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood cultures obtained in the emergency department are costly, subject to false positive&#xD;
      results, and only positive about 10% of the time. Also, they rarely change patient&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) is an inflammatory marker that rises rapidly in the presence of&#xD;
      bacterial infections. Because CRP rises as much as 100 times normal levels in the presence of&#xD;
      bacterial infections, we have used it successfully to identify patients with sepsis who do&#xD;
      not require a blood blood culture, we believe that physicians knowledge of CRP levels can&#xD;
      help to guide their decision to order blood cultures.Patients with sepsis (2 or more SIRS&#xD;
      criteria and presumed infection) will have their CRP levels measured using a point of care&#xD;
      device (Alere Afinion AS100 Analyzer) prior to blood tests being ordered. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to either have their CRP value shown to the attending physician or not. Rates of&#xD;
      blood culture ordering and safety outcomes will then be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
