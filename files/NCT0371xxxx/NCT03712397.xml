  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, multicenter phase 2 study. The study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      activity of a combination therapy with nal-IRI (PEP02, MM-398, Onivyde®) plus 5-FU and&#xD;
      leucovorin in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of head &amp; neck and esophagus failed to&#xD;
      platinum-based treatment in prior chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. The primary endpoint is&#xD;
      to assess the objective tumor response rate (ORR). Eligible patients will be enrolled to&#xD;
      receive combination therapy of nal-IRI plus 5-FU and Leucovorin on day 1, every 2 weeks.&#xD;
      Every 2 weeks will be counted as one cycle. Treatment will continue until disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity or other condition meeting the discontinuation criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, uncontrolled, open-labeled, and one-arm study. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be treated with combination therapy of nal-IRI 80 mg/m2 for 90 minutes,&#xD;
      leucovorin 400 mg/m2 for 30 minutes and 5-FU 2400 mg/m2 for 46 hours in sequence at day 1,&#xD;
      every 14 days counted as one cycle. Modification of treatment dose is allowed according to&#xD;
      the toxicities occurred in the previous treatment cycle. Patients will be treated until&#xD;
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or other condition meeting the treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor response will be assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) every 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute's Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor marker response of SCC antigen will be evaluated by the change of serum SCC antigen&#xD;
      level every 6 weeks. Tumor marker response is defined as a decrease of SCC antigen after&#xD;
      treatment in relation to the pretreatment level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients sign additional consent to participate in the pharmacogenetic and serum biomarker&#xD;
      evaluation will be required to have extra blood samplings at the study entry and every 6&#xD;
      weeks thereafter for up to the maximum 4 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up visit is required approximately 30 days after treatment discontinuation. Overall&#xD;
      survival status will be followed by clinic visit or by phone every 3 months until death or&#xD;
      the maximum of 3 years, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
