      The aim of the study is to evaluate the patients' satisfaction, peri-implant parameters&#xD;
      (bleeding on probing, probing depth and plaque index) and crestal bone resorption of implants&#xD;
      restored with PEEK abutments restored with PEEK superstructure compared to implants restored&#xD;
      with zirconia abutments with PEEK superstructure.the NULL HYPOTHESIS;There is no difference&#xD;
      between the two groups&#xD;

      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized Controlled Trial., Parallel Design., Allocation ratio 1:1&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out on patients enrolled from the Outpatient clinic in the Fixed&#xD;
      Prosthodontics clinic, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Visit: ( Diagnosis and records Making)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recalled to the outpatient clinic, treatment will be discussed with the&#xD;
      patient in details with the expected timeline and full duration of the treatment and a signed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thorough medical history will be taken from the patient to identify any causes preventing the&#xD;
      patient from undergoing the surgery and to eliminate any risk factors. Primary alginate&#xD;
      impressions and bite registration will be made to obtain mounted study casts for case study,&#xD;
      intra-oral photographs will be taken and the patient will be asked for a CBCT for the area of&#xD;
      interest to be studied and discussed .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second visit: (Implant insertion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be locally anaesthetized using Articaine 4% (Septanest, France) , and&#xD;
      patient will be left for 5 -10 minutes after which he/she will be examined for&#xD;
      objective/subjective signs. If the patient shows any signs of pain or discomfort during&#xD;
      examination, another carpule will be administrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A full thickness flap will be opened at the surgical site using #15 blade with a sub-crestal&#xD;
      incision to expose the crest of the bone and two vertical releasing incisions. The flap will&#xD;
      be reflected using a mucoperiosteal elevator. Sequential drilling will be performed according&#xD;
      to the desired implant diameter using the drills provided by the surgical kit and the implant&#xD;
      will be inserted manually into the osteotomy using the ratchet wrench and driver. The initial&#xD;
      stability of the implant will be tested with the torque wrench and the implant opening will&#xD;
      be closed using a cover screw. A peri-apical radiograph will be taken to confirm the implant&#xD;
      position and assure it is away from vital structures by 2mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flap will be repositioned using a tissue forceps and suturing will be done to secure the flap&#xD;
      in position using a 4-0 silk suture material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be given the post-operative instructions and hygiene measures and Augmentin 1gm&#xD;
      / 12 hours for 7 days and analgesics ( Brufen 400 mg when needed)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third visit: (Re-entry)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After three to four months, the patient will be recalled for the 2nd stage surgery and&#xD;
      implant exposure. Peri-apical radiographs and intra-oral photographs will be taken. The&#xD;
      patient will be anaesthetized and the implant will be exposed by a crestal incision using a&#xD;
      #15 blade. The cover screw will be replaced with a healing collar which will be left for 2&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourth visit: (Impression making):&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 2 weeks the healing collar will be removed and the transfer copings will be placed for&#xD;
      impression making, after setting the impression will be disinfected and send to the&#xD;
      laboratory along with the implant replicas for fabrication of the abutments and the&#xD;
      prosthesis. The healing collar is replaced till the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifth visit: ( Delivery of the final restoration)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The healing collar will be removed and the abutment and final restoration will be placed over&#xD;
      the implant, a peri-apical radiographs will be taken to ensure tightening of the abutment&#xD;
      screw and absence of any gaps. Patient will be given oral hygiene instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant care/interventions that will be permitted or prohibited during the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive antibiotics and pain killers after the implant insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be educated with proper hygiene measures and motivated to keep good oral&#xD;
           hygiene&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be advised to stop/ decrease the frequency of smoking to maximum one pack&#xD;
           per day and will be prohibited from drinking alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' satisfaction will be measured used the Visual analogue scale; a numerical scale&#xD;
      from 0-10 with 0 being the lowest value (dis-satisfied) and 10 being the highest (highly&#xD;
      satisfied). The patient will be asked to fill the VAS at time of crown delivery (0) ,&#xD;
      3months, 6 months and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome: will be assessed at 0,3,6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bleeding on Probing Visual Inspection combined with Plastic Periodontal Probe 2 Binary&#xD;
           (Yes or No)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Probing Depth Graduated periodontal probe 2 Millimeters (m.m)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Plaque accumulation Visually 2 Binary (Yes &amp; No)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be assessed at 0,3,6 and 12 months using the standardized peri-apical radiographs and&#xD;
      image super-imposition on the software to measure the difference in bony crest height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where 0= time of prosthesis delievery.&#xD;
