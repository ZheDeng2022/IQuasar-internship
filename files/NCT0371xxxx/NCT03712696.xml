  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) is one of the most common and emotionally distressing&#xD;
      side effects of cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we sought to assess the feasibility and the effectiveness of scalp cooling&#xD;
      system DigniCap® to prevent alopecia in primary breast cancer patients receiving an&#xD;
      anthracycline containing adjuvant chemotherapy (CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective two-stage design clinical trial conducted at a single Institution of women with&#xD;
      primary breast cancer scheduled to receive anthracycline with or without taxane-based&#xD;
      adjuvant CT. Patients were enrolled from July 2014 to November 2016, with ongoing annual&#xD;
      follow up for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scalp cooling period initiated approximately 30 minutes before CT. Scalp temperature was&#xD;
      to be maintained at 3-5°C throughout CT and for 90 to 120 minutes afterward, depending on the&#xD;
      CT drug and dose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scalp cooling to prevent chemotherapy-induced alopecia has been in use since the 1970's and&#xD;
      offers excellent or good prevention of alopecia caused by many chemotherapeutic regimens,&#xD;
      including those commonly used for breast cancer. The protection from alopecia offered by&#xD;
      scalp cooling is a consequence of vasoconstriction resulting in reduced blood flow in the&#xD;
      scalp, and reduced metabolic rate in the hair follicles with consequent decreased exposure to&#xD;
      the chemotherapeutic agents. This limits the damage to dividing cells in the hair follicles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, scalp cooling is well tolerated. Tolerance can be graded by a Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scale of 0-10, in which 0 represents 'not tolerable' and 10 means 'really well tolerable'.&#xD;
      Mean scores vary between 6.9 and 8.0. No serious side effects have been reported. The most&#xD;
      common reported side effects are headaches, unpleasant feelings due to the heaviness of the&#xD;
      cap and coldness, dizziness and transient lightheadedness. Headaches are mostly not severe&#xD;
      and can usually be prevented by paracetamol. Freezing has never been reported. Side effects&#xD;
      in more than 10% of the patients were the reason to stop scalp cooling in only four of all&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DigniCap® System has been developed to provide continuous scalp cooling with high efficacy,&#xD;
      safety and acceptable patient comfort. The system consists of a refrigerator unit integrated&#xD;
      into a control unit based on a computerized interface. The system forms a compact mobile&#xD;
      cabinet to which a soft and tight-fitting silicon cap is connected via a tube. A liquid&#xD;
      coolant is pumped from the cooled reservoir in the cabinet to circulate through small canals&#xD;
      within the cap. Two separate cooling circuits allow coolant to flow through the front and the&#xD;
      back of the cap autonomously. Scalp temperature is monitored by three separate sensors in the&#xD;
      cap: two temperature sensors and a security sensor. Deviations from the preset temperatures&#xD;
      are immediately detected and automatically adjusted by the system. An outer cap made of&#xD;
      neoprene is used to secure and insulate the inner silicon cap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since hair loss becomes noticeably visible after the loss of 50% or more of the scalp hair,&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of the Dignicap System to prevent chemotherapy induced alopecia will&#xD;
      be evaluated in women with early breast cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. The&#xD;
      scalp cold cap will be applied at each chemotherapy cycle. Hair loss will be evaluated by&#xD;
      patient self assessment (VAS scale), and by means of 5 standardized photographs taken prior&#xD;
      to each chemotherapy cycle and by physician by the 5 point Dean's scale.&#xD;
