  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional neurological disorders (FND) are neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by&#xD;
      a lesion or related to an identified dysfunction of the central nervous system. FND are&#xD;
      under-diagnosed, although common and highly disabling. Childhood trauma events are found in&#xD;
      30% to 80% of FND patients, and are more common in people with functional neurological&#xD;
      disorder than in healthy controls and patient controls. Overall, risks factors, perpetuating&#xD;
      factors and maintaining factors have been described in FND, although none of the studies have&#xD;
      analysed the prevalence of Early Maladaptive Schemas (EMS) in these patients. EMS, as&#xD;
      measured with the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ), are proposed to underlie a variety of&#xD;
      mental health problems, in particular Personality Disorders. We hypothesize that some of&#xD;
      these early maladaptive schemas may participate in the psychopathology and severity of FND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome of this study is to assess the prevalence of early maladaptive schemas in&#xD;
      patients presenting with Functional Movement Disorders in comparison to patients presenting&#xD;
      with Parkinson's Disease or Organic Dystonia. The secondary outcomes are to further analyse&#xD;
      the underlying relation of these early maladaptive schemas and (i) the severity of the motor&#xD;
      symptoms, (ii) anxiety and/or depression, (iii) the occurrence of childhood trauma events in&#xD;
      our participants.&#xD;

      Functional neurological disorders (FND) are neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by&#xD;
      a lesion or related to an identified dysfunction of the central nervous system. FND are&#xD;
      under-diagnosed, although common and highly disabling. Functional Movement Disorders are a&#xD;
      sub-category of FND, affecting the voluntary motor command. Childhood trauma events are found&#xD;
      in 30% to 80% of FND patients, and are more common in people with functional neurological&#xD;
      disorder than in healthy controls and patient controls. Overall, risks factors, perpetuating&#xD;
      factors and maintaining factors have been described in FND, and some team research as Brown&#xD;
      R. and al. have attempted to include it in psychopathological models such as the Integrative&#xD;
      Conceptual Model in 2004. Nonetheless, none of the studies have analysed the prevalence of&#xD;
      Early Maladaptive Schemas (EMS) in these patients. EMS, as measured with the Young Schema&#xD;
      Questionnaire (YSQ), are proposed to underlie a variety of mental health problems, in&#xD;
      particular Personality Disorders. Jeffrey Young has developed this concept in the 90's,&#xD;
      through the so called &quot;Schema Therapy&quot;. EMS are proposed as the core and main target for&#xD;
      treatment of personality disorders and long-standing characterological problems. The current&#xD;
      definition of an EMS is &quot;a broad, pervasive theme or pattern, comprised of memories,&#xD;
      emotions, cognitions, and bodily sensations, regarding oneself and one's relationships with&#xD;
      others, developed during childhood or adolescence, elaborated throughout one's lifetime and&#xD;
      dysfunctional to a significant degree&quot;. It has been studied in various conditions such as&#xD;
      obesity, personality disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, or obsessive-compulsive&#xD;
      disorder, finding some EMS specificity in patients presenting with these conditions. In our&#xD;
      study, we hypothesize that some of these early maladaptive schemas may participate in the&#xD;
      psychopathology and severity of FND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome of this study is to assess the prevalence of early maladaptive schemas in&#xD;
      patients presenting with Functional Movement Disorders in comparison to patients presenting&#xD;
      with Parkinson's Disease or Organic Dystonia. The secondary outcomes are to further analyse&#xD;
      the underlying relation of these early maladaptive schemas and (i) the severity of the motor&#xD;
      symptoms, (ii) anxiety and/or depression, (iii) the occurrence of childhood trauma events in&#xD;
      our participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reach these objectives, we aim to include 77 patients from which 30 patients with&#xD;
      Functional Movement Disorder, 28 patients with Parkinson's disease, 19 patients with organic&#xD;
      dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible participants who have accepted to participate in the study will fill the YSQ-S3&#xD;
      (Short Form, French Version, validated and reliable instrument in clinical and research&#xD;
      settings).The YSQ-S3 is a self-questionnaire which uses a Likert-type ranking, whereby 1&#xD;
      means &quot;completely untrue of me&quot; and 6 means &quot;describes me perfectly&quot;. Similarly, questions&#xD;
      range from life experiences to present feelings about certain situations. It consists of 90&#xD;
      self-report items, measuring all of the 18 EMS, aiming to describe one's functioning schemas&#xD;
      over the past year.&#xD;
