      Purpose of Study: In order to improve upon the variable results seen in irrigation and&#xD;
      debridement for periprosthetic infection, we ask if the use of intraosseous regional&#xD;
      administration of antibiotics at the time of irrigation and debridement will improve the&#xD;
      modest success of standard irrigation and debridement. We will use the existing literature on&#xD;
      standard irrigation and debridement procedures to compare with the results of the irrigation&#xD;
      and debridement with the use of intraosseous antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      How will this study benefit the patient? Currently when an I&amp;D fails, the patient needs to&#xD;
      undergo two more major procedures: 1) implant removal and 2) reimplantation of the&#xD;
      prosthesis. Any improvement in the results of a standard irrigation and debridement procedure&#xD;
      may decrease the number of patients having to go through further extensive procedures to cure&#xD;
      their infection.&#xD;

      Type of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, single arm, retrospective/prospective clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ The treatment group includes any patient with an acute perioperative infection, an acute&#xD;
      hematogenous, or a chronic infection with unresectable components and treated with&#xD;
      intraoperative intraosseous vancomycin during a one-stage debridement protocol. Additionally,&#xD;
      patients will be treated with at least 4 weeks of IV antibiotics under guidance of an&#xD;
      infectious disease specialist, and indefinite antibiotic chronic suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical and Antibiotic Administration Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, all patients will receive standard weight based cefazolin (1 gram for patients &lt;&#xD;
      80kg, 2 grams for patients between 80-120kg, and 3 grams for patients over 120kg)&#xD;
      preoperatively. Our protocol for MRSA positive patients is to use cefazolin and vancomycin&#xD;
      preoperatively. Because irrigation and debridement in patients with gram positive infections&#xD;
      are frequently done urgently before exact organism identification and sensitivities are&#xD;
      available it is important to cover the patient broadly with cefazolin and vancomycin&#xD;
      initially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment group will receive post debridement intraosseous vancomycin as described below.&#xD;
      In total knee infections a pneumatic tourniquet must be used for the procedure. After&#xD;
      entering the knee joint the following process is followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fluid is collected in four syringes and placed into two sets of aerobic and anaerobic&#xD;
           adult blood culture bottles,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Two synovial tissue cultures from different areas of the joint are obtained and sent for&#xD;
           culture,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If not enough fluid is obtained send an additional tissue culture,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Remaining tissue is sent for final pathologic analysis at the end of the case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining cultures radical synovial debridement is performed debriding the inner&#xD;
      surface of the entire knee capsule including the posterior capsule of the knee. Modular parts&#xD;
      will be removed, that is the polyethylene insert for knees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Debridement and Irrigation Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a complete synovectomy is performed along with extraction of modular parts any exposed&#xD;
      metallic parts will be scrubbed with a sterile brush soaked in dilute betadine. A 5-step&#xD;
      irrigation protocol will then be used for all surgeries:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pulse lavage with 3 liters of normal saline (NS),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lavage with 100 cc's of 3% H202 and 100 cc's of sterile water, a 50/50 solution left in&#xD;
           wound for 2 minutes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lavage 3 liters NS,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lavage with 1 liter of dilute, sterile Betadine (22.5 ml Betadine/liter NS) - left in&#xD;
           wound for 3 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pulse lavage with 3 liters of NS&#xD;
&#xD;
      After debridement and irrigation the interventional group will receive intraosseous&#xD;
      vancomycin 500mg in 150ml of normal saline. This dose was selected based on the studies of&#xD;
      Young (10) and Clarke (11) who used this dose in two high risk groups (revision TKA and high&#xD;
      BMI patients) with no significant side effects or red man syndromes. This solution will be&#xD;
      prepared by the hospital pharmacy and administered via an EZ-IO intraosseous cannula. In&#xD;
      total knees the cannula will be placed in the proximal medial tibia using a starter drill&#xD;
      slightly smaller than the diameter of the cannula to ensure a press fit just distal to the&#xD;
      tibia implant in the vicinity of the pes anserine tendons. 75ccs of the vancomycin solution&#xD;
      will be injected as a bolus. Subsequent to this the remaining 75ccs will be placed in the&#xD;
      distal femur just proximal to the femoral component evenly split between the medial and&#xD;
      lateral femoral condyles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After irrigation and debridement the wound will be closed over a betadine soaked lap sponge&#xD;
      placed between the components. Contaminated drapes and instruments will be removed and the&#xD;
      patient will be re-prepped with new drapes. New instruments will be used to insert the new&#xD;
      modular parts. After opening the wound and prior to inserting new modular parts the wound&#xD;
      will be irrigated this time with the following regime:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pulse lavage with 3 liters of normal saline (NS),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lavage with 100 cc's of 3% H202 and 100 cc's of sterile water, a 50/50 solution left in&#xD;
           wound for 2 minutes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lavage 1 liters NS,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lavage with 1 liter of dilute, sterile Betadine (22.5 ml Betadine/liter NS) - left in&#xD;
           wound for 3 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pulse lavage with 3 liters of NS&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the modular parts are reinserted the wound is closed with monofilament sutures over&#xD;
      drains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative treatment will be managed by an infectious disease specialist with at least&#xD;
      four weeks of intravenous antibiotics followed by indefinite chronic suppression as&#xD;
      recommended by the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (Table 1). Baseline creatinine will be&#xD;
      obtained preoperatively and on postop days 1 and 2. Infectious disease consultants will&#xD;
      monitor peak and trough levels based on the specific antibiotic administered and they will&#xD;
      adjust dosage as indicated.&#xD;
