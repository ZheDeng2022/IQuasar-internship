      The goal of this study is to identify the comparative efficacy of high-intensity walking&#xD;
      training in individuals with chronic, motor incomplete spinal cord injury as compared to&#xD;
      lower-intensity walking exercise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background/Readiness: The objective of this proposal is to maximize locomotor outcomes of&#xD;
      patients following incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) through identification of&#xD;
      rehabilitation strategies that maximize recovery. Specific training parameters, such as&#xD;
      provision of large amounts of stepping, appears to facilitate locomotor function in patients&#xD;
      with iSCI, although other factors may be critical. In this proposed phase II randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial, the overarching hypothesis is that the &quot;intensity&quot; of locomotor practice,&#xD;
      defined as power output and estimated using cardiopulmonary measures, is critical to&#xD;
      maximizing walking outcomes. Performance of high intensity locomotor training increases the&#xD;
      cardiovascular and neuromuscular demands, which results in physiological changes that&#xD;
      facilitate greater locomotor performance in individuals with and without neurological injury.&#xD;
      There are, however, limited data supporting its utility in patients with iSCI. Recent&#xD;
      findings suggest a role for high-intensity stepping training in variable contexts, with gains&#xD;
      in peak locomotor capacity as compared low-intensity variable training. Additional changes in&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary function and neuromuscular coordination provide a mechanistic rationale for&#xD;
      the utility of this strategy. Such changes are likely due to increased central (volitional)&#xD;
      activation, and are in sharp contrast to the long-standing notion that high intensity&#xD;
      training impairs motor function in neurological injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these data, genotypic variations suggest specific caveats related to high intensity&#xD;
      training. For example, many patients possess a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation&#xD;
      in the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene that may impact the activity-dependent&#xD;
      BDNF expression thought to contribute to neuroplasticity underlying improved performance.&#xD;
      This single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can influential declarative memory, with recent&#xD;
      data suggesting a potential impact on motor recovery after neurologic injury. Previous&#xD;
      studies indicate limited BDNF increases in patients with this SNP during high intensity&#xD;
      exercise, although the effects of locomotor recovery with repeated high-intensity training is&#xD;
      unclear Hypothesis/Specific Aims: The primary hypotheses are that high intensity variable&#xD;
      stepping can markedly improve locomotor performance as well as neuromuscular and&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary function as compared to lower-intensity training in patients with chronic&#xD;
      motor iSCI. It is believed that genotypic variations in the ability to synthesis activity&#xD;
      dependent BDNF may modify the effects of high intensity training. Specific Aim 1: Test if&#xD;
      high intensity stepping training in variable contexts results in greater locomotor gains as&#xD;
      compared to lower intensity interventions. Specific Aim 2: Test the effects of these training&#xD;
      strategies on neuromuscular and cardiopulmonary impairments. Specific Aim 3: Test the effects&#xD;
      of the presence of the BDNF SNP on locomotor improvements in patients following&#xD;
      high-intensity activities Study Design: This phase II, stratified, assessor- blinded&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial will assess the effects 2 months (up to 30 sessions) of high- vs&#xD;
      low-intensity variable stepping training on ambulatory patients with chronic (&gt; 1year) motor&#xD;
      iSCI. Participants referred from outpatient therapy settings will undergo evaluation of&#xD;
      locomotor performance, cardiopulmonary capacity, and neuromuscular coordination and&#xD;
      impairments prior to and following each training paradigm, with 2-month follow-up&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Impact: The application of high-intensity locomotor training in the clinical&#xD;
      rehabilitation of patients with iSCI is extremely limited, despite data regarding the&#xD;
      potential benefits in neurological intact individuals and patients with stroke. The clinical&#xD;
      application of high-intensity training represents a simple, readily modified training&#xD;
      parameter that can be readily implemented, and is in stark contrast to current clinical&#xD;
      practice and challenge traditional dogma in rehabilitation medicine.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with motor incomplete SCI (AIS C or D) &gt; 12 mo. duration will be recruited&#xD;
             to participate in the study, with further criteria including anatomical lesions&#xD;
             between C1-T10..&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be between 18 and 75 years of age (note: while participants &gt; 50 yrs&#xD;
             with subacute SCI have a reduced probability of functional ambulation 79, participants&#xD;
             will already be ambulatory with only minimal or no assistance and in the chronic phase&#xD;
             of rehabilitation, and prediction rules using age will not necessarily apply in this&#xD;
             study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants must be able to perform walking training with passive range of motion&#xD;
             within the limits of normal locomotor function, including: 0-30 degrees ankle&#xD;
             plantarflexion, knee flexion from 0 to 90 degrees, hip flexion to 0-90 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with body mass &gt; 400 lbs will be excluded, which is the highest limit for&#xD;
             use of our motorized treadmill and safety harness systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be medically stable with medical clearance to participate, with&#xD;
             absence of concurrent severe medical illness including: unhealed decubiti, existing&#xD;
             infection, significant cardiovascular or metabolic disease which limits exercise&#xD;
             participation, significant osteoporosis (as indicated by history of fractures&#xD;
             following injury), active heterotrophic ossification in the lower extremities, known&#xD;
             history of peripheral nerve injury in lower legs, history of traumatic brain injury,&#xD;
             and history of pulmonary complications that limits exercise capacity, including&#xD;
             significant obstructive and/or restrictive lung diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are ventilator-dependent will be excluded secondary to severely&#xD;
             impaired respiratory capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with substantial orthopedic bracing to stabilize the cervical or thoracic&#xD;
             vertebral column are not eligible due to safety concerns with harness supported&#xD;
             ambulation training..&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will also be excluded if they are unable to tolerate 10 minutes of standing&#xD;
             without orthostasis (decrease in blood pressure by 20 mmHg systolic and 10 mmHg&#xD;
             diastolic); previous experience in the sub-acute population suggests that 10 minutes&#xD;
             of standing is more than sufficient for tolerating 45 minutes of walking secondary to&#xD;
             increased activity/muscle pump minimizing risk for orthostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are undergoing concurrent physical therapy will be excluded from the&#xD;
             study population to eliminate confounding effects of additional physical&#xD;
             interventions, Other therapies, such as occupational or speech therapies, will be&#xD;
             allowed as prescribed by their physician. Individuals will be allowed and encouraged&#xD;
             to continue their normal exercise routines during the course of the intervention, with&#xD;
             activity monitors measuring stepping activity in all participants&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential will not be excluded, although women who are pregnant&#xD;
             or who are considering becoming pregnant will be excluded due to the trunk and pelvis&#xD;
             restraints required for use during locomotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects prescribed oral anti-spastic medications will not be excluded, although&#xD;
             patients with intrathecal baclofen pumps or history of recent (&lt; 3 months) botulinum&#xD;
             toxin injection in the lower extremities will be excluded due to potential increases&#xD;
             in weakness interfering with the effects of stepping training performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known history of autonomic dysreflexia will not be excluded, although&#xD;
             specific signs and symptoms of all patients with history of injury &gt; T6 anatomical&#xD;
             level will be closely monitored throughout training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women will be recruited for participation in the proposed clinical trial at&#xD;
             rates consistent with national and local average of gender disparities of SCI (80%&#xD;
             male, 20% women). Women of childbearing potential will not be excluded, although women&#xD;
             who are pregnant or who are considering becoming pregnant will be excluded due to the&#xD;
             trunk and pelvis restraints required for use during locomotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals of different ethnicities will be recruited at rates similar to the&#xD;
             national and local ethnicity rates. Current data since 2005 indicate that of the&#xD;
             entire population of SCI, 66.1% are Caucasian, 27.1% are African American, 6.6% are of&#xD;
             Hispanic origin, and 2.0% Asian. These populations closely resemble those at RHI and&#xD;
             in our previous studies in human SCI.&#xD;
