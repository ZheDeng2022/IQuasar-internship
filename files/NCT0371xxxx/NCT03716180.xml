    <textblock>
      This research study is studying whether participants and their doctors are willing to&#xD;
      determine post-surgery treatment on the basis of response to pre-surgery treatment, and&#xD;
      studying blood and tissue collected from participants treated with a combination of drugs as&#xD;
      a treatment for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paclitaxel (also called Taxol)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trastuzumab (also called Herceptin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pertuzumab (also called Perjeta)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which means investigators are looking at the&#xD;
      feasibility of a new approach for deciding the optimal medical treatment for this type of&#xD;
      breast cancer. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved paclitaxel,&#xD;
      trastuzumab, and pertuzumab as part of a pre-operative treatment option for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether participants and their doctors are willing&#xD;
      to accept a treatment recommendation for post-operative chemotherapy, on the basis of the&#xD;
      participant's response to pre-operative treatment with paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and&#xD;
      pertuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators are evaluating how the body's immune system works with&#xD;
      paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab to kill cancer cells. For this reason, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect samples of the participant's breast tumor and samples of the&#xD;
      participant's blood over time to understand the reaction of the immune system to the&#xD;
      participant's tumor.&#xD;
