  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are highly prevalent among adolescents. Despite&#xD;
      established principles for STI control, clinical practices related to screening and&#xD;
      diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of STIs among adolescents are suboptimal. There is an&#xD;
      urgent need to expand our screening programs to nontraditional healthcare settings such as&#xD;
      emergency departments (ED) to reach those adolescents who would otherwise not receive&#xD;
      preventive healthcare, and to determine the most efficient and cost-effective method for&#xD;
      providing this screening. The goal of this study is to leverage our recent insights obtained&#xD;
      from single center ED-based adolescent gonorrhea and chlamydia screening research and apply&#xD;
      them across a national pediatric ED research network to determine the most clinically&#xD;
      effective and cost-effective screening approach for adolescents when implemented into a&#xD;
      real-world clinical setting through a pragmatic trial. This will be accomplished through a&#xD;
      network of children's hospital EDs with a track record of robust research collaboration&#xD;
      (Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network or PECARN). This intervention will rely on&#xD;
      an innovative approach that electronically integrates patient-reported data to guide clinical&#xD;
      decision support. The investigators will apply human factors modeling methods to perform ED&#xD;
      workflow evaluations at each participating pediatric ED to determine the most efficient way&#xD;
      to integrate the screening process into everyday clinical care. Following these analyses, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a comparative effectiveness pragmatic trial of targeted STI&#xD;
      screening (screening only those disclosing high risk sexual behavior) versus&#xD;
      universally-offered STI screening (offered to all, regardless of risk) through electronic&#xD;
      integration of patient reported data for provision of clinical decision support. The&#xD;
      investigators will then develop decision analytic models to evaluate the cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of targeted screening compared to universally offered screening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents are disproportionately affected by sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The&#xD;
      STI epidemic among youth is a national public health priority as noted in the Healthy People&#xD;
      2020 objectives, which specifically recommend enhanced STI diagnosis, treatment, and&#xD;
      reduction in adolescents. Failure to diagnose and treat STIs in a timely manner results in&#xD;
      serious reproductive morbidity, mortality, and increased transmission of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents frequently access the emergency department (ED) for care, with the ED functioning&#xD;
      as the primary source of health care for over 1.5 million adolescents. EDs are potentially&#xD;
      high-yield sites for the delivery of sexual health services as part of a larger public health&#xD;
      prevention strategy. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend&#xD;
      universal HIV screening in EDs, no recommendations currently exist for gonorrhea and&#xD;
      chlamydia (GC/CT) screening. Addressing the effectiveness and integration of ED-based STI&#xD;
      screening is critically needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insufficient knowledge of the ideal structure for delivery (i.e. universally-offered or&#xD;
      targeted to high risk groups) is a barrier to the implementation of ED-based GC/CT screening.&#xD;
      While universally-offered screening (offered to all, regardless of risk) may detect a larger&#xD;
      number of cases than targeted screening (screening only those disclosing high risk sexual&#xD;
      behavior), it is more resource-intensive and may result in more false positive cases due to a&#xD;
      lower pretest probability of infection. The investigators each study targeted (Goyal) and&#xD;
      universally-offered (Reed) ED-based GC/CT screening via electronically entered&#xD;
      patient-reported data providing real-time clinical decision support (CDS). They have shown&#xD;
      that both strategies are acceptable, feasible, and result in increased STI screening rates at&#xD;
      their respective pediatric EDs; but it is unknown which method is most efficient and cost&#xD;
      effective when instituted across a national sample of pediatric EDs with varying community&#xD;
      STI prevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific premise of this application is to leverage recent insights obtained from&#xD;
      single center ED-based adolescent GC/CT screening research and apply them across a national&#xD;
      pediatric ED research network to determine the most clinically effective and cost-effective&#xD;
      screening approach for adolescents when implemented in a real-world clinical setting through&#xD;
      a pragmatic trial. To be successful and sustainable, the ideal screening strategy must be&#xD;
      easily incorporated into the clinical workflow. Electronic integration of patient-reported&#xD;
      data with CDS offers one such solution with additional benefits: overcomes privacy concerns,&#xD;
      circumvents provider biases about STI risk, and enables early detection of infection before&#xD;
      development of adverse sequelae. The objective of this study is to compare targeted and&#xD;
      universally-offered STI screening approaches by seamlessly integrating real-time CDS based on&#xD;
      electronically-obtained patient-reported data into the normal ED workflow through human&#xD;
      factors analysis followed by cost-effectiveness analyses. The investigators will execute a&#xD;
      multicenter comparative effectiveness pragmatic trial within a national sample of pediatric&#xD;
      EDs through the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To compare the effectiveness of usual care, targeted screening and&#xD;
      universally-offered screening in EDs through a pragmatic trial that applies a human factors&#xD;
      systems approach to implement GC/CT screening into routine clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the most cost-effective approach for GC/CT detection (i.e. usual&#xD;
      care, targeted screening, and universally-offered screening) in an adolescent ED population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Workflow Evaluations: The investigators will first perform ED workflow evaluations to&#xD;
           determine how to best integrate new processes into current workflow by applying a human&#xD;
           factors workflow process mapping approach at each participating pediatric ED. Data from&#xD;
           these methods will enable the development of site-specific adaptations for the&#xD;
           implementation of electronically-enhanced STI screening processes that use patient&#xD;
           reported outcomes (PROs) to generate CDS. This process is necessary to optimize the&#xD;
           experimental environment by ensuring usability, which will be essential for adoption of&#xD;
           this comparative effectiveness trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pragmatic Trial: The investigators will then conduct a comparative effectiveness&#xD;
           pragmatic trial using a stepped wedge crossover design. The design also allows the&#xD;
           investigators to control for the effects of secular trends (e.g. changes that are&#xD;
           outside the interventions of the study). This was designed as a pragmatic trial to&#xD;
           evaluate the performance of these screening strategies in routine clinical care, rather&#xD;
           than under strict experimental conditions. Sites will be randomized to one of six&#xD;
           positions. After collecting baseline data, each site will subsequently be randomized to&#xD;
           either start with implementation of a targeted screening intervention (T) or a&#xD;
           universally offered screening intervention (U). Each site will then cross-over and&#xD;
           implement the opposite strategy. The final intervention will continue until the&#xD;
           conclusion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cost-effectiveness analysis: Even if clinical strategies, such as universally offered&#xD;
           screening for STIs, are proven to be effective, the costs of those strategies compared&#xD;
           with usual care or more targeted approaches may make them impractical and unsustainable&#xD;
           in a cost-constrained healthcare system. The result of a cost-effectiveness analysis is&#xD;
           the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which describes the additional cost of&#xD;
           the more expensive but more effective strategy being examined, in this case universally&#xD;
           offered STI screening, compared with the lesser cost of the less effective strategy (we&#xD;
           have hypothesized this will be targeted screening) divided by the measure of&#xD;
           effectiveness being considered. For this project, the investigators plan to look at&#xD;
           additional cost per STI detected, as well as cost per QALY gained. The investigators&#xD;
           will develop decision analytic models (using Markov state transition structure) to&#xD;
           evaluate the cost-effectiveness of universally offered screening compared with targeted&#xD;
           screening. To be complete, &quot;usual care&quot; will be included as a third strategy. A simple&#xD;
           model will only examine effectiveness in terms of STIs detected. A more complicated&#xD;
           model will include short- and long-term consequences of treated and untreated disease.&#xD;
           Short-term outcomes will include the likelihood of follow-up and treatment once a&#xD;
           diagnosis has been made, along with the efficacy of antibiotic therapy. Based on test&#xD;
           characteristics from the literature, small numbers of patients may have false positive&#xD;
           or false negative test results. The investigators will model the consequences of both,&#xD;
           in terms of additional costs and consequences of unnecessary treatment for false&#xD;
           positives, and the costs and consequences of undetected/untreated STI in the case of&#xD;
           false negatives. Outcomes also will be modeled for unscreened patients who later return&#xD;
           for treatment of symptomatic disease (e.g., acute pelvic inflammatory disease).&#xD;
           Long-term outcomes addressing the sequelae of untreated/ undetected STIs (tubal&#xD;
           infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain) and outcomes following&#xD;
           successful detection and treatment will be modeled. Data generated from Aim 2 regarding&#xD;
           the effectiveness of the two screening strategies in detecting GC/CT, the proportion of&#xD;
           identified patients who ultimately receive treatment, and the prevalence ranges of GC&#xD;
           and CT in cohorts presenting for ED care at the 6 sites in this study, will be used to&#xD;
           inform probabilities in the model. Literature-based estimates will inform other&#xD;
           probabilistic events and costs of long-term STI sequelae in the model. Incremental&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated to determine cost-effectiveness. The&#xD;
           analysis will use a health care sector perspective that includes medical costs borne by&#xD;
           third-party payers and paid out-of-pocket by patients. These will include current and&#xD;
           future costs related to both the intervention and downstream events related to treated&#xD;
           or missed STIs. The investigators will perform a series of deterministic sensitivity&#xD;
           analyses to explore the impact of parameter uncertainty on results, and known population&#xD;
           variations. A key parameter of interest is the background rate of STI. This likely&#xD;
           varies from location-to-location, and will be a key determinant to the&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness of the universally offered screening strategy. The threshold of&#xD;
           background STI prevalence above which universally offered screening becomes &quot;very&#xD;
           cost-effective&quot; (i.e., an ICER &lt; $50,000/QALY) will be calculated. As a result, the&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness of the universally offered screening strategy may vary from location&#xD;
           to location in the study, and in real-world use of the screening tool. Understanding&#xD;
           this threshold may help shape policy for optimal screening strategies in different&#xD;
           locations and settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Human Factors Workflow Analyses: Human factors workflow evaluations will occur at each&#xD;
           of the 6 participating sites. These observations will be conducted to understand&#xD;
           site-specific ED flow differences that may occur with respect to the care of&#xD;
           adolescents. Observational data will be collected regarding ED workflow and information&#xD;
           exchange using the tool TaskTracker to record clinical workflow and identify common&#xD;
           workflow paths. These observations will be conducted during different times of the day&#xD;
           to account for variation in ED volume and staffing fluctuations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pragmatic Trial: Once the ideal workflow strategy is identified at each individual site,&#xD;
           all participants in both the targeted and universally offered screening phases will use&#xD;
           a handheld tablet device to provide electronic informed consent for participation. All&#xD;
           participants will complete the previously developed and validated ACASI SHS containing&#xD;
           questions regarding their personal sexual health history. The PROs tool will&#xD;
           risk-stratify patients for STIs based on their reported sexual experience and/or&#xD;
           presence of STI-related symptoms. Using the tablet device, patients will also provide&#xD;
           consent for clinician-ordered STI testing (urine-based GC/CT). This will provide&#xD;
           clinicians real-time EHR-integrated decision support for GC/CT testing. Since this is a&#xD;
           pragmatic trial, the exact process of distributing tablets may differ by site and will&#xD;
           be further clarified during the workflow analyses. The electronic informed consent&#xD;
           document will contain information about the study. Reasons for not offering the tablet&#xD;
           will be recorded by the ED staff. Furthermore, if adolescents decline study&#xD;
           participation, a reason for refusal will also be recorded on the tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Targeted screening: During the targeted screening intervention, data from the SHS&#xD;
                will be integrated into the EHR and will provide CDS for GC/CT testing based on&#xD;
                SHS-calculated STI risk. Patients will be classified as at high risk for STIs if&#xD;
                they disclose being sexually active and have either the presence of STI-related&#xD;
                symptoms or any of the following high risk behaviors: more than 1 sexual partner in&#xD;
                the last 3 months, no condom use during last sex, prior history of STI. Patients&#xD;
                will be classified as at risk if they disclose being sexually active but do not&#xD;
                disclose having any STI-related symptoms or any high-risk sexual behaviors.&#xD;
                Patients will be classified as at low risk if they deny any history of sexual&#xD;
                activity. When patients classify as at high risk, clinicians will receive CDS that&#xD;
                STI testing is &quot;highly recommended&quot;; when they care for patients who classify as at&#xD;
                risk, they will receive CDS that STI testing is &quot;recommended&quot;; when caring for&#xD;
                patients who classify as at low risk, they will receive CDS that STI testing &quot;is&#xD;
                not necessary at this time.&quot; If the clinician chooses to follow the recommendation&#xD;
                for screening based on patient's risk assessment, and the patient consents to&#xD;
                testing on the tablet device, urine GC/CT testing will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Universally offered screening: During the universally offered screening&#xD;
                intervention, STI screening will be offered to all eligible adolescents, regardless&#xD;
                of risk. All eligible patients will also complete the SHS, will be informed of the&#xD;
                CDC GC/CT testing recommendations and then be given the option to decline STI&#xD;
                testing using the tablet device. During this phase, the SHS results will not be&#xD;
                available to the clinician. STI testing recommendations will be based only on the&#xD;
                patient's decision to undergo GC/CT testing. Like the process followed in the&#xD;
                targeted screening phase, if the clinician follows the CDS that informs the&#xD;
                clinician that the patient agreed to GC/CT screening and consequently orders&#xD;
                testing, urine GC/CT testing will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Both approaches: If the patient is at risk for STIs and declines GC/CT testing, or&#xD;
                the patient simply declines GC/CT testing on the tablet but the clinician believes&#xD;
                the patient should be tested, the clinician will have the opportunity to engage in&#xD;
                a shared decision-making process with the patient as per routine clinical care.&#xD;
                Alternatively, if the clinician declines the CDS GC/CT testing recommendations,&#xD;
                he/she will be asked to electronically document the reason the CDS is not being&#xD;
                followed. All patients who test positive for an STI will be notified of their&#xD;
                results and provided treatment based on each site's standard clinical processes for&#xD;
                result notification and treatment.&#xD;
