    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the correct dose and safety of adding a new cancer&#xD;
      drug, Venetoclax, to a standard combination of chemotherapy drugs used prior to Autologous&#xD;
      stem cell transplant (ASCT) in participants with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). In this study,&#xD;
      Venetoclax will be added to BEAM (BCNU or carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine or ara-c, and&#xD;
      melphalan). All NHL participants are admitted for conditioning chemotherapy which is given&#xD;
      prior to the infusion of stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax is a new anti-cancer drug that works by targeting a protein (known as the Bcl-2&#xD;
      protein). By inhibiting or &quot;blocking&quot; this protein, a downstream cascade occurs which results&#xD;
      in cancer cells to die. Adding Venetoclax to the standard BEAM conditioning chemotherapy with&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplant is believed to increase the chance of remission. Venetoclax&#xD;
      is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for participants with chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia (CLL). However, Venetoclax is investigational for this study because it is not yet&#xD;
      approved for use in participants with NHL or in combination with BEAM chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to establish the safety of V-BEAM conditioning regimen&#xD;
      prior to autologous stem cell transplant in order to identify the recommended phase II dose&#xD;
      (RPD2). This study will also seek to compare time to neutrophil engraftment and time to&#xD;
      platelet engraftment of participants who receive V-BEAM and ASCT, compared to historical&#xD;
      controls and among cohorts. And finally, it will determine the Progression Free Survival&#xD;
      (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) of V+BEAM followed by ASCT relative to historical controls of&#xD;
      BEAM alone followed by ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single-institution, open label, phase I study designed to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      of this combination. The target population will be participants with NHL who are eligible for&#xD;
      ASCT. Dose escalation will proceed using a standard 3 + 3 design with 5 dose levels, a&#xD;
      minimum of 6 participants and a maximum of 30 participants will be required to identify the&#xD;
      RP2D. If a participant does not take all scheduled doses of Venetoclax according to his/her&#xD;
      cohort, the participant will be replaced because he/she has not taken enough drug to confirm&#xD;
      safety at that dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the conditioning regimen has been delivered and autologous stem cells have been infused&#xD;
      there is no further disease-directed treatment as part of this protocol. In accordance with&#xD;
      routine practice the bone marrow transplant program at the Cleveland Clinic, participants&#xD;
      receive supportive care and follow-up until disease relapse or death. In the absence of&#xD;
      treatment delays during the conditioning regimen due to adverse events, participants will&#xD;
      remain on study for 24 months or until one of the following criteria applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigator considers it, for safety reasons, to be in the best interest of the&#xD;
           participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General or specific changes in the participant's condition rendering the participant&#xD;
           unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants decision to withdraw from treatment (partial consent) or from the study&#xD;
           (full consent)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy during the course of the study for a child-bearing participant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sponsor reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for toxicity for 24 months after hospital discharge or until a&#xD;
      protocol approved outcome. The first 3 months will be at the treating center and continued&#xD;
      recommended follow-up should be at a minimum of 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months&#xD;
      after hospital discharge or as clinically appropriate according to local practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until&#xD;
      it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will necessitate&#xD;
      follow-up to determine the final outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs after the&#xD;
      study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study&#xD;
      participation will be recorded and reported immediately.&#xD;

             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria: The presence of any of the following will exclude a patient from study&#xD;
        enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more&#xD;
             than 2 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment toxicities have not resolved to ≤ Grade 2 according to NCI CTCAE&#xD;
             Version 5.0 (except clinically unrelated toxicities such as alopecia or peripheral&#xD;
             neuropathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to Venetoclax or other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding will be excluded from this study because&#xD;
             carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan are chemotherapeutic agents with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown, but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with these agents. These potential risks may&#xD;
             also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with Venetoclax. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow&#xD;
             suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving&#xD;
             combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated. HIV testing prior to enrollment is&#xD;
             not required for screening but strongly encouraged for patients with no documented&#xD;
             prior HIV assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malabsorption syndrome or other condition that precludes enteral route of Venetoclax&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with metastatic solid tumor malignancies. Patients who have early stage solid&#xD;
             tumors and have completed curative treatment are eligible at the discretion of the&#xD;
             primary investigator. Patients with unresected but localized stage prostate cancer or&#xD;
             other carcinomas in situ that are undergoing observation are also allowed. Patients&#xD;
             with transformed lymphoma and/or underlying indolent lymphoproliferative disorder are&#xD;
             allowed at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical condition requiring chronic use of high dose systemic corticosteroids (i.e.,&#xD;
             doses of prednisone higher than 10 mg/day or equivalent). Brief (&lt;15 days) treatment&#xD;
             with glucocorticoids (prednisone 100 mg by mouth daily, or equivalent) is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with chronic use of moderate or strong CYP3A4 modulators (inhibitor or&#xD;
             inducer) or use of a P-gp inhibitor, or a P-gp substrate with a narrow therapeutic&#xD;
             index are prohibited. A washout period of 7 days is required prior to Venetoclax&#xD;
             dosing if a prohibited medication is discontinued. Lists including medications or&#xD;
             substances known or with the potential to interact with the specific CYP3A4 isoenzymes&#xD;
             and P-gp are provided in Appendix II.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant medications that fall into the categories below could potentially lead to&#xD;
             adverse reactions and should be considered cautionary (except where noted).&#xD;
             Medications and cautionary medications that fall into the categories within this&#xD;
             section can be found at http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main-table. If a&#xD;
             potential study patient is taking any of the medications in the categories described&#xD;
             below, the investigator will assess and document the use of medications known or&#xD;
             suspected to fall in the following medication categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Moderate/Weak CYP3A inducers such as efavirenz and oxcarbazepine.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CYP2C8 substrates such as thiazolidinediones (glitazones) and select statins&#xD;
                  (because of expected inhibition of the metabolism of CYP2C8 substrates by&#xD;
                  Venetoclax).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CYP2C9 substrates such as tolbutamide (because of expected inhibition of the&#xD;
                  metabolism of CYP2C9 substrates by Venetoclax). It is recommended to exclude&#xD;
                  CYP2C9 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index such as phenytoin.&#xD;
