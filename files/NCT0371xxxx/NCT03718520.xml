  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis is the most commonly used drug by women during pregnancy with an estimated&#xD;
      prevalence of use in Colorado of 5.7%. THC and its metabolites freely cross the placenta and&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier to bind with cannabinoid receptors, disrupting the endogenous cannabinoid&#xD;
      signaling system during a critical period of development of cortical circuitry structure and&#xD;
      function. The density of cannabinoid receptors in the developing brain is high, especially in&#xD;
      the limbic areas and prefrontal lobes. Research in animal models suggests synaptic plasticity&#xD;
      in the prefrontal lobes as well the amygdala and hippocampus are impacted by the prenatal&#xD;
      cannabis exposure; regions associated with both cognitive and emotional control, thus&#xD;
      influencing long-term deficiencies in attention and impulsivity. This pilot study will&#xD;
      collect preliminary data on the structural impact of in utero cannabis exposure on&#xD;
      region-specific morphology and structural connectivity of white matter tracts that connect to&#xD;
      the prefrontal lobes and the limbic regions shortly after birth, before confounding by the&#xD;
      postnatal environment becomes a major influence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis is the most commonly used psychoactive substance among pregnant women, with an&#xD;
      estimated prevalence of use between 5 to 20% in in the United States. Little is known about&#xD;
      the neurodevelopmental consequences for the fetus, particularly in the context of&#xD;
      contemporary cannabis use patterns including high potency strains, cannabinoids and novel&#xD;
      routes of administration. Colorado leads the nation in implementation of legalized medical&#xD;
      and retail marijuana. Coupled with a growing pro-marijuana advocacy movement, marijuana may&#xD;
      be perceived as &quot;safe&quot; to use during pregnancy. The local actions of endocannabinoids are in&#xD;
      place in the placenta during fetal brain development and THC and its metabolites freely pass&#xD;
      the placental barrier and the fetal blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, cannabinoid receptors&#xD;
      appear to be more widespread in the fetal and neonatal prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the limbic&#xD;
      areas (the amygdala and hippocampus) than in the adult brain, thus the in utero period may be&#xD;
      a sensitive period of human brain development during which exogenous cannabinoids could&#xD;
      permanently alter neurodevelopmental processes. Human epidemiologic studies across diverse&#xD;
      populations have reported an emerging theme of deficiencies related to impulse control and&#xD;
      executive functioning among offspring with in utero exposure to cannabis starting in&#xD;
      adolescence. Only rudimentary aspects of executive function are present in infants, thus&#xD;
      evidence of an impact during infancy and the toddler years is sparse, inconsistent and&#xD;
      confounded by the postnatal environment (i.e., daycare, caregiver functioning). Research is&#xD;
      needed to evaluate the proximal impact of in utero cannabis exposure on robust metrics of&#xD;
      neonatal brain morphology and structural integrity of white matter tracts that connect to the&#xD;
      PFC and the limbic regions before the influence of postnatal exposures become a major&#xD;
      confounding influence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this challenge, a pilot prospective pre-birth cohort study will be conducted to&#xD;
      investigate the impact of chronic in utero cannabis exposure by enrolling 110 mother-infant&#xD;
      pairs (50 exposed and 60 unexposed controls) for a neonate neuroimaging scan within 2 weeks&#xD;
      after birth. Chronic in utero cannabis exposure will be quantified using ultra-high&#xD;
      performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) of neonatal meconium. The&#xD;
      associations between in utero cannabis exposure and neural morphological outcomes will be&#xD;
      examined by structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The central hypothesis is that&#xD;
      in utero cannabis exposure will be associated with alterations in grey and white matter&#xD;
      development in the prefrontal lobe and its connectivity to limbic regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine the magnitude of the association between in utero exposure to&#xD;
      cannabis and neonate brain morphology and structural connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: In utero exposure to cannabis (assessed by THC metabolites in meconium) will be&#xD;
      associated with the following neonate brain structural outcomes: (1) Grey matter: reduced&#xD;
      volume in the PFC and limbic regions (i.e. the amygdala, hippocampus); (2) White matter:&#xD;
      reduced structural integrity (assessed by fractional anisotropy) of white matter tracts that&#xD;
      connect to the PFC and the limbic regions including the uncinate fasciculus and the cingulum&#xD;
      bundle. The associations will be independent of other maternal substance use (i.e. tobacco),&#xD;
      postnatal feeding practices (i.e. breastfeeding), socio-demographic characteristics and&#xD;
      maternal mental health.&#xD;
