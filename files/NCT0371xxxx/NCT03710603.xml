  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background of the study: The combination of daratumumab with VRd is anticipated to further&#xD;
      improve response rates in patients and may lead to improved long-term outcomes in newly&#xD;
      diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma. Given this potential, and based upon the initial&#xD;
      safety and efficacy observed in the ongoing Phase 2 Study MMY2004, as well as continued&#xD;
      positive results with daratumumab in various disease settings and combination regimens, this&#xD;
      Phase 3 study is designed to demonstrate improved outcomes for patients treated with&#xD;
      daratumumab+VRd. The Phase 3 study will utilize the subcutaneous (SC) formulation of&#xD;
      daratumumab instead of the IV formulation utilized in the Phase 2 study, which may limit&#xD;
      additional toxicity to patients treated with the quadruplet regimen.&#xD;

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire containing both single and multi-item measures. These include five functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, and Social Functioning), three symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, and Nausea/Vomiting), a Global Health Status/ Quality-of-Life (QoL) scale, and six single items (Constipation, Diarrhea, Insomnia, Dyspnea, Appetite Loss, and Financial Difficulties). The scores ranges from 0-100, a high score for functional scales and for Global Health Status/QoL represent better functioning ability or Health-Related Quality-of-Life (HRQoL), whereas a high score for symptom scales and single items represents significant symptomatology.</description>

&#xD;
               2. Seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B surface&#xD;
                  antigen [HBsAg]). Subjects with resolved infection (ie, subjects who are positive&#xD;
                  for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [antiHBc] and/or antibodies to&#xD;
                  hepatitis B surface antigen [antiHBs]) must be screened using real-time PCR&#xD;
                  measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels. Those who are PCR positive&#xD;
                  will be excluded. EXCEPTION: Subjects with serologic findings suggestive of HBV&#xD;
                  vaccination (antiHBs positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history&#xD;
                  of prior HBV vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by polymerase&#xD;
                  chain reaction (PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Seropositive for hepatitis C (HCV) (anti-HCV antibody positive or HCV-RNA&#xD;
                  quantitation positive), except in the setting of a sustained virologic response&#xD;
                  (SVR), defined as viremia at least 12 weeks after completion of antiviral&#xD;
                  therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Concurrent medical or psychiatric condition or disease (such as but not limited to,&#xD;
             systemic amyloidosis, POEMS, active systemic infection, uncontrolled diabetes, acute&#xD;
             diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease) that is likely to interfere with the study&#xD;
             procedures or results, or that in the opinion of the investigator, would constitute a&#xD;
             hazard for participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. myocardial infarction within 6 months before randomization, or an unstable or&#xD;
                  uncontrolled disease/condition related to or affecting cardiac function (eg,&#xD;
                  unstable angina, congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association Class&#xD;
                  III-IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia or clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
                  abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. screening 12-lead ECG showing a baseline QT interval &gt;470 msec&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40% for subjects age 65-70 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Received a strong CYP3A4 inducer within 5 half-lives prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to boron or mannitol, corticosteroids,&#xD;
             monoclonal antibodies or human proteins, or their excipients (refer to the&#xD;
             Investigator's Brochure), or sensitivity to mammalian-derived products or&#xD;
             lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Not able to comply with the study protocol (eg, because of alcoholism, drug&#xD;
             dependency, or psychological disorder). Subject has any condition for which, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the&#xD;
             subject (eg, compromise the well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the&#xD;
             protocol-specified assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Pregnant, or breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant while enrolled in this&#xD;
             study or within 3 months after the last dose of any component of the treatment&#xD;
             regimen. Or, subject is a man who plans to father a child while enrolled in this study&#xD;
             or within 3 months after the last dose of any component of the treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Major surgery within 2 weeks before randomization or will not have fully recovered&#xD;
             from surgery, or has surgery planned during the time the subject is expected to&#xD;
             participate in the study. Kyphoplasty or Vertebroplasty is not considered major&#xD;
             surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Received an investigational drug (including investigational vaccines) or used an&#xD;
             invasive investigational medical device within 4 weeks before randomization or is&#xD;
             currently enrolled in an interventional investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Contraindications to the use of any components of the backbone treatment regimens, per&#xD;
             local prescribing information.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of oral drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Vaccination with live attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of first study agent&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Unable or unwilling to undergo antithrombotic prophylactic treatment.&#xD;
