  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrapleural administration of fibrinolytic therapy, urokinase in parapneumonic effusion and&#xD;
      empyema has been shown to decrease the need for surgical intervention and length of hospital&#xD;
      stay. Pleural adhesions are easily formed in the early stages of empyema and the thickening&#xD;
      of the pleural causes subsequent treatment difficulties. The goal of this study was to&#xD;
      observe and compare the efficacy of treatment in empyema patients with urokinase and chest&#xD;
      drainage or with chest drainage or with chest tube drainage alone so as to provide evidence&#xD;
      for guiding clinical treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Empyema, a collection of pus in the pleural space has been continuously associated with&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality rates of 10-20%. Increase in the incidence of empyema with change in&#xD;
      pattern of disease and the causative organism has demonstrated a challenge in the diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment. In the recent years many studies and clinical trials have been done among&#xD;
      adults and children regarding the optimal empyema treatment and its efficacy and some are&#xD;
      still in the process of further study. Appropriate treatment according to the three stages of&#xD;
      empyema (i.e. exudative stage, fibropurulent stage and organizing stage) has constantly been&#xD;
      under frequent research, finding which treatment is more effective (i.e. antibiotics, chest&#xD;
      tube drainage, intrapleural fibrinolytics, VATS and decortication alone in combination) and&#xD;
      when is the proper time for intervention. Intrapleural instillation of urokinase was&#xD;
      initially described in 1994 on pediatric population and since then lots of studies have been&#xD;
      reported. Therefore, the investigators conducted a randomized controlled study with relevant&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria to assess the success rate of intrapleural urokinase&#xD;
      administration among the patients with Complicated Pleural Effusion (CPE) / empyema comparing&#xD;
      it with drainage alone. All case patients in this study received antibiotic empirically or&#xD;
      with sensitivity when microbiological tests available, chest tube drainage along with&#xD;
      urokinase intrapleural therapy or drainage alone for treatment of CPE/empyema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into two groups: one is chest tube drainage and intrapleural&#xD;
      fibrinolytic agent and another is chest tube drainage alone. The group with intrapleural&#xD;
      fibrinolytic agent will receive urokinase 10ml of 1000 IU/ml in children aged less than or&#xD;
      equal to 1 year or 40ml of 1000 IU/ml in children aged more than 1 year and the other group&#xD;
      with drainage alone. The first instillation of the agent is done at the time of chest tube&#xD;
      insertion of 12Fr or 14Fr tube, after instillation the chest tube is closed for 4 hours. The&#xD;
      chest tube is then unclamped after 4 hours and connected to the suction system with pressure&#xD;
      of -20cm H2O for 8 hours and the process is repeated every 12 hourly. The procedure was done&#xD;
      for 3 consecutive days and was evaluated with daily chest X-ray and followed chest tube&#xD;
      removal when the drainage was less than 40ml/day or according to the clinical and&#xD;
      radiological response of patients with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is being done for 12 months with 80 participants taken from one center, Beijing&#xD;
      children´s Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate difference among intrapleural urokinase as the initial&#xD;
      treatment for children with pleural empyema against chest tube drainage alone. Length of&#xD;
      hospital stay, number of days chest tube drainage, number of days of fever after tube&#xD;
      insertion, complications such bleeding, chest pain will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
