  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to understand how individuals respond to financial incentive programs for&#xD;
      wellness care. In a randomized controlled trial among customers with care gaps, the&#xD;
      investigators will experimentally compare the impacts of incentives for gap closure (gift&#xD;
      cards), information on existing gaps (mailers), and no intervention. The research objectives&#xD;
      are to assess how responsive individuals are to incentives for, and to information about,&#xD;
      existing care gaps; and to assess spillovers from incentives onto other care. In addition,&#xD;
      impacts on downstream utilization will be studied, which may be impacted if financial&#xD;
      incentives are effective at increasing wellness visits.&#xD;

      Setting and sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted among individuals enrolled in an insurance plan offered by an&#xD;
      insurance company in the state of Nebraska.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will include a subset of individuals eligible for a program designed to improve&#xD;
      delivery of care by incentivizing individuals and their dependents to fill &quot;care gaps&quot; - gaps&#xD;
      in recommended care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design will entail two overarching interventions for each incentivized care gap:&#xD;
      Incentives, and Information Only. In addition, there will be a control that receives neither.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incentives. Individuals receiving the Incentives intervention for a given care gap will&#xD;
           receive a mailer informing them of that gap, and that they are eligible for a gift card&#xD;
           if they close that care gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information Only. Individuals receiving the Information Only intervention for a given&#xD;
           care gap will receive a mailer informing them of that gap, but without information on&#xD;
           the incentives available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control. Individuals receiving the Control intervention for a given care gap will not&#xD;
           receive a mailer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals will be made whole following the intervention period, regardless of treatment&#xD;
      status; i.e. members will be compensated for closing incentivized care gaps regardless of&#xD;
      whether they were informed of their eligibility to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific Incentivized Care Gaps include: W34, LSC, IMA, CDC Eye Exam and/or CDC Hba1c&#xD;
      Screening, CCS, and AWC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A separate letter is sent for each care gap, so that individuals may receive more than one&#xD;
      letter. The investigators will randomize which letters are sent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process will be as follows: every individual with a care gap in the sample (a care-gap,&#xD;
      beneficiary pair) will be randomly assigned a study status: financial incentive, information&#xD;
      only, or no letter. When it comes time to send mailers for each care gap, mailers will be&#xD;
      sent according to the intersection of eligibility and care gap-specific treatment assignment.&#xD;
      E.g. if at mailing time a participant is eligible for only cervical cancer screening (CCS),&#xD;
      that participant will receive the CCS intervention (Control, Information Only, or Incentives)&#xD;
      as pre-assigned. If the participant is also eligible for an adolescent well-visit (AWC)&#xD;
      incentive based on her dependent's age and visit status, the participant will also receive&#xD;
      the AWC intervention as pre-assigned; this intervention may be the same or different from her&#xD;
      CCS intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the number and rate of care-gap closure at 6 and 18 months&#xD;
      following the initial mailing. The investigators will also conduct heterogeneity analysis&#xD;
      according to baseline characteristics of the population.&#xD;

    <description>Care gap closure for all care gaps. A care gap is considered closed for an individual or dependent who had not received recommended care (i.e. who had a care gap) at the time of enrollment at the time they receive the recommended care. For example, if a dependent child has not received lead screening (LSC) at the time of enrollment, the LSC care gap is considered closed once the child receives a lead screening.</description>
