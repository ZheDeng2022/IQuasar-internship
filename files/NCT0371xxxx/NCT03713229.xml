  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing awareness of augmenting risk of anal cancer in people living with HIV,&#xD;
      especially among men who have sex with men (MSM). High resolution anoscopy (HRA) represents&#xD;
      the gold standard to detect pre-cancerous anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions&#xD;
      (HSIL), however, the procedure is time-consuming, costly and, most importantly, the learning&#xD;
      curve is very flat. This yields a poor implementation of anal screening and, likely, to an&#xD;
      excess of otherwise preventable anal cancer. Other screening methods include digital&#xD;
      ano-rectal examination, anal-rectal cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping, since&#xD;
      infection with high-risk HPV genotypes has been identified as the main reason for the&#xD;
      development of HSIL. To date, there is no consensus in screening strategies. Furthermore, it&#xD;
      remains unclear whether, in whom and to which extend the currently available topic and&#xD;
      invasive treatment options for HSIL should be applied, given that the natural history of the&#xD;
      development of anal cancer remains poorly understood. The present cohort study aims to&#xD;
      provide real-life data on the screening, management and follow-up of HIV-infected MSM is&#xD;
      warranted for a better understanding of anal cancer in this setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of anal precancerous squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) and cancer of the&#xD;
      anus is mainly caused by infection with high-risk human papillomavirus genotypes (HR-HPV).&#xD;
      There is increasing awareness of marked (40 to 130-fold) risk of anal cancer in people living&#xD;
      with HIV, especially among men who have sex with men (MSM). With the changing scenario of&#xD;
      comorbidities in the HIV-infected population, given the success of modern antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy, anal cancer has emerged as a leading neoplasia across different cohorts in Western&#xD;
      countries. iIn 2014, almost 30000 people were newly diagnosed with HIV in Europe, the&#xD;
      majority of cases (77%) being men. This was largely driven by HIV transmission between MSM,&#xD;
      which accounted for 42% of all HIV diagnoses. Hence, the incidence of anal cancer is likely&#xD;
      to increase in the years to come.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of experts who support the necessity of implementing wide programs of anal cancer&#xD;
      screening in at-risk populations is rapidly growing. Indeed, both the European Guidelines for&#xD;
      treatment of HIV-infected adults and the Guidelines of the Spanish AIDS Society (GESIDA)&#xD;
      currently recommend the screening of anal cancer in HIV-infected subjects at risk. It is&#xD;
      likely that in years to come, a general recommendation to screen for anal cancer in patients&#xD;
      with different conditions associated with immunosuppression is established, as experienced in&#xD;
      other populations. In this context, since HIV-negative MSM and women with a history of&#xD;
      anogenital dysplasia, as well as transplant patients, exhibit excess risk of anal cancer,&#xD;
      these populations have been typically screened in center with ongoing anal cancer screening&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital ano-rectal examination (DARE) is mainly accepted as the first screening procedure for&#xD;
      anal high-risk SIL (HSIL), followed by anal-rectal cytology. Both represent simple methods,&#xD;
      however, cytology shows an alarmingly low negative predictive value and furthermore, in case&#xD;
      of an abnormal cytology, the patient is referred to high resolution anoscopy (HRA) for biopsy&#xD;
      of acetowhite lugol-negative lesions in the anal epithelium, suggestive of HSIL. HRA&#xD;
      performance is similar to cervical colposcopy, but unfortunately, the training process is by&#xD;
      far longer, hampering its implementation and availability to highly-specialized centers with&#xD;
      large cohorts of people living with HIV under care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although histological HSIL was identified as precursor of anal cancer, it remains unclear if,&#xD;
      which and in whom treatment is indicated, since not all patients progress, a considerable&#xD;
      proportion even regresses spontaneously and recurrence rates are high. Treatments currently&#xD;
      available include topical imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil, as well as surgical treatment. Due to&#xD;
      the lack of data, no consensus of HSIL management has been reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together what was mentioned above, real-life data on the screening, management and&#xD;
      follow-up of HIV-infected MSM is warranted for a better understanding of anal cancer in this&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
