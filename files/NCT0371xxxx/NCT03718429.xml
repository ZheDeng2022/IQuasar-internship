    <textblock>
      Recent studies indicate that anti-factor-Xa inhibition with low-dose rivaroxaban may have a&#xD;
      role in the reduction of ischemic recurrences in patients with atherosclerotic disease&#xD;
      manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date there is very little data, and not conducted in human subjects, on the interplay&#xD;
      between anti-Xa blockade with low-dose rivaroxaban and antiplatelet therapies, and in&#xD;
      particular how this affects profiles of platelet reactivity and thrombin generation. Given&#xD;
      the potential role for the use of low-dose rivaroxaban for the prevention of ischemic&#xD;
      recurrences in patients with atherothrombotic disease manifestations, including coronary&#xD;
      artery disease (CAD) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD), the study team proposes a&#xD;
      prospective pharmacodynamic (PD) investigation assessing the impact of low-dose rivaroxaban&#xD;
      when used in combination with antiplatelet treatment regimens commonly used in clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

      Recent studies indicate that anti-factor-Xa inhibition with low-dose rivaroxaban may have a&#xD;
      role in the reduction of ischemic recurrences in patients with atherosclerotic disease&#xD;
      manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, although the introduction of newer antithrombotic strategies has been associated&#xD;
      with a reduction in ischemic recurrences in high-risk patients, these have been consistently&#xD;
      associated with an increase in bleeding complications. These have been observed particularly&#xD;
      with the combination of an oral anticoagulant agent, including low-dose rivaroxaban, with&#xD;
      standard DAPT, also known as &quot;triple therapy&quot;. Observations from laboratory and clinical&#xD;
      studies suggest that in the presence of effective blockade of other pathways triggering&#xD;
      thrombotic complications aspirin may not offer added antithrombotic effects but contribute to&#xD;
      the increased bleeding. These observations have set the basis for a large number of clinical&#xD;
      outcomes studies evaluating whether dropping aspirin in the presence of more potent and&#xD;
      effective blockade of other pathways triggering thrombosis has a better safety profile&#xD;
      without a tradeoff in efficacy. Amongst these strategies, the use of low-dose rivaroxaban in&#xD;
      adjunct to a P2Y12 inhibitor, also known as dual therapy, has been proposed. This approach&#xD;
      may be of potential benefit to reduce atherothrombotic complications in high-risk patients&#xD;
      following an acute coronary event. On the other hand, regimens with more modest&#xD;
      antithrombotic effects compared with a combination of low-dose rivaroxaban and a P2Y12&#xD;
      receptor inhibitor such as low-dose rivaroxaban alone or in combination with aspirin may be&#xD;
      more suitable in more stabilized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date there is very little data, and not conducted in human subjects, on the interplay&#xD;
      between anti-Xa blockade with low-dose rivaroxaban and antiplatelet therapies, and in&#xD;
      particular how this affects profiles of platelet reactivity and thrombin generation. Given&#xD;
      the potential role for the use of low-dose rivaroxaban for the prevention of ischemic&#xD;
      recurrences in patients with atherothrombotic disease manifestations, including coronary&#xD;
      artery disease (CAD) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD), the study team proposes a&#xD;
