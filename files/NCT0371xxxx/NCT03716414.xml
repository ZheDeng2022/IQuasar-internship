      To evaluate the efficacy of sentinel lymph node biopsy technique in patients with high-risk&#xD;
      endometrial carcinoma, which provides the evidence that sentinel lymph node biopsy technique&#xD;
      could substitute the systematic Lymph node dissection(LND).&#xD;

      Comprehensive surgical staging for endometrial carcinoma(EC) is an indisputable staging and&#xD;
      prognostic tool. The staging procedure includes total hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
      salpingo-oophorectomy, and lymphadenectomy, omental biopsy if necessary. Since lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis is one of the most important risk factors of prognosis. The dissection of lymph&#xD;
      nodes has been used for staging, prognostic information, and to determine the need for&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy. The approach to lymph node evaluation in women with EC is still a subject&#xD;
      of debate. Practice varies across different institutions or surgeons. In general, the options&#xD;
      for management of retroperitoneal lymph nodes include no lymph node dissection (LND),&#xD;
      systematic LND only if the risk of lymph node metastasis exceeds a certain threshold, or&#xD;
      routine sentinel LND following lymphatic mapping. lymphadenectomy is significantly associated&#xD;
      with longer operating time, higher surgical costs, greater rate of infection, as well as the&#xD;
      occurrence of lymphocysts and lymphedema, moreover, there is lack of evidence of a&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit of LND, less invasive techniques have emerged as possible alternatives.&#xD;
      The technique for lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) in EC has been&#xD;
      refined and found a low false-negative rate for detection of positive lymph nodes. The 2018&#xD;
      National Comprehensive cancer Network (NCCN) guideline of uterus cancer states SLN mapping&#xD;
      can be considered for the surgical staging of apparent uterine-confined malignancy when there&#xD;
      is no metastasis demonstrated by imaging studies or no obvious extrauterine disease at&#xD;
      exploration. It indicates low-risk patients could avoid those side effects of the systematic&#xD;
      Lymph node dissection. Whether high-risk patients (grade 3, deep myometrial invasion,&#xD;
      non-endometrioid endometrial cancer, and Cervical invasion) can be benefited from this&#xD;
      technique? This prospective cohort study is designed to To evaluate the efficacy of sentinel&#xD;
      lymph node biopsy technique in patients with high-risk endometrial carcinoma. Surgery should&#xD;
      be performed within a maximum of 4 weeks from the patient's first consultation.&#xD;
