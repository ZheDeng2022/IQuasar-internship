  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV antiretroviral therapy has the potential to dramatically decrease HIV transmission&#xD;
      worldwide1; yet, a barrier to ending the AIDS epidemic in low-resource settings is the fact&#xD;
      that healthcare is largely provided by traditional or spiritual healers rather than&#xD;
      biomedical providers, and there are no strategies in place to identify HIV-infected patients&#xD;
      among Traditional Healer patients and link them to HIV care. In order to reach the UNAIDS&#xD;
      90-90-90 benchmarks HIV services must reach marginalized populations in endemic regions, such&#xD;
      as in southwestern Uganda. Uganda is one of seven sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries&#xD;
      accounting for 90% of all new HIV infections in this region6. HIV prevalence is 7.3%, with&#xD;
      ~1.5 million people living with HIV/AIDS and 99,000 new infections in 2014. However, only 50%&#xD;
      of sexually active Ugandans have ever tested for HIV8. In the project location of&#xD;
      southwestern Uganda, like much of SSA, the majority of Ugandans utilize Traditional Healers&#xD;
      (TH), but little is known about Traditional Healer practices or rates of HIV testing (or HIV&#xD;
      infection) among their clients. Specific aims of this study are to: 1) identify key&#xD;
      socio-structural factors that frame HIV testing behaviors among Ugandan adults who utilize&#xD;
      Traditional Healers; 2) investigate acceptability of providing point-of-care HIV testing at&#xD;
      Traditional Healer practice locations; and 3) develop and pilot a prospective HIV testing&#xD;
      intervention among Traditional Healer patients to promote earlier diagnosis. Results will be&#xD;
      used to implement subsequent, large-scale cluster-randomized HIV testing intervention at&#xD;
      Traditional Healer practice locations. Findings from the proposed study include formative&#xD;
      data on populations that utilize Traditional Healers in an HIV-endemic region of Uganda, and&#xD;
      pilot testing of an HIV testing intervention at healer practice locations; these results&#xD;
      could be applied towards expanding HIV testing in other low-resource, endemic settings.&#xD;

      This study has three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Identify key socio-structural factors that frame HIV testing behaviors among&#xD;
      clients of Ugandan TH, using an exploratory sequential, mixed-methods study design. First,&#xD;
      qualitative interviews with 25-35 purposely-sampled TH clients will characterize the&#xD;
      care-seeking trajectory, HIV testing behaviors and related stigma, healthcare costs, and HIV&#xD;
      risks and exposures. Based on these results, a survey will be designed and administered to&#xD;
      300 Ugandan adults who utilize TH in Mbarara District. This cross-sectional study will&#xD;
      identify 1) rates of HIV testing among TH clients and 2) variables that independently predict&#xD;
      HIV testing within the prior 12 months. These data will inform a model of HIV testing&#xD;
      behavior among TH clients based on the Andersen Model of Healthcare Utilization, and generate&#xD;
      hypotheses to be tested in Specific Aim 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Characterize acceptability of receiving point-of-care (POC) HIV testing at TH&#xD;
      locations, using an exploratory sequential, mixed-methods approach. Qualitative interviews&#xD;
      with 15-25 purposely sampled TH and 15-25 purposely-sampled TH clients will explore attitudes&#xD;
      and experiences with biomedicine, feasibility and acceptability of delivering POC HIV testing&#xD;
      at TH locations, and investigate relevant themes emerging from Aim 1. Based on qualitative&#xD;
      results, a survey will be developed and administered to 175 TH in Mbarara District. This&#xD;
      cross-sectional study will characterize TH practices relevant to HIV testing, and identify&#xD;
      characteristics of healers who favorably view the proposed intervention (Specific Aim 3).&#xD;
      These data will be integrated with results from SA1 to develop an intervention that will&#xD;
      overcome socio-structural barriers to HIV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Develop and pilot an HIV testing intervention among TH clients using a&#xD;
      cluster randomized study design. Integration of results from SA1 and SA2 will inform a pilot&#xD;
      HIV testing intervention at 9 TH practice locations, to be compared with a control group&#xD;
      receiving usual TH care at 8 practices. This pilot will offer HIV testing at TH practice&#xD;
      sites to 250 TH clients at the intervention arm sites, and offer protocoled usual care to 250&#xD;
      clients at control arm sites. Primary outcome for this study will be rates of HIV testing&#xD;
      among TH clients. Secondary outcomes will include i) number of new HIV diagnoses among TH&#xD;
      clients, and ii) number of patients with +HIV POC test who successfully link to HIV care in 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <description>Primary study outcome was receipt of an HIV test within 90 days of enrollment. In the control arm, this was assessed via self-report at time of 90-day phone call follow up.

If the HIV test was accepted and delivered, the healer recorded the result of the test.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Our goal was to evaluate the effectiveness of delivering HIV testing via a novel implementation strategy. This was not a large-scale cost-effectiveness trial. Future studies are needed to evaluate program cost. Since we excluded healers with the lowest patient volume, results may not be generalizable to these smaller practices.</limitations_and_caveats>
