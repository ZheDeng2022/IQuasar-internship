  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our long-term goal is to decrease cervical cancer incidence and mortality among women in low-&#xD;
      and middle-income countries (LMICs) by using the most efficacious and acceptable screening&#xD;
      method, particularly among women who do not come to the clinic for their regular Pap testing.&#xD;
      The purpose of this feasibility study is to compare three cervical cancer screening&#xD;
      modalities (self-collection and HPV testing, Pap testing at the public health clinic, and&#xD;
      choice between self-collection and HPV testing and Pap testing) among women who have not&#xD;
      undergone cervical cancer screening within the past four years using a theory-based,&#xD;
      culturally relevant intervention implemented by Community Health Workers (CHWs) via&#xD;
      door-to-door visits. Three Basic Health Units (BHUs) within the public health system will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the three screening modalities/conditions (self-collection and&#xD;
      HPV testing, Pap testing at the local public health clinic, and choice between&#xD;
      self-collection and HPV testing and Pap testing). CHWs will invite women who report not&#xD;
      having been screened for cervical cancer in the past four years to participate in the study,&#xD;
      and deliver a brief educational/behavioral session on cervical cancer and screening using a&#xD;
      door-to-door approach under of one of the three conditions. The primary outcome will be&#xD;
      adherence to cervical cancer screening. We hypothesize that (1) Women in the &quot;choice&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;self-collection&quot; groups will be more likely to engage in cervical cancer screening and&#xD;
      display higher satisfaction with their screening than women assigned to the &quot;Pap&quot; with women&#xD;
      assigned to the &quot;choice&quot; group having the highest adherence of the three groups; and (2)&#xD;
      Within the &quot;choice&quot; group, more women will choose and complete self-collection than Pap test.&#xD;
