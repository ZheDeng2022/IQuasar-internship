  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe treatment patterns associated with first-line and&#xD;
      second line biologic use (vedolizumab or other biologic) and to describe the real-world&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness of the use (first-line and second line) vedolizumab versus other&#xD;
      biologics at least 6 months post-treatment initiation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, non-interventional study of participants with CD or UC. The study&#xD;
      will review the medical charts of participants who have initiated the first or second line&#xD;
      treatment with vedolizumab or another biologic agent (infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab&#xD;
      [UC only]) (index event) during the eligibility period to evaluate the treatment&#xD;
      effectiveness, treatment patterns, health care utilization and safety of vedolizumab, and to&#xD;
      provide the real-world treatment landscape with anti-TNF alpha therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 400 participants, with 200 participants in each treatment&#xD;
      cohort. All participants will be enrolled into two observational groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Vedolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Other Biologics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data for participants will be collected in two main periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-index Event Period: From the data of diagnosis of UC/CD until one day prior to the&#xD;
           date when vedolizumab or other biologic treatment was initiated during the eligibility&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-index Event Period: From the date when vedolizumab or other biologic treatment was&#xD;
           initiated during the eligibility period until the earliest of 6 months (post-index&#xD;
           treatment discontinuation, death of participants, lost-to-follow up, or date of chart&#xD;
           abstraction initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Spain and Portugal. The overall time for data&#xD;
      collection in the study will be approximately 12 months and the overall duration of the study&#xD;
      is approximately 24 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mayo Score at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 6 post-index date</time_frame>
    <description>Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. Complete Mayo score consists of 4 sub-scores: stool pattern, most severe rectal bleeding of the day, endoscopic findings and global assessment by physician, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 12. Partial Mayo score consists of 3 sub-scores: stool pattern, most severe rectal bleeding of the day, and global assessment by physician, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9. Here, higher scores indicates more severe disease.</description>
