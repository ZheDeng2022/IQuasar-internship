  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcome of periodontal reconstructive therapy is to regenerate all tissues of the&#xD;
      periodontium including a functional periodontal ligament, alveolar bone and cementum. A&#xD;
      number of treatment modalities including the use of bone grafts, guided tissue regeneration&#xD;
      (GTR), and the addition of biological agents have been used with large heterogeneity in the&#xD;
      clinical and histological outcomes. The rationale of using a filling material when treating&#xD;
      unfavorable and large intrabony defects (IBDs) with membranes or biological agents consists&#xD;
      of sustaining the overlying soft tissues in the presence of a non-contained defect's&#xD;
      architecture, at the same time enhancing the stability of coagulum; and facilitating the&#xD;
      proliferation of mesenchymal progenitor cells. Among bone grafts available, anorganic bone&#xD;
      bone (ABB) have been widely used in periodontics for the treatment of IBDs In recent years,&#xD;
      the increasing understanding of the role of growth factors (GFs) in the wound healing process&#xD;
      suggested the use of these biological agents in the regenerative treatment of periodontal&#xD;
      bony defects. Noninferiority trials are designed to demonstrate that the effect of a new&#xD;
      treatment is adequately similar to an active control by more than a specified margin The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to verify if the combined use of PRF (Platelet Rich Fibrin) and ABB in the&#xD;
      management of IBDs may be a treatment modality that is clinically &quot;not inferior&quot; compared to&#xD;
      the membrane + ABB one, since the combined periodontal regenerative technique has been&#xD;
      already tested in literature as a &quot;gold standard&quot; periodontal regenerative technique.&#xD;

      Experimental Design This is a prospective, randomized and controlled clinical trial designed&#xD;
      to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes 12 months after two treatment modalities&#xD;
      of IBDs: test sites ( TS) will be treated by a combination of PRF and ABB; control sites (CS)&#xD;
      will receive the combined treatment of collagen membrane + ABB. The patients enrolled will&#xD;
      exhibit unfavorable IBDs and all experimental sites will be accessed with a simplified&#xD;
      papilla preservation flap (SPPF) procedure. The filling material (ABB) will be common to both&#xD;
      treatments: therefore, the investigation focused on the addictive effect of PRF used instead&#xD;
      of COLLAGEN MEMBRANE. Collagen membrane is chosen as the active control (AC) as it is&#xD;
      currently considered as the &quot;gold standard&quot; among the biological agents for the treatment of&#xD;
      IBDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-inferiority trial (NIT) is designed to verify whether to use PRF instead of collagen&#xD;
      membrane in association with ABB can lead to not inferior therapeutic results, reducing the&#xD;
      treatment's cost and allowing the clinicians to use autogenous materials only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population 62 patients (33 males and 29 females) aged 42 to 64 years (mean: 53±12)&#xD;
      seeking treatment at the Unit of Periodontology of the &quot;G. D'Annunzio&quot; University of Chieti-&#xD;
      Pescara, Italy, and affected by moderate-to-severe chronic periodontitis, will be selected&#xD;
      for the study. The inclusion criteria are: 1) no systemic diseases; 2) no medications&#xD;
      affecting periodontal status during the previous 6 months; 3) not pregnant or lactating; 4)&#xD;
      non-smoker; and 5) the following dental and periodontal factors: a full-mouth plaque score&#xD;
      (FMPS)25 and a full-mouth bleeding score (FMBS)26 &lt; 20% at the time of surgery, no&#xD;
      periodontal therapy in the 2 previous years, no inadequate endodontic treatment at the&#xD;
      experimental sites, no dental mobility, ≥ 20 teeth, exhibit vertical bone loss detected by&#xD;
      radiographic examination ( ACL (alveolar crest level) - (BD bottom of the defect) distance =&#xD;
      BDD (Bone defect depth ) ≥ 4 mm and a probing pocket depth (PPD) ≥ 5mm when evaluated 12&#xD;
      weeks after non- surgical therapy [ scaling and root planing ( SRP)]. Only predominantly 1-,&#xD;
      combined 1- and 2-, 2-walls defects or teeth with a defect angle ≥ 36° were considered in&#xD;
      this study (unfavorable IBDs). To be included in this category, the IBDs should not have a&#xD;
      3-wall component &gt;20% of the total defect depth. The architecture of the defect had to be&#xD;
      confirmed by observation during the surgical intervention. Each patient will participate in&#xD;
      the study with a single experimental site. In the case that a patient will have more than one&#xD;
      IBD with clinical features that could be eligible for study, the most severe defect will be&#xD;
      chosen. The participants volunteered for the study after they will receive verbal and written&#xD;
      information and signed a consent form approved by the Ethical Committee of the G. D'Annunzio&#xD;
      University of Chieti - medical faculty. The study protocol is in accordance with the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki of 1975, revised in Tokyo in 2004. The study was performed from&#xD;
      February 2013 to December 2016. Four months before the surgical treatment, all 44 patients&#xD;
      will undergo SRP by ultrasonic instruments II and hand curettes¶ and motivational&#xD;
      instructions on oral home care.&#xD;
