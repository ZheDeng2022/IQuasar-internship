      A single-center, phase II, single-arm, feasibility study to evaluate PLD (Caelyx®) as an&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy regimen in patients with early-stage luminal B breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be to evaluate the feasibility of adjuvant PLD (Caelyx®) for each&#xD;
      individual subject. The regimen will be considered feasible if that subject is able to&#xD;
      achieve relative dose intensity (RDI) of at least 85% of the 8 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caelyx® should be administered intravenously at a dose of 20 mg/m2 once every two weeks for 8&#xD;
      courses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the 2011 St Gallen Consensus Conference, the Panel considered that both anthracyclines and&#xD;
      taxanes should be included in the chemotherapy regimen for 'Luminal B' disease1. However,&#xD;
      several patients are reluctant to receive a &quot;strong&quot; chemotherapy because of the fear of its&#xD;
      toxic effects, and usually ask for a somehow &quot;less intensive&quot; approach, even accepting a&#xD;
      possible reduction in the treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the reasons why patients refuse chemotherapy more often is the fear of alopecia. Few&#xD;
      dermatologic conditions carry as much emotional distress as chemotherapy-induced alopecia.&#xD;
      Hair loss negatively affects a patient's perception of appearance, body image, sexuality, and&#xD;
      self- esteem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We decided to conduct a single-center, phase II, single-arm, feasibility study to evaluate&#xD;
      PLD (Caelyx®) as an adjuvant chemotherapy regimen in patients with early-stage luminal B&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be to evaluate the feasibility of adjuvant PLD (Caelyx®) for each&#xD;
      individual subject. The regimen will be considered feasible if that subject is able to&#xD;
      achieve relative dose intensity (RDI) of at least 85% of the 8 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tolerability (treatment completion)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breast cancer free interval (BCFI; events are reappearance of invasive breast cancer at&#xD;
           any site including contralateral disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease Free Survival (DFS) (includes second malignancies and deaths)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival (OS) Caelyx® should be administered intravenously at a dose of 20 mg/m2&#xD;
           once every two weeks for 8 courses.&#xD;
