    <textblock>
      Purpose: Evidence-based guidelines on optimal perioperative fluid management have not been&#xD;
      established in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. Recent randomized trials in major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery suggest that large amounts of IV fluid may increase morbidity and hospital&#xD;
      stay. This study will investigate the effects of two regimens of intraoperative fluid&#xD;
      management (&quot;traditional&quot; vs. &quot;oral&quot;) with physiologic and patient function as primary&#xD;
      outcome measures after surgery.&#xD;

      Evidence-based guidelines on optimal perioperative fluid management have not been established&#xD;
      in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. Typical intraoperative and post-operative fluid&#xD;
      management has been arbitrary without evidence based guidelines established following total&#xD;
      joint replacement. The investigators have observed many patients post-operatively with side&#xD;
      effects such as fluid overload leading to medical complications requiring either prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization or readmission. Additionally, this overload may lead to wound healing&#xD;
      complications secondary to fluid shifts which may be devastating in this patient population.&#xD;
      Recent randomized trials in major abdominal surgery suggest that large amounts of IV fluid&#xD;
      may increase morbidity and hospital stay. Additionally, this increase fluid may be&#xD;
      detrimental in patients with anastomosis leading to failure and/or complications in this&#xD;
      patient population. The investigators have defined to specific groups of interest to study in&#xD;
      this patient population with regards to fluid management. The first group is the&#xD;
      &quot;traditional&quot; IV fluid group where the anesthesiologist gives an unspecific amount of fluid&#xD;
      intraoperatively and post-operatively the patient gets a set amount of fluid based on&#xD;
      &quot;protocol&quot; on the orthopaedic floor (i.e. 75 cc/hour until good oral intake). This is the&#xD;
      protocol utilized by most orthopaedic practices throughout the United States. The second&#xD;
      group is defined as patients who are given a specific protocol preoperatively to optimize&#xD;
      hydration, followed by limited fluids intraoperatively based on physiologic parameters. This&#xD;
      study will investigate the effects of two regimens of intraoperative fluid management&#xD;
      (&quot;traditional&quot; vs. &quot;oral&quot;) with&#xD;
