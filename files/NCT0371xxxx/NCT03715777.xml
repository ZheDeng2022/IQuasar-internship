  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common presenting complaint affecting approximately 15-40 % of&#xD;
      women aged 18-50 in western countries and 5-43% of women in most developing countries. It is&#xD;
      debilitating and has a large socio- economic impact, with a 45%reduction in work&#xD;
      productivity, and a 15% increase in absence from work in women with the condition. Botulinum&#xD;
      neurotoxin type A (BoNTA) has been suggested to improve pain in muscle spasm, its role in CPP&#xD;
      secondary to pelvic floor spasm has gained increasing interest. However, clinicians do not&#xD;
      have a diagnosis tool to evaluate the CPP and the BoNTA treatment results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and develop an efficient and simple tool for the diagnosis and detection of pelvic&#xD;
      floor muscle (PFM) dysfunction based on superficial electromyography (EMG) and perform 25 EMG&#xD;
      registrations sessions in healthy patients and 25 EMG sessions in patients diagnoses with PFM&#xD;
      that will be treated with BoNTA to and study the EMG signal before and after BoNTA&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 - 12 - 24</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.</description>

    <measure>SF-12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 - 12 - 24</time_frame>
    <description>Although Short Form (SF)-12 × 2® has been extensively studied and used as a valid measure of health-related quality of life in a variety of population groups, no systematic studies have described the reliability of the measure in patients with behavioral conditions or serious mental illness (SMI).</description>

    <measure>Index of Female Sexual Function (IFSF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 - 12 - 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Index of Female Sexual Function (IFSF) is a brief questionnaire measure of sexual functioning in women. It was developed for the specific purpose of assessing domains of sexual functioning (e.g. sexual arousal, orgasm, satisfaction, pain) in clinical trials.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>The Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 - 12 - 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) is a global index that may be used to rate the response of a condition to a therapy (transition scale). It is a simple, direct, easy to use scale that is intuitively understandable to clinicians</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 - 12 - 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI) consists of three different global measures: Severity of illness: (CGI-S); Global Improvement (CGI-I); Efficacy index The CGI-I score generally tracks with the CGI-S such that improvement in one follows the other; CGI-S and CGI-I scores can occasionally be dissociated</description>
