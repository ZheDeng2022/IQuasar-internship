      This research study is studying a drug called M6620 as a possible treatment for advanced&#xD;
      solid tumor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is made up of two phases: a Translational Lead-In Phase and a Phase II. These two&#xD;
      phases serve different functions. The translational lead-in phase is designed to test the&#xD;
      drug on a small number of patients in efforts to gain information on two research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If M6620 has an anti-cancer effect on participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If M6620 research findings that were discovered in laboratory studies are also found in&#xD;
           human research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II is a much larger study to determine if M6620 has an anti-cancer effect in different&#xD;
      groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved M6620 as a treatment for any&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATR is an enzyme in cells that is responsible for multiple functions including repairing&#xD;
      damaged DNA, helping cells that are stressed during the DNA copying process, and working to&#xD;
      maintain the ends of chromosomes. In cancer cells, active ATR enzymes protect the cancer by&#xD;
      helping the cells repair damage, stay alive, and maintain health. M6620 is a drug designed to&#xD;
      inhibit the ATR enzyme. Inhibiting ATR may block how cancers repair their naturally damaged&#xD;
      DNA, handle cancer cell stress, and maintain cancer cell life and health. Administration of&#xD;
      M6620 may therefore assist in the slowing of growth or destruction of some cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are...&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gathering initial data on the anti-cancer activity of M6620 when given alone to&#xD;
           participants within selected cancer populations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining if there are changes in the biological components in the participant's body&#xD;
           that may be associated with damaged DNA repair&#xD;

             the cohort enrollment decision will be discussed with the overall principal&#xD;
             investigator. For example, if a participant has both an ATM mutation and an FBXW7&#xD;
             mutation and thus could enroll to either Cohort 2 or Cohort 4A, the decision of which&#xD;
             cohort to enroll to will be made in conjunction with the overall principal&#xD;
             investigator. The decision as to which cohort the participant should be enrolled on&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  The effects of M6620 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
                  and because anti-cancer agents are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
                  child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
                  (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry&#xD;
                  and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
                  suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study,&#xD;
                  she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on&#xD;
                  this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study,&#xD;
                  for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of M6620&#xD;
                  administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy, immune therapy, other investigational therapy,&#xD;

             C) prior to entering the study, or participants who have not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 or&#xD;
             baseline from therapies administered more than 3 weeks prior (with the exceptions of&#xD;
             1. Alopecia and peripheral neuropathies which may be ≤ Grade 2 at study entry and 2.&#xD;
             Laboratory abnormalities that are not listed in 3.1 and that are not considered&#xD;

             half-lives of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have previously received treatment with an ATR inhibitor, including&#xD;
             but not limited to M6620 (VX-970).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known untreated brain metastases should be excluded from this&#xD;
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events. Participants with a history of brain metastases that have&#xD;
             been treated, no longer require corticosteroids, and have been stable on imaging for&#xD;
             at least one month following the end of treatment are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to M6620.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M6620 is an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with M6620, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             M6620.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive participants are ineligible because of the increased risk of lethal&#xD;
             infections when treated with potentially marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of another malignancy are excluded with the exception of 1.&#xD;
             patients who remain disease-free for 3 years and 2. adequately treated cervical&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ, non-melanoma skin cancer (e.g. basal cell, squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinomas), low-risk thyroid cancer.&#xD;
