    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well dexamethasone, elotuzumab, pomalidomide work in treating&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma that has not responded to previous treatment. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as elotuzumab, may help the body?s&#xD;
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow&#xD;
      and spread. Pomalidomide may stop the growth of multiple myeloma by blocking the growth of&#xD;
      new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth. Giving dexamethasone, elotuzumab, pomalidomide&#xD;
      may work better in treating patients with multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of utilizing elotuzumab, pomalidomide and&#xD;
      dexamethasone in patients with disease refractory to daratumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine percentage of patients achieving complete response (CR) with the elotuzumab&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) for treatment with the elotuzumab&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine safety profile for treatment with the elotuzumab combination. IV. To&#xD;
      determine the overall survival (OS) for patients receiving treatment with the elotuzumab&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of courses 1-2 and&#xD;
      IV on day 1 and orally (PO) on days 8, 15, and 22 of subsequent courses and elotuzumab IV on&#xD;
      days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of courses 1-2 and day 1 of subsequent courses. Patients also receive&#xD;
      pomalidomide PO on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until&#xD;
      progressive disease, then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
