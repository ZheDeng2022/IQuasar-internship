      Study hypothesis: cardiac autonomic dysfunction may affect vaso vagal syncope recurrences in&#xD;
      type 2 patients with diabetes vs. patients without diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: vaso vagal syncope and its recurrences may be due to alterations in autonomic&#xD;
      system function, that may be more frequent in diabetics. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a&#xD;
      valid test to study sympathetic and vaso vagal tone dysfunction. However, in this study&#xD;
      authors investigated the correlation between HRV alterations and diabetes in a population of&#xD;
      patients affected by syncope, and classified as vaso vagal syncope by Head Up Tilt Test (HUT)&#xD;
      exam. Secondly, authors assessed these alterations as causes of vaso vagal syncope recurring&#xD;
      at 12 months of follow up in type 2 patients with diabetes vs. patients without diabetes.&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: In a retrospective multicenter study authors studied 1567 consecutive&#xD;
      patients with vaso vagal syncope. All enrolled patients were in stable sinus rate before to&#xD;
      perform ECG Holter, and the Head Up Tilt Test (HUT). However, before to perform the HUT all&#xD;
      patients performed a 24 hours ECG Holter, to asses sinus rhythm , heart rate, and HRV.&#xD;
      Moreover, authors performed a propensity score matching (PSM) analysis to evaluate 121&#xD;
      diabetics vs. 121 non diabetics.&#xD;

      Vaso vagal syncope recurrence is a relevant clinical problem (1). In fact, despite the vaso&#xD;
      vagal syncope event is a transient loss of consciousness with rapid onset, short duration,&#xD;
      and spontaneous complete recovery after the event, it may be complicated by physical injury&#xD;
      (2). Conversely, the syncope recurrence rate is about 35%, and it causes a physical injury&#xD;
      until the 29% (3). In addition, the vaso vagal syncope has a frequency between 15% and 39%,&#xD;
      with annual number of episodes about 18.1-39.7 per 1000 patients, and an incidence of 6.2 per&#xD;
      1000 person-years, that grows up after 70 years of age with rate annual 19.5 per thousand&#xD;
      individuals after 80 years (3). The patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represent a&#xD;
      percentage about the 30% of all the subjects with syncope (4). About the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      syncope a central role is played by autonomic nervous system (5). To date, the autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system regulates the hemodynamic stability by maintaining a stable blood pressure and&#xD;
      heart rate under normal and abnormal physiologic conditions (5). Consequently, the&#xD;
      dysfunction of this complex regulatory system, and of its interaction with sensor systems as&#xD;
      baroreceptors, mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors, may alter the vascular reactivity, leading&#xD;
      to the clinical event and to future recurrences (5). Multiple factors affecting the autonomic&#xD;
      system balance may trigger and cause a syncope event, as the result of an inappropriate&#xD;
      response of the autonomic nervous system, with excessive vagal tone, and sympathetic tone&#xD;
      withdrawal (2). In this setting, authors may note the diabetes as a common cause of autonomic&#xD;
      system dysfunction (6). Moreover, T2DM may cause a severe form of autonomic system&#xD;
      dysfunction affecting the cardiac autonomic regulation, and named as cardiac autonomic&#xD;
      neuropathy (CAN), (6). Intriguingly, patients with diabetes experience a parasympathetic&#xD;
      denervation, with an early augmentation of sympathetic tone, then leading to impaired heart&#xD;
      rate variability, resting tachycardia, exercise intolerance, abnormal blood pressure&#xD;
      regulation, and orthostatic hypotension (7). In addition, in T2DM there is a compensatory&#xD;
      increase in the cardiac sympathetic tone in response to subclinical peripheral denervation&#xD;
      (7). However, the T2DM may be seen as a relevant risk factor and a trigger to alter the&#xD;
      autonomic system balance, and to cause vaso vagal syncope. Actually, the association between&#xD;
      diabetes and autonomic dysfunction and the vaso vagal syncope recurrence at follow up is not&#xD;
      well established. Moreover, the recent studies cannot come to definitive conclusion about the&#xD;
      diabetes as risk factor and/or as trigger of vaso vagal syncope events, and about its&#xD;
      implication to cause future recurrences in affected patients. Conversely, heart rate&#xD;
      variability (HRV) is a simple, reproducible and well-recognized method for evaluating&#xD;
      sympatho vagal activity (8, 9). However, in this study authors evaluated the autonomic&#xD;
      dysfunction as alteration in HRV, and its relevance to cause vaso vagal syncope, and the vaso&#xD;
      vagal syncope recurrence in diabetics vs. non diabetics at 12 months of follow up.&#xD;
