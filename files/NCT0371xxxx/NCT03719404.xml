    <textblock>
      Till date, no study has systematically evaluated the role of a single variable on success of&#xD;
      endodontic retreatment. While the evaluation of a single factor as the primary objective in a&#xD;
      study is a difficult task, it unarguably provides more valuable information regarding the&#xD;
      influence of that variable on outcome. The clinical studies comparing the use of Sodium&#xD;
      hypochlorite (NaOCl) and Chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) in retreatment cases have evaluated&#xD;
      only the antibacterial effectiveness and there is no clinical study comparing their effect on&#xD;
      the clinical outcome in retreatment cases. And also, no study has compared the use of&#xD;
      irrigant as single variable in the primary objective on success of retreatment cases. The&#xD;
      conclusions drawn from such &quot;surrogate measures&quot; must be interpreted and applied in clinical&#xD;
      settings with caution. Since there is no standardised irrigation treatment protocol for&#xD;
      secondary root canal treatment, the present study is being conducted to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of 5% NaOCl with 17% Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 2% CHX with 10% citric acid&#xD;
      (CA) on outcome, when used as irrigants during the chemomechanical preparation in retreatment&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;

      Introduction: Retreatment is defined as a procedure to remove root canal filling materials&#xD;
      from the tooth, followed by cleaning, shaping and obturating the canals (AAE glossary of&#xD;
      endodontic terms). There is a scarcity in retreatment studies when compared to literature&#xD;
      available pertaining to primary root canal treatment. Till date, only 7 studies are available&#xD;
      which have attempted to analyse the factors predicting the prognosis of nonsurgical&#xD;
      retreatment. However, none of these studies has systematically evaluated the role of a single&#xD;
      variable on success of endodontic retreatment. These are either retrospective or cohort&#xD;
      studies, with no study identifiable as a randomised controlled trial. While the evaluation of&#xD;
      a single factor as the primary objective in a study is a difficult task, it unarguably&#xD;
      provides more valuable information regarding the influence of that variable on outcome. The&#xD;
      present study is being conducted to evaluate the effect of 5% NaOCl with 17% EDTA, and 2% CHX&#xD;
      with 10% CA on outcome, when used as irrigants during the chemomechanical preparation in&#xD;
      retreatment cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim and Objectives: To evaluate and compare the success of nonsurgical endodontic retreatment&#xD;
      following use of the two different irrigant regimes, using 5% NaOCl with 17% EDTA and 2% CHX&#xD;
      with 10% CA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Study subjects will be recruited from Post Graduate Department of Conservative&#xD;
      Dentistry and Endodontics, PGIDS, Rohtak, Haryana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective randomized controlled trial Time frame: 18 months Method: Patients&#xD;
      with above inclusion criteria will be selected and randomly allocated to one of the two study&#xD;
      groups according to the irrigants used ( NaOCl + EDTA , CHX + CA ). The secondary root canal&#xD;
      treatment was completed in two visits. Proper rubber dam isolation and aseptic conditions&#xD;
      were followed throughout the procedure. Caries and /or coronal restorations were removed with&#xD;
      sterile burs. The coronal two thirds of the root filling was mechanically removed with hand&#xD;
      files. A sterile #15 K- file was used to create space by applying a gentle filing motion. A&#xD;
      larger endodontic file was used to engage the root canal filling material and the file with&#xD;
      the attached root filling material was withdrawn from the canal. The working length was&#xD;
      determined with the aid of the electronic apex locator and radiographs using digital sensor&#xD;
      (Carestream RVG 5200, Carestream Health Inc, Rochester, NY). Apical preparation was completed&#xD;
      to the working length with hand stainless-steel files. 2 ml of corresponding chosen primary&#xD;
      irrigant (NaOCl or CHX) was used after each instrument change in the respective groups. All&#xD;
      the irrigation procedures were performed using a 30 gauge needle ensuring that the needle was&#xD;
      placed to within 1-2mm from the apex. After preparation of the canals, the smear layer was&#xD;
      removed using a rinse of 5 ml of either 17% EDTA or 10 % CA depending on the group, which was&#xD;
      ultrasonically activated for 3 minutes. Then the final irrigation was done using 5 ml of&#xD;
      corresponding primary irrigant of the group. The root canal walls were then dried using paper&#xD;
      points. Calcium hydroxide paste mixed with sterile saline was placed with Lentulo spiral&#xD;
      fillers in the entire root canal extent and the access cavity was restored with Cavit. The&#xD;
      dressing was left in place for 7 days. At the second visit, the temporary restoration was&#xD;
      removed. The intracanal dressing was removed with 5 ml of corresponding primary irrigant and&#xD;
      with gentle filing with the use of Hedstroem file. The root canal was then irrigated with 5&#xD;
      ml of corresponding chelating agent with ultrasonic activation followed by 5 ml of primary&#xD;
      irrigants of the corresponding group. The canals were dried and obturated with the&#xD;
      GuttaPercha using lateral condensation technique and Zinc Oxide- Eugenol based sealer in both&#xD;
      the groups. After obturation, the tooth was restored permanently. Immediate post-operative&#xD;
      radiograph was then taken using preset exposure parameters with Rinn paralleling device.&#xD;
      Follow up clinical and radiographic examinations were carried out every 3 months, till 12&#xD;
      months period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The data gathered will be analyzed using suitable statistical methods.&#xD;

    <description>Follow up will be done every 3 months till 12 months. Scoring of each tooth will be done according to the following five point scale (PAI). 1- normal periapical structures 2-Small changes in bone structure 3-Changes in bone structure with some mineral loss 4-Periodontitis with well-defined radiolucent area 5-Severe periodontitis with exacerbating features&#xD;
Instructions for scoring using PAI:&#xD;
All teeth must be given a score&#xD;
When in doubt assign higher score&#xD;
For multirooted teeth, use the highest of the scores given to the individual roots.&#xD;
Success was calculated as a dichotomous variable with teeth showing a PAI score of ≤ 2 considered as healed, while those showing a score of ≥3 considered as nonhealed.</description>
