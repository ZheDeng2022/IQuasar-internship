  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It can detect anxiety and depressive disorders. It has 14 items rated from 0 to 3. Seven questions relate to anxiety (total A) and seven others to the depressive dimension (total D), thus obtaining two scores (maximum score of each score = 21). 7 or less: no symptomatology 8 to 10: doubtful symptomatology 11 and above: certain symptomatology.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Doloplus scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral Assessment Scale of Pain in Older People with Verbal Communication Disorders. This scale comprises ten items divided into three subgroups (five somatic, two psychomotor and three psychosocial).&#xD;
Each item is rated from 0 to 3 (four exclusive and progressive level scoring), which results in an overall score between 0 and 30.&#xD;
The pain is clearly affirmed for a score greater than or equal to 5 out of 30.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Zarit's score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Zarit scale assesses the emotional, physical and financial burden for caregivers of caring for someone with a loss of autonomy.&#xD;
The total score, which is the sum of the scores obtained for each of 22 items, varies from 0 to 88.&#xD;
A score less than or equal to 20 indicates a low or no load; a score between 21 and 40 indicates a light load; a score between 41 and 60 indicates a moderate load; a score above 60 indicates a severe charge.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Goal Attainment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Goal Attainment Scale by objectives at the beginning and end of taking charge. Each item built has 5 levels of answers 0: corresponds to the achievement of the goal set by the examiner.&#xD;
1: is a better score than expected.&#xD;
2: corresponds to the most favorable evolution expected.&#xD;
1: corresponds to a score lower than that expected.&#xD;
2: corresponds to a least favorable score expected.</description>
