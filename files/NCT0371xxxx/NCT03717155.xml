    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Best Objective Response (BOR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 Assessed by Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from the first dose of study drug until occurrence of PD, death due to any cause (assessed up to 612 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Confirmed BOR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved confirmed complete responses (CR) or partial response (PR), according to RECIST version 1.1 assessed by the Investigator.CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of all lesions. Stable disease (SD)= Neither sufficient increase to qualify for progression of disease (PD) nor sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR. PD: At least a 20 percent (%) increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Confirmed CR=as at least two determinations of CR at least 4 weeks apart with no PD. Confirmed PR=as at least 2 determinations of PR or better (PR followed by PR or PR followed by CR), at least 4 weeks apart (not qualifying for a CR) with no PD in between. Percentage of Participants with confirmed BOR were reported.</description>

    <time_frame>Time from the first dose of study drug assessed up to (612 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug or worsening of pre-existing medical condition, whether or not related to study drug.Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. TEAE is defined as AEs starting or worsening after the first intake of the study drug. TEAEs include both Serious and non-serious TEAEs. irAEs included AEs that matches a preferred term on the list of pre-selected MedDRA terms. AEs with relationship to study treatment are reported as Treatment-related AEs. Treatment related AEs with grade 3 or more is also reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Time Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from the first dose of study drug until occurrence of PD, death due to any cause (assessed up to 612 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time (in months) from first treatment day to the date of the first documentation of objective progression of disease (PD) according to RECIST version 1.1 assessed by Investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PD is defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from the first dose of study drug until occurrence of PD, death due to any cause (assessed up to 612 days)</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined for participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as the time from first documentation of confirmed response to the date of first documentation of progression of disease (PD) according to RECIST version 1.1 (assessed by Investigator) or death due to any cause. Duration of objective response was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the SLD of all lesions. PD: At least a 20 percent (%) increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 941 days</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were analyzed for the presence of anti-cetuximab or anti-avelumab antibodies by anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay. The binding ADA assay results were summarized as negative or positive.</description>

    <description>Participants received 800 milligrams Avelumab, 1250 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2) gemcitabine on Day 1 and Day 8, cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/m^2 on Day 1 along with 250 mg/m2 body surface area Cetuximab on Day 1 and 500 mg/m2 body surface area on Day 8 of each cycle as intravenous (IV) infusions up to maximum of 4 cycles (each cycle is of 3 weeks) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. In case of cisplatin toxicities, participants were switched to carboplatin at a dose of target area under the serum concentration-time curve of 5 (AUC 5) on Day 1 for the remainder of cycles. Subsequently participants were administered with avelumab and cetuximab as IV infusion at the dose of 800 mg and 500 mg/m^2 respectively, every 2 weeks in the Maintenance phase until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities.</description>

          <description>Participants received 800 milligrams Avelumab, 1250 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2) gemcitabine on Day 1 and Day 8, cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/m^2 on Day 1 along with 250 mg/m2 body surface area Cetuximab on Day 1 and 500 mg/m2 body surface area on Day 8 of each cycle as intravenous (IV) infusions up to maximum of 4 cycles (each cycle is of 3 weeks) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. In case of cisplatin toxicities, participants were switched to carboplatin at a dose of target area under the serum concentration-time curve of 5 (AUC 5) on Day 1 for the remainder of cycles. Subsequently participants were administered with avelumab and cetuximab as IV infusion at the dose of 800 mg and 500 mg/m^2 respectively, every 2 weeks in the Maintenance phase until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Best Objective Response (BOR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 Assessed by Investigator</title>
        <description>Confirmed BOR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved confirmed complete responses (CR) or partial response (PR), according to RECIST version 1.1 assessed by the Investigator.CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of all lesions. Stable disease (SD)= Neither sufficient increase to qualify for progression of disease (PD) nor sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR. PD: At least a 20 percent (%) increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Confirmed CR=as at least two determinations of CR at least 4 weeks apart with no PD. Confirmed PR=as at least 2 determinations of PR or better (PR followed by PR or PR followed by CR), at least 4 weeks apart (not qualifying for a CR) with no PD in between. Percentage of Participants with confirmed BOR were reported.</description>

PD: At least a 20 percent (%) increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Confirmed CR=as at least two determinations of CR at least 4 weeks apart with no PD. Confirmed PR=as at least 2 determinations of PR or better (PR followed by PR or PR followed by CR), at least 4 weeks apart (not qualifying for a CR) with no PD in between. Percentage of Participants with confirmed BOR were reported.</description>

        <title>Duration of Response (DOR)</title>
        <description>DOR is defined for participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as the time from first documentation of confirmed response to the date of first documentation of progression of disease (PD) according to RECIST version 1.1 (assessed by Investigator) or death due to any cause. Duration of objective response was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the SLD of all lesions. PD: At least a 20 percent (%) increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>
