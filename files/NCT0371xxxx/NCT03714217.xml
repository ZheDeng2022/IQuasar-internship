  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to provide tele-nutrition counseling after a spinal cord injury&#xD;
      (SCI). During the three months of participation, subjects will be given an iPad and the iPad&#xD;
      will be used to record meals using a photo journal application, YouAte. In addition, subjects&#xD;
      will receive dietary advice two times a month with a registered dietitian (RD). The dietitian&#xD;
      role in the study will be to educate healthy weight management and accommodate any cultural&#xD;
      and behavioral habits. The objective of this study is to show that the proposed&#xD;
      tele-nutrition program will be effective with weight management through 3-month&#xD;
      tele-nutrition counseling via iPad FaceTime. The hypotheses are 1) that weight and waist&#xD;
      circumference will not increase after 3 months of tele-nutrition program, 2) quality of life&#xD;
      will improve, and 3) quality of diet will improve.&#xD;

      Participants with spinal cord injury (traumatic or non-traumatic) will be recruited over a&#xD;
      9-month period from Santa Clara Valley Medical Center's (SCVMC) inpatient rehabilitation&#xD;
      program before discharge as well as through the outpatient SCI clinic. Demographic data,&#xD;
      weight /height, waist circumference as well as Life Satisfaction Index-A will be obtained at&#xD;
      enrollment and 3-months post-enrollment. For subjects unable to return to the SCVMC clinic,&#xD;
      questionnaires will be administered over the phone and they will be asked to measure their&#xD;
      waist circumference by themselves and with assistance from a caregiver if needed. Each&#xD;
      participant will be provided with an iPad and 4 month cellular data plan at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment. iPad accessories like mouthstick will be provided if needed. Prior to initiating&#xD;
      the tele-nutrition service, each participant will be instructed on how to use the iPad and&#xD;
      FaceTime. Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) will provide an assessment of current&#xD;
      knowledge and nutrition evaluation at enrollment in order to individualize intervention on a&#xD;
      per-participant basis. Counseling twice a month over a 3 month time-period via tele-nutrition&#xD;
      using iPad FaceTime will be provided for each participant. Tele-nutrition consults, via iPad&#xD;
      with a food photo journal application (YouAte), would emphasize the importance of tracking&#xD;
      food intake with the primary focus on healthy weight management. Nutrition education will be&#xD;
      tailored according to and around each individual's cultural and behavioral practice with&#xD;
      regards to food. Participants will be counseled with the goal to make incremental changes in&#xD;
      current diet to better optimize energy, protein, fat, and fiber intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      YouAte, a food journaling application, will be installed on each iPad and will have a&#xD;
      three-month membership. This app is a mindful and simple way for participants to document&#xD;
      their food intake for the review of the RDN over the course of this project. Once a picture&#xD;
      is taken of a meal (with assistance from a caregiver if needed), participants can choose&#xD;
      whether they feel the meal is on-path or off-path, based on their goals. Participants can&#xD;
      further include information about the meal in a note section if they choose to. Additional,&#xD;
      one-tap choices of the app can further tailor each meal's mindful approach to why it was&#xD;
      eaten, how the meal made them feel, where they ate, how it was made, and how it made them&#xD;
      feel. RDN will be able to review all meals and snacks in order to further discuss choices and&#xD;
      provide valuable feedback with each participant to improve intake. At the end of the 3-month&#xD;
      participation in the tele-nutrition program, each participant will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      satisfaction survey in addition. This app will be set up using subject identifier such as a&#xD;
      set of numbers and/or alias. So, no Protected Health Information such as name or date of&#xD;
      birth will be entered or used to identify the diet journaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected throughout the study will be used to provide preliminary evidence for the&#xD;
      feasibility of the tele-nutrition program. Baseline measures will be used to characterize the&#xD;
      cohort and measure changes across the intervention. Quantitative changes in weight and waist&#xD;
      circumference, as well as satisfaction survey at the end of the assessment period will be&#xD;
      used to measure feasibility. A combination of non-parametric statistics, most likely Wilcoxon&#xD;
      Sign Ranked Tests, and clinical assessment will be used to measure whether the changes were&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
