  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single ascending dose study&#xD;
      of IV VIS649 in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIS649 is a monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) antibody targeting the B-cell growth factor&#xD;
      APRILL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll up to 45 subjects and will be conducted in up to 5 sequential dosing&#xD;
      cohorts at four different dose levels, enrolling 9 subjects per cohort. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to VIS649 or placebo in a ratio of 7:2 (7 active, 2 placebo). Safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data from the initial cohorts will be assessed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On Day 1, a single dose of VIS649 or placebo will be administered IV. Pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      sampling will start with a collection prior to the start of infusion and at multiple&#xD;
      timepoints throughout the study. Pharmacodynamics sampling will occur at baseline and&#xD;
      multiple timepoints throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentinel subjects will be utilized; the first two subjects in each cohort will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive either VIS649 or placebo and will receive study drug at least 24 hours before the&#xD;
      remaining subjects in the cohort are dosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety profile of these subjects over the 24 hour post-administration period will be&#xD;
      reviewed to determine whether it is appropriate to proceed with enrollment of the remaining&#xD;
      subjects in the cohort as planned. This will occur for each dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum duration of participation (Screening through End-of-study) for individual&#xD;
      subjects will be approximately 20 weeks (5 months). The scheduled final visit will occur 16&#xD;
      weeks post-dosing (112 days).&#xD;
