  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal pain, sometimes severe, is a known symptom of polycystic kidney disease (PKD)&#xD;
      related to the cystic expansion. This study will investigate whether the vasopressin V2&#xD;
      receptor antagonist lixivaptan can alleviate intractable pain in a pediatric PKD patient who&#xD;
      cannot tolerate the related vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Capable of understanding the written informed consent/assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Provides signed and witnessed written informed consent/assent, and agrees to comply&#xD;
             with protocol requirements and study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At least 15 years of age at the time of Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has been diagnosed with ADPKD by modified Ravine criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the subject has a family history of ADPKD, a minimum of 3 cysts per kidney by&#xD;
                  sonography or 5 cysts by computerized tomography or MRI; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the subject does not have a family history of ADPKD, a minimum of 10 cysts per&#xD;
                  kidney by any radiologic method and exclusion of other cystic kidney diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Considered by the Investigator to be in good health relative to underlying CKD status&#xD;
             and clinically stable with respect to underlying CKD, based on medical evaluation that&#xD;
             includes medical and surgical history, as well as a complete physical examination&#xD;
             including vital signs, ECG, and laboratory test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has a known sensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to any compound present in&#xD;
             lixivaptan or any compound listed as being present in the formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Is pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has taken any investigational drug or used an investigational device within 30 days or&#xD;
             5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has taken tolvaptan, conivaptan, somatostatin analogs (e.g. lanreotide, pasireotide,&#xD;
             octreotide, etc.), mTOR kinase inhibitors (e.g. everolimus, sirolimus, etc.), or oral&#xD;
             or intravenous antibiotics within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior&#xD;
             to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has a history of testing positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C, or&#xD;
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Consumes grapefruit or Seville oranges (or their juices, or foods containing their&#xD;
             extract) from 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication and until after the&#xD;
             final dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has clinically significant liver disease, or clinically significant liver function&#xD;
             abnormalities or serology other than that expected for ADPKD with cystic liver disease&#xD;
             at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities or concomitant conditions&#xD;
             other than ADPKD (including treatment for such conditions) that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, could either interfere with the study drug or pose an unacceptable risk&#xD;
             to the subject.&#xD;
