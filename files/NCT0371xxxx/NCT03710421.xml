      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CS1-chimeric antigen receptor&#xD;
      (CAR) T therapy after chemotherapy in treating patients who have CS1 positive multiple&#xD;
      myeloma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Immune&#xD;
      cells can be engineered to kill multiple myeloma cells by inserting a piece of&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into the immune cells using a lentiviral vector such as CS1, that&#xD;
      allows them to recognize multiple myeloma cells. These engineered immune cells, CS1-CAR T&#xD;
      cells, may kill multiple myeloma cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intravenous (i.v.) delivered autologous CS1-CAR&#xD;
      T cells for research participants with CS1+ recurrent/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the response rates at days 28, 100, and 180 post CAR T cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Measure the persistence of CS1-CAR T cells in blood and marrow. III. Measure phenotype&#xD;
      and anti-tumor functionality of CS1-CAR T cells in marrow and blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Measure the levels of cytokines in blood and marrow, and soluble CS-1 in blood post&#xD;
      infusion as a surrogate indicator of CAR T cell activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Evaluate CS-1 expression on MM cancer cells before, during and at progressive disease (PD)&#xD;
      to determine antigenic loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Describe the percentage of MM cells that express CS-1 surface marker before, during and at&#xD;
      PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CS1-CAR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo leukapheresis over 2-4 hours. Beginning 3-4 weeks, patients receive&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -4 and/or -3 or fludarabine IV and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide IV on days -5 to -3. Patients then undergo CS1-CAR T therapy over 10-15&#xD;
      minutes on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 day, at least every 2 days&#xD;
      for up to a minimum of 14 days, weekly for 1 month, monthly for 1 year, then periodically for&#xD;
      up to 15 years.&#xD;
