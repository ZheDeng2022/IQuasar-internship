    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a lifesaving procedure used to treat severe&#xD;
      forms of heart and/or lung failure. It works by the principal of replacing the function of&#xD;
      these organs by taking blood from the patient, provide it with oxygen outside the body and&#xD;
      return it to the patient in one continuous circuit. Because of the evaluability of better&#xD;
      technology, the use of ECMO has exponentially risen over the last decade. This treatment is&#xD;
      very invasive and carries a number of risks. It is mostly used in situations where it seems&#xD;
      likely that the patient would otherwise die and no other less invasive measure could change&#xD;
      this. Still in large registries 50-60% of patients die which is often due to complications&#xD;
      associated with the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most important complication is caused by the activation of clotting factors during&#xD;
      the contact with the artificial surfaces of the device. This can lead to clot formation&#xD;
      inside the patient or the device. To counterbalance this anticoagulation is needed. Because&#xD;
      of the consumption of clotting factors and the heparin therapy bleeding complications are&#xD;
      also very common in ECMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians are challenged to balance these competing risks and are often forced to transfuse&#xD;
      blood products to treat these conditions, which comes with additional risks for the patient.&#xD;
      Many experienced centres have reported thromboembolic and bleeding events as the most&#xD;
      important contributor to a poor outcome of this procedure. However, no international study&#xD;
      combining the experience of multiple centres to compare their practice and identify risk&#xD;
      factors which can be altered to reduce these risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been endorsed by the international ECMONet and aims to observe the practice in&#xD;
      up to 50 centres and 500 patients worldwide to generate the largest ever published database&#xD;
      on this topic. It will concentrate on patients with severe heart failure and will be able to&#xD;
      identify specific risk factors for thromboembolic and bleeding events. Some of these factors&#xD;
      may be modifiable by change in practice and can subsequently be evaluated in clinical trials.&#xD;
      Some of these factors may include target values for heparin therapy and infusion of clotting&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will directly improve patient management by informing clinicians which measures&#xD;
      are associated with the best outcome and indirectly helps building trials to increase the&#xD;
      evidence further.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is the most frequently used mechanical circulatory&#xD;
      support (MCS) for severe forms of cardiogenic shock (CS) when simpler measures like inotropes&#xD;
      and the intra-aortic balloon pump fail. Despite improvements in technology and growing&#xD;
      clinical experience mortality among patients supported with ECMO remains above 40%. In&#xD;
      addition to bloodstream infections and circuit-related complications, disorders of&#xD;
      coagulation which can result in life-threatening hemorrhage, thrombosis and thromboembolic&#xD;
      events remain the most frequent and dangerous complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant perturbations in hemostatic function are seen during extracorporeal therapies.&#xD;
      The mechanisms of these are complex and relate to underlying pathology, blood-surface contact&#xD;
      and pump mechanics. They are evidenced by platelet dysfunction and consumption,&#xD;
      hyperfibrinolysis or coagulopathy secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the multifactorial disturbances of hemostasis that can result in hemorrhage during&#xD;
      ECMO, standard laboratory hemostatic testing may not enable the clinician to specify the&#xD;
      underlying cause of the bleeding. Consequently, bleeding events are typically managed with&#xD;
      transfusion of coagulation factors guided by clinician judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticoagulation practice itself may also determine the bleeding risk and it has been noted&#xD;
      that practice is variable. Heparin dosage and titration as well as stopping rules are not&#xD;
      well defined and vary vastly in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, bleeding had been reported in clinical trials where high anticoagulation&#xD;
      targets were used which contributed to excessive bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding and the utilization of blood products have frequently been described as a predictor&#xD;
      of poor outcome in the general ICU population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines suggesting high hemoglobin targets to optimize oxygen delivery in ECMO have&#xD;
      subsequently been challenged to avoid potential risk associated with blood product&#xD;
      transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excessive transfusion of blood products, which increases the risk of complications such as&#xD;
      transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion-related circulatory overload&#xD;
      (TACO) and transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM) may outweigh the potential benefit.&#xD;
      Unnecessary exposure to procoagulant factors also increases the risk of ECMO-circuit&#xD;
      malfunction and thromboembolic complications. These additionally lead to increased ICU and&#xD;
      hospital length of stay, and markedly increased costs. Improvement in the management of&#xD;
      anticoagulation and hemostatic therapy in this setting may alter outcome in ECMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current knowledge is insufficient to provide high level evidence-based recommendations on&#xD;
      anticoagulation, management of bleeding or transfusion triggers. Published literature is&#xD;
      mostly drawn from retrospective single centre reports over different time periods, case mix,&#xD;
      ECMO equipment and data points. In the absence of randomized controlled trials (RCT)&#xD;
      addressing these multitude of issues, best practice should be based on multicenter cohort&#xD;
      studies. A standardized multicenter approach is needed to observe associations between&#xD;
      variations in practice and clinically relevant outcomes. These observations will support&#xD;
      hypothesizes for future RCT and is crucial to propose feasible interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Bleeding, thromboembolic complications and blood product usage in ECMO for MCS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vary among centers providing the service&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differ with different anticoagulation strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are dependent on diagnostic grouping and presentation category&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are independently associated with morbidity and mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • An international, multicenter, observational cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To prospectively describe bleeding, thromboembolic complications, blood management and&#xD;
           anticoagulation in ECMO for MCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate its associations with morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify risk factors for bleeding, thromboembolic complications and blood product&#xD;
           usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide information on current standard of care for future prospective interventional&#xD;
           trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) maintains a registry and reports 4297&#xD;
      annual adult ECMO runs worldwide in 2016. This number has more than doubled since 2012. Since&#xD;
      this registry relies on voluntary contributions it is almost certainly only reporting a&#xD;
      fraction of all global treatments. Using national insurance datasets McCarthy reports almost&#xD;
      3000 usages in the US in 2012 (ELSO registry: less than 1000 for North America). Using a&#xD;
      similar approach Karagiannidis found almost 4500 annual runs in Germany in 2014 (ELSO&#xD;
      registry: 921 for Europe in total during the same year). Using the Japanese Diagnosis&#xD;
      Procedure Combination national inpatient database 5263 patients were treated in that country&#xD;
      for cardiac support only over a period of 3 years from 2010 to 2013 (ELSO registry: less than&#xD;
      500 for the whole Asia-Pacific area). No global statistic of ECMO usage exists but it can be&#xD;
      assumed that the largest registry probably underestimates the true utilisation by a factor of&#xD;
      5-20. This would translate into an annual number of patients treated with ECMO of around&#xD;
      20.000 to 100.000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mortality attributed to bleeding and thromboembolic complications is also unknown. Based&#xD;
      on ELSO data Lorusso found the incidence of stroke, cerebral haemorrhage, brain death and&#xD;
      seizures to be 7% with an associated mortality of more than 70% in patients treated with ECMO&#xD;
      for respiratory support. Given that these patients were primarily diagnosed with a pulmonary&#xD;
      disease and a low risk profile for cerebral complications, ECMO may be a contributor to this&#xD;
      negative outcome which may potentially be avoidable. Other causes of bleeding and&#xD;
      thromboembolic complications during ECMO for MCS are more frequent and reported as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clots: oxygenator 8.2%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other clots in the ECMO system 5.6%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastrointestinal haemorrhage 4.4%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cannulation site bleeding 17.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical site bleeding 19.2%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Haemolysis 5.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) 3.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac tamponade: blood 5%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary haemorrhage 2.8%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Limb Ischemia 3.6%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compartment syndrome 1%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Limb Fasciotomy 1.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Limb Amputation 0.5% While these registry data do not allow insight into a causative&#xD;
           correlation with mortality, bleeding and thromboembolic complications almost certainly&#xD;
           contribute to morbidity and treatment costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for blood transfusions has been quantified to be between 1 and 4 Units per day of&#xD;
      ECMO treatment which may further contribute to mortality and morbidity through direct and&#xD;
      indirect transfusion related complications. Best strategies to avoid blood transfusions in&#xD;
      ECMO have not been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The costs directly related to ECMO are difficult to assess. However, so far the largest&#xD;
      randomized trial has calculated the additional costs of patients treated with the modality at&#xD;
      about 40.000 pounds while other observational studies measured a direct treatment related&#xD;
      cost of 73.000 USD and 106.000 Euro. Even a conservative estimation of the annual case load&#xD;
      would quantify the global treatment related costs at more than 1.5 billion USD. Using the&#xD;
      same conservative approach and assuming an average ECMO treatment duration of 10 days would&#xD;
      translate into 200.000 units of blood transfused. Given the reported direct costs of a blood&#xD;
      transfusion of USD 265 the costs would be about 50 Million USD per annum for red blood cells&#xD;
      alone. Indirect costs related to TRALI and other complications as well as administration&#xD;
      costs cannot be assessed but are most likely much higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific data on blood management and anticoagulation have only been published in single&#xD;
      centre retrospective trials. This study's targeted recruitment of 500 patients would&#xD;
      represent by far the largest contemporary sample in this area worldwide.&#xD;
