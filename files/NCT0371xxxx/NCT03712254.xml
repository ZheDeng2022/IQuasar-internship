  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The nature of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is fluctuating and patients can experience periods of&#xD;
      complete remission of pain as well as periods with excessive pain. TN is often triggered by&#xD;
      innocuous intra- and extraoral stimuli such as chewing. Since the first-line prophylactic&#xD;
      drugs, i.e. carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, are administered orally, medical treatment of TN&#xD;
      can be problematic in periods of exacerbation. In cases of severe exacerbation, patients&#xD;
      oftentimes become dehydrated and anorectic as eating and drinking will evoke pain. Treatment&#xD;
      with drugs administered intravenously is needed in such situations. Phenytoin was the first&#xD;
      drug to be used for TN but it is rarely used as long-time preventative because of frequent&#xD;
      side-effects associated with long-term use. However, phenytoin has the advantage over other&#xD;
      drugs, that it can be administered also intravenously as fosphenytoin (the prodrug of&#xD;
      phenytoin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      By clinical experience the efficacy is very good. However, evidence of the treatment is&#xD;
      lacking as only case reports including a total of 5 patients described the effects and side&#xD;
      effects with pain relief lasting two days. By providing solid observational evidence, the&#xD;
      treatment can be considered for incorporation in local and international treatment&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that fosphenytoin loading reduces TN pain with&#xD;
      at least 50 % in 80% of patients with trigeminal neuralgia experiencing exacerbation of TN&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a descriptive prospective observational pilot study with 3 months followup&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
