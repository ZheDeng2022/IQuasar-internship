    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed as observational study of overall duration of 8-9 years, but&#xD;
      the first results and conclusions could be achieved in 3-4 years. In the first phase, that&#xD;
      would last 3-4 years, the investigators will form three predetermined groups of breast cancer&#xD;
      patients that would be monitored in the second phase for 5 postoperative years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients involved in this trial would undergo defined protocol. All patients&#xD;
      participating in this trial and all members of investigation team would be completely&#xD;
      introduced to plan and aims of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two main hypothesis of this trial are that SLNB does not have negative impact on clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (locoregional recurrence and overall survival) in initially node-positive patients&#xD;
      who achieved complete clinically axillary remission after neoadjuvant systemic treatment and&#xD;
      that lymph node status after neoadjuvant treatment is significantly more relevant prognostic&#xD;
      factor than nodal status at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim is to establish that sentinel lymph node biopsy, in node positive breast&#xD;
      cancer patients that achieve clinical remission after neoadjuvant treatment, is reliable&#xD;
      approach for sugical axillary management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data would be collected individually for each patient and recorded on appropriated forms.&#xD;
      After data completion, leading investigator would import encoded data in register. Data&#xD;
      collected in this trial would be used for publications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed as prospective, observational, non-randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      of overall duration of 8-9 years, but the first results and conclusions (secondary outcomes)&#xD;
      could be achieved in 3-4 years from the beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on ultrasound and/or magnetic resonance assessment of primary tumor dimensions,&#xD;
      pathological report of core needle biopsy, ultrasound evaluation of axillary lymph nodes and&#xD;
      cytologicaly proven positive lymph nodes, patients would be divided in three predefined&#xD;
      groups and would undergo through predetermined group protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (T1-2 N0 M0) protocol: Surgery is primary treatment (quadrantectomy/mastectomy and&#xD;
      sentinel lymph node biopsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (T2-3 N0 M0) protocol: Neoadjuvant oncological treatment is primary therapy followed&#xD;
      by surgery (quadrantectomy/mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy) and afterward by&#xD;
      adjuvant oncological treatment. Before neoadjuvant treatment all patients would undergo&#xD;
      magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and ultrasound guided placement titanium clip in primary&#xD;
      tumor site. Clinical assessment of effectiveness of neoadjuvant treatment would be evaluate&#xD;
      by breast MR imaging in the middle and at the end of the neoadjuvant systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 (T1-3 N1-2 M0) protocol include the Group 2 protocol in addition with FNA (cytology)&#xD;
      prove of positive node, ultrasound guided marking positive node with titanium clip before&#xD;
      starting neoadjuvant protocol, ultrasound and MR imaging reevaluation of axillary nodes at&#xD;
      the end of neoadjuvant treatment and for those patients who achieve complete clinical&#xD;
      remission of axillary lymph nodes, biopsy of marked node would be performed in context of&#xD;
      standard surgical procedure (in addition to quadrantectomy/mastectomy and sentinel lymph node&#xD;
      biopsy) regardless being sentinel node or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For presence of any size residual tumor in lymph node(s) in group 2 and 3 axillary lymph node&#xD;
      dissection would be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients would be controlled periodically in postoperative five years follow up period to&#xD;
      determine the prevalence of locoregional recurrence, progression of disease to M1 stage and&#xD;
      overall survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results would be compared among groups, to available literature data and to our former&#xD;
      data of patients of same stage but treated in period from 2011 till 2014 (i.e. without&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, all marked nodes (group 3) would be examined for presence or absence of&#xD;
      intraoperative signal and presence or absence of any residual tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase, that would last 3-4 years, the investigators would form three&#xD;
      predetermined groups of breast cancer patients that would be monitored in the second phase&#xD;
      for 5 postoperative years and analyse secondary outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to statistical analysis made of former data of Clinical Hospital Centar Rijeka,&#xD;
      groups should be made of at last 30 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients participating in this trial and all members of investigation team would be&#xD;
      completely introduced to plan and aims of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two main hypothesis of this trial are that SLNB does not have negative impact on clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (locoregional recurrence and overall survival) in initially node-positive patients&#xD;
      who achieved complete clinically axillary remission after neoadjuvant systemic treatment and&#xD;
      that lymph node status after neoadjuvant treatment is significantly more relevant prognostic&#xD;
      factor than nodal status at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim is to establish that sentinel lymph node biopsy, in node positive breast&#xD;
      cancer patients that achieve clinical remission after neoadjuvant treatment, is reliable&#xD;
      approach for sugical axillary management and that does not have negative impact on the&#xD;
      oncological principles and clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data would be collected individually for each patient during diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      period and in follow up period (periodic ambulance controls) for 5 postoperative years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data would be recorded on appropriated forms. After data completion, leading investigator&#xD;
      would import encoded data in register. All data would be available to all members of&#xD;
      investigation team, members of Ethic Committee and a person in charge of statistic analysis.&#xD;
      Data collected in this trial would be used for publications and self-control of our&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team for breast cancer.&#xD;
