  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized control trial aims to establish whether viewing and discussing patients'&#xD;
      electronic communication (texts, emails, Facebook direct messaging, etc) impacts clinical&#xD;
      care and decision making across the lifespan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study explores the usefulness and effectiveness of including electronic communication as&#xD;
      part of standard clinical care. Participants will provide information and content from their&#xD;
      electronic media to research assistants during in person interviews if they are in the&#xD;
      intervention group. Research assistants will then give clinicians the information collected,&#xD;
      so the clinicians can incorporate the data into the session as they see fit. Therapists will&#xD;
      retain full clinical discretion of how they continue to conduct their therapy sessions. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare the impact of receiving this electronic enhancement intervention&#xD;
      versus only receiving treatment as usual care on mental health related functioning and&#xD;
      therapeutic alliance.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in Mental Health Related Quality of Life/Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>After final visit</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the Short Form Health - 36 Item Survey (SF-36) to assess whether use of electronic media will lead to participants reporting improved functioning/quality of life. The SF-36 is a patient-administered scale and focuses on 8 domains including social functioning, perceptions of health, emotional well-being, role limitations due to physical or emotional concerns, and physical functioning.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Therapeutic Alliance</measure>
    <time_frame>After final visit</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the Working Alliance Inventory - Short Revised (WAI-SR) scale to assess whether use of electronic media will lead to participants reporting an enhanced working alliance. The working alliance inventory is a 12 item measure of the client's/patient's perception of how comfortable they believe their alliance with their therapist is. Each item is rated on a scale of 1-5, and measures how frequently participants believe criteria has been achieved. A score of 1 typically represents that the specific item has been achieved least frequently and a sore of 5 indicates that the specific item is achieved at every session. The items are then summed up to compute a total score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Outcome - Improvement in scores of depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 4 visits, up to 13 visits</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (OHQ-9) to assess changes in patient's/client's symptoms of depression. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 is a 9 item questionnaire used to screen for symptoms of major depression. It is self-administered by participants. Items are scored on a scale of 0-3 with total scores ranging from 0-27. Higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Outcome - Improvement in scores of anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 4 visits, up to 13 visits</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) to assess changes in patient's/client's symptoms of anxiety. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale is a 7-item questionnaire used to screen symptoms of anxiety disorders. It is self-administered by the participant. The 7 items are scored on a 0-3 scale, and total scores range from 0-21. Higher scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>
