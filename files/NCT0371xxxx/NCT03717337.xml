      This study evaluates success rate of non vital mature anterior teeth with periapical lesion&#xD;
      treated by regenerative endodontic protocol in single visit versus two visit technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized into two groups where treatment will be done either in one visit&#xD;
      including access, disinfection, placing platelet rich plasma as scaffold and restoration or&#xD;
      two visit protocol involving access, disinfection and placing calcium hydroxide as intracanal&#xD;
      medicament in first visit followed by a second visit after 3 weeks involving reopening of the&#xD;
      tooth, removing intracanal medicament and placing platelet rich plasma as scaffold then&#xD;
      restoration. Success rate is defined as absence of subjective signs and symptoms along with&#xD;
      healing of periapical lesion&#xD;

      Title: Evaluation of Success Rate of Non Vital Mature Anterior Teeth with Periapical Lesion&#xD;
      Following Single versus Two Visit Regenerative Treatment Protocol (A Randomized Clinical&#xD;
      Trial) Regenerative endodontics can be defined as biologically based procedures designed to&#xD;
      replace damaged structures, including dentin and root structures, as well as cells of the&#xD;
      pulp-dentin complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of endodontic patients are adults, thus the application of the tissue&#xD;
      engineering concept to mature teeth could provide a biological treatment modality instead of&#xD;
      the conventional one. In fact, several advantages were reported about regenerative procedures&#xD;
      in well developed mature teeth. Reconstitution of the neurovascular system in root canals by&#xD;
      pulp regeneration will provide pulp tissues with an immune system, which will function as the&#xD;
      first line of defense against microbial challenge. Moreover, restoration of pulp dentine&#xD;
      complex will protect the tooth during loading and mastication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different treatment protocols for pulp regeneration were reported in the literature regarding&#xD;
      irrigation (type, concentration and time), intracanal medication, pulpal space barrier,&#xD;
      incorporation and lack of scaffolds (blood clot, PRP,PRF, collagen) as well as recall visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for conducting the research and choice of comparators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple visits protocol has been the commonly used technique in regenerative endodontic&#xD;
      procedures. It involves the placement of intracanal medicaments between visits (calcium&#xD;
      hydroxide and triple antibiotic paste) which have many drawbacks such as difficulty in&#xD;
      removal, tooth discoloration, weakening of the root and tooth loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completing revascularization in one visit has many advantages. First, it reduces the chance&#xD;
      of additional bacterial contamination of the space. Second, a single revascularization&#xD;
      protocol may overcome the problem of poor patient compliance and reduce the number of&#xD;
      appointments needed. Third, it can help to combat potential injury of the tooth and tooth&#xD;
      discoloration Unfortunately, up till the moment it is not clear which protocol is the most&#xD;
      effective. Thus randomized clinical trials are required to provide plausible answers to this&#xD;
      question In the present research the recent single visit regenerative treatment for necrotic&#xD;
      mature teeth will be compared to the conventionally used two visit one&#xD;
