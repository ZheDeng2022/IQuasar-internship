  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an acceptability study to evaluate the gastrointestinal tolerance and compliance over&#xD;
      a seven-day period, of pediatric formula for the dietary management of participants with&#xD;
      short bowel syndrome; intractable malabsorption; preoperative preparation of undernourished&#xD;
      patients; inflammatory bowel disease; total gastrectomy; dysphagia; bowel fistulae; feeding&#xD;
      intolerances, developmental disabilities, disease related malnutrition The acceptability data&#xD;
      from 15 participants will be collected in order to submit an application to the Advisory&#xD;
      Committee on Borderline Substances (ACBS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients well established and stable on a standard enteral tube feed will be changed to a&#xD;
      paediatric formula for a period of seven days. This group will act as their own controls.&#xD;
      Each child will receive for a period of seven days the paediatric formula, a nutritionally&#xD;
      complete standard enteral tube feed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dietitian will determine the feeding regimen on an individual basis and the enteral&#xD;
      formula will be provided via a feeding tube. A baseline questionnaire will be completed by&#xD;
      the dietitian to ensure eligibility of study, current stool patterns or symptoms, current&#xD;
      oral intake and weight at the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parents will complete a week intake chart to monitor how much feed has been consumed each&#xD;
      day and a tolerance diary to review gastrointestinal symptoms at the start and end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
