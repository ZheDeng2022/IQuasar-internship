      Over the past decade, experimental data has suggested a complex and bidirectional interaction&#xD;
      between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the central nervous system (CNS), the so-called&#xD;
      &quot;Gut- Brain axis.&quot; . Changes in the gut microbiota composition may cause alterations in the&#xD;
      gut barrier function and intestinal permeability, affecting not only GI epithelial cells and&#xD;
      immune system, but also the ENS including both neurons and glial cells . The bidirectional&#xD;
      brain-gut-microbiota axis interactions modulate pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. It has&#xD;
      been suggested that the gut microbiota changes associated with intestinal inflammation may&#xD;
      contribute to the initiation of α-syn misfolding. There is a growing number of evidence&#xD;
      confirming that the gut microbiota alterations precede or occur during the course of PD.&#xD;
      Importantly, some genetic risk factors may play a crucial role in the interactions between&#xD;
      the brain-gut-microbiota axis with respect to gut inflammation. It has been also shown that&#xD;
      the methylation status in the SNCA promoter region may affect α-syn expression and the risk&#xD;
      for PD. Therefore, a potential role of the gut microbiota as an epigenetic factor influencing&#xD;
      DNA methylation may be speculated. Moreover, genetic variant of the component of innate&#xD;
      immune system - TREM2 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells) has been reported to&#xD;
      be associated with a higher risk for PD. The ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) has been&#xD;
      shown to increase the risk for dementia in synucleinopathies such as PD. Potentially, ApoE&#xD;
      genotype, by influencing bile acid secretion, could affect the composition of the gut&#xD;
      microbiota to favor the development of organisms triggering misfolding. Moreover, three&#xD;
      single nucleotide polymorphisms in CARD15 gene, known to be associated with Crohn's disease,&#xD;
      have been also shown to be over-expressed in PD patients, supporting the observation that GI&#xD;
      inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of PD.&#xD;

      -  Normal gut microbiota is essential in preventing colonization of the harmful bacteria by&#xD;
           competing with them for vital resources such as food and growth factors .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Another way that gut microbiota can enhance the function of the intestinal barrier is&#xD;
           through protecting and improving epithelial tight junctions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infection and disease can also briefly affect natural gut flora composition and&#xD;
           consequently have harmful effects on the host . Toxins produced by pathogenic&#xD;
           microorganisms and the focal inflammation created by immune responses to them can&#xD;
           increase gut permeability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impaired intestinal barrier function and consequent increased gut permeability can lead to&#xD;
      increased translocation of gut bacteria across the intestinal wall and into the mesenteric&#xD;
      lymphoid tissue. Furthermore, increased permeability of the gut can also increase the&#xD;
      translocation of metabolic products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or neuroactive peptides&#xD;
      created by the bacteria that can alter the activity of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS). Increased exposure of the ENS or mucosal immune cells to&#xD;
      bacteria can provoke an immune response that can lead to release of inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      and activation of the vagus nerve and spinal afferent neurons. Inflammatory cytokines and the&#xD;
      vagal system in turn can modulate the activity of the CNS and ENS.Neuro/immune-active&#xD;
      substances derived from the intestinal lumen can penetrate the gut mucosa, be transported by&#xD;
      blood, cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and affect the CNS. Gut microbiota can influence&#xD;
      CNS function through their ability to synthesize or mimic a range of host-signaling&#xD;
      neuroactive molecules, such as acetylcholine (Ach), catecholamines, gamma-aminobutyric acid&#xD;
      (GABA), histamine, melatonin and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin). 5-HT is crucial in&#xD;
      the regulation of of peristalsis or modulation of sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multicentric neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the&#xD;
      accumulation and aggregation of alfa-synuclein (α-syn) in the substantia nigra in the central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) and in other neural structures. The classical motor symptoms like&#xD;
      bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity and late postural instability result from the death of&#xD;
      dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra. There is also a wide spectrum of non-motor&#xD;
      manifestations involving for example olfactory (loss of smell), gastrointestinal (GI),&#xD;
      cardiovascular and urogenital systems. It has become evident that the different levels of the&#xD;
      brain-gut axis including the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the enteric nervous system&#xD;
      (ENS) may be affected in PD. Recently, it has been also recognized that the brain-gut axis&#xD;
      interactions may be essentially influenced by the gut microbiota. On the one hand,&#xD;
      dysregulation of the brain-gut-microbiota axis in PD may result in GI dysfunction, which is&#xD;
      present in over 80% of PD subjects . On the other hand, this dysregulation may also&#xD;
      significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of PD itself, supporting the hypothesis that the&#xD;
      pathological process is spread from the gut to the brain .&#xD;
&#xD;
      GUT MICROBIOTA AND PARKINSON'S DISEASE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decade, experimental data has suggested a complex and bidirectional interaction&#xD;
      between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the central nervous system (CNS), the so-called&#xD;
      &quot;Gut- Brain axis.&quot; . Changes in the gut microbiota composition may cause alterations in the&#xD;
      gut barrier function and intestinal permeability, affecting not only GI epithelial cells and&#xD;
      immune system, but also the ENS including both neurons and glial cells . The bidirectional&#xD;
      brain-gut-microbiota axis interactions modulate pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. It has&#xD;
      been suggested that the gut microbiota changes associated with intestinal inflammation may&#xD;
      contribute to the initiation of α-syn misfolding. There is a growing number of evidence&#xD;
      confirming that the gut microbiota alterations precede or occur during the course of PD.&#xD;
      However, the causal relationship between the microbiota changes and the pathogenesis of PD&#xD;
      remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interesting concept of molecular mimicry involving the microbiota in neurodegeneration&#xD;
      has been also proposed. Indeed, Friedland suggested that bacterial proteins may elicit&#xD;
      cross-seeded misfolding, inflammation and oxidative stress, and cellular toxicity in&#xD;
      neurodegeneration, initiating or otherwise influencing the development of PD, Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease and other related disorders. Pathways of molecular mimicry processes induced by&#xD;
      bacterial amyloid may involve TLR2/1, C14, and NFκB among others. Priming of the innate&#xD;
      immune system by the microbiota (residing in the gut and oral/nasal cavities) may enhance the&#xD;
      inflammatory response to cerebral amyloids such as α-syn. Trudler et al postulated that&#xD;
      cerebral amyloid may mimic viral or bacterial infection resulting in glial cell activation&#xD;
      through TLRs. Specifically, it has been documented that neuroinflammation in PD is associated&#xD;
      with upregulation of TLR2 signaling and activation of microglia. TLR2, playing an important&#xD;
      role in the regulation of intestinal barrier integrity, has been also found to activate&#xD;
      microglial cells in the CNS. It has been suggested that the peripheral immune response&#xD;
      characterized by the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-8 in&#xD;
      the serum induces a disruption of the blood-brain barrier and promotes microglia-mediated&#xD;
      inflammation and neurotoxicity. In a germ-free animal model, it has been found that the gut&#xD;
      microbiota influences the blood-brain barrier permeability associated with reduced expression&#xD;
      of the tight junction proteins in a homological way as it affects the intestinal epithelial&#xD;
      barrier. Very recently, Sui et al proved that a bidirectional transport of α-syn into and out&#xD;
      of the brain by the blood-brain barrier is possible and suggested that LPS-induced&#xD;
      inflammation could increase α-syn uptake by the brain by disrupting the blood-brain barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an animal model of PD, peripherally-induced inflammation was shown to induce the&#xD;
      microglial complement pathway to damage dopaminergic neurons. Several studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that pro-inflammatory factors associated with chronic GI diseases induce brain&#xD;
      inflammation and the death of dopaminergic neurons and could eventually be responsible for&#xD;
      parkinsonism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, some genetic risk factors may play a crucial role in the interactions between&#xD;
      the brain-gut-microbiota axis with respect to gut inflammation. It has been also shown that&#xD;
      the methylation status in the SNCA promoter region may affect α-syn expression and the risk&#xD;
      for PD. Therefore, a potential role of the gut microbiota as an epigenetic factor influencing&#xD;
      DNA methylation may be speculated. Moreover, genetic variant of the component of innate&#xD;
      immune system - TREM2 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells) has been reported to&#xD;
      be associated with a higher risk for PD. The ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) has been&#xD;
      shown to increase the risk for dementia in synucleinopathies such as PD. Potentially, ApoE&#xD;
      genotype, by influencing bile acid secretion, could affect the composition of the gut&#xD;
      microbiota to favor the development of organisms triggering misfolding. Moreover, three&#xD;
      single nucleotide polymorphisms in CARD15 gene, known to be associated with Crohn's disease,&#xD;
      have been also shown to be over-expressed in PD patients, supporting the observation that GI&#xD;
      inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of PD.&#xD;
