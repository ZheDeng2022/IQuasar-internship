  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this investigation is to compare the standard of general anesthesia used in these&#xD;
      patients with these short-acting local anesthetics (Chloroprocain (Ampres®) and Prilocain&#xD;
      (Takipril®)) for spinal anesthesia as well as to report the patient centered outcome of&#xD;
      postoperative delirium and neurocognitive disorder. In accordance to current evidence&#xD;
      regarding the occurrence of postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive deficit,&#xD;
      patients are to be screened daily for delirium up to the fifth postoperative day if in&#xD;
      hospital, or till the first postoperative day after ambulatory surgery and for neurocognitive&#xD;
      disorder 1 year following the surgery. To detect delirium the Nu-DESC (Nursing Delirium&#xD;
      Screening Scale) will be used as a validated scoring systems to ensure the highest&#xD;
      sensitivity in delirium identification. CANTAB battery will be used for assessment of&#xD;
      neurocognitive disorder. This is a neuropsychological testing (computer-based (I-Pad)&#xD;
      [Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery - CANTAB connect and parameters from the&#xD;
      item list], as well as the subjective / by proxy Assessment of Cognitive Limitations. It is&#xD;
      essential to perform the appropriate cognitive performance tests not only on operative&#xD;
      patients but also on a non-surgical cohort, using currently established models of calculation&#xD;
      in postoperative cognitive deficits and a control group generated from non-surgical patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A conventional spinal anesthesia with long-acting drugs (such as bupivacaine) can lead to&#xD;
      delays in postoperative recovery, mobilization, delays in discharge from recovery room and in&#xD;
      ambulatory surgery. Short-acting local anesthetics (Chloroprocain (Ampres®) and Prilocain&#xD;
      (Takipril®)) might be beneficial in short duration surgery under spinal anesthesia and could&#xD;
      improve patients' acceptance for neuroaxial anesthesia as it might improve early recovery and&#xD;
      early mobilization. Time to first oral nutritional intake/postoperative nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      (PONV), time to discharge from post-anesthesia recovery unit and time to discharge home after&#xD;
      ambulatory operation might be reduced and might reduce incidence of postoperative delirium&#xD;
      and neurocognitive disorder after peripheral surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to retrospectively examine a group of surgical patients for the purpose of a&#xD;
      comparative descriptive collective. This comparison collective is required for various&#xD;
      questions, in particular influencing factors with regard to the postoperative outcomes&#xD;
      delirium, neurocognitive disorder and mortality. Only the routine data is used and no&#xD;
      additional surveys are performed on these patients. Inclusion criteria such as the study&#xD;
      cohort and additionally the inclusion criterion: Spinal anesthesia with another local&#xD;
      anesthetic&#xD;
