      Effects of serotonin 2A/1A receptor stimulation by psilocybin on mood and emotion processing&#xD;
      in major depressive disorder: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the world's greatest contributor to the global&#xD;
      burden of disease and MDD affects around 17% of the Swiss population (Tomonaga et al. 2013).&#xD;
      It is a chronic condition and can cause the affected person to suffer greatly and function&#xD;
      poorly at work, at school and in the family. More than 1'000 suicides were recorded in&#xD;
      Switzerland in 2014, about 90% of these fatalities were related to depression or other&#xD;
      psychiatric problems. Suicide is the second leading cause of death in individuals 15-24 years&#xD;
      of age (Insel &amp; Charney 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current pharmacotherapies, including monoaminergic-acting antidepressants, require prolonged&#xD;
      administration (weeks if not months) for clinical improvement. This lag time, as well as a&#xD;
      high non-response rate, emphasizes the need for better and faster-acting antidepressant&#xD;
      medications. However, psychopharmacological research has largely failed to produce novel and&#xD;
      more efficacious treatment options for MDD since decades. Advanced pharmaceutical&#xD;
      antidepressants should ideally facilitate the psychotherapeutic process for patients, reduce&#xD;
      the time onset of antidepressant efficacy, and prime neuroplastic adaptations relevant to&#xD;
      symptom improvement. Such novel therapeutics are much needed and would address this&#xD;
      detrimental public health problem, particularly in treatment-resistant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early clinical studies using the psychotropic compound psilocybin&#xD;
      (4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine) as an adjunct in psychotherapy reported a&#xD;
      significant improvement of clinical symptoms in depression and anxiety disorder (Leuner 1961,&#xD;
      1981). Psilocybin is the main psychoactive principle of the group of hallucinogenic fungi&#xD;
      (Hofmann 1968), commonly known as magic mushrooms, and acts as partial agonist at cortical&#xD;
      and sub-cortical serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptors. At moderate doses, psilocybin&#xD;
      produces a dream-like state of consciousness (Kraehenmann et al. 2016) characterized by&#xD;
      perceptual alterations, enhanced mood, facilitated autobiographic memory recollection, and a&#xD;
      change of perspective on the self (Leuner 1981; Studerus et al. 2011). Recent clinical&#xD;
      studies applying placebo-controlled designs support and extend these early findings by&#xD;
      showing that a single dose of psilocybin leads to a fast and sustained reduction in anxiety&#xD;
      and depression as well as an improvement of quality of life in advanced cancer patients&#xD;
      (Griffiths 2015, Grob et al. 2011). Furthermore, a recent open-label feasibility study showed&#xD;
      rapid-onset, sustained symptom improvements over 3 weeks in a small sample of&#xD;
      treatment-resistant depressed patients following two psilocybin treatment sessions&#xD;
      (Carhart-Harris et al. 2016). Accumulating evidence from pharmacological and neuroimaging&#xD;
      studies suggests that psilocybin may produce its antidepressant effects via activation of&#xD;
      5-HT2A receptors located in prefrontal-limbic structures that are also implicated in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of depression (Kraehenmann &amp; Vollenweider et al. 2015; Vollenweider und&#xD;
      Kometer 2010; Disner et al. 2011). In addition, molecular studies suggest that the enduring&#xD;
      symptom improvement after a single dose of psilocybin may be mediated through downstream&#xD;
      effects on the glutamate system and a subsequent activation of neuroplastic factors such as&#xD;
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Catlow et al. 2013, Barre et al. 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present clinical trial aims at investigating the putative antidepressant effects of a&#xD;
      single moderate dose of psilocybin (0.215 mg/kg) in patients suffering from MDD by applying a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. The specific aims of this project are:&#xD;
      1. To investigate whether psilocybin in combination with short-term focused psychotherapy&#xD;
      will reduce core symptoms in patients with MDD. 2. Using functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI) to longitudinally assess whether a single dose of psilocybin will post-acutely&#xD;
      change the negative emotion processing bias in patients with MDD and whether the change in&#xD;
      emotion processing bias will predict subsequent symptom improvement. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will analyze whether psilocybin will lead to sustained changes in functional&#xD;
      neuronal network connectivity (FC), e.g. in amygdala-prefrontal FC. 3. To investigate whether&#xD;
      psilocybin will increase BDNF plasma concentration and whether the change in BDNF is related&#xD;
      to changes in fMRI markers and the subsequent mood improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent reviews indicate that impaired neuroplasticity is at the core of the pathophysiology&#xD;
      moods and stress-related disorders. Current available antidepressants have been developed&#xD;
      with the aim of providing symptom relief rather than targeting neuroplastic impairments. In&#xD;
      contrast to this, the present proposal builds on promising new findings that single dose of&#xD;
      psilocybin, presumably via a 5-HT2A receptor driven glutamatergic mechanism, leads to a rapid&#xD;
      enhancement in neuronal resilience and a to a change in the function of neuronal networks&#xD;
      underlying depressive symptoms and behavior. Targeting neuroplasticity with such novel&#xD;
      approaches appears to be important for reversing cognitive schemata and emotion processing&#xD;
      biases, fostering enduring improvements in mood and cognitive flexibility (Krystal et al.&#xD;
      2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected value: this is the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      (RCT) of psilocybin treatment in MDD. Using state-of-the art behavioral, neuroimaging, and&#xD;
      neuroplasticity methodology, the results of this study will help elucidate urgently needed&#xD;
      new treatment mechanisms in MDD. Should it turn out that a single moderate dose of psilocybin&#xD;
      vs. placebo in conjunction with psychotherapy may rapidly and sustainedly reduce depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, this will be a major breakthrough in finding a novel and fast acting treatment&#xD;
      strategy in depressed patients. Therefore, the results of this study will have high impact on&#xD;
      the field of pharmacological research into novel antidepressant medication.&#xD;
