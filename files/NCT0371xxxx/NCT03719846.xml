    <textblock>
      This study will provide urine cycles from both pregnant and not pregnant volunteers to&#xD;
      maintain the SPD sample bank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study volunteers, seeking to conceive will be provided with Clearblue Ovulation product to&#xD;
      help them pinpoint their most fertile time and aid conception. All volunteers will provide&#xD;
      daily early morning urine samples throughout the study period and keep a study diary of&#xD;
      menses and pregnancy test results for 1 menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples will be received in the clinical laboratory and aliquoted into 2.25ml amounts&#xD;
      at stored at -80˚C until required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also gather optional information from volunteers regarding a woman's general&#xD;
      health and stress levels when trying to conceive. This will be used to study the relationship&#xD;
      between general health, stress and conception.&#xD;

      This study will provide urine cycles from both pregnant and not pregnant volunteers to&#xD;
      maintain the SPD sample bank.&#xD;

      hormones related to pregnancy and fertility, then aliquoted into 2.25ml amounts at stored in&#xD;
      the SPD BioBank at -80˚C until required for product development or evaluation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also gather optional information from volunteers regarding a woman's general&#xD;
