      The NanoSense study is a multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, observational,&#xD;
      feasibility, non-significant risk study. The NanoSense study will enroll up to 500 subjects&#xD;
      in up to 10 centers in order to collect data which includes at least 150 heart failure&#xD;
      hospitalizations in participating subjects.The duration of the NanoSense study is expected to&#xD;
      be 2 years. The study device is the Wearable Congestive Heart Failure Management System&#xD;
      (WCHFS, also known as SimpleSENSE)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NanoSense is a data collection study to develop a multi-sensor algorithm to predict worsening&#xD;
      Heart Failure (HF). Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria and agree to participate in&#xD;
      the study will enter the informed consent process in which the subject will be informed about&#xD;
      the research study, the voluntary nature of the research and all attendant risks and&#xD;
      benefits. Once the subject has been informed and all question answered, the subject will be&#xD;
      asked to sign an informed consent document (approved by the local Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board). At enrollment, data about subject demographics, cardiac disease history, and&#xD;
      comorbidities will be collected. The subject vital signs, blood labs (as available; if an&#xD;
      N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is not available, one will be ordered&#xD;
      to coincide with the next lab samples), HF medications and HF assessment measurements will be&#xD;
      made and recorded. Subjects will be given a diary to record daily weights, diuretics changes,&#xD;
      and weekly HF status. The subject will be fitted with a Nanowear Wearable Congestive Heart&#xD;
      Failure System (WCHFS) and educated on the use of the system with attention to proper fit and&#xD;
      changing or charging the battery daily depending on the type of battery used. Subjects who&#xD;
      have a pacemaker or Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) will undergo pacemaker/ICD&#xD;
      interrogation while wearing the device to assure that there are no electrical signals&#xD;
      detected that may interfere with pacemaker or ICD function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be asked to wear the device for approximately 12 hours daily including 2&#xD;
      hours prior to sleep and 2 hours after awakening. The follow-up period will be 90 days. At&#xD;
      visit 2, the clinical assessment will be repeated and recorded. The device will be retrieved&#xD;
      from the subject. In the event that a subject is unable to travel to the investigator's site,&#xD;
      the subject will be asked to mail the device back to the sponsor with use of a prepaid&#xD;
      mailing package that will be delivered to the subject. Data may be obtained by phone if the&#xD;
      subject is unable or unwilling to return for visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final contact will be made to the subject at 30 days following visit 2 to determine whether&#xD;
      there were any adverse effects that were not previously recognized that may be related to&#xD;
      their participation in the study.&#xD;
