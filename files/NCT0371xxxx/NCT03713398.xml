      Interventions that address criminogenic risk factors, such as Thinking for a Change (T4C),&#xD;
      are not used with prisoners with serious mental illness (SMI) because of the neurocognitive&#xD;
      and social impairments associated with SMI. This study examines the effectiveness of T4C with&#xD;
      a modified delivery system designed specifically to address the unique needs of persons with&#xD;
      SMI in prison, including improving impulsivity, criminal attitudes, and interpersonal problem&#xD;
      solving (treatment targets) and levels of aggression, and the amount of behavioral&#xD;
      infractions and time spent in administrative segregation in prison (outcomes).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interventions are urgently needed to improve the delivery and impact of mental health&#xD;
      services for persons with serious mental illnesses (SMI) in prison. Treatments addressing the&#xD;
      symptoms of mental illness form a critical component of the continuum of services needed by&#xD;
      prisoners with SMI. However, a growing body of literature shows that mental health treatments&#xD;
      need to be combined with treatments that directly address criminogenic risk factors (i.e.,&#xD;
      those factors most closely associated with criminal activities). Despite promising evidence,&#xD;
      interventions that address criminogenic risk factors, such as Thinking for a Change (T4C),&#xD;
      are not used with prisoners with SMI because of the neurocognitive and social impairments&#xD;
      associated with SMI. This study examines the effectiveness of T4C with a modified delivery&#xD;
      system designed specifically to address the unique needs of persons with SMI in prison. This&#xD;
      small-scale randomized controlled trail (RCT) explores the potential effectiveness of T4C-SMI&#xD;
      towards improving impulsivity, criminal attitudes, and interpersonal problem solving&#xD;
      (treatment targets) and levels of aggression, and the amount of behavioral infractions and&#xD;
      time spent in administrative segregation in prison (outcomes). The study will also examine&#xD;
      whether the treatment targets for T4C-SMI mediate the intervention's impact on outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal is to grow the evidence-base for interventions with the capacity to&#xD;
      improve prison and community-reentry outcomes for persons with SMI. This study will provide&#xD;
      the data needed to implement a rigorous RCT in a future study and supports NIMH's mission to&#xD;
      develop innovative interventions in mental health services.&#xD;

    <description>T4C-SMI entails a 25-session, manualized intervention that is delivered in a closed-group format at least twice a week over a three-month period. The intervention curriculum includes three modules: nine sessions on social skills training, five sessions on cognitive restructuring activities, and ten sessions on problem-solving methods. Participants assigned to T4C-SMI receive this intervention in addition to any other prison mental health services that they are otherwise eligible to receive during their incarceration.</description>

The second component of T4C-MI is the Targeted Service Delivery Approach (TSDA) that this research team developed for use during the delivery of T4C to compensate for the impact of the neurocognitive and social impairments associated with mental illness on participants' ability to fully engage in and understand T4C's intervention materials.</description>

        <title>Change in Overall Criminal Attitudes Score</title>
        <description>The Measure of Criminal Attitudes and Associates (MCAA) Part B is a 46-item measure. Responses are recorded in an agree/disagree format. MCAA includes four scales: attitudes toward violence, sentiments of entitlement, antisocial intent, and associates. Scores range from 0 to 46. Lower scores indicate lower levels of criminal attitudes.</description>

            <description>The research intervention is Thinking for Change for prisoners with mental illness (T4C-MI). This intervention has two components. The first component is Thinking for a Change (T4C), a CBT based group intervention that includes three treatment modules delivered over the course of 25-sessions in a closed-group format to 8-12 people up to twice a week over 12-14 weeks. The second component of T4C-MI is the Targeted Service Delivery Approach (TSDA) that this research team developed for use during the delivery of T4C to compensate for the impact of the neurocognitive and social impairments associated with mental illness on participants' ability to fully engage in and understand T4C's intervention materials.</description>

        <description>Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) is a 30 item self-report measure. Items scored on a 4-point Likert scale. It is comprised of six subscales including attention, cognitive instability, perseverance, self-control, motor impulsiveness, and cognitive complexity. The total score ranges from 30 to 120. Lower scores indicate lower levels of impulsiveness.</description>
