  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PATH for PWS is a study to help researchers better understand serious medical events in PWS&#xD;
      over a 4-year period, as well as evaluate how PWS-related behaviors change over time. The&#xD;
      data from this study is intended to inform the development and clinical trial design of&#xD;
      potential new treatments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every 6 months, participants or their caregivers will be asked to update online surveys about&#xD;
      medical problems and serious medical events, as well as provide information about conditions&#xD;
      and behaviors often associated with PWS such as hyperphagia. Because this is an observational&#xD;
      study, no study drug will be provided and no visits to a doctor or clinic are required.&#xD;
