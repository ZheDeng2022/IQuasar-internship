    <textblock>
      Given the popularity that LISA technique has gainig in worldwide neonatal units, the lack of&#xD;
      evidence regarding its premedication is becoming even more relevant to provide the best care&#xD;
      to premature infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of this clinical trial is to establish the best premedication for LISA procedure&#xD;
      considering neonatal pain assessed with premature infants pain scale, salivary cortisol&#xD;
      levels as an indicator of stress and crSO2 values as indicators of cerebral oxygenation.&#xD;
      Moreover, we aim to verify if sucrose 24% given orally is an effective tool for pain&#xD;
      management in preterm neonates also in more invasive procedure, comparable to pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last decades, one of the most relevant interventions which have led to a significant&#xD;
      increase in preterm infants survival rate is the introduction of surfactant replacement&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, given the trend towards the less invasive respiratory support also for low and&#xD;
      extremely low gestational age infants, the use of intubation and prolonged mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation has been minimized. In fact, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has been proved to&#xD;
      be closely related to prolonged intubation and it is one of the main problem clinicians must&#xD;
      face with. This is the reason why the INSURE technique was introduced as a routine care&#xD;
      procedure in neonatal units. In fact, INSURE is the acronym for INtubation - SURfactant&#xD;
      administration-Extubation. This technique ensures the baby the positive effects of surfactant&#xD;
      on respiratory mechanics minimizing the intubation length. However, the INSURE procedure&#xD;
      still involves intubation, meaning that it is still invansive and some infants cannot be&#xD;
      extubated immediately afterward. Thus, lately new technique for surfactant administration has&#xD;
      been introduced. The most extensively studied are the so-called less invasive surfactant&#xD;
      administration (LISA) and minimally invasive surfactant therapy (MIST). With these&#xD;
      procedures, infants receive non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&#xD;
      treatment, while being given intratracheal surfactant via a feeding tube or small catheter.&#xD;
      Although the paucity of literature available to date, for extremely preterm infants LISA has&#xD;
      shown to be able to reduce the need for intubation, ventilation and supplemental oxygen when&#xD;
      compared with the standard technique of rescue intubation and ventilation. In comparison with&#xD;
      the INSURE procedure the less invasive surfactant administration was associated with a&#xD;
      reduced need for ventilation and reduced risk of BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if this technique can provide the gentlest treatment presently available in&#xD;
      administering surfactant, it implies laryngoscopy and somewhat discomfort. The importance of&#xD;
      proper care in managing preterm infants, especially during painful procedures, has been well&#xD;
      demonstrated and all the caregivers have to be even more committed to this aspect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain in neonates is usually assessed through pain scales and using clinical parameters such&#xD;
      as pulse oximetry (SatO2) and Heart Rate (HR). Since pain scores are subject to caregivers'&#xD;
      individual perception and parameters can be influenced by other clinical underlying&#xD;
      condition, especially in preterm infants, determination of cortisol concentration could be a&#xD;
      useful alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cortisol is the major glucocorticoid produced in the adrenal cortex. Cortisol production has&#xD;
      a circadian rhythm, with levels peaking in the early morning and dropping to lowest values at&#xD;
      night. Levels rise independently of circadian rhythm in response to stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is convincing evidence that providing neonates with oral glucose during painful&#xD;
      procedure reduces the stress related to the procedure itself, without serious side effects or&#xD;
      harms related to this intervention. Different concentrations of glucose solution are&#xD;
      currently available and have been used in neonatal field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is still high debate on the need to provide sedation to babies undergoing&#xD;
      LISA, and lack of evidence available regarding the optimal premedication. Some Authors report&#xD;
      to use LISA technique without any sort of sedation, while others perform it with the same&#xD;
      sedation they use for INSURE method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, there is lack of evidence in regard to the effects of this method on cerebral&#xD;
      oxygenation, which can be easily monitored using NIRS (near infrared spectroscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since LISA technique's popularity is increasing, we believe that there is urgent need to&#xD;
      better clarify how this approach can be performed in the gentlest way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given these premises, we indeed speculate that oral glucose as a premedication for LISA&#xD;
      procedure could be an intriguing alternative to standard sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of this clinical trial is to establish the best premedication for LISA procedure&#xD;
      considering neonatal pain assessed with premature infants pain scale, salivary cortisol&#xD;
      levels as an indicator of stress and crSO2 values as indicators of cerebral oxygenation.&#xD;
      Moreover, we aim to verify if sucrose 24% given orally is an effective tool for pain&#xD;
      management in preterm neonates also in more invasive procedure, comparable to pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the efficacy of non-pharmacological sedation will lead to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a gentler approach for preterm babies and a better understanding of LISA technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an improvement in pain management, where sucrose can be applied for several painful&#xD;
           procedures of different degrees of invasiveness, not only in the mildest ones&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a significant reduction in prolonged ventilation due to surfactant administration's&#xD;
           pharmacological sedation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a safer use of surfactant administration also in level II neonatal unit, since the risk&#xD;
           for subsequent need of invasive respiratory support due to excessive sedation would be&#xD;
           considerably reduced&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a significant economic impact on public health care system, for the inferior cost of&#xD;
           oral sucrose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a relevant decrease of the onset and subsequent public cost of BPD, if data about LISA&#xD;
           technique capability to reduce it will be further confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verify which is the best premedication for LISA procedure to reduce neonatal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;

           after LISA procedure&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Verify the influence of premedication on adverse events' occurrence during LISA&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Verify the effects of different pre-medications on the ease in administering surfactant&#xD;
