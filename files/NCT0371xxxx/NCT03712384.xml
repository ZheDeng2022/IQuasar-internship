    <textblock>
      A growing qualitative literature about personal recovery process in mental disorders emerges.&#xD;
      However in Anorexia Nervosa (AN), it remains few understood, especially in severe AN during&#xD;
      adolescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study seeks to enhance understanding of recovery from AN in France and support the&#xD;
      dissemination of the PR paradigm among the French mental health community working with AN, as&#xD;
      a complement to the medical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualitative research according to Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) method was&#xD;
      conducted .Five young women hospitalized ten years before for a severe AN during their&#xD;
      adolescence were interviewed with a semi-structured face-to-face interview on recovery&#xD;
      process.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is one of the most severe mental disorders with a mortality and high&#xD;
      risk of developing chronicity. Lifetime prevalence is evaluated among women between 1.2% and&#xD;
      2.2%, with the higher incidence during adolescence. Recovery process remains poorly&#xD;
      understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In scientific literature, recovery process of mental disorders can be seen in two different&#xD;
      ways: the medical and the personal recovery (PR). The medical recovery is based on objective&#xD;
      criteria, including cure (symptom disappearance), remission (symptom suspension) or&#xD;
      therapeutic response (change of values after treatment). This medical recovery is generally&#xD;
      studied in quantitative outcome studies. The experiential or PR is based on first person&#xD;
      qualitative research or consensus methods, starting from patients' struggle for regaining&#xD;
      place in their own recovery. It has become the paradigm orientation of mental health policy&#xD;
      in anglophone countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent systematic review summeries relapse, remission or recovery criteria used in a AN&#xD;
      outcome studies in 1-weigh measurement only; 2-symptoms reported only; 3-on both. In addition&#xD;
      to weigh, other criteria are noticed: menstruations, psychological and behavioral features,&#xD;
      disparities of time remission/recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite numerous quantitative studies, reasons for recovery, relapse or following&#xD;
      struggle steal unclear. Medical framework is sometimes considered as reductive Moreover,&#xD;
      those researches usually focus on risk factors, hiding protector's factors that are central&#xD;
      for supporting recovery. Furthermore, symptom improvement is not always priority of&#xD;
      patients(9), while improvement might happen despite symptoms persistence. Discrepancies are&#xD;
      described in the negotiated link clinicians-patients: patient might wait for more singular&#xD;
      and subjective approach whereas clinicians would be more invested in objective and rigorous&#xD;
      features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent systematic review offers a theorical framework to study PR in mental disorders. It&#xD;
      is defines as an active, individual, unique, non-linearn, multidimensional and gradual&#xD;
      process. It can be described as phase or stage, as struggle, as a life-changing experience or&#xD;
      even as a trial or error process. It may be structured by a turning point, after when there&#xD;
      are no turning back. It is aided by supporting and healing environment, and might occur&#xD;
      without cure. Starting from first person narratives of mental disorders recovery, five&#xD;
      factors supporting recovery are described: connectedness, hope and optimism about the future,&#xD;
      identity, meaning in life, empowerment. One meta-ethnography review was published on&#xD;
      qualitative research about PR in AN, concerning 8 studies. It provides elements on process of&#xD;
      change, factors supporting PR and notion of empowerment and self-reconciliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, most of PR studies come from USA, UK, Australia and Canada. Further research are&#xD;
      needed to ground PR including cultural context. In France, AN PR has been rarely studied.&#xD;
      These study tries to enhance understanding AN recovery in French context, to support&#xD;
      implementation of PR paradigm among French mental health AN community; complementary to&#xD;
      medical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study questions are: how people who suffered of severe AN and experienced hospitalization&#xD;
      during adolescence feel and make sense to their recovery?&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS This study is a qualitative research with IPA, supplemented by quotation of ICD 10&#xD;
      criteria. We reported COREQ 32 guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and participants IPA recommends homogeneous and short sampling so as to better&#xD;
      appreciate convergences and divergences of phenomena. To maximize homogenization, very&#xD;
      precise criteria (presented in box 1) were first chosen in order to focus on studied&#xD;
      phenomena with in-depth way, before opening to wider study on AN recovery. Recruitment was&#xD;
      restrained to the same hospital (Institut Mutualiste Montsouris) at the same year of&#xD;
      hospitalization, so as to homogenize experience of care. Period of 10 years was chosen for&#xD;
      being widely beyond largest literature mean criteria of medical recovery fixed at seven&#xD;
      years, to get some distance with recovery process.&#xD;
