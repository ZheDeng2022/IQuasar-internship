  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted to determine the therapeutic role of flax seed for Poly cystic ovary&#xD;
      syndrome. A sample of 100 subjects were collected. The subjects were from various age group&#xD;
      ranging from 18 to 45 years. Subjects showing the signs, symptoms, biochemical, and clinical&#xD;
      parameters of the diseases were included in the study. Three different quantities of flax&#xD;
      seed were introduced to the subjects for 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the nutritional status of Poly cystic Ovary Syndrome patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the therapeutic role of flax seed for PCOS patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and method: The level of follicle stimulating hormone, leutinizing hormone, sex&#xD;
      hormone binding globulin, serum prolactin, ultrasound were analyzed. To determine the side&#xD;
      effects of the flax seed, the liver-enzymatic, lipid profile, and renal tests were conducted.&#xD;

      Material and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data were collected from the Allied Hospital. All Females of ages 18 to 45 years, having&#xD;
      PCOS attending the OPD of Allied Hospital was taken as the study population. Efficacy trials&#xD;
      were conducted on the patients of PCOS, including females of age 18-45 years. They were&#xD;
      divided into different groups (as per no. of selected treatments along with the control). Ten&#xD;
      subjects left the study and were replaced. The project was approved by the ethical review&#xD;
      committee.The feeding study was conducted with the cooperation of Allied Hospital. The study&#xD;
      protocol was discussed with medical professionals and finalized after through technical&#xD;
      suggestions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of subjects and Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were assorted randomly into four groups, 25 in each, namely control (T0),&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total 100 female subjects were included in the study as under A) Control: To: 25 B)&#xD;
      Experimental groups (PCOS): 75&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. T1: 25&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. T2: 25&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. T3: 25&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All females of age 18 to 45 having PCOS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women showing the presence of two out of three features (Oligo- or anovulation,&#xD;
      hyper-androgenism, or poly cystic ovaries (Ovarian volume &gt;10cc, 12 or more peripherally&#xD;
      located follicles 2-9 mm in diameter or hypo-echoic enlarged ovaries with hyper-echoic&#xD;
      central stroma in USG). Patients on Metformin (used for insulin resistance)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Females under 18 and above 45 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those on any other medical therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant and lactating women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those with a history of allergy to flax seed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women on anti-platelet and fibrinolytic drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women showing signs of PCOS but showing normal ovaries on ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was literature review based intervention study. The selected population for intervention&#xD;
      purposes was studied twice, i.e. before and after the intervention of the selected&#xD;
      nutraceutical. The same subjects were studied once again after one month of stopping the&#xD;
      intake of selected nutraceutical. The change in results has confirmed the effects of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This has been divided into four phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase-1:Assessment of the nutritional Status in PCOS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase -2:Development of nutraceutical (flaxseed sachets)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Phase -3:Intervention to study the effect of selected nutraceutical&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Phase-4:Blood Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           The procedure adopted in each of the above phases is explained as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase-1: Assessment of the nutritional status of selected patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           This was done in Allied Hospital, patients attending OPD of gynecology ward was assessed&#xD;
           for nutritional status. Following parameters were studied for this purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Family History&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical signs (thyroid gland, height, weight, skin, hair, breasts, belly, and BMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Menstrual cycle detail (menarche, frequency, duration, and severity)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History of dysmenorrhea&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ferriman-Gall way scoring for hirsutism&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Marital status, parity, and difficulty in conception&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase -2: Development of Nutraceutical (flaxseed sachets)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procurement of raw materials Preparation of flax seed powder Preparation of flax seed&#xD;
           sachets&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase-3: Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
           An acceptable number of human volunteers were selected keeping in view all ethical&#xD;
           considerations. (25 in each group)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Control group (To)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Flaxseed (5 g) xTTS = 15 g/day (T1)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Flaxseed (6.6 g) x TTS = 20 g/day (T2)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Flaxseed (8.3 g) xTTS = 25 g/day (T3)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The flaxseed powder from the selected treatments was given daily for a period of 12&#xD;
           weeks. The dietary history of the subjects was monitored with the help of a Food Diary&#xD;
           on a weekly basis. Education/counselling were provided to the patients for necessary&#xD;
           compliance with the restricted diet for PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase-4: Blood Analysis and Ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
           After three months of intervention blood tests: follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),&#xD;
           Luteinizing hormone (LH) thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), serum prolactin, and&#xD;
           ultrasound will be repeated.&#xD;

           following the radio-immunological method.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thyroid stimulating hormone&#xD;
&#xD;
           The thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level in patients fed with flaxseed powder was&#xD;
           performed to determine the thyroid gland functioning by following the third-generation&#xD;
           non-isotopic method.&#xD;

&#xD;
           The high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was assessed by HDL-Cholesterol precipitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Triglyceride&#xD;
&#xD;
           The triglyceride in the collected serum was determined by liquid triglyceride (GPO-PAP)&#xD;
           method.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Renal Function Tests&#xD;
&#xD;
           Urea&#xD;
&#xD;
           The flax seed fed patients were diagnosed with urea content by GLDH method with the help&#xD;
           of commercial kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;
           The blood creatinine of the patients fed on flax seed powder was determined by the Jaffe&#xD;
           method using creatinine commercial kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follicles present in ovaries&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ultrasound of the ovaries was carried out to check the number of follicles present in&#xD;
           the ovaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Size of the ovaries&#xD;
&#xD;
           The size of the ovaries of patients fed with flax seed powder was also checked in&#xD;
           ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fasting blood glucose level&#xD;
&#xD;
           The blood sample was taken to check the fasting blood glucose level. The sample was&#xD;
           taken eight hours after eating. Fasting blood glucose level as determined by glucose dye&#xD;
           oxido-reductase mediator reaction which is specific for glucose by glucometer Accuchek&#xD;
           active.&#xD;

&#xD;
           Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data were subjected to statistical analysis by using the SPSS statistical package,&#xD;
