  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase II open-label, single-arm 36-week clinical trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of eltrombopag in patients with poor graft function (PGF) after&#xD;
      allogeneic-hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (allo-HSCT).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of eltrombopag for poor graft&#xD;
      function on overall hematologic response (partial and complete), as determined by platelet,&#xD;
      hemoglobin and neutrophil counts by 16 weeks after the initiation of eltrombopag.&#xD;
