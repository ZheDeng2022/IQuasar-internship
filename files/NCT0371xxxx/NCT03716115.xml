      The TAME study will evaluate four new approaches which will be compared against the standard&#xD;
      care currently in use in the treatment of malnutrition enteropathy in children with severe&#xD;
      acute malnutrition. A high pathogen burden causes damage to the intestinal mucosa which&#xD;
      exacerbates nutritional impairment and leads to further susceptibility to infection and&#xD;
      impaired epithelial regeneration. Enteropathy is characterised by multiple epithelial&#xD;
      breaches, microbial translocation from gut lumen to systemic circulation and systemic&#xD;
      inflammation.The trial will evaluate the potential impact of four interventions (colostrum,&#xD;
      N-acetyl glucosamine, teduglutide, and budesonide) given for 14 days, which aim at mucosal&#xD;
      restoration. The trial will determine if repairing damage to the small intestinal mucosa&#xD;
      leads to the reduction of systemic inflammation and thus lessening the nutritional&#xD;
      impairment, and so if this contributes to the reduction of mortality in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Zambia only, endoscopic biopsies and confocal laser endomicroscopy will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate response and confirm safety at a mucosal level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying an agent or agents which contribute most to mucosal healing will then ultimately&#xD;
      lead to further large phase 3 trial in which the agent(s) will be further evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial also anticipates to gain a more in depth understanding of pathophysiology and may&#xD;
      identify where current management strategies of treating malnutrition enteropathy in children&#xD;
      are failing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last two decades, three key developments in the approach to treatment have improved&#xD;
      the outcome of SAM: standardised management protocols, ready to use therapeutic food (RUTF),&#xD;
      and community management of acute malnutrition (CMAM). CMAM has four components, namely,&#xD;
      community mobilization and community identification of cases of acute malnutrition,&#xD;
      supplementary feeding programme (SFP) for children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM),&#xD;
      outpatient therapeutic programme (OTP) of SAM with no medical complications and inpatient&#xD;
      management of SAM with medical complications However, severely malnourished children with&#xD;
      medical complications requiring hospitalisation often fail to respond to treatment, and&#xD;
      continue to experience high inpatient mortality of up to 35%. Even after discharge, children&#xD;
      have a poor prognosis, with 42% mortality over the subsequent year. It is a subgroup of&#xD;
      children with SAM and acute or persistent diarrhoea who pose the most difficult management&#xD;
      challenges, although the vast majority of children with SAM have substantial degree of&#xD;
      enteropathy. Current treatment guidelines for SAM are not well supported by an evidence base,&#xD;
      and there is a dearth of clinical trial data; in particular, there are no specific&#xD;
      interventions to target enteropathy in SAM. In a systematic review, only three trials were&#xD;
      found which inform management of SAM and persistent diarrhoea, and no trials dealing with the&#xD;
      HIV-infected child. The investigators therefore believe that novel therapeutic approaches are&#xD;
      urgently needed, and that a series of small phase 2 trials could guide development of a new&#xD;
      generation of treatments. These trials should focus on repairing damage to the small&#xD;
      intestinal mucosa, as there is now substantial evidence that this plays a central role in the&#xD;
      genesis of systemic inflammation, bacterial translocation and sepsis with all its adverse&#xD;
      nutritional consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of malnutrition enteropathy: Recent studies have been highly informative about the&#xD;
      infectious contribution to dysfunction of the small intestine in malnourished children. A&#xD;
      high pathogen burden causes damage to the mucosa which exacerbates nutritional impairment and&#xD;
      leads to further susceptibility to infection and impaired epithelial regeneration, in a&#xD;
      cyclical process first described in Central America in the 1970s. This mucosal damage in SAM&#xD;
      is here referred to as malnutrition enteropathy. In previous studies, markers of microbial&#xD;
      translocation and systemic inflammation were dramatically increased in children with SAM&#xD;
      compared to healthy controls. Enteropathy is characterised by multiple epithelial breaches,&#xD;
      microbial translocation from the gut lumen to the systemic circulation, and systemic&#xD;
      inflammation. Epithelial breaches were present in histological (haematoxylin/eosin-stained)&#xD;
      sections and sections studies using immunofluorescence for claudin 4 and E-cadherin. In&#xD;
      adults, these lesions were shown to occur in vivo using confocal laser endomicroscopy. There&#xD;
      was also a consistent pattern of blunted epithelial repair, with reduced glucagon-like&#xD;
      peptide 2 (GLP2) in serum, reduced trefoil factor 3 in duodenal aspirates, and a strong&#xD;
      transcriptomic signature of impaired mucosal defence. Two further immunological abnormalities&#xD;
      were identified in children with malnutrition enteropathy: low-level false positive&#xD;
      coeliac-like autoantibodies, and upregulation of SMAD7 similar to the pattern seen in Crohn's&#xD;
      disease. Together, these abnormalities indicate there is substantial structural and&#xD;
      functional damage to the small intestine, and that this primary gut pathology is associated&#xD;
      with systemic sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO guidelines clearly state that antibiotic treatment should be part of the initial&#xD;
      management of all cases of SAM, whether associated with overt features of infection&#xD;
      ('complicated' SAM) or not ('uncomplicated' SAM). Antibiotic use was associated with reduced&#xD;
      short term mortality and improved nutritional rehabilitation in SAM with no medical&#xD;
      complications in Malawi but post-discharge prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole did not reduce&#xD;
      long-term mortality following complicated SAM in Kenya, and in Niger antibiotics conferred no&#xD;
      benefit. Even in the best outcome group in the Malawi antibiotic trial, mortality was not&#xD;
      reduced below 4% over 12 weeks in children managed as outpatients in OTP. This seems to be a&#xD;
      glass floor below which it has never been possible to reduce mortality in SAM, even in&#xD;
      uncomplicated cases in the community or in clinical trials. In SAM with medical complications&#xD;
      who are managed as inpatients, mortality is much higher, and when combined with HIV infection&#xD;
      can reach 35% in hospital and 62% over one year post-discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If optimal antibiotics are insufficient to reduce mortality below 4% in uncomplicated cases&#xD;
      treated in the community, and mortality is much higher in complicated cases, there must be&#xD;
      other factors which lead inexorably to adverse outcomes in a subgroup of children with&#xD;
      complicated SAM. It seems that a major contributor to the residual mortality observed after&#xD;
      current optimal therapies have been implemented is failure of restitution in the gut. This&#xD;
      means that in a subset of children with SAM, largely but not exclusively those with&#xD;
      persistent diarrhoea, the intestinal mucosa is damaged and leaky, permitting efflux of plasma&#xD;
      proteins and influx of luminal microbial products, and fails to repair following the&#xD;
      infective insult. The evidence leading to this interpretation is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. In children with SAM and persistent diarrhoea, there are epithelial gaps visualised in&#xD;
      haematoxylin/eosin-stained sections and using immunohistochemistry for claudin-4 and&#xD;
      E-cadherin; ii. These are morphologically similar to lesions seen in environmental&#xD;
      enteropathy in adults, though more severe and more numerous; iii. Plasma proteins are easily&#xD;
      detected in western blots of duodenal aspirates, suggesting leakage from blood to gut lumen;&#xD;
      iv. Biomarkers of microbial products (bacterial DNA and lipopolysaccharide) are found in very&#xD;
      high concentrations in peripheral blood, direct evidence of microbial translocation from&#xD;
      lumen to blood; v. Children with persistent diarrhoea and malnutrition have reduced&#xD;
      circulating concentrations of glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP2) and reduced trefoil factor 3 in&#xD;
      intestinal secretions, suggesting a failure of homeostatic repair mechanisms. Circulating LPS&#xD;
      was inversely proportional to circulating GLP2, and this remained true in multivariate&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study of children with complicated SAM in Malawi, children who died were more&#xD;
      likely to have diarrhoea and higher levels of faecal calprotectin (a marker of intestinal&#xD;
      inflammation), and levels of systemic inflammation were directly related to mortality. There&#xD;
      is now clear evidence that enteropathy is associated with systemic inflammation and mortality&#xD;
      in SAM and a new treatment paradigm is required to improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for new approaches. The investigators postulate that the central lesion in&#xD;
      malnutrition enteropathy is epithelial leakiness through tight junction damage and&#xD;
      microerosions, and so propose therapy directed at restoration of the mucosal barrier which&#xD;
      will permit reversal of the cascade of downstream inflammatory derangements. Novel approaches&#xD;
      are required in order to achieve a radical improvement in outcome, and reduce current&#xD;
      unacceptably high mortality rates. The TAME trial will investigate four potential therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches to achieving mucosal restoration. Colostrum, teduglutide and N-acetyl glucosamine&#xD;
      are all intended to achieve mucosal healing. Budesonide, a corticosteroid with limited&#xD;
      absorption, is targeted at the downstream inflammatory changes; in inflammatory conditions&#xD;
      such as coeliac disease or Crohn's disease, steroids produce rapid clinical response. If any&#xD;
      of these interventions impact on malnutrition enteropathy, it will become possible to trial&#xD;
      these novel therapeutic approaches in phase 3 trials to detect an impact on our world's most&#xD;
      disadvantaged children. The trial will also generate useful information about&#xD;
      pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel therapeutic approaches to be tested in the TAME trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colostrum: high-protein bovine colostrum powder (Neovite) orally 1.5 g every 8 hours for&#xD;
           14 days, reconstituted with water and given through a nasogastric (NG) tube or orally.&#xD;
           Colostrum reduces the increased epithelial permeability seen in heat shock. Colostrum&#xD;
           contains nutrients, immunoglobulins and growth factors, including epidermal growth&#xD;
           factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) will be given orally or via NG tube for 14 days, gradually&#xD;
           increased from a starting dose of 0.5g, to 1g three times daily to avoid osmotic&#xD;
           diarrhoea. Impaired glycosylation of glycosaminoglycans has been noted in oedematous&#xD;
           malnutrition, with reduced concentrations of glycosaminoglycans found in blood, urine,&#xD;
           kidney, brain and small intestine. Specific consequences of reduced heparan sulphate&#xD;
           expression include gut epithelial leakiness with hypoalbuminaemia. GlcNAc administration&#xD;
           has been demonstrated to restore the intestinal epithelial charged barrier in Crohn's&#xD;
           disease. GlcNAc may theoretically induce osmotic diarrhoea if not absorbed in the small&#xD;
           intestine. Although this has not been observed clinically in animals or in older&#xD;
           children we will use a dose escalation schedule to minimise the chance of this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Teduglutide by subcutaneous injection (0.05mg/kg/day) daily for 14 days. Teduglutide is&#xD;
           a long-acting form of GLP2 which has proven efficacy in intestinal failure, improving&#xD;
           absorption and reducing the need for parenteral support. GLP2 is a hormone secreted by L&#xD;
           cells in the terminal ileum, which drives epithelial repair and mediates intestinal&#xD;
           adaptation by increased cellular proliferation and villus hypertrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Budesonide 3mg orally daily for 7 days, then 2mg for 4 days then 1mg for 3 days.&#xD;
           Budesonide is standard therapy for Crohn's disease, and can be used for refractory&#xD;
           coeliac disease. Since malnutrition enteropathy is characterized by intestinal&#xD;
           inflammation, with infiltration of activated T cells, an anti-inflammatory approach is&#xD;
           rational. A prior trial of mesalazine in Kenya confirmed an immuno-modulatory approach&#xD;
           is safe in the setting of SAM, but targeting the small, rather than large, intestine&#xD;
           with a more potent agent is likely to be more effective.&#xD;
