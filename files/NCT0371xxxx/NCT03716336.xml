  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 42 premenopausal women diagnosed clinically as having insulin resistance. Their&#xD;
      ages ranged from 35 to 45 years old; their body mass index was &gt;30 kg/m2 and They were obese&#xD;
      women complained of insulin resistance and non diabetic or cardiovascular disease, were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to group A participated in aerobic &amp; resistive exercise program, and group&#xD;
      B participated in aerobic exercise and followed prescribed diet restriction program. Both of&#xD;
      the groups (A&amp;B) followed the treatment program 3 times per weeks for 8 weeks. Assessment of&#xD;
      the fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and HOMA test of insulin resistance were measured for&#xD;
      all subjects in both groups (A and B) was carried out before and after the end of the&#xD;
      treatment program&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Forty two obese premenopausal women diagnosed as having insulin resistance were participated&#xD;
      in this study. They were selected randomly from the out Patient Clinic of Obstetrics at Kasr&#xD;
      El Ainy University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University. Their age ranged from 35&#xD;
      - 45years, their body mass (BMI) were&gt;30kg/m2. Exclusion criteria of the study were as&#xD;
      follows: Patients having diabetic or cardiovascular disease, Patients with life threatening&#xD;
      disorders as renal failure and myocardial infarction, Patients with active malignancy and&#xD;
      patients with severe hemorrhage, hyperthyroidism, acute viral diseases and mental disorders.&#xD;
      Participants were assigned randomly used sealed envelope into two groups (A&amp;B) equally in&#xD;
      number. Group (A): (Combined resistive and aerobic exercise group) consisted of 20 women were&#xD;
      participated in aerobic &amp; resistive exercise program plus diet restriction, 3 times per weeks&#xD;
      for 8 weeks. Group (B): consisted of 20 women were participated in aerobic exercise plus diet&#xD;
      restriction 3 times per weeks for 8 weeks.&#xD;
