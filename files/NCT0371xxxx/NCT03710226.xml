  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet indices might be a marker for platelet activation, and thus could predict&#xD;
      thrombosis. This might be the cause in some cases of recurrent miscarriage. This study aims&#xD;
      to evaluate the use of platelet indices -as a simple test- to predict recurrent miscarriage.&#xD;

      -  Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size: This study will be conducted on (70) women attending outpatient clinic&#xD;
           divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1st Group (35): women with history of recurrent miscarriage (two or more&#xD;
                consecutive miscarriages)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2nd Group (35): women without history of recurrent miscarriage and delivered at&#xD;
                least once before.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size justification: The means of the platelet indices were used to calculate the&#xD;
           sample size. Group sample sizes of 35 per group achieve 80% power to reject the null&#xD;
           hypothesis of zero effect size when the population effect size is 0.70 (moderate to&#xD;
           large) and the significance level (alpha) is 0.050 using a two-sided two-sample&#xD;
           equal-variance t-test. (Machin et al., 1997)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrollment: Women will be enrolled from the outpatient clinic and recurrent pregnancy&#xD;
           loss outpatient clinic in Ain shams maternity hospital. 70 women will be enrolled from&#xD;
           each clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed Consent: All participants will give their informed consent prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detailed history and general examination: To exclude obese women (BMI &gt;30%), women with&#xD;
           known uterine anomalies, endocrinological diseases or immunological disorders and women&#xD;
           on anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transvaginal ultrasound: to exclude any uterine anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory blood sampling: For testing of (TSH, HbA1C, Anticardiolipin antibody (IgG,&#xD;
           IgM), lupus anticoagulant antibodies and Anti-β2 glycoprotein I ) in women with history&#xD;
           of recurrent miscarriage and excluded if positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All other enrolled women will be tested by CBC by XN-1000(SA-01) machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The blood sample will be preserved by EDTA and will be processed within maximum 2&#xD;
                hours..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection &amp; recording: Data of each patient will be recorded in a Case Record Form&#xD;
           (CRF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics for measured variables will be expressed as range, mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation (for metric data); range, median and interquartile range (for discrete data); and&#xD;
      number and proportions (for categorical data the platelet indices in each clinic will be&#xD;
      compared using the t-test A P-value of 0.05 or less will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Informed Consent Forms: Before being admitted to the study, the patient must consent to&#xD;
      participate after the nature, scope, and steps of the study have been explained in a form&#xD;
      understandable to her.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2- Confidentiality: Only the patient number and patient initials will be recorded in the CRF.&#xD;
      The investigator will maintain a personal patient identification list (patient numbers with&#xD;
      the corresponding patient names) to enable records to be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3- Protocol approval: Before the beginning of the study and in accordance with the local&#xD;
      regulation followed, the protocol and all corresponding documents will be declared for&#xD;
      ethical and research approval by the council of obstetrics and gynaecology department, Ain&#xD;
      Shams University; according to the WMA Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
