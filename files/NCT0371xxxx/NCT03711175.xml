  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized blinded study to determine how repairing&#xD;
      the subscapularis vs. not repairing the subscapularis when subjects are implanted with the&#xD;
      AltiVate Reverse® Shoulder System for reverse total shoulder arthroplasty affects isometric&#xD;
      and isokinetic internal rotational strength. It is hypothesized that patients in which the&#xD;
      subscapularis is repaired will have improved postoperative isometric and isokinetic internal&#xD;
      rotational strength.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is performed to provide improvement in pain relief and&#xD;
      restoration of function in patients with rotator cuff tear arthropathy and massive&#xD;
      irreparable rotator cuff tears . Traditional total shoulder designs failed to address the&#xD;
      unique mechanics of shoulders with deficient rotator cuffs. Different prosthesis designs&#xD;
      exist for RSA, all of which increase the deltoid lever arm to provide a stable fulcrum for&#xD;
      active elevation in a rotator cuff deficient shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Reverse® Shoulder Prosthesis (RSP®) (DJO Surgical) sought to address issues correlated to&#xD;
      the Grammont design by lateralizing the center of rotation as well as utilizing a central&#xD;
      compressive screw with a 5.0-mm peripheral locking screws for fixation and a glenosphere .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the success of the lateralized design, the effect of the repair of the subscapularis&#xD;
      tendon during RSA on shoulder strength, range of motion, and shoulder function remains&#xD;
      inconclusive. The rationale for repairing the subscapularis during RSA include anatomic&#xD;
      preservation of a functioning rotator cuff muscle, an increased potential for internal&#xD;
      rotation, better joint protection, and more stability. The reasoning for not repairing the&#xD;
      subscapularis include that it may be biomechanically unfavorable for both the deltoid and the&#xD;
      posterior rotator cuff, limiting the range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, this randomized study aims to address if subscapularis repair impacts isometric and&#xD;
      isokinetic internal rotational strength, with shoulder function and complications as&#xD;
      secondary objectives, when patients are implanted with the AltiVate Reverse® device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place at multiple sites across the United States and will be managed by&#xD;
      the DJO Surgical Clinical Affairs Department.&#xD;
