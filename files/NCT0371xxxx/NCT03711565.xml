      Controlled randomized trial looking at Standard nasal continuous airway pressure (CPAP)&#xD;
      respiratory support versus High Frequency CPAP in neonates who require respiratory support or&#xD;
      who are being extubated and require support post extubation. Patients will be evaluated for&#xD;
      need to be reintubated and oxygen requirement and PaCO2 levels&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial comparing High Frequency nasal CPAP versus&#xD;
      standard nasal CPAP. The patient population includes preterm newborns who require respiratory&#xD;
      support but do not need to be initially intubated and preterm or term infants who are being&#xD;
      extubated and will require support for the continued lung disease. After obtaining parental&#xD;
      consent the patient will be randomized to one of the two treatments. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed for requirement of level of oxygen and blood gases looking at acidity (pH) and PaCO2&#xD;
      and Bicarbonate(HCO3). A respiratory index score will be measured. Attending physician will&#xD;
      determine the need for the patient to be intubated or reintubated depending on the patient&#xD;
      selected. Additionally, frequency, duration and severity of Apnea, Bradycardia and&#xD;
      Desaturation events will be recorded. Also safety issues to include pulmonary airleak, nasal&#xD;
      injury, facial edema and scalp edema due to straps holding the device in place will be&#xD;
      recorded. Also gaseous distension of the stomach and intestines will be assessed and compared&#xD;
      between treatment arms. This study is not powered to look at long term outcomes.&#xD;

Average index scores will be compared between conditions.</description>

    <description>High Frequency Nasal CPAP for management of respiratory distress Patient will be connected to the high frequency device through nasal prongs. The Bronchotron produces a pressure that is variable with an adjustable frequency that is equal or greater than 500 times per minute connecting to prongs in the patient's nose. The pressure, frequency and amplitude of the pulsations will be adjusted as needed to provide acceptable oxygenation and ventilation.</description>
