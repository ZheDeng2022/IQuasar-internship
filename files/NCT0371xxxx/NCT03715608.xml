      Objective To evaluate the incidence of psychological problems in total knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      (TKA) patients and examine whether perioperative psychological intervention can improve the&#xD;
      outcomes of and patient satisfaction with TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The investigators will prospectively collect clinical data from 400 patients who&#xD;
      underwent primary TKA by the same surgeon at Peking University Third Hospital. The patients&#xD;
      will be divided into 3 groups based on psychological status and intervention: the normal&#xD;
      group comprised patients with a normal psychological status, while patients with an abnormal&#xD;
      psychological status will be randomly divided into the intervention group, which received&#xD;
      psychological interventions, and the control group, which do not receive any psychological&#xD;
      interventions. The HSS（Hospital of special surgery） and WOMAC scores will be evaluated&#xD;
      preoperatively, 3 months postoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. A self-administered&#xD;
      satisfaction scale (very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, very&#xD;
      dissatisfied) that assessed overall satisfaction as well as satisfaction with pain relief and&#xD;
      the ability to perform daily and leisure activities will be administered 6 months&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis A certain percentage of TKA patients have preoperative psychological&#xD;
      abnormalities. Preoperative psychological abnormalities can have an adverse effect on&#xD;
      postoperative improvement in joint function and can reduce patient satisfaction. Preoperative&#xD;
      psychological intervention can improve the prognosis of TKA patients with psychological&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;

      Patients with knee osteoarthritis（OA） undergoing primary unilateral TKA at the Department of&#xD;
      Orthopedics of Peking University Third Hospital from May 2016 to January 2018 will be&#xD;
      prospectively included in the study. Inclusion criteria: (1) Signed written informed consent;&#xD;
      (2) Willingness to complete the assessment and an examination using a psychometric scale; (3)&#xD;
      No surgical contraindications. Exclusion criteria: (1) Patients undergoing revision; (2)&#xD;
      Patients with infection; (3) Patients who could not undergo the psychological assessment; (4)&#xD;
      Loss to follow-up; (5) Psychological disorders of severe type, which means the patient needs&#xD;
      to stop TKA surgery for psychological therapy. The patients' general preoperative data and&#xD;
      joint function scores will be collected. Preoperative psychoanalysis will be conducted by a&#xD;
      psychiatrist from Peking University Sixth Hospital to determine the TKA patients'&#xD;
      preoperative psychological characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the presence or absence of psychological abnormalities, the patients will be&#xD;
      divided into a psychological abnormalities group and a normal group. The patients in the&#xD;
      normal group will receive routine TKA surgery and perioperative management without any other&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled prospective study will be conducted with the patients in the&#xD;
      psychological abnormalities group. They will be randomly divided into two groups: the&#xD;
      intervention group and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group: Like the patients in the normal group, the patients in the control group&#xD;
      will receive routine TKA surgery and perioperative management without any other&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group: The patients in the intervention group will receive psychological&#xD;
      counseling and corresponding medication after the operation. Other perioperative treatments&#xD;
      will be the same as the patients in the control group. Psychotherapy will be based on the&#xD;
      clinical expertise of the psychosocial specialist, who will select the most appropriate plan&#xD;
      for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WOMAC and HSS scores of all patients will be analyzed preoperatively, 3 months&#xD;
      postoperatively and 6 months postoperatively, and a postoperative satisfaction survey&#xD;
      questionnaire will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For every patient in this study, standard TKA and perioperative management will be performed&#xD;
      by one experienced surgeon at Peking University Third Hospital. Postoperative follow-up will&#xD;
      be performed by a group of doctors who are blinded to the group and intervention information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological status assessment and clinical outcome evaluation The patients' psychological&#xD;
      and physical performance will be assessed using the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90), a&#xD;
      self-assessment questionnaire that is commonly used to assess patients' psychological health.&#xD;
      The SCL-90 has a good ability to identify people with psychological symptoms (especially&#xD;
      patients on the border of clinically significant psychological symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether a patient had a psychological disorder that met the diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      before surgery, the MINI-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) will be used to&#xD;
      assess patients with suspected anxiety or depression. The MINI is a short, structured&#xD;
      interview for the diagnosis of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV（DSM-IV）and International&#xD;
      Classification of Diseases-10（ICD-10 ） axis psychiatric disorders. It can be conducted in a&#xD;
      short period of time (average 15 minutes). The Chinese version of the MINI has shown&#xD;
      reliability and validity in clinical practice. It has been widely used clinically in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HSS and WOMAC scores will be evaluated preoperatively, 3 months postoperatively and 6&#xD;
      months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A self-administered satisfaction scale (very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, somewhat&#xD;
      dissatisfied, very dissatisfied) that assessed overall satisfaction as well as satisfaction&#xD;
      with pain relief and the ability to perform daily and leisure activities will be administered&#xD;
      6 months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological intervention There are three main interventions for TKA patients: patient&#xD;
      visits and education, medication, and psychological interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient visits and education: Patient education can shorten hospital stays, reduce&#xD;
           surgical complications, relieve preoperative anxiety and depressive symptoms, increase&#xD;
           confidence, and improve patient satisfaction. In particular, patients with clear&#xD;
           psychological problems should pay attention to and divert disease-related negative&#xD;
           emotions, such as tension, fear, depression and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Drug treatment：Patients who meet the indications for drug treatment should be treated&#xD;
           with drugs that are sensitive and effective as recommended by psychiatrists.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Antidepressants are usually divided into tricyclic antidepressants, tetracyclic&#xD;
           antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&#xD;
           (SSRIs), dopamine reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and desmethyl selective serotonin and&#xD;
           norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), norepinephrine and specific serotonin&#xD;
           antidepressants. Among them, SSRIs and SNRIs are widely used in clinical practice. The&#xD;
           SSRIs are fluoxetine hydrochloride, paroxetine hydrochloride, sertraline, fluvoxamine,&#xD;
           citalopram and escitalopram. The main SNRI drugs are venlafaxine, duloxetine and&#xD;
           milnacipran.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Anti-anxiety drugs are mainly benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, alprazolam, and&#xD;
           clonazepam, and aromatic piperazine anxiolytics, such as buspirone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Psychological interventions include cognitive and behavioral therapy, supportive&#xD;
           therapy, relaxation therapy, and such methods as group therapy, motivational interview&#xD;
           therapy, and interpersonal psychotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient has his or her own psychological characteristics. It most effective for a&#xD;
      psychiatrist to develop a personalized psychological intervention program based on the&#xD;
      patient's psychological characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics approval This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking University&#xD;
      Third Hospital. The enrolled patients can choose to withdraw unconditionally at any time&#xD;
      during the study, and the investigators guarantee that the patient's TKA surgery would&#xD;
      continue unaffected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The data distribution will be normal according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov&#xD;
      test. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the demographic data and other baseline&#xD;
      features, and the number, mean, and standard deviation values will be calculated for&#xD;
      continuous variables. Pearson correlations and paired T tests for preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative data comparisons will be used to evaluate the relationship between different&#xD;
      variables. The inferential statistics results (P values) are listed as descriptive results.&#xD;
      SPSS (Version 19, SPSS, Inc., Chicago IL) will be used for the statistical analysis.&#xD;
