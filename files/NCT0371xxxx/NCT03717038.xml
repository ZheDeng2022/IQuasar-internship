  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, 2-arm trial designed to evaluate overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) following treatment with Sym004, an investigational medicinal product (IMP), versus&#xD;
      TAS-102 (trifluridine/tipiracil), a comparator (control) agent.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomization is in the ratio of 1:1 to either Sym004 (Arm A) or TAS-102 (Arm B) in&#xD;
      genomically-selected patients with chemotherapy-refractory or relapsed metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      carcinoma (mCRC) and acquired resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent, centralized genomic analysis will be conducted on blood samples obtained&#xD;
      from each potential patient. Double-negative (DN) results as defined in trial inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be required for initial eligibility prior to randomization. Patients with&#xD;
      DNmCRC will continue in the screening process. Once deemed fully eligible, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to either Arm A or Arm B (collectively referred to as protocol therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing cycles of 28 days with the assigned protocol therapy will continue until a&#xD;
      protocol-specified discontinuation criterion is met. Following treatment discontinuation,&#xD;
      patients will continue to be followed for OS.&#xD;
