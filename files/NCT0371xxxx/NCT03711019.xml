  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to assess the efficacy and tolerability of Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST) and&#xD;
      two different forms of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in sustaining response during and&#xD;
      after a course of continuation treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve a parallel-group clinical trial with three treatment arms conducted at&#xD;
      the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto, ON, Ontario Shores Centre for&#xD;
      Mental Health Sciences in Whitby, ON and University of British Columbia (UBC) Hospital in&#xD;
      Vancouver, BC. It will include participants who are classified as responders or remitters in&#xD;
      the CREST-MST (NCT03191058) trial, the CORRECT-BD (NCT03641300) trial and individuals&#xD;
      responding to bitemporal ECT after participating in either of the above trials, who qualify&#xD;
      for a continuation course of convulsive therapy to prevent relapse of depression. Individuals&#xD;
      blinded to their acute course of treatment will continue to receive the convulsive therapy to&#xD;
      which they responded in in a blinded fashion. Continuation treatments will be scheduled&#xD;
      according to a modified version of the Symptom-Titrated Algorithm-based Longitudinal ECT&#xD;
      (STABLE) algorithm. STABLE includes an initial four week period of ECT delivered on a fixed&#xD;
      schedule (once or twice per week), and then transitions to a symptom-driven schedule whereby&#xD;
      ECT is delivered between zero and two times per week based on the patient's weekly Hamilton&#xD;
      Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24) outcomes during weeks five to 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, this trial will also include non-responders to MST or right unilateral ultrabrief&#xD;
      pulse ECT (RUL-UB ECT) from CREST-MST or CORRECT-BD, who are switched to bitemporal ECT based&#xD;
      on their clinical indication. They will receive bitemporal ECT on an acute basis, i.e. 2 - 3&#xD;
      times per week. If their symptoms respond or remit with bitemporal ECT, they will also be&#xD;
      offered a continuation course of bitemporal ECT as part of this trial and will be followed in&#xD;
      the same manner as those receiving MST or RUL-UB ECT.&#xD;

The investigators plan to enroll up to 105 participants to ensure 70 participants receive a complete course of continuation therapy following MST, RUL-UB ECT, or bitemporal ECT and anticipate enrolling up to 60 participants who will receive an acute course of bitemporal ECT as part of our secondary exploratory outcome over 48 months.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (24-item version):&#xD;
This scale is used to quantify the severity of symptoms of depression&#xD;
Scale range: 0-76 (total score)&#xD;
Lower scores indicate lower severity of depressive symptoms (i.e., better outcome)&#xD;
Higher scores indicate higher severity of depressive symptoms (i.e., worse outcome)&#xD;
Non-inferiority trials such as this proposed study specify a non-inferiority margin, with a tolerance of 3.9 points denoting equivalence between the two treatments when the efficacy of MST can be concluded to be not more than 3.9 points on the HRSD-24 at the endpoint of treatment.</description>

    <description>MST treatment will be administered using the MagPro MST with a Cool TwinCoil over the frontal cortex in the midline position using 100 Hz stimulation. Seizure threshold will have been determined during the first treatment session following a standard established protocol in the context of CREST-MST or CORRECT-BD. Treatment in the continuation phase will be administered at the same stimulus dose as the last treatment in acute phase.&#xD;
This will be performed under the effect of anesthesia. The treatment procedure is approximately 10 minutes, followed by a recovery period of approximately 30 minutes.</description>
