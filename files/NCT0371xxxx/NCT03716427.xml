      This is Phase 1, single-center, open-label, single-sequence drug-drug interaction study to&#xD;
      determine the effect of CT1812 (560 mg) once daily on the pharmacokinetics of 4 probe drugs&#xD;
      (tolbutamide, midazolam, dextromethorphan and omeprazole).&#xD;

      This is Phase 1, single-center, open-label, single-sequence drug-drug interaction study to&#xD;
      determine the effect of CT1812 (560 mg) once daily on the pharmacokinetics of 4 probe drugs&#xD;
      (tolbutamide, midazolam, dextromethorphan and omeprazole).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will qualify for entry into the study within 35 days before admission to the&#xD;
      clinical unit. Subjects will check into the clinical unit on Day -3 for baseline assessments.&#xD;
      Each subject will receive a single dose of each of the probe drugs on Day -2 as a 'cocktail'.&#xD;
      A single dose of CT1812 and each of the probe drugs will be co-administered on Day 6. On Days&#xD;
      1 through 5, subjects will receive a single daily dose of CT1812.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Consumption of alcohol within 14 days prior to dose administration or during any&#xD;
             in-patient period&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Any history of alcohol abuse, illicit drug use, significant mental illness, physical&#xD;
