      This study will evaluate intrapleural administration of Adenovirus-Delivered Interferon&#xD;
      Alpha-2b (rAd-IFN) in combination with Celecoxib and Gemcitabine in patients with&#xD;
      histologically confirmed Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) who have failed a minimum of 1&#xD;
      treatment regimen and a maximum of 2 treatment regimens, 1 of which must have been an&#xD;
      anti-folate and platinum combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment group: rAd-IFN + Celecoxib followed by Gemcitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group: Celecoxib followed by Gemcitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the treatment group will receive rAd-IFN administered into the pleural&#xD;
      space via an Intrapleural catheter (IPC) or similar intrapleural device on study Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the overall survival (OS) associated with&#xD;
      rAd IFN, when administered with celecoxib and gemcitabine, versus that associated with&#xD;
      celecoxib and gemcitabine alone for the treatment of patients with MPM&#xD;

&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the overall survival (OS) associated with&#xD;
      rAd IFN, when administered with celecoxib and gemcitabine, versus that associated with&#xD;
      celecoxib and gemcitabine alone for the treatment of patients with MPM who have failed a&#xD;
      minimum of 1 treatment regimen and a maximum of 2 treatment regimens, 1 of which must have&#xD;
      been an anti-folate and platinum combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare between rAd-IFN, when administered with celecoxib and gemcitabine, versus&#xD;
           that associated with celecoxib and gemcitabine alone for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
           MPM who have failed a minimum of 1 treatment regimen and a maximum of 2 treatment&#xD;
           regimens, 1 of which must have been an anti-folate and platinum combination regimen,&#xD;
           with respect to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Survival rate at 12 months and every 6 months thereafter;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Progression-free survival (PFS);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Best response (complete response, partial response, or stable disease); and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Safety of rAd-IFN; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate rAd-IFN, when administered with celecoxib and gemcitabine, in a sub-set of&#xD;
           patients with MPM who have failed a minimum of 1 treatment regimen and a maximum of 2&#xD;
           treatment regimens, 1 of which must have been an anti-folate and platinum combination&#xD;
           regimen, with respect to viral shedding and biodistribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To compare between rAd-IFN, when administered with celecoxib and gemcitabine, versus that&#xD;
      associated with celecoxib and gemcitabine alone for the treatment of patients with MPM who&#xD;
      have failed a minimum of 1 treatment regimen and a maximum of 2 treatment regimens, 1 of&#xD;
      which must have been an anti-folate and platinum combination regimen, with respect to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health-related Quality-of-Life,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The relationship between immunological status and response to treatment, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biocorrelates of response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population for this study is patients with histologically confirmed MPM of epithelioid or&#xD;
      biphasic (predominantly [&gt;50%] epithelioid) histology who have failed a minimum of 1&#xD;
      treatment regimen and a maximum of 2 treatment regimens, 1 of which must have been an&#xD;
      anti-folate and platinum combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an open-label, randomized, parallel group study conducted in patients with&#xD;
      histologically confirmed MPM of epithelioid or biphasic (predominantly [&gt;50%] epithelioid)&#xD;
      histology who have failed a minimum of 1 treatment regimen and a maximum of 2 treatment&#xD;
      regimens, 1 of which must have been an anti-folate and platinum combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening assessments must be completed within 28 days of Study Day 1, and eligible patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment group: rAd-IFN (Study Day 1) + celecoxib (Study Days 1 to 14) + gemcitabine&#xD;
           (Study Days 14 and 21 [i.e., Days 1 and 8 of the first gemcitabine treatment cycle],&#xD;
           gemcitabine will be repeated every 3 weeks until disease progression/early termination&#xD;
           [ET]); or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group: celecoxib (Study Days 1 to 14) + gemcitabine (Study Days 14 and 21 [i.e.,&#xD;
           Days 1 and 8 of the first gemcitabine treatment cycle], gemcitabine will be repeated&#xD;
           every 3 weeks until disease progression/ET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase Patients randomized to receive rAd-IFN (treatment group) will have an&#xD;
      intrapleural catheter (IPC) or other intrapleural access device previously in place or&#xD;
      inserted for the study, permitting drug administration to an accessible pleural space. The&#xD;
      rAd-IFN will be diluted to a volume of 25 mL using sterile normal saline and will be&#xD;
      administered directly to the pleural space via the IPC or similar device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive gemcitabine until disease progression/ET. All adverse events will be&#xD;
      captured from the time of the main study's informed consent through 30 days after the last&#xD;
      dose of study treatment (rAd-IFN, celecoxib, and/or gemcitabine). All treatment emergent&#xD;
      adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until resolution or&#xD;
      stabilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival Follow-Up Phase Following disease progression, patients will be followed every 3&#xD;
      months for survival. All previously recorded TEAEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution&#xD;
      or stabilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the treatment group will receive rAd-IFN (3 × E11 viral particles) on&#xD;
      Day 1 of the study, diluted to a total volume of 25 mL using sterile normal saline and&#xD;
      administered into the pleural space via an IPC or similar intrapleural device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study patients (treatment and control) will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Celecoxib administered at a dose of 400 mg twice daily orally on Days 1 to 14 of the&#xD;
           study; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gemcitabine starting on Study Day 14, using the following treatment regimen: 1250 mg/m2&#xD;
           administered intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day gemcitabine cycle and continued&#xD;
           every 3 weeks until disease progression/ET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis of the primary endpoint is a comparison of the OS curves between the 2&#xD;
      groups using a log-rank test. The log-rank test will be stratified using the same variables&#xD;
      used for stratifying the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses of the primary endpoint will include a comparison of the survival rates at&#xD;
      various time points since randomization and a comparison of the median survival times. The&#xD;
      effect of baseline covariates will be assessed by constructing a proportional hazard model.&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses will include comparison of the survival curves by methods that do not&#xD;
      rely on proportional hazards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary time-to-event endpoints will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical efficacy endpoints will be summarized and compared between groups using a&#xD;
      Pearson's test, with the effect of baseline covariates assessed using logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nature, incidence, severity, relatedness, expectedness, seriousness, and outcome of TEAEs&#xD;
      will be summarized by treatment group for safety analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 interim analyses planned:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis for futility will be assessed upon reaching 123 deaths (estimated to occur 27&#xD;
           months after first patient first visit [FPFV]). Approximately half of the available Beta&#xD;
           will be spent at this interim; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis for efficacy will be assessed upon reaching 234 deaths (estimated to occur 45&#xD;
           months after FPFV). Approximately one-fifth of the available Alpha will be spent at this&#xD;
           interim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final analysis will be assessed upon reaching 267 deaths (estimated to occur 60 months&#xD;
      after FPFV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned sample size is approximately 300 patients. Based on a 1:1 randomization between&#xD;
      treatment groups, a 2.5% one-sided significance level, and a predicted survival at 18 months&#xD;
      of 35% in the rAd-IFN treatment group versus 20% in the control group, the study will have at&#xD;
      least 90% power (after adjusting for the interim analyses) to detect a statistically&#xD;
      significant difference between the treatment groups in the primary endpoint using the&#xD;
      log-rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculation was based on the assumptions that recruitment is uniform over 3 years and&#xD;
      that all alive patients are followed-up for 2 years after the end of recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING BOARD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be convened for this study to&#xD;
      monitor safety, efficacy, and study integrity. All aspects of the DSMB's scope of review and&#xD;
      procedures will be detailed in a DSMB charter.&#xD;

             from tumor specimens obtained at the time of initial presentation or a subsequent&#xD;
             procedure. Central confirmation of diagnosis with immunohistochemistry will be&#xD;
             performed, and independent central confirmation will be required for study entry;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Measurable disease, per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]&#xD;
             1.1 (see Section 7) for pleural mesothelioma;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has received a minimum of 1 treatment regimen and a maximum of 2 treatment regimens,&#xD;
             which may have been chemotherapeutic and/or immunotherapeutic treatment regimens for&#xD;
             MPM which included at least 1 anti-folate and platinum combination regimen;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy represent 1 line of therapy each;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have undergone primary surgical resection and/or radiation therapy&#xD;
                  to the pulmonary site are eligible to participate. For clarity, surgical&#xD;
                  resection and/or radiation therapy to the pulmonary site are not exclusionary and&#xD;
                  are not considered a line of therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Treatment that is split between pre-surgical resection and post-surgical&#xD;
                  resection and is the same regimen will be counted as 1 regimen. Patients meeting&#xD;
                  this condition should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to including&#xD;
                  the patient in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has a pleural space accessible for IPC or similar device insertion. Patients with a&#xD;
             previously inserted IPC or similar device may be enrolled, and the pre-existing IPC or&#xD;
             similar device can be used for vector administration as long as it is functional and&#xD;
             has no evidence of local infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Life expectancy 12 weeks in the judgement of the Investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of 1 or 0;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female and male patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test&#xD;
                  upon entry into this study and agree to use a highly effective method of&#xD;
                  contraception from Screening until 1 month after the last dose of gemcitabine;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Highly effective methods of contraception that result in a low failure rate&#xD;
                       (i.e., &lt;1% per year) when used consistently and correctly include combined&#xD;
                       (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with&#xD;
                       inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal),&#xD;
                       progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of&#xD;
                       ovulation (oral, injectable, or implantable), intrauterine device,&#xD;
                       intrauterine hormone-releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion,&#xD;
                       vasectomized partner, or sexual abstinence;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  True abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                       patient, is considered a highly effective method only if defined as&#xD;
                       refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of study&#xD;
                       participation and for 1 month after the last dose of gemcitabine. The&#xD;
                       reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                       duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                       patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, and&#xD;
                       post-ovulation method) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                       contraception; and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female patients of non-childbearing potential must be either postmenopausal (no&#xD;
                  menstrual period for a minimum of 12 months) or surgically sterile upon entry&#xD;
                  into the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male patients must be either surgically sterile or agree to use a double-barrier&#xD;
                  contraception method from Screening until 6 months after the last dose of&#xD;
                  gemcitabine; o Where available and in accordance with local practice, male&#xD;
                  patients must be advised to seek further advice regarding cryoconservation of&#xD;
                  sperm prior to gemcitabine treatment due to the possibility of infertility after&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Adequate laboratory values at Screening:&#xD;
