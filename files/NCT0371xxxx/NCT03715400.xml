      Anhedonia is a symptom dimension that characterizes many individuals suffering from&#xD;
      depression, as well as some types of anxiety, psychosis, and substance use. For the most&#xD;
      part, treatments are effective in decreasing negative affect but ineffective in improving&#xD;
      anhedonia, with some antidepressant medications even worsening symptoms of anhedonia. Yet&#xD;
      anhedonia is a significant marker of poor prognosis as well as suicidal ideation and actual&#xD;
      suicide. The development of effective treatments for anhedonia is thus of paramount&#xD;
      importance. Advances in neuroscience indicate specific targets that may underlie anhedonia&#xD;
      that can be shifted through behavioral training. The investigators have developed such a&#xD;
      program and found it to be effective in raising positive affect, especially for depressed or&#xD;
      anxious individuals with anhedonia at baseline. To date, this program has been implemented by&#xD;
      highly trained clinicians, which have supervised its implementation on a large scale.&#xD;
      Moreover, the behavior program is dependent on readily available rewarding experiences, which&#xD;
      anhedonia obviously challenges. Furthermore, mechanistic evaluation is impeded by intra¬- and&#xD;
      inter-¬individual variability in exposure to rewarding stimuli. Virtual Reality (VR) offsets&#xD;
      these barriers by repeated controlled immersion in experiences designed to enhance approach&#xD;
      motivation, initial responsiveness to reward attainment, and reward learning. In this current&#xD;
      study, the investigators aim to measure clinical outcomes using Virtual Reality-Reward&#xD;
      Training (VR-RT).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anhedonia is a symptoms dimension that characterizes many individuals suffering from&#xD;
      depression, as well as some types of anxiety, psychosis, and substance use. Anhedonia refers&#xD;
      to deficits in positive affect as observed through 1) loss of enjoyment in pleasurable&#xD;
      activities and/or 2) loss of desire to engage in pleasurable activities. Within depression,&#xD;
      anhedonia is more strongly associated with the core disturbance of depressions (e.g.&#xD;
      lassitude) than with the nonspecific symptoms that are shared without emotion disorders (e.g.&#xD;
      insomnia). Approximately one¬-third of depressed individuals have clinically significant&#xD;
      anhedonia symptoms, as defined by cutoffs on scales that measure enjoyment of social and&#xD;
      physical pleasure. Anhedonia extends beyond major depression to social anxiety disorder and&#xD;
      generalized anxiety disorder, although with a smaller magnitude of effect than depression.&#xD;
      Anhedonia is also relevant to schizophrenia and substance use disorder. Thus, anhedonia&#xD;
      represents a dimension of psychopathology that crosses diagnostic boundaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anhedonia is associated with several indices of psychopathology. First, self¬-reported&#xD;
      anhedonia (lower levels of positive emotion) is a robust predictor of poorer longitudinal&#xD;
      course of symptoms of major depression across a number of prospective studies. Relatedly, the&#xD;
      trait variance component of low positive affect prospectively predicts the onset of not only&#xD;
      major depression, but also social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, albeit&#xD;
      through correlates with neuroticism. Second, anhedonia within major depression is a major&#xD;
      predictor of suicide, and the predictive effects upon suicidal ideation persist even when&#xD;
      controlling for other cognitive and affective symptoms of depression. Third, anhedonia is a&#xD;
      predictor of poorer response to pharmacological treatments for depression. Some preliminary&#xD;
      data from our laboratory replicate this relationship in terms of psychological treatments, at&#xD;
      least for social anxiety disorder: in a sample of 75, the investigators found that low&#xD;
      positive affect again significantly predicted poorer outcomes (b = ¬-.70, B = -¬.25, p &lt;&#xD;
      .05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach Motivation: Dopaminergic signaling is related to the motivation for reward. In&#xD;
      humans, neural regions most strongly linked to the approach motivation for reward include the&#xD;
      ventral tegmental area, amygdala, and striatum, all of which are innervated by or project to&#xD;
      dopaminergic nuclei. Phasic bursts in dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area have&#xD;
      been shown to co¬-occur in response to violations in reward expectancy. Dopamine signaling in&#xD;
      the nucleus accumbens (which has dense dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental&#xD;
      area) is also associated with reward motivation in rodents. Increased mPFC activation may&#xD;
      function to reduce striatal response and behavioral drive for rewarding dopaminergic&#xD;
      stimulation. Approach motivation is also tied to reward learning, which involves Pavlovian or&#xD;
      instrumental associations and predictions about future rewards based on past experiences. As&#xD;
      with the approach motivation for reward, learning of reward is associated with dopaminergic&#xD;
      signaling. Various areas of the prefrontal cortex have been implicated in decision making and&#xD;
      reward learning, and animal research highlights areas such as the ACC, orbitofrontal cortex,&#xD;
      vmPFC and dlPFC. Not only do depressed individuals show reduced activation in reward&#xD;
      circuitries in anticipation of reward but reduced ventral striatum responsivity to incentive&#xD;
      stimuli is particularly related to anhedonic symptoms. Further evidence is derived from&#xD;
      behavioral indices in which trait anhedonia among healthy individuals correlates with&#xD;
      choosing easy tasks for a small reward over harder tasks for larger rewards, indicative of&#xD;
      less motivation (i.e., expenditure of effort) to gain reward. Also, depressed individuals&#xD;
      make fewer higher reward/high effort choices than healthy controls, and importantly, the&#xD;
      motivational effort they expend to obtain rewards correlates negatively with anhedonia. In&#xD;
      self-¬report measures, dysphoric individuals expect to feel less positive emotion in future&#xD;
      positive events and report less positive emotion in anticipation of a monetary reward&#xD;
      compared to healthy controls, although the evidence is not entirely robust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responsiveness to Reward Attainment: Responsiveness to reward attainment (or hedonic&#xD;
      capacity) is more strongly related to opioid and endocannabinoid pathways. Neural regions&#xD;
      most strongly linked with liking of reward include the ventral striatum (representing overlap&#xD;
      with the approach motivation component) and orbitofrontal cortex. Depressed individuals show&#xD;
      ventral striatum hypo-activity to positive stimuli, and the hypo-activity is particularly&#xD;
      strongly associated with symptoms of anhedonia. Furthermore, Wacker et al. (2009) established&#xD;
      that the effects were specific to anhedonia above and beyond negative symptoms of anxiety and&#xD;
      depression. Further evidence for deficits in initial responsiveness to attainment derives&#xD;
      from cognitive measures, with depressed individuals showing less attention to positive&#xD;
      stimuli than controls as measured by response latency times in dot probe tasks and eye&#xD;
      tracking. Moreover, attention to positive information is associated with positive affect. The&#xD;
      evidence for deficits in self-¬rated liking of reward in depressed individuals is mixed.&#xD;
      Importantly, lower levels of self¬-reported positive emotions to positive stimuli (e.g. sweet&#xD;
      taste test) are more strong related to anhedonia than depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted Treatment for Anhedonia: In light of the evidence summarized above, a treatment that&#xD;
      specifically targets reward approach motivation and learning, and responsiveness to reward&#xD;
      attainment may be particularly potent for anhedonia. As noted, existing psychological&#xD;
      treatments mostly target negative affect, and while behavioral activation is designed to&#xD;
      increase engagement in pleasant activities, little attention has been given to date to how to&#xD;
      optimize positive emotions during the planning and conduct of such activities. Drawing from&#xD;
      affective neuroscience and experimental psychopathology, the investigators have developed a&#xD;
      treatment that specifically targets these components of the reward system. The treatment is&#xD;
      comprised of therapeutic techniques that directly target one or more of these subdomains. The&#xD;
      first phase of treatment (sessions 1-7) involves modified behavioral activation (called&#xD;
      behavioral training), which combines planning for engagement in pleasurable activities&#xD;
      (reward approach and motivation) and reinforcement via positive mood inducing effects (reward&#xD;
      learning) with 'in¬-the-¬moment' recounting designed to savor pleasurable moments and enhance&#xD;
      hedonic impact (responsiveness). The second phase of treatment (sessions 8¬-13) adds two&#xD;
      additional components to ongoing behavioral training: cognitive training designed to shift&#xD;
      attention towards positive stimuli in the environment (reward approach motivation), reinforce&#xD;
      associations between responses and positive outcomes (reward learning) and train motivation&#xD;
      for positive events and emotions through imagery (reward approach motivation); and compassion&#xD;
      training that focuses on motivating toward (reward approach motivation) and savoring positive&#xD;
      experiences (responsiveness). The investigators found that this treatment is effective in&#xD;
      both reducing negative affect (depression and anxiety) and improving positive affect,&#xD;
      especially for individuals who are most anhedonic at baseline. Specifically, patients who&#xD;
      meet entry criteria of elevated levels of depression, anxiety (somatic), or stress (worry) on&#xD;
      the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and who are at least moderately impaired&#xD;
      according to the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), are randomly assigned to receive treatments&#xD;
      aimed at increasing reward sensitivity (Positive Affect Treatment, PAT) or at reducing threat&#xD;
      sensitivity (Negative Affect Treatment, NAT). Here the investigators present data from the&#xD;
      first 61 enrolled patients (N=20 PAT and N=41 NAT) who began the 15 ¬treatment session&#xD;
      protocol. Self-¬reported symptoms of depression (DASS-¬D) and stress (DASS-¬S) decreased from&#xD;
      a severe range at pre-¬treatment to a normal range at post-¬treatment in PAT and NAT&#xD;
      (DASS¬-D: Cohen's d=1.89 and 1.41, respectively; DASS¬-S: d=1.35 and d=1.65, respectively).&#xD;
      Self¬-reported anxiety (DASS¬-A) decreased from extremely severe to normal for PAT and from&#xD;
      moderate to mild for NAT (d=1.02 and 1.47). The investigators found significant improvements&#xD;
      for our anhedonia outcome measure, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Positive Scale&#xD;
      (PANAS-¬P). Positive affect improved linearly in both treatment, but significantly greater&#xD;
      changes occurred with PAT (d=1.40) versus NAT (d=.59) (Group x Time; p=.001). Only PAT&#xD;
      significantly and satisfactorily normalized deficits in positive affect (changes from 20th to&#xD;
      46th percentile on the scale developed by Crawford Henry, 2004. In NAT treatment, levels of&#xD;
      PANAS-¬P remained lower than the population average (change from 18th to 32nd percentile).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual Reality-Reward Training: While our &quot;reward training&quot; treatment has a strong&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy signal, it is dependent on delivery by highly trained clinicians, which&#xD;
      reduces its scalability and accessibility to large section of the population. Furthermore,&#xD;
      evaluation of mechanisms is somewhat impeded by variability both within the between&#xD;
      individuals in terms of rate of exposure to rewarding stimuli. Finally, chronically anhedonic&#xD;
      individuals, especially those with limited social contact and therefore lack of social&#xD;
      reinforcement, may be faced with difficulties when asked to repeatedly engage in rewarding&#xD;
      experiences. Repeated imagining of positive outcomes from multiple scenarios has already been&#xD;
      shown to be an effective means for raising positive affect. However, imagery alone provides&#xD;
      limited control over the content of images and is dependent upon an individual's ability to&#xD;
      imagine vividly. Virtual reality provides a vehicle for repeated programmatic immersion in&#xD;
      rewarding experiences that can include training to identify positive stimuli, sustain&#xD;
      attention upon positive stimuli, receive reinforcement for such attention, and notice mood&#xD;
      enhancing effects, with training extending from primary reward (e.g. physical and social) to&#xD;
      acts of generosity/loving kindness. This type of automated training offers the potential to&#xD;
      eventually become a self-¬guided treatment which would increase implementation on a large&#xD;
      scale. Furthermore, it offers a mechanistic dose-¬response evaluation since the dosage of&#xD;
      rewarding experiences within virtual reality can be fully controlled. Virtual reality with&#xD;
      relaxing scenes has been shown to increase ratings of happiness. Virtual reality has already&#xD;
      been tested and shown to be an effective tool for raising positive affect in patients with&#xD;
      chronic or terminal medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will complete a brief online screener to verify eligibility. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to VR-RT or a delayed waitlist control condition. All&#xD;
      participants will complete a Baseline assessment at Week 0 through Qualtrics that measures&#xD;
      symptoms of anhedonia, depression, and anxiety. Participants randomized to VR-RT will be&#xD;
      provided with VR viewers to allow them to use their smartphone devices to view virtual&#xD;
      reality scenes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have the option to proceed with online screening through this webpage,&#xD;
      which will initiate the pre-screening process. During pre-screening, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to answer a brief screener. If participants are eligible after this step, they will&#xD;
      continue with prescreening by completing the 1) BAS, 2) DASS-21, and 3) SDS. Participants&#xD;
      will be eligible based on meeting the following dimensional score cutoffs: BAS (Reward Drive&#xD;
      subscale score of ≤ 11, Reward Sensitivity Subscale score of ≤ 11, or Responsiveness subscale&#xD;
      score of ≤ 16), DASS-21 score above mild/moderate in any subscale, and SDS score of ≥6. Those&#xD;
      who meet the appropriate score cutoffs listed above will be redirected to the study&#xD;
      information sheet and online consent form. On the online consent form, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to 1) agree to participate in the study, 2) confirm willingness to be contacted for&#xD;
      future studies, and 3) confirm willingness to share data with other investigators. After&#xD;
      providing online consent, participants will provide contact information (which will include&#xD;
      phone verification and email verification steps), age and sex, and preferred mode of contact&#xD;
      through a secured registration system. Once this information is collected, participants will&#xD;
      receive a notification that they will be contacted within three business days to complete the&#xD;
      final screening step by phone. If participants are not eligible after completing the online&#xD;
      screening or decline to provide consent, they will be sent a notification of their&#xD;
      ineligibility and a list of resources. If the participants are found eligible, they will be&#xD;
      randomized to the treatment or waitlist control group and scheduled for all of the VR-¬RT&#xD;
      sessions and assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each assessment, the participant will complete the PANAS-SF (at beginning and end),&#xD;
      MASQ-AD 14 item, DASS-21, Ruminative Responses Scale, SDS, EEfRT task, and Pizzagalli task.&#xD;
      Each of these sessions is expected to take approximately one hour, with the exception of the&#xD;
      Treatment condition Baseline, which will take roughly 2.5 hours, as it includes an initial&#xD;
      orientation to the VR program, they will be instructed how to access the VR scenes online and&#xD;
      view them using the virtual reality viewer, as well as how to use Qualtrics to guide their&#xD;
      recall of the VR scenes and autobiographical memories. Please see the attached document&#xD;
      &quot;Amended Participant Timeline&quot; for a Participant timeline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Virtual Reality Reward Training (VR-RT): VR-RT will be scheduled twice weekly&#xD;
      for with each lasting roughly 45 minutes (7 sessions, 4 weeks total). These sessions will&#xD;
      occur at a comfortable, private location (e.g. at home) with a sufficiently strong Wi-Fi&#xD;
      connection chosen at the participant's discretion. We have determined that UCLA's campus has&#xD;
      sufficiently strong Wi-Fi connection to complete the VR-RT viewings and tasks. Participants&#xD;
      will therefore be offered the option to complete their sessions on campus in the laboratory&#xD;
      of Dr. Craske in the Life Sciences Building.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first session will consist of an overview of the treatment, instruction in the use of the&#xD;
      virtual reality equipment, and Session 1 of VR-RT. Each session will involve unique virtual&#xD;
      reality scenes. All virtual reality scenes will contain physical (e.g. walking through a&#xD;
      beautiful forest) and/or social (e.g. being welcomed as entering a social gathering)&#xD;
      reward-related sub-scenes in which higher-intensity rewarding stimuli are embedded and are to&#xD;
      be discovered through searching (e.g. sun filtering through the forest in one of several&#xD;
      hiking trials; being invited to join a group within a larger social gathering); negative&#xD;
      sub-scenes may also be embedded (e.g. clouds looming overhead; a group who ignore the&#xD;
      participant) in order to emphasize focus on the positive aspects of the scenes. Some of the&#xD;
      social reward scenes will involve acts of generosity and loving kindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session will be comprised of three components: 1) Preparation. Participants will be&#xD;
      given a description of the virtual scene to which they will be exposed. They will be informed&#xD;
      that their task is to become as fully immersed in the scene as possible, to notice their&#xD;
      emotions, physical reactions and thoughts as they participate, and to move away from embedded&#xD;
      negative stimuli and discover embedded higher intensity rewarding stimuli through searching&#xD;
      behavior and to move away from embedded negative scenes; this represents training in goal&#xD;
      setting and approach motivation. Participants will rate their mood using the International&#xD;
      Positive and Negative Affective Schedule Short Form (I-PANAS-SF) to assess positive affect&#xD;
      and negative affect, anchored to current mood states. They will then connect their smartphone&#xD;
      to the virtual reality equipment, queuing up the VR video for that session. 2) Experience.&#xD;
      Each session will consist of two to six videos and average approximately 15 minutes. 3)&#xD;
      Evaluate and Recount. Participants will complete a Post- VR I-PANAS-SF. Participants will&#xD;
      type into Qualtrics their recollection of the VR scene(s). They will then listen to a guided&#xD;
      mindfulness summary of the scene(s) they just watched. Participants will then type into&#xD;
      Qualtrics their recollection of an autobiographical memory; the autobiographical memory they&#xD;
      recall will be prompted by the program, differing by session. Participants will then listen&#xD;
      to a guided mindfulness recording that prompts them to recall their own, prompted&#xD;
      autobiographical memory. In doing so, the training targets savoring or attainment of reward&#xD;
      and reward learning (i.e., my mood is changed by this activity). Participants will then rate&#xD;
      their mood again according to the I-PANAS-SF.&#xD;
