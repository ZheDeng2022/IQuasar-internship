      This study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial conducted at the In Vitro&#xD;
      Fertilization ( IVF) center of the Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, Kasr El-Ainy&#xD;
      Teaching Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt, from October 2018 to&#xD;
      September 2019, to determine the clinical effect of fasting on ICSI outcomes in poor&#xD;
      responders 360 participants will be randomized withdrawing closed envelopes for each patient&#xD;
      into group A and group B .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (A): patients will have periodic fasting for 4 weeks prior to the treatment cycle. The&#xD;
      fasting method involves daily fasts of 14-16hours and restrict eating to an 8-10 hour &quot;eating&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, single-blinded (to the outcomes assessor), randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial conducted at the In Vitro Fertilization ( IVF) center of the Department of Obstetrics &amp;&#xD;
      Gynecology, Kasr El-Ainy Teaching Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt,&#xD;
      from October 2018 to September 2019, to determine the clinical effect of fasting on ICSI&#xD;
      outcomes in poor responder patients. Ethical committee approval was obtained. The study will&#xD;
      include 360 infertile patients with poor ovarian reserve (POR )diagnosed by low Antral&#xD;
      follicle count (AFC)( less than 5 follicles), Elevated basal follicle-stimulating hormone&#xD;
      (FSH) (more than 10 IU/mL) and low anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH)(less than 1.5 ng/ml),&#xD;
      previous POR (≤three oocytes with a conventional stimulation protocol). Women with diabetes,&#xD;
      thyroid disorder or other endocrine dysfunctions, uterine abnormalities were excluded.Also&#xD;
      severe oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia or azospermia are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are informed about the study and consent is given by those who accept to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Careful history taking include infertility type, duration , cause, obstetric history, medical&#xD;
      and surgical history and demographic distribution is taken. Full physical examination and 2&#xD;
      dimensional (2D) transvaginal sonography (TVS) are done on day 2 to 5 of menses to assess&#xD;
      antral follicle count, uterus and adnexa . Body mass index (BMI) and waist/hip ratio (WHR)&#xD;
      are calculated, Blood samples are taken for fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile (&#xD;
      Triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol, High density Lipoprotein (HDL), Low density&#xD;
      Lipoprotein (LDL),AntiMullerian Hormone (AMH), Basal Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH),&#xD;
      Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Estradiol (E2) All 360 participants will be randomized withdrawing&#xD;
      closed envelopes for each patient into group A and group B .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (A): patients will have periodic fasting for 4 weeks prior to the treatment cycle. The&#xD;
      fasting method involves daily fasts of 14-16hours and restrict eating to an 8-10 hour &quot;eating&#xD;
      window&quot; as 2-3 or more meals of balanced diet. Group (B): no fasting, patients will have&#xD;
      usual balanced diet as 3 meals and 2 snacks all over the day. Both groups should take&#xD;
      adequate water and non calorie beverages intake daily (2-3 liters) Subjects are instructed to&#xD;
      wait for spontaneous menses. The next visit is scheduled on day 2 of next cycle when&#xD;
      transvaginal ultrasound is done to confirm that endometrial thickness &lt;5mm, no ovarian cyst&#xD;
      by ultrasound. Body mass index (BMI) and waist/hip ratio (WHR) are calculated. Blood samples&#xD;
      are taken for fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile ( Triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol,&#xD;
      High density Lipoprotein (HDL), Low density Lipoprotein (LDL), AntiMullerian Hormone (AMH),&#xD;
      Basal Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Estradiol (E2),and then&#xD;
      antagonist protocol is followed. Gonadotropins as Intramuscular (I.M.) injections of 150-300&#xD;
      (International units) I.U. of highly purified Human Menopausal Gonadotropins daily (Merional,&#xD;
      75 I.U. /vial, IBSA). and Urofollitropin or highly purified human follicle stimulating&#xD;
      hormone(Fostimon®, 75 I.U. /vial, IBSA) are give in a ratio of 1:1.The dose is adjusted&#xD;
      according to the age, BMI, Antral follicle count (AFC), serum levels of AMH, FSH and ovarian&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the sixth day of stimulation , a visit is scheduled to assess the ovarian response (&#xD;
      folliculometry) by TVS. Gonadotrophin releasing hormone antagonist (GnRH antagonist) which is&#xD;
      Cetrorelix 0.25mg ( Cetrotide®, 0.25 mg/ vial, Merck Serono, is filled and mixed with diluent&#xD;
      from a prefilled syringe with a 20 gauge needle) is given subcutaneously (S.C.) by 27-gauge&#xD;
      needle starting from the 6th day of stimulation (fixed antagonist protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next visits are every other day for follow up using the TVS. The trigger by Human Chorionic&#xD;
      Gonadotrophin (HCG)10000 I.U., I.M. ( Pregnyl, Organon) is given when at least 3 follicles&#xD;
      reach 18mm in mean diameter or more and E2 level is less than 2500 pg/ml. Ovum retrieval is&#xD;
      done 34 hours after HCG injection and embryo transfer using Wallace catheter on day 2 to 3.&#xD;
      Luteal support includes natural Progesterone 400 mg 1x2 as rectal suppository, Folic acid 0.5&#xD;
      mg orally once daily, Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid 1gm 1x2x7 orally, Progesterone 100 I.M.&#xD;
      injections daily for 10 days, Acetylsalicylic Acid (75 mg) orally once daily Quantitative ß-&#xD;
      HCG in serum after is done after 14 days of embryo transfer.TVS is performed to detect&#xD;
      clinical pregnancy at 6-7 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is clinical pregnancy rate per cycle. Secondary outcomes include Body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) and waist/hip ratio (WHR), fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile ( Triglycerides&#xD;
      (TGs), total cholesterol, High density Lipoprotein (HDL), Low density Lipoprotein (LDL),&#xD;
      AntiMullerian Hormone (AMH), Basal Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone&#xD;
      (LH), Estradiol (E2, Days of stimulation , dose of gonadotrophins, number of M II oocytes&#xD;
      retrieved, number of grade1and 2 embryos, number of frozen embryos, freeze all cycles,&#xD;
