    <time_frame>Baseline (Prior to Treatment) to End of Study (BELKYRA Treatment: Up to Month 11; Non-BELKYRA Treatment: Up to Month 5)</time_frame>
    <description>The participant assessed satisfaction using the 10 items on the FACE-Q: Satisfaction with Facial Appearance questionnaire measured on a 4-point scale where 1=very dissatisfied, 2=somewhat dissatisfied, 3=somewhat satisfied, and 4=very satisfied. The responses to the items were converted to a 100-point Rasch transformed scale score with 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Participant's Assessment of Age-related Facial Appearance as Measured by Self-perception of Age (SPA) Questionnaire (Item 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Prior to Treatment) to End of Study (BELKYRA Treatment: Up to Month 11; Non-BELKYRA Treatment: Up to Month 5)</time_frame>
    <description>The participant assessed age-related facial appearance using the 3 items on the SPA Questionnaire. Participants were asked 'how they think of their facial appearance looks compared to their age on the day of assessment' and participants had to respond in any one of the following responses: 1) I look my current age, or 2) I look (enter number of years) years younger, or 3) I look (enter number of years) years older. Item 1: Number of participants who responded 'I look my current age' is reported.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Participant's Assessment of Age-related Facial Appearance as Measured by SPA Questionnaire (Items 2 and 3) to End of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Prior to Treatment) to End of Study (BELKYRA Treatment: Up to Month 11; Non-BELKYRA Treatment: Up to Month 5)</time_frame>
    <description>The participant assessed age-related facial appearance using the 3 items on the SPA Questionnaire. Participants were asked 'how they think of their facial appearance looks compared to their age on the day of assessment' and participants had to respond in any one of the following responses: 1) I look my current age, or 2) I look (enter number of years) years younger, or 3) I look (enter number of years) years older.

Each question is answered using a 5-point scale where: 0=Never (best) to 4=all of the time (worst). The responses to the items on the questionnaire were converted to a 100-point Rasch transformed scale score with 0 (best) to 100 (worst). Lower scores indicate higher satisfaction.

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 59 participants were enrolled, of which 58 were randomized in the study to receive BELKYRA and non-BELKYRA treatment in the ratio of approximately 1:2. Participants receiving BELKYRA treatment entered the study at Month 0 continuing on to Month 11. Participants not receiving BELKYRA following screening entered the study at Month 0 (similar to Month 6 visit of the BELKYRA arm) to begin treatment with JUVÉDERM hyaluronic acid (HA) facial fillers, SkinMedica, and BOTOX Cosmetic.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The participant assessed social function using the FACE-Q questionnaire measured on a 4-point social function scale where 1=definitely disagree, 2=somewhat disagree, 3=somewhat agree, 4=definitely agree. The responses to the items on the questionnaire were converted to a 100-point Rasch transformed scale score with 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Higher scores indicate higher social function.

Results for Items 2 and 3 are reported. The higher number of years in Item 2 implies better self-perception of age; a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. The fewer number of years in Item 3 implies better self-perception of age; a negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Participant's Assessment of Age-related Facial Appearance as Measured by SPA Questionnaire (Items 2 and 3) to End of Study</title>
          <description>The participant assessed age-related facial appearance using the 3 items on the SPA Questionnaire. Participants were asked 'how they think of their facial appearance looks compared to their age on the day of assessment' and participants had to respond in any one of the following responses: 1) I look my current age, or 2) I look (enter number of years) years younger, or 3) I look (enter number of years) years older. Results for Items 2 and 3 are reported. The higher number of years in Item 2 implies better self-perception of age; a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. The fewer number of years in Item 3 implies better self-perception of age; a negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Periorbital Aesthetic Appearance Questionnaire (PAAQ) Total Score</title>
        <description>The PAAQ consists of 9 questions answered by the participant about their satisfaction with their eye appearance over the past 7 days. Each question is answered using a 5-point scale where: 0=Never (best) to 4=all of the time (worst). The responses to the items on the questionnaire were converted to a 100-point Rasch transformed scale score with 0 (best) to 100 (worst). Lower scores indicate higher satisfaction. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
