      Determine the effects of Apitox add-on therapy on the progression of disability in all forms&#xD;
      of multiple sclerosis (MS) utilizing the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and the MS&#xD;
      Functional Composite (MSFC) measure. b. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of add-on Apitox&#xD;

      The primary efficacy endpoints will assess the effects of Apitox add-on therapy on the&#xD;
      changes in EDSS and the MSFC measure from baseline (average Week -1 and Week 1 pre-dose) to&#xD;
      Week 16 (Visit 21) versus placebo (histamine). The primary safety endpoint will evaluate, at&#xD;
      specified visits, the effects of Apitox add-on therapy on adverse events and tolerability,&#xD;
      vital signs, clinical laboratory values, urine pregnancy test, physical exam and 12-Lead ECG.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will determine the effects of Apitox add-on therapy versus placebo on the&#xD;
      improvement in: 1. Quality of life as measured by the MSQoL-54 questionnaire at baseline&#xD;
      (average Week -1 and Week 1 pre-dose) and Weeks 3 (Visit 8), Week 10 (Visit 15), Week 15&#xD;
      (Visit 20), Week 16 (Visit 21), Week 17 (Visit 22) and Week 19 (Visit 23). 2. Ambulatory and&#xD;
      functional disability as measured by the individual Functional System Scores (FSS) at&#xD;
      baseline (average Week -1 and Week 1 pre-dose) and Visits 8, 15, 20, 21, 22 and 23. 3.&#xD;
      Progression of disability utilizing the change in EDSS and MSFC obtained at baseline (average&#xD;
      Week -1 and Week 1 1 pre-dose) and Visits 8, 15, 20, 21, 22 and 23. 3. Progression of&#xD;
      disability utilizing the change in EDSS and MSFC obtained at baseline (average Week -1 and&#xD;
      Week 1 pre-dose) and assessed at and Visits 8, 15, 20, 22 and 23. 4. Pain and physical&#xD;
      function as assessed with the Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS) and Patient&#xD;
      Global Impression of Change (PGIC) at baseline (average Week -1 and Week 1 pre-dose) and&#xD;
      Visits 8, 15, 20, 21, 22 and 23. 5. Disease status using Patient Global Assessment (PGA), and&#xD;
      Physician's Global Assessment (PhGA) at baseline (average Week -1 and Week 1 pre-dose) and&#xD;
      Visits 8, 15, 20, 21, 22 and 23. Exploratory endpoints will assess, in a subset of subjects,&#xD;
      changes in MS lesions from baseline (Week -2 or within the past 52 weeks) . Prior to&#xD;
      randomization, subjects will undergo a skin test with Apitox (50 micrograms) to exclude those&#xD;
      with systemic hypersensitivity to the product. Subjects will continue taking their regular MS&#xD;
      treatments throughout the study. During the study, subjects will receive an additional 1 gram&#xD;
      ascorbic acid per day and must not consume alcohol. After a screening period of up to 3&#xD;
      weeks, approximately 436 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either Apitox&#xD;
      (n=218) or Placebo (n=218). The fixed histamine placebo dosage was designed to be&#xD;
      sub-therapeutic and mimic the sensation of a bee sting. All injections will be administered&#xD;
      intradermally according to the schedule and anatomical sites provided in Appendix 1, twice&#xD;
      weekly for 3 weeks, and then once weekly for another 12 weeks. Each subject's starting dose&#xD;
      will be 0.2 mL (Week 1; Visit 3) and will be escalated at every visit in 0.2 mL increments up&#xD;
      to the maximum dose of 1.5 mL (1500 micrograms at Week 4; Visit 9). At Visits 9 through 20,&#xD;
      subjects will continue to receive 1.5 mL Apitox or placebo for the rest of the study. A&#xD;
      subset of the randomized subjects (n=44) will undergo MRI testing for exploratory analyses of&#xD;
      changes in MS lesions at follow-up Visit 21 (Week 16). There are 3 follow up visits (Visits&#xD;
      21, 22 and 23) at 1, 2 and 4 weeks post-treatment after the last maximum dose visit (Week 15;&#xD;
      Visit 20). During treatment, visits should be at least 3 days apart. The duration of the&#xD;
      study is up to 22 weeks that includes up to 3 weeks of screening, 15 weeks on treatment, and&#xD;
      4 weeks for follow-up visits. If a subject experiences an exacerbation of MS during the&#xD;
      study, he or she should inform the site as soon as possible. The subject's primary care&#xD;
      physician will be consulted if appropriate additional treatment can be performed at the site;&#xD;
      e.g. intravenous (IV) corticosteroids. The primary care physician and PI will determine if&#xD;
      the subject will continue in the trial. If the subject is discontinued, she or he will have&#xD;
      an early termination (ET) visit. If a subject experiences an immediate or delayed&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reaction from Apitox or histamine study treatments, the subject will undergo&#xD;
      emergency procedures described in Sections 5.4.5 and 5.4.6. Dosing will be carried out at&#xD;
      clinical sites in geographical areas with access to emergency facilities (i.e., near hospital&#xD;
      or clinic with an Emergency Care Facility). Each site has personnel trained in emergency&#xD;
      response including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and each has rescue parenteral&#xD;
      epinephrine available. Before discharge at Week 1 (Visit 3), each subject will be provided&#xD;
      epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylactic shock (e.g. EpiPen® Auto-Injector) and will be&#xD;
      advised that this should always be available to them. In the event of a severe anaphylactic&#xD;
      reaction, subjects will stop Apitox therapy and will be discontinued from the study. This&#xD;
      study will be monitored by a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC). The SMC will be comprised of&#xD;
      an independent physician, the Medical Monitor and the Investigator. The independent physician&#xD;
      is not directly affiliated with the protocol under review. The SMC will meet to review the&#xD;
      safety of subjects who participate in the trial and will meet, if required, to advise the&#xD;
      sponsor if enrollment and dose escalation should continue for a specific subject&#xD;
