  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ObsQoR-11 is an 11-item survey that was recently developed to evaluate recovery after&#xD;
      caesarean section. This has been shown to be valid, feasible, reliable and responsive to&#xD;
      changes in health status. The aim of this study to validate the ObsQoR-11 score in an Irish&#xD;
      obstetric hospital. The collection of supplemental data will allow its comparison to the&#xD;
      QoR-15 score and calculation of the MCID.&#xD;

      The investigators aim to perform a prospective observational study of term parturients&#xD;
      undergoing caesarean section. Patients undergoing elective and emergency caesarean section&#xD;
      will be eligible for inclusion. Patients will be invited to fill out the survey before their&#xD;
      caesarean section if feasible and then again at 24 and 48 hours. A subset of patients will be&#xD;
      asked to repeat the second survey 30-60 minutes later to assess test-retest reliability. The&#xD;
      patient demographics will be recorded at the initial survey. The time taken to fill out the&#xD;
      11-item ObsQoR-11 will be recorded. The QoR-15 score will also be completed at the same time&#xD;
      and will allow comparison of the scores. The patient's Global health score will be assessed&#xD;
      on a 0-100 scale from worst imaginable health state to best imaginable health state. At 24&#xD;
      and 48 hours patients will be asked to rate their overall recovery from surgery yesterday on&#xD;
      a 15-point scale ranging from -7 to +7. This will facilitate an anchor-based determination of&#xD;
      the MCID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validation of the ObsQoR-11 score will follow as per the Consensus based Standards for&#xD;
      the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) initiative. The assessment tool will&#xD;
      be evaluated under the domains of validity, reliability, responsiveness and feasibility. The&#xD;
      QoR-15 score will be similarly assessed to allow a comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validity will be assessed using two separate methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Convergent and discriminant validity - Comparison of the ObsQoR-11 score to 100mm Global&#xD;
           health score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Content validity - ObsQoR-11 will be assessed for correlation with patient age and&#xD;
           length of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability as a measure of consistency will be assessed based on the following methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Internal consistency - the averaged correlation between each of the items within&#xD;
           theObsQoR-11.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Split half reliability - assessed by evaluating the correlation between random split&#xD;
           segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test-retest reliability - a subset of patients will be reassessed at 30-60 minutes and&#xD;
           the correlation between scores assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Floor and ceiling effects - this will be evaluated by whether &lt;15% of patients achieved&#xD;
           the highest (110/110) or lowest (0/110) possible scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responsiveness is a measure of the ability to detect a clinically important change.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cohen effect size - the mean change in scores from before surgery to 24 hours after&#xD;
           surgery divided by the standard deviation at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standardised response mean - the change in the scores before surgery to 24 hours after&#xD;
           surgery divided by the standard deviation of the change in scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mean ObsQoR-11 scores - mean scores compared before surgery to 24 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of recruitment rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Successful recruitment rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Time taken to complete the ObsQoR-11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MCID will be determined based on an anchor-based method. The change in the mean score of&#xD;
      the ObsQoR-11 score will be compared to the patient's own assessment of her change in health&#xD;
      status using a Likert scale. We opted to follow a similar statistical method from an&#xD;
      influential paper for estimation of the MCID. This will be based on calculation of the 0.3 SD&#xD;
      (standard deviation), SEM (standard error of the mean) and the 5% range.&#xD;
