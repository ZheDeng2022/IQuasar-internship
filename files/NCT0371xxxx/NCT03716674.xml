    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients suffer from gait impairments responsible for falls and bad&#xD;
      quality of life: reduced speed and stride length, randomness in stride duration variability&#xD;
      (reduced Long-Range Autocorrelations (LRA)). Authors showed beneficial effects of isochronic&#xD;
      Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) on stride length and speed but a deleterious effect on&#xD;
      LRA. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to compare between 3 different RAS&#xD;
      (isochronic, random and autocorrelated) on 9 PD patients' gait parameters and stride duration&#xD;
      variability. Although the autocorrelated RAS (AC) does not improve the LRA present in the&#xD;
      stride duration variability, the AC does, however, maintain an acceptable level of LRA for PD&#xD;
      patients' gait stability. The autocorrelated RAS would therefore possibly be the best way to&#xD;
      apply auditory cueing to PD patients but this must be confirmed by future longitudinal&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basal Ganglia dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease (PD) induces gait impairment such as shorter&#xD;
      stride length, reduced gait speed, reduced arm swing and an increased randomness in stride&#xD;
      duration variability of gait cycles. This increased randomness in gait variability is a&#xD;
      typical symptom which can lead to falls, autonomy loss and reduced quality of life. Recently,&#xD;
      the Long-Range Autocorrelations (LRA) assessment allowed to emphasize the deterioration of&#xD;
      the temporal organization of PD patients' gait variability and demonstrated correlations with&#xD;
      disease severity and balance status. These LRA involve a long-memory process which means that&#xD;
      every stride depends on the duration of the previous near and far strides. Gait variability&#xD;
      should be balanced and should stay in an optimal framework between randomness and&#xD;
      over-regularity. This means that LRA should be balanced to keep the healthy adaptive&#xD;
      capabilities of the system, to be in the &quot;Optimal Movement Variability&quot; which allows the&#xD;
      person to move in a stable but still adaptive way. LRA measurement would therefore be the&#xD;
      first quantitative biomarker of gait instability and risk of falling, which is of particular&#xD;
      clinical interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now well known that PD patients have a greater gait variability with a decrease of the&#xD;
      LRA. That means that PD patients are more likely to fall which lowers the quality of life. It&#xD;
      is also well known that gait disorders do not respond well to dopaminergic pharmacological&#xD;
      treatments. Therefore, it seems important to develop non-pharmacological treatments to&#xD;
      improve LRA. Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS), by mean of a metronome, has been studied&#xD;
      for years to improve PD patients' gait. Authors showed that the use of a fixed-tempo&#xD;
      isochronic RAS reduced the stride duration variability, acting like an external rhythm&#xD;
      generator and bypassing the basal ganglia that act like an impaired internal rhythm generator&#xD;
      in PD patients. It is then suggested that a broader use of a isochronic RAS, by the mean of a&#xD;
      metronome, should be beneficial in gait rehabilitation for PD patients' gait parameters, such&#xD;
      as gait speed, stride length, stride duration variability and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it has been demonstrated that the use of a isochronic RAS decreases LRA in healthy&#xD;
      persons and also PD patient. Authors suggested that the cognitive load required by a&#xD;
      isochronic RAS would be too elevated for PD patients, creating a dual tasking and diminishing&#xD;
      its applicability in a cueing device. This RAS would compel patients to a stereotyped gait&#xD;
      instead of an adaptive autocorrelated gait. Then the question is: Should clinicians continue&#xD;
      to use an isochronic RAS by the mean of a metronome for PD patients' gait rehabilitation ? Or&#xD;
      should clinicians use autocorrelated RAS to avoid loss of adaptivity but still get the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of the metronome ? The objective of this study was to analyze the effects&#xD;
      of 3 different RAS (isochronic metronome, autocorrelated metronome and random metronome) on&#xD;
      PD patients' gait parameters and stride duration variability (magnitude and temporal&#xD;
      organization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was unicentric. Nine PD patients participated in the study and were recruited from&#xD;
      the department of Neurology of Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc (Brussels, Belgium). The&#xD;
      study was approved by the local ethics committee. All patients gave informed written consent&#xD;
      to the study. Eligibility criteria will be described in another section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were asked to walk around 4 times (1 time for each condition presented below) on an&#xD;
      oval indoor track of 42 m during 10 minutes each time to get 512 consecutive strides&#xD;
      necessary to measure the LRA. The indoor track was chosen in order to collect data in a&#xD;
      standardized way and to avoid bias linked to environmental conditions that could potentially&#xD;
      affect patients' balance, such as terrain and/or weather conditions. Two unidimensional&#xD;
      accelerometers were taped on patients' both lateral malleoli in the antero-posterior&#xD;
      direction. These accelerometers were connected to a recording device (Vitaport 3 - Temec&#xD;
      Instruments B.V., Kerkrade, The Netherlands) attached to the patients' waist. This system&#xD;
      allowed to record at 512 Hz each positive acceleration peak that correspond to each heel&#xD;
      strike. The peak of acceleration, detected by the software internally developed, determined&#xD;
      the stride duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four conditions were presented to patients in a randomized order. One condition consisted on&#xD;
      walking without any RAS (Spontaneous Condition, SC). The three other conditions were&#xD;
      respectively the Isochronic tempo RAS Condition (IC), the Random RAS Condition (RC) and the&#xD;
      Autocorrelated RAS Condition (AC). Each of these three conditions consisted in walking with&#xD;
      slight RAS which differ by their temporal organization. Each of them were composed with the&#xD;
      software Matlab 2014R (Mathworks, M.A.) and adapted to each patient according to spontaneous&#xD;
      gait speed determined by a 10m Walk Test achieved before the experiment. Consequently the IC,&#xD;
      RC and AC respectively contained no RAS variation, random variation of the RAS and&#xD;
      autocorrelated RAS organized in time and characterized by a Hurst (H) exponent = 0.80. To&#xD;
      resume, even if these three RAS had the same mean of the interbeat duration, RAS differ from&#xD;
      each other by the presence or the absence of rhythm variations (different H and alpha&#xD;
      exponents). During the experiment, patients were listening to the RAS through earphones&#xD;
      (Apple EarPods) by the mean of a MP3 player.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before data collection, patients listened to the RAS and were asked to mark the rhythm with a&#xD;
      finger tapping to see if the temporal structure of the RAS was accurately detected. After&#xD;
      this, patients were asked to &quot;walk accordingly to the proposed rhythm&quot;. A minimum of 10&#xD;
      minutes is necessary to get 512 consecutive gait cycles (number required for the application&#xD;
      of the signal processing methods detailed below). The heading direction taken by the patients&#xD;
      (clockwise or counterclockwise) was randomized between them but each patient kept the same&#xD;
      heading direction after randomization. The experiment was always performed at the same time&#xD;
      of the day for the same patient during ON phase of dopaminergic treatment to avoid drug&#xD;
      effect. Furthermore, a maximum of two conditions were tested during one day with a minimum&#xD;
      break of 5 minutes between each of the conditions to avoid a fatigue effect. Patients&#xD;
      returned a second day to perform the other 2 conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional assessments covered the 3 domains of International Classification of Functioning,&#xD;
      Disability and Health (ICF) : body functions and structures, activity and participation.&#xD;
      Assessments will be described in another section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were extracted from 512 consecutive gait cycles which is required to measure gait&#xD;
      variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spatiotemporal gait variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean gait speed, gait cadence and stride length were measured as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean gait speed (m.s-1) = Total walking distance (m)/ Acquisition duration (s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gait cadence (#steps.min-1) = Total number of steps (#)/Acquisition duration (min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step length (m) = Gait speed (m/s)*60/Gait cadence (steps/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stride duration variability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stride duration variability can be assessed 2 ways: in terms of magnitude or in terms of&#xD;
      organization (how stride duration evolves across consecutive gait cycles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnitude of the stride duration variability:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of the RAS on the magnitude of the stride duration variability during&#xD;
      512 gait cycles, the mean, the standard deviation (SD) and the coefficient of variation (CV =&#xD;
      [SD/mean] * 100) were assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temporal organization of the stride duration variability (LRA):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three methods (Rescaled Range Analysis (Hurst exponent; H), Power Spectral Density (α&#xD;
      exponent) and d relationship (d = H- [(1+ α)/2])) and the &quot;surrogate data tests&quot; were used to&#xD;
      measure LRA. The presence of LRA can be shown with a high level of proof when these 3&#xD;
      conditions are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H is greater than 0.5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  α is significantly different from 0 and less than 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  d ≤ 0.10 If an inconsistency appears between H and α, the Randomly Shuffled Surrogate&#xD;
           Data Test is applied in order to reject null hypothesis of an absence of temporal&#xD;
           structure in studied series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were treated by the mean of CVI Labwindows (C++).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses were conducted using SigmaPlot 13.0. A one-way repeated measures ANOVA&#xD;
      was applied to determine the presence or absence of effect of the various RAS on&#xD;
      spatiotemporal gait parameters (gait speed, gait cadence, stride length) and on stride&#xD;
      duration variability (linear measures (mean, SD, CV) and nonlinear measures (H exponent and&#xD;
      α)). Another one-way repeated measures ANOVA was applied to analyze the variability of the&#xD;
      inter-beat duration of the RAS (linear and nonlinear measures). When a significant difference&#xD;
      between groups was detected with the ANOVA, a post hoc Tukey Test was performed to compare&#xD;
      each mean with the other means to isolate the groups from each other. Spearman's correlation&#xD;
      coefficient was measured to analyze the link between the nonlinear measures (H, α) of the&#xD;
      stride duration and the inter-beat duration of the RAS. The results were considered&#xD;
      statistically different for p-values &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
