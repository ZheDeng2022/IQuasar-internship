  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gut microbiota may play a key role in many metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (T2D). Consumption of high-fat/high-sugar western diet seem to alter human resident&#xD;
      microbiota towards reduced genetic diversity and to influence its metabolic activity towards&#xD;
      enhanced energy extraction. Plant-based diets are effective in the treatment of T2D but it is&#xD;
      not clear whether their effect results solely from diet composition or whether it is&#xD;
      mediated, at least partly, by different microbiota and its metabolic activity. One possible&#xD;
      therapeutic approach is replacement of &quot;pro-diabetic&quot; microbiota with its &quot;healthy&quot; variant&#xD;
      but what the &quot;healthy&quot; microbiota is and under which conditions this microbiota could stay&#xD;
      stable and functional is not known. The aim of the proposed study is to identify possible&#xD;
      metagenome/metabolome characteristics in different human cohorts (T2D vs vegans), to assess&#xD;
      the stability of vegan microbiota in T2D-like environment and to evaluate the possibility to&#xD;
      influence human T2D microbiota/metabolome towards more protective composition by dietary&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

      The aim of this project is to study the possibilities of gut microbiota manipulation in type&#xD;
      2 diabetes (T2D) towards more beneficial genetic and metabolic profile. This study address&#xD;
      several issues. First, identification of specific metagenome/metabolome features&#xD;
      characteristic for human cohorts with different risk of T2D development. Second, the&#xD;
      resilience of microbiota associated with beneficial metabolic phenotype in pro-diabetogenic&#xD;
      environment and the possibility to support its survival by prebiotic treatment. Third,&#xD;
      development of the method for personalized prediction of the effectivity of prebiotic&#xD;
      treatment in T2D patients and the evaluation of the benefit of long-term prebiotic&#xD;
      administration in responders´ subpopulation. The project will be realized in three work&#xD;
      packages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP1: Observation study focused on the description of gut microbiome and metabolome in obese&#xD;
      type 2 diabetics, vegans and obese but otherwise healthy omnivores and identification of key&#xD;
      markers specific for these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP2: Study focused on the interaction of vegan microbiota and pro-diabetogenic (western-type)&#xD;
      diet and on the effects of prebiotic supplementation in germ-free animals. In addition, the&#xD;
      effect of diet-alone and the effect of standardized Schaedler flora will be tested as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP3: The identification of predictive markers indicative for the benefit of prebiotic&#xD;
      treatment in the individual context (T2D cohort) and second, long-term human intervention&#xD;
      study in the selected responders´ group aimed on the possibility of therapeutic modulation of&#xD;
      gut microbiome/ metabolome by prebiotics. Only WP3 is subjected to clinical trial&#xD;
      registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP 3: Identification of T2D subpopulations according to their susceptibility to dietary fiber&#xD;
      intervention Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Are there different subpopulations within T2D subjects that differ in their ability to&#xD;
           increase SCFA production in response to prebiotic supplementation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is it possible to identify these subpopulations (&quot;responders&quot; vs &quot;non-responders&quot;) by&#xD;
           simple intervention test?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is this phenomenon associated with specific microbiota composition?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Within &quot;responder&quot; subpopulation, is it possible to manipulate fecal&#xD;
           metabolome/metagenome towards more beneficial composition by long-term prebiotic&#xD;
           intervention? In order to fulfill this task microbiome characterization of T2D cohort in&#xD;
           WP1 will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of WP3 is to provide the proof of concept that a diet enriched with specific&#xD;
      prebiotics improves the specific (SCFA) metabolite production and that the beneficial effect&#xD;
      is dependent on pre-existing microbiota composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute intervention test (&quot;inulin test&quot;) The participants enrolled into T2D cohort will be&#xD;
      asked to participate in short-term intervention test. They will be provided the prebiotic and&#xD;
      instructed on the test procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: sample the stool (&quot;sample 1&quot;); step 2: take the dose (20 g) of inulin; step 3: during&#xD;
      following three days collect sample of feces at each defecation. The samples will be analyzed&#xD;
      by NMR and mass spectrometry with special respect to SCFA content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary readout: The magnitude of SCFA content elevation after the bolus prebiotic&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary readout: The potential association between the response to prebiotic bolus and&#xD;
      microbiota composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term intervention study Based on the results of acute inulin intervention test, the&#xD;
      subgroups of most pronounced &quot;responders&quot; and &quot;non-responders&quot; will be selected (defined as&#xD;
      both extreme tertiles of the group, at least 10 subjects are expected to be enrolled per&#xD;
      subgroup). Participants from both subgroups will be asked to take part in three months&#xD;
      intervention study when they will be administered 10 g of inulin prebiotic (FAN s.r.o.,&#xD;
      Tišice 225, 27715 Tišice) on every-day basis. Prior and at the end of the intervention&#xD;
      period, the participants will be subjected to metabolic characterization, indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry and assessment of intestine permeability. Feces samples will be collected before&#xD;
      the study and then after each month for 16S rRNA sequencing, NMR spectroscopy and mass&#xD;
      spectrometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary readout:&#xD;
&#xD;
      gut microbiome and fecal, urine and plasma metabolome composition of feces&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary readouts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. metabolic characteristics: basal blood tests (glucose, lipid profile, NEFA, insulin,&#xD;
           C-peptide); twostep hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp; indirect calorimetry with energy&#xD;
           expenditure and respiratory quotient&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. intestinal permeability markers: serum content of bacterial endotoxin, D-lactate,&#xD;
           endotoxin core antibody, iFABP and citrulline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome: validation of short prebiotic intervention test as a tool for prediction of&#xD;
      the efficiency and benefit of long-term prebiotic supplementation; evaluation of the benefit&#xD;
      of long-term prebiotic supplementation in T2D &quot;responder&quot; subgroup.&#xD;
