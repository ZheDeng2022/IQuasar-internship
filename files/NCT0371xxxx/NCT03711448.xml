  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common form of vasculitis after age 50. It is a&#xD;
      vasculitis affecting the large vessels, in particular the aorta and its collateral vessels,&#xD;
      especially those in the external carotid area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroids are the cornerstone of GCA treatment. They are very effective but are&#xD;
      generally continued for 18 to 24 months or more since at least 30% of patients with GCA will&#xD;
      relapse during their follow-up. Thus, the vast majority of patients treated for GCA have at&#xD;
      least one adverse event from corticosteroid therapy, which is the main source of morbidity in&#xD;
      these elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reducing the use of corticosteroids, especially during relapses, is therefore a major&#xD;
      objective to improve the treatment of patients with GCA. Methotrexate, abatacept and&#xD;
      tocilizumab have been shown to be effective during GCA. However, the therapeutic effect of&#xD;
      the first two is modest. As for tocilizumab, its use has many limitations: suspensive effect,&#xD;
      many contraindications and there are no biological parameters available for reliable&#xD;
      monitoring of inflammatory syndrome in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data have shown the major role of T helper (Th) Th1 and Th17 T cells in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of GCA. Th17 lymphocytes are sensitive to corticosteroid therapy but Th1&#xD;
      persists despite treatment and produces interferon-γ which activates macrophages and smooth&#xD;
      muscle cells, leading to remodelling of the vascular wall responsible for ischemic GCA&#xD;
      manifestations. Joint targeting of Th17 and Th1 responses is therefore necessary to fully&#xD;
      treat the vascular inflammation that exists during GCA. Ustekinumab, which is a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody blocking the subunit common to IL-12 and IL-23 (p40), blocks the Th1 and Th17&#xD;
      responses, and could therefore be an excellent treatment for GCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab for the treatment of GCA relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very little data is available on the use of ustekinumab during GCA. Recently, 14 patients&#xD;
      with refractory GCA, defined as the occurrence of at least 2 relapses and the inability to&#xD;
      reduce the prednisone dose below 10 mg/d, received ustekinumab treatment. No patients&#xD;
      relapsed during treatment while the median dose of prednisone was reduced from 20 to 5 mg/d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ustekinumab has also been used successfully in a patient with refractory GCA. Under&#xD;
      treatment, the patient did not have a new relapse and the dose of prednisone was reduced. In&#xD;
      addition, there was a major decrease in the percentages of circulating Th1 and Th17&#xD;
      lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, to date, no controlled studies have been conducted to confirm the efficacy of&#xD;
      ustekinumab during GCA relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This guarantees the originality and innovation of this study.&#xD;
