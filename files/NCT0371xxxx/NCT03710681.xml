  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiple dose escalating and open labeled clinical trial to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of&#xD;
      SHR-1314 in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of multiple&#xD;
      doses of subcutaneous SHR-1314 in subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity profile of&#xD;
      SHR-1314 in subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      16 subjects with 2 dose groups will be enrolled in the study, all of whom received the&#xD;
      SHR-1314 without placebo control. There are 8 subjects in each cohort. The dose will be&#xD;
      started at 160mg and will be escalated by following dose escalating rules. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is the safety and tolerability : adverse events, vital signs, physical examination,&#xD;
      laboratory examination, 12 lead electrocardiogram, injection site reactions, etc.&#xD;
