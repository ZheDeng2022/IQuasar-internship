    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility of using differentially methylated insulin DNA, a&#xD;
      biomarker of beta cell death, in determining the time course of beta cell death and&#xD;
      development of diabetes in people with cystic fibrosis. Study participants with cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis and healthy control participants will have a blood sample drawn in order to measure&#xD;
      the levels of differentially methylated insulin DNA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) causes increased morbidity and mortality in people&#xD;
      with cystic fibrosis (CF). The prevalence of CFRD increases with age. While CFRD is diagnosed&#xD;
      in only 2 percent of children under 10 year sof age, it is present in 19 percent of&#xD;
      adolescents and up to 50 percent of adults with CF. Although CFRD is uncommon in children,&#xD;
      recent animal and human studies have shown that milder glycemic abnormalities are common in&#xD;
      infants and young children with CF. One of the proposed mechanisms for early glucose&#xD;
      dysregulation in CF is related to ongoing beta cell death that may start at a very early age.&#xD;
      The assay to be used in this study measures differentially methylated insulin DNA, released&#xD;
      exclusively by beta cells, to determine levels of beta cell death. This assay has been shown&#xD;
      to detect beta cell death in individuals at risk of developing type 1 diabetes. If this assay&#xD;
      successfully detects beta cell death in individuals with CF, the investigators can identify&#xD;
      critical time points of beta cell loss in people with CF. Understanding how and when glycemic&#xD;
      dysregulation occurs in CF will lead to better treatment of CFRD in the future.&#xD;
