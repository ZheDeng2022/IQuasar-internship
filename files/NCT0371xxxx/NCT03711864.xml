  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with multiple myeloma with recurrent or refractory BCMA, CAR-T cell infusion was&#xD;
      performed after screening, blood collection and pretreatment. Starting dose for 5 x 10^5 /&#xD;
      kg, 1 x 10^6 doses sequentially. If dose-limiting toxicity is not observed in 3 patients in a&#xD;
      dose group, the next dose group test can be performed; If more than 2/3 of patients (2 cases,&#xD;
      included) in a dose group had DLT, dose-escalation was not performed. If 1 case of DLT (1/3)&#xD;
      appears in the first 3 patients of a dose group, 3 patients need to be added to the dose&#xD;
      group (at this time, there are 6 patients in the group).&#xD;

      allowed. Researchers and bidders to form drug safety monitoring committee (SRC), every dose&#xD;
      group of subjects to complete the DLT observation period, after summarizing the security of&#xD;
      this dose group, determine the test of the next dose, subjects such as draw up the highest&#xD;
      dose group safety tolerance, SRC to decide whether to continue to increase the dose group of&#xD;
      research, finally according to have obtained all the safety and efficacy of dose group&#xD;
