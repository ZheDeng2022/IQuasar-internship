  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase II trial to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of PTK 0796 in the treatment of&#xD;
      complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacologic profile of PTK 0796 in humans suggests that it has the potential to be used&#xD;
      safely and effectively for this indication. Data from in vitro and animal studies support&#xD;
      this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PTK 0796-CSSI-0702 the safety and efficacy of PTK 0796 in the treatment of cSSSI will be&#xD;
      compared to an antibiotic approved for this indication by FDA. Initial treatment will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously with the option for subsequent oral treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Clinical response is defined as clinical success (CS), which is categorized as a determination by a blinded evaluator (BE) that the infection had sufficiently resolved such that antibiotics were no longer needed, the participant (par.) received ≥1 dose of test article, the par. did not receive non-study antibiotics on &gt;2 calendar days from Day 1 to the Test of Cure assessment, and the par. did not meet any of the criteria for clinical failure. Clinical failure (CF) is categorized as a determination by a BE that the infection had responded inadequately such that alternative antibiotics were needed, the BE discontinued test article due to an adverse event that was possibly/probably related to test article, the primary site of infection was surgically removed, or the par. received potentially effective antibiotics for treatment of the primary infection site on &gt;2 days after study enrollment. A classification of indeterminate is used for any outcome that was not classified as CS or CF.</description>

        <description>Clinical response is defined as clinical success (CS), which is categorized as a determination by a blinded evaluator (BE) that the infection had sufficiently resolved such that antibiotics were no longer needed, the participant (par.) received ≥1 dose of test article, the par. did not receive non-study antibiotics on &gt;2 calendar days from Day 1 to the Test of Cure assessment, and the par. did not meet any of the criteria for clinical failure. Clinical failure (CF) is categorized as a determination by a BE that the infection had responded inadequately such that alternative antibiotics were needed, the BE discontinued test article due to an adverse event that was possibly/probably related to test article, the primary site of infection was surgically removed, or the par. received potentially effective antibiotics for treatment of the primary infection site on &gt;2 days after study enrollment.
