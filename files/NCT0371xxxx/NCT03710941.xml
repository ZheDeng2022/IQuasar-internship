  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of REGN2477+REGN1033 in&#xD;
      combination on total lean mass, as measured by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in&#xD;
      patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of REGN2477+REGN1033 on the IBM-Functional Rating Scale&#xD;
           (IBM-FRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of REGN2477+REGN1033 on the sIBM Physical Functioning&#xD;
           Assessment (sIFA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of REGN2477+REGN1033&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effects of REGN2477+REGN1033 on body composition by DXA, including&#xD;
           appendicular lean mass and total fat mass&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of REGN2477+REGN1033 on measures of muscle performance and&#xD;
           physical function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of REGN2477+REGN1033 on patient reported outcome measures&#xD;
           including the fear of falling, falls and near falls, and health-related quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic(s) (PK) profile of REGN2477+REGN1033, including&#xD;
           functional REGN2477 and functional REGN1033 concentrations in serum over time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of REGN2477+REGN1033&#xD;
