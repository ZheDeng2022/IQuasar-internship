  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the fact that a substantial number of school age children struggle with both reading&#xD;
      and math acquisition, the brain mechanisms of the overlapping aspects of reading and math&#xD;
      skills, thought in part to be linked via executive functions (EF), have not been unpacked.&#xD;
      This project will use a longitudinal design, following children from Kindergarten through 1st&#xD;
      grade, to understand how the brain networks associated with reading, math, and EF interact to&#xD;
      predict academic outcomes and, in those who struggle academically, intervention response.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This longitudinal study will be conducted with 260 Kindergartners, staggered across multiple&#xD;
      cohorts, who are followed through 1st grade. There will be three time points of testing for&#xD;
      each cohort: fall of Kindergarten, spring of Kindergarten, and in the fall of 1st grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the third testing time point, in the fall of 1st grade, the bottom 1/3 of readers in&#xD;
      the sample will be selected to participate in the intervention arm of the study. These&#xD;
      students will be randomly placed in one of two arms: business-as-usual, in which children&#xD;
      receive no additional instruction; or the reading intervention condition, in which they&#xD;
      receive 20 hours of 1:1 reading intervention over 6 weeks. Children in both sub-sample arms&#xD;
      are assessed again after tutoring is complete, in the spring of 1st grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroimaging through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI) will occur as part of study participation in conjunction with testing at fall&#xD;
      of Kindergarten, fall of 1st grade, and spring of 1st grade time points.&#xD;
