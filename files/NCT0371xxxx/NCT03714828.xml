    <textblock>
      This is single arm a Phase 2, single center study of talimogene laherparepvec (TVEC) to treat&#xD;
      low risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out more about talimogene laherparepvec (also known as&#xD;
      OncoVEXGM-CSF or IMLYGIC®) in people with a healthy immune system with confirmed low-risk&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma. Usually, low-risk SCC is treated with a surgical procedure, but&#xD;
      surgery can be challenging when patients have: multiple SCCs on their body, when the SCC is&#xD;
      on a challenging place on the body to remove or when patients are older or have diseases that&#xD;
      place them at risk for surgery related complications. Immune therapy is a treatment that uses&#xD;
      certain parts of a person's immune system to fight disease. Immune therapy is a proven&#xD;
      therapeutic approach in many cancers, including melanoma, another type of skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Talimogene laherparepvec (TVEC) is made from a modified herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1,&#xD;
      the &quot;cold sore&quot; virus). The virus' genes were modified in a laboratory so that it produces a&#xD;
      protein called human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which&#xD;
      multiplies and grows in tumor cells. Human GM-CSF is normally produced by various cells&#xD;
      within the body and is used as a medicine to treat patients with white blood cell counts that&#xD;
      are too low. This modified HSV-1 produces a protein that acts on tumor cells and stimulates&#xD;
      the immune system. TVEC is administered by injection with a needle directly into one or more&#xD;
      tumors and works by directly destroying cancer cells and enhancing immune response to destroy&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;
