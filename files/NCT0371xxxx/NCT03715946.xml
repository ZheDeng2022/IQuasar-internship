  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will evaluate a new combination of treatments for Oropharyngeal Squamous&#xD;
      Cell cancers (OPSCC), and compare it to the current standard of care (concurrent,&#xD;
      platinum-based chemoradiotherapy). Chemoradiotherapy is efficacious, but also associated with&#xD;
      significant toxicities and is only suitable for patients with good performance status and&#xD;
      without severe comorbidities. The purpose of this trial is to demonstrate equivalent&#xD;
      oncologic outcome with fewer adverse effects and improved quality of life when compared to&#xD;
      the standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to enroll 135 patients (male and female, age 18+) who are newly diagnosed&#xD;
      with resectable, squamous cell carcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma of the oropharynx.&#xD;
      Survival rate and treatment response of OPSCC varies based on HPV infection status and&#xD;
      genotype; therefore, in this study, only patients who are HPV seropositive and have HPV type&#xD;
      16 will be enrolled. All patients will receive the same treatment, i.e. there is no active&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, patients will undergo transoral surgery followed by de-intensified adjuvant&#xD;
      radiotherapy plus nivolumab. The radiotherapy will consist of 45 or 50 Gy (depending on tumor&#xD;
      volume) in 25 daily fractions, 6 fractions per week. Nivolumab will be administered at a&#xD;
      fixed dose of 240 mg over 30 minutes IV every 2 weeks during radiotherapy, and at 480 mg over&#xD;
      60 minutes IV every 4 weeks for 6 doses after radiotherapy. The first dose will be given&#xD;
      prior to the first fraction of radiation (Day 1) on Day -3 (+/- 2 days), and continued every&#xD;
      2 weeks (+/- 2 days). Nivolumab will thus be given in weeks 2 and 4 of radiotherapy. Adjuvant&#xD;
      nivolumab will then be given for a total of 6 additional doses after the completion of&#xD;
      radiotherapy every 4 weeks (+/- 7 days), starting in the second or third week after the&#xD;
      completion of radiotherapy. Doses of nivolumab may be interrupted, delayed, or discontinued&#xD;
      depending on how well the subject tolerates the treatment. Relevant outcome measures include&#xD;
      disease free survival (2 year post surgery); percutaneous gastronomy dependence (1-year&#xD;
      postsurgery); acute and late toxicity; patient-reported Quality of Life measures,&#xD;
      locoregional control and distant metastatic control.&#xD;

    <measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head and Neck Cancer (FACT-H&amp;N) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after completion of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-H&amp;N (version 4)17 consists of a cancer-specific questionnaire, FACT-G, in addition to 12 H&amp;N cancer-specific items (the HN subscale). FACT-G is a 27-item measure that assesses general cancer quality of life. The FACT-G contains 4 subscales: physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being. Individuals are asked to indicate how true 27 statements are for them, using the past 7 days as the timeframe. Responses range from not at all (0), to very much (4) on a 5-point scale.</description>

    <measure>MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for head and neck cancer (MDASI-HN)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after completion of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>MDASI-HN measures treatment related symptom burden in head and neck cancer patients. The 20-item MDASI measures both severity and burden of symptoms and their effect on patients' daily activities, using a numeric rating scale of 0-10. This instrument includes 13 core symptoms and 9 head and neck specific items. Higher scores indicate superior perception of function.</description>

    <description>The MDADI measures swallowing-related quality of life (QOL) in patients with swallowing dysfunction in a 20 - item written questionnaire. It evaluates the patient's physical (P), emotional (E) and functional (F) perceptions of swallowing dysfunction. This instrument has been psychometrically validated in head and neck cancer patients. Higher scores indicate superior perception of swallowing function.</description>

    <measure>Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after completion of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The VHI-10 is a patient self-assessment instrument that quantifies patients' perception of their voice handicap. It evaluates patient's physical (P), emotional (E), and functional (F) perceptions of voice and has shown to be highly reliable for internal consistency and test-retest stability. The VHI-10 utilizes a 10-item questionnaire in which the patient circles the response that most accurately reflects his or her own experience on a linear scale (from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;always&quot;). &quot;Always&quot; response is scored 4 points, a &quot;Never&quot; response is scored 0. The remaining options are scored between 1 and 3 points. The tallied number of points for each of the subscales is computed to a total composite score. The patient's values are compared to published norms.</description>

    <measure>Performance Status Scale (PSS-HN)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after completion of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Performance Status Scale (PSS-HN) is a clinician-rated instrument consisting of 3 questions: normalcy of diet, public eating/swallowing, and understandability of speech subscales in patients with head and neck cancer. Each subscale is rated from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better performance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Barium Swallow (MBS) rating</measure>

These have been selected as universal items generally reported by swallowing clinicians that have been shown to significantly predict pneumonia in patients with oropharyngeal cancers. Prevalence of these dysphagia endpoints will be estimated at each time point.</description>
