  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive meningococcal disease and meningococcal meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis&#xD;
      have their highest incidence in children, with a second peak in adolescents and young adults.&#xD;
      The most important disease-causing serogroups are meningococcal serogroups A (MenA) and MenC&#xD;
      in Asia, such as China. The specific vaccine use in each country depends on the predominant&#xD;
      serogroups, cost, and availability. conjugate vaccines are preferred to polysaccharide&#xD;
      vaccines due to their impact on decreasing nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis and&#xD;
      their overall increased immunogenicity in children. This clinical trial is planning to&#xD;
      evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of bivalent meningococcal serogroups A and C tetanus&#xD;
      toxoid conjugate vaccine in Chinese healthy children aged 3 months to 5 years.&#xD;

      Invasive meningococcal disease and meningococcal meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis&#xD;
      have their highest incidence in children, with a second peak in adolescents and young adults.&#xD;
      The most important disease-causing serogroups are meningococcal serogroups A (MenA), MenB,&#xD;
      MenC, MenW and MenY. Their prevalence varies geographically, MenA and MenC being more&#xD;
      prominent in Asia. Neisseria meningitidis is one of the leading causes of bacterial&#xD;
      meningitis globally. The annual number of cases related to invasive meningococcal disease&#xD;
      (IMD) is estimated to be at least 1.2 million with 135 000 deaths.1 To combat IMD, an&#xD;
      increasing number of countries have included vaccines against N. meningitidis in their&#xD;
      routine immunization programs. The specific vaccine use in each country depends on the&#xD;
      predominant serogroups, cost, and availability. Polysaccharide vaccines were used in high&#xD;
      risk people in Saudi Arabia and Syria and in routine immunization in China and Egypt. In&#xD;
      general, conjugate vaccines are preferred to polysaccharide vaccines due to their impact on&#xD;
      decreasing nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis and their overall increased&#xD;
      immunogenicity in children. This clinical trial is planning to evaluate the immunogenicity&#xD;
      and safety of bivalent meningococcal serogroups A and C tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine in&#xD;
      Chinese healthy children aged 3 months to 5 years.&#xD;
