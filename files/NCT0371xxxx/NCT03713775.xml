    <textblock>
      Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects over 1 million individuals in the UK and results&#xD;
      in costs of over £450 million per year to the National Health Service (NHS). Current rhythm&#xD;
      control strategies are limited by high recurrences of AF. New strategies tackling more&#xD;
      upstream pathophysiological mechanisms are most needed. The incidence and prevalence of AF&#xD;
      markedly increase with age, whilst obesity is the strongest modifiable risk factor for AF.&#xD;
      Preliminary data in relatively young patients suggest that weight loss programmes may reduce&#xD;
      AF burden and improve AF-related symptoms. Such programmes could be a widely-applicable and&#xD;
      cost-effective option in AF management if they are also effective in elderly patients with&#xD;
      AF, particularly if they also improve physical performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The aim of this study is to investigate whether, in older overweight/obese AF patients,&#xD;
      referral to a weight loss programme with meal replacement &amp; behavioral support can reduce&#xD;
      AF-recurrences and improve physical performance compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Parallel-group, open-label, multi-centre randomised controlled trial. Elderly&#xD;
      individuals (60-85 years) with persistent AF and elevated body mass index (BMI; ≥ 27 kg/m2)&#xD;
      will be recruited. Participants will be randomly allocated (1:1) to (a) referral to a meal&#xD;
      replacement programme with behavioral support (intervention) or (b) usual care (control) for&#xD;
      32-to-36 weeks. The primary endpoints are AF recurrence and physical performance test (PPT)&#xD;
      score. Participants randomised to the study intervention will be referred to a commercial&#xD;
      provider (CP) providing the intervention. The co-primary endpoints of AF recurrence &amp; PPT&#xD;
      score will be analysed irrespective of compliance during the scheduled treatment period&#xD;
      following an intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, and is associated with a&#xD;
      two-fold increase in the risk of premature death. Morbidity and mortality related to stroke,&#xD;
      heart failure, myocardial infarction, and reduced quality of life, are all common in patients&#xD;
      with AF. AF therefore represents a burgeoning public health problem, affecting over 1 million&#xD;
      patients in the UK and resulting in estimated costs of over £450 million per annum. The main&#xD;
      drivers of AF-related costs are hospitalizations (over £270 million for admissions annually)&#xD;
      and outpatient encounters (approximately £50 million for General Practitioner consultations&#xD;
      and £36 million for specialist clinic referrals annually)11. Recurrence of AF remains a&#xD;
      clinical challenge despite pharmacological and interventional rhythm control strategies.&#xD;
      Moreover, currently available therapies have not been consistently shown to reduce AF&#xD;
      recurrence and the risk of major adverse events, or to improve long-term prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence and prevalence of AF are closely linked to increasing age and excess weight. On&#xD;
      one hand, advanced age is the most important non-modifiable risk factor for AF and the&#xD;
      corollary is that AF is associated with frailty and impaired physical function. Meanwhile,&#xD;
      excess weight is of particular interest as results from four large community-based European&#xD;
      studies clearly demonstrated that elevated body mass index (BMI) is the strongest modifiable&#xD;
      risk factor for incident AF. A large-scale observational cohort study reported a 4% increase&#xD;
      in AF-risk per 1-unit increase in body mass index (BMI) after adjustment for cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors and interim myocardial infarction or heart failure. Moreover, a recent Mendelian&#xD;
      randomization study confirmed a causal relationship between increased BMI and incident AF.&#xD;
      The precise mechanisms by which obesity increases the risk of development and maintenance of&#xD;
      AF are incompletely understood; potential contributors include left atrial (LA) enlargement,&#xD;
      left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, altered cardiac energetics, and&#xD;
      inflammatory/oxidative signalling from the epicardial adipose tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very low calorie diets, providing less than 800 kcal/d have been used for many years as&#xD;
      highly effective methods for inducing weight loss, leading to consistent reductions in&#xD;
      visceral fat and overall adiposity. A systematic review showed weight loss at 1 year of 8-14&#xD;
      kg, which was 4.3 kg (95% CI: 1.1 kg, 7.4 kg) greater than the comparator interventions. The&#xD;
      historical limitation of very low calorie diets has historically been long-term&#xD;
      effectiveness, and there has been growing interest in the use of total meal replacement&#xD;
      sachets as part of a wider behavioural programme. This includes individualised one-to-one&#xD;
      counselling to motivate and encourage adherence to the diet, as well as support to establish&#xD;
      a healthy eating plan when individuals reintroduce food. Results from DiRECT (a&#xD;
      cluster-randomised trial assessing a meal replacement programme in patients with type II&#xD;
      diabetes) were published recently in The Lancet: the intervention arm reached an average&#xD;
      weight loss of 10 kg at 1 year with 45% of individuals achieving complete remission of type&#xD;
      II diabetes, which is also a relevant risk factor for AF. Preliminary data suggest that such&#xD;
      a programme proved highly effective in reducing AF symptoms in a relatively young group of AF&#xD;
      patients where the diet resulted in significant weight loss (&gt;10kg) sustained to 15 months.&#xD;
      However, it remains unclear whether the beneficial effects of weight loss translate in (a)&#xD;
      reducing AF recurrences and (b) whether they also extend to the more typical elderly patient&#xD;
      population with AF, as reversing cardiac remodelling may prove more difficult in aged hearts.&#xD;
      Additionally, the balance between beneficial and detrimental effects of weight loss in the&#xD;
      elderly may be dependent on preservation of muscle strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether, in older overweight/obese AF patients,&#xD;
      referral to a weight loss programme with meal replacement &amp; behavioral support can reduce&#xD;
      AF-recurrences and improve physical performance compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a parallel-group, open-label, randomized controlled study to determine whether&#xD;
      substantial weight reduction through referral to a weight loss programme with meal&#xD;
      replacement &amp; behavioral support in older patients who are overweight/obese with persistent&#xD;
      AF can reduce AF recurrences and symptoms and improve the adverse cardiometabolic profile and&#xD;
      physical performance. The expected duration of such programme is approximately 8 months, with&#xD;
      a total of two study visits (at baseline and at 8 months). AF recurrence (primary endpoint)&#xD;
      is defined as either failure to recover sinus rhythm in response to direct current&#xD;
      cardioversion (DCCV), or relapse of any ECG-confirmed episode of atrial arrhythmia at any&#xD;
      time between the DCCV-day and the 8 month follow-up visit (e.g. at routine clinical follow-up&#xD;
      post-cardioversion, a follow-up clinic appointment, hospitalization or ED attendance, etc).&#xD;
      The co-primary endpoints of AF recurrence and physical performance will be assessed at&#xD;
      approximately 8 months after the commencement of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly individuals (60-85 years) with elevated BMI (≥27 kg/m2), who are scheduled for a DCCV&#xD;
      with a diagnosis of persistent AF will be recruited. Participants will be randomised (1:1) to&#xD;
      (a) weight loss programme for a total of ~8 months (intervention) or (b) usual care; i.e.,&#xD;
      nurse-based consultation and supporting written material (control). All participants will&#xD;
      undergo a baseline visit (prior to randomisation) and a follow-up visit at ~8 months. Both&#xD;
      study visits will include a physical performance test (PPT), AF symptom assessment using the&#xD;
      AFSS score, anthropometric measurements, quality of life assessment, Patient Health-Resource&#xD;
      Use Questionnaire (PRUQ), MR scan, and blood sample collection. Additionally, prolonged ECG&#xD;
      monitoring, a cardiac CT scan, and patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) will also be&#xD;
      acquired at the 8-month visit. Finally, at approximately 4 months patients will be asked to&#xD;
      complete interim questionnaires (including PRUQ, PROMs, Quality of Life) by post/telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the LOSE-AF trial, the intervention is at very low risk of adverse events and no Trial&#xD;
      Steering Committee or Clinical Trial Authorization is required. The study will be coordinated&#xD;
      by the Data Management Group (DMG), consisting of 2 study investigators (medically qualified&#xD;
      clinicians), CTSU statistician, and the research nurse. The DMG will be responsible for the&#xD;
      day-to-day management of the study. The DMG will meet bi-annually (quorum of 2) to monitor&#xD;
      and discuss the overall progress and conduct of the study, with particular attention to&#xD;
      participant safety, data quality, and value to the public. Copies of all meeting agendas,&#xD;
      papers and minutes will be retained in the Study Master File. Finally, 2 members of the PPI&#xD;
      advisory group will join the DMG yearly.&#xD;
