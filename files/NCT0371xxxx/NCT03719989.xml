    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial aims at evaluating the efficacy and safety of azacitidine&#xD;
      followed by rituximab-GDP immunochemotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse&#xD;
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Patients who were treated with from 1 to 4 lines of prior&#xD;
      therapies for relapsed/refractory DLBCL wee eligible. azacitidine will be treated one week&#xD;
      prior to conventional rituximab-gemcitabine, dexamethasone, cisplatin (R-GDP)&#xD;
      immunochemotherapy. Patients will be treated every 21 days as one cycle, and up to 6 cycles.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is objective response rate according to the Lugano&#xD;
      response criteria for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and secondary endpoints are safety, complete&#xD;
      response, progression-free survival, and overall survival.&#xD;

      This phase II clinical trial aims at evaluating the efficacy and safety of azacitidine&#xD;
      followed by rituximab-GDP immunochemotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse&#xD;
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This study is designed with the expectation of correction of&#xD;
      aberrant hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes by preceding use of low dose azacitidine&#xD;
      thereby re-sensitizing chemosensitivity of tumor cells. Patients who were treated with from 1&#xD;
      to 4 lines of prior therapies for relapsed/refractory DLBCL wee eligible. Planned initial&#xD;
      doses of the current regimen are as follows;&#xD;
&#xD;
      azacitidine S.C 25 mg/m2 D1,2,3,4,5 rituximab I.V. 375 mg/m2 D8 gemcitabine I.V. 1,000 mg/m2,&#xD;
      D8,15 dexamethasone I.V. or P.O. 40 mg D8,9,10,11 cisplatin 70 mg/m2 I.V. D8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated every 21 days as one cycle, and up to 6 cycles of treatment will be&#xD;
      conducted. Especially, first 3~6 patients will be regarded as 'lead-in safety cohort' and&#xD;
      their safety will be reviewed by an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB). The&#xD;
      primary endpoint of this study is objective response rate according to the Lugano response&#xD;
      criteria for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and secondary endpoints are safety, complete response,&#xD;
      progression-free survival, and overall survival.&#xD;
