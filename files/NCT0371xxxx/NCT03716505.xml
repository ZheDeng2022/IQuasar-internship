  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of the study is to investigate if the use of gammaCore Sapphire™ device reduces&#xD;
      the number of migraines preventatively.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective randomized, multi-center, double-blind, parallel, sham-controlled&#xD;
      study, designed for comparison of two parallel groups, gammaCore®-Sapphire (active treatment)&#xD;
      and a sham (inactive) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period will begin with a four-week run-in period, during which there is no&#xD;
      investigational treatment. The purpose of the run-in period will be to establish a baseline&#xD;
      of the subject's headache/migraine history for longitudinal comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The run-in period will be followed by a 12-week randomized period when the subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized (1:1) to either active treatment or sham (inactive) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will dose themselves 3 times per day for 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>GammaCore Sapphire™ is a handheld, non-invasive, low voltage electrical device which stimulates the vagus nerve by producing weak 120 second electrical stimulation cycles that may help reduce, ease, lessen or stop your migraine symptoms. GammaCore Sapphire™ has been approved for the treatment of headache, including migraine by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</description>
