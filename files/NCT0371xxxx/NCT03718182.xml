  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are around 115,000 people in the United Kingdom suffering with Crohn's Disease (CD). CD&#xD;
      can cause inflammation and ulcers to develop anywhere within the gut. Symptoms of the disease&#xD;
      include diarrhoea, abdominal pain and nutritional problems including vitamin D deficiency.&#xD;
      Around half of people with CD are likely to have vitamin D deficiency. Research has shown&#xD;
      that treating vitamin D deficiency in people with CD might help to improve the symptoms of&#xD;
      the disease. However, there are no clear guidelines on how to detect or treat vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency in people with CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two parts to the planned research involving three hospitals in Birmingham. Part&#xD;
      1 is a vitamin D screening study, where adults will be asked to have a finger-prick blood&#xD;
      test to check their vitamin D levels. They will complete short diet and lifestyle&#xD;
      questionnaires. Adults found to have vitamin D deficiency in part 1 may be invited to join&#xD;
      part 2 of the research. Part 2 is a vitamin D supplementation study where participants will&#xD;
      be given a daily vitamin D capsule to take by mouth for 6 months. They will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to 2 different groups with each group receiving a different dose of vitamin D.&#xD;
      Participants will have blood tests at the start, after 3 months and after 6 months. They will&#xD;
      complete quality of life questionnaires at the start and after 6 months. The last appointment&#xD;
      will be a final follow up appointment after 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is important to help determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which dose of vitamin D is most effective at treating vitamin D deficiency in people&#xD;
           with CD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If symptoms of CD improve when vitamin D deficiency is treated.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>D-CODE is a two part trial entailing two vitamin D screening studies (winter and summer) and an interventional feasibility study.&#xD;
The vitamin D screening studies will take place during the winter and summer months to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with CD throughout the seasons.&#xD;
In the intervention/feasibility stage D-CODE is an exploratory study for an open label, multi-site, superiority randomised controlled trial. Participants will be randomised to one of two parallel arms (A or B)</intervention_model_description>
