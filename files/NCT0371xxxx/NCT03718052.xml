  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infective endocarditis (IE) is associated with an overall in-hospital mortality rate of&#xD;
      15-25% and a high incidence of embolic events (20-50%). Leading causes of mortality are heart&#xD;
      failure (HF) resulting from valve dysfunction, and stroke caused by vegetation embolization.&#xD;
      The rate of symptomatic embolic events occurring after antibiotic initiation is around 15%.&#xD;
      Valve surgery benefit has been clearly demonstrated in patients with periannular&#xD;
      complications and moderate to severe HF resulting from acute valve regurgitation. The timing&#xD;
      of surgery to prevent embolism is critical since the risk of new embolic event is highest&#xD;
      during the first weeks of antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare clinical outcomes of Early Valve Surgery (as soon as&#xD;
      possible within 72 hours of randomization) with those of a conventional management based on&#xD;
      current guidelines in patients with native left-sided IE and high risk of embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      208 patients (104 patients per arm) will be included in a national multicenter (19 centers)&#xD;
      prospective randomized open blinded end-point (PROBE) sequential superiority trial.&#xD;

      Infective endocarditis (IE) is associated with an overall in-hospital mortality rate of&#xD;
      15-25% and a high incidence of embolic events (20-50%). Leading causes of mortality are heart&#xD;
      failure (HF) resulting from valve dysfunction, and stroke caused by vegetation embolization.&#xD;
      The rate of symptomatic embolic events occurring after antibiotic initiation is around 15%.&#xD;
      Valve surgery benefit has been clearly demonstrated in patients with periannular&#xD;
      complications and moderate to severe HF resulting from acute valve regurgitation. Indications&#xD;
      of valve surgery for prevention of embolic complications are less clearly defined. Potential&#xD;
      complications of valve surgery and of implanted permanent prosthetic valve are to be balanced&#xD;
      against their potential benefits in terms of prevented embolism and improved survival. The&#xD;
      timing of surgery to prevent embolism is critical since the risk of new embolic event is&#xD;
      highest during the first weeks of antibiotic treatment. The points in favor of early valve&#xD;
      surgery (EVS) in patients with high embolic risk include the following 1) patients with high&#xD;
      risk of embolism are identified by transesophageal echocardiography (TOE); 2) advances in&#xD;
      surgical management of IE dramatically lowered postoperative mortality; 3) 2015 European ESC&#xD;
      IE guidelines state that valve surgery should be performed in IE with vegetation above 10 mm&#xD;
      AND an embolic event occurring while patients are receiving antibiotic (grade I/B) and should&#xD;
      be considered in IE with vegetation above 30 mm (Grade IIaB ) and may be above 10 mm and&#xD;
      severe valve regurgitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare clinical outcomes of EVS (as soon as possible within 72&#xD;
      hours of randomization) with those of a conventional management based on current 2015&#xD;
      European ESC guidelines in patients with native left-sided IE and high risk of embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary assessment criterion is a composite of all-cause death and clinically symptomatic&#xD;
      embolic events within 6 weeks from randomization in all included patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      208 patients (104 patients per arm) will be included in a national multicenter (19 centers)&#xD;
      prospective randomized open blinded end-point (PROBE) sequential superiority trial.&#xD;
