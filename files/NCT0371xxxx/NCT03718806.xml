  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, parallel, open-label, randomized, cross-over, single-center study with&#xD;
      zoliflodacin administered as granules for oral suspension with or without food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to enroll 2 cohorts (Cohorts 1 and 2) of 24 subjects each (48 subjects in&#xD;
      total), with the target of achieving data in 20 evaluable subjects per cohort. Single doses&#xD;
      of zoliflodacin will be assessed within each cohort in a two period cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive one of the following regimens per period, depending on cohort, in a&#xD;
      sequence according to the randomization schedule (per cohort, subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      immediately before dosing in Period 1), separated by a minimum 4 day washout between each&#xD;
      period. The actual length of washout period may change pending emerging PK data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen A: 3 g zoliflodacin oral suspension; oral administration after an overnight fast&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen B: 3 g zoliflodacin oral suspension; oral administration with a standardized&#xD;
           high calorie, high-fat breakfast&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen C: 4 g zoliflodacin oral suspension; oral administration after an overnight fast&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen D: 4 g zoliflodacin oral suspension; oral administration with a standardized&#xD;
           high calorie, high-fat breakfast&#xD;
