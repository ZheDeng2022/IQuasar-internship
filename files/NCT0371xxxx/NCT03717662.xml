    <textblock>
      This project aims to publicize quitting among female smokers, and encourage and support those&#xD;
      who want to quit by providing face-to-face and/or telephone counseling. The objectives are&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Build up a Women Against Tobacco Taskforce (WATT) with woman volunteers from various&#xD;
           organizations to promote quitting in female smokers, and to arouse public awareness of&#xD;
           the effects of smoking on sexual, reproductive and child health, and other diseases&#xD;
           among women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct a survey among the women volunteers and staff of the women's organization to&#xD;
           ascertain their learning needs, knowledge, attitudes, and practice of tobacco control&#xD;
           and smoking cessation, and to identify interested participants to join the smoking&#xD;
           cessation training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Design and deliver a smoking cessation counseling training program (based on the&#xD;
           learning needs identified), to equip women volunteers with the knowledge and skills in&#xD;
           smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Develop and evaluate a gender-specific smoking cessation program to help female smokers&#xD;
           to reduce and quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Promote women's health and quality of life, and reduce the life-long morbidity and&#xD;
           mortality of female smokers in the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Examine the long term (3-year) impact of a gender-specific smoking cessation program on&#xD;
           the smoking behaviors of female smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Examine another long-term (6-year) impact of a gender-specific smoking cessation program&#xD;
           on the smoking behaviors of female smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Ascertain the contributing factors in the rate of quitting, retention and relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Investigate Hong Kong women smokers awareness and attitude to women quitline.&#xD;

      Phase I: Build up a network and need assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We will invite collaboration with the Hong Kong Women Development Association (18&#xD;
           organizational members and over 30,000 individual members), the Hong Kong Federation of&#xD;
           Women (45 organizational members), Women's Club of Family Planning Association (7&#xD;
           Women's Club), Hone Kong Young Women's Christian Association (around 260,000 members)&#xD;
           and other woman organizations to build up a network by setting up a Women Against&#xD;
           Tobacco Taskforce (WATT) jointly with representatives from women organizations and led&#xD;
           by the Department of Nursing Studies of The University of Hong Kong. This proposed Task&#xD;
           Force will focus on promoting smoking cessation among female smokers and arousing the&#xD;
           public's awareness of health risks specific to women from smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Need assessment survey and focus group interview of the women volunteers and staff: all&#xD;
           volunteers and staff will be invited to participate in a need assessment survey and&#xD;
           focus group interview. The perceived needs identified will be used to design a&#xD;
           tailor-made smoking cessation counselor training curriculum for the participants, and&#xD;
           they will be asked to indicate their interest and commitment to undertake such training&#xD;
           (free of charge), and to help women quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and deliver training curriculum: Based on the needs assessment data, we will design&#xD;
      and deliver a tailor-made smoking cessation counseling training program for the woman&#xD;
      volunteers and staff. A maximum capacity of 200 participants can be trained. At the end of&#xD;
      the program, participants should be capable of delivering smoking cessation advice for women,&#xD;
      and a referral system can be set up so that women that required more intensive counseling can&#xD;
      be referred to us if necessary. The outcome of the training will be evaluated through a&#xD;
      survey before and immediate after, and 6 months post training, which include: knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes, and practice of smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to train women smoking cessation counselors as they can better understand the needs&#xD;
      and feelings of female smokers. Female addiction to cigarette smoking may be reinforced more&#xD;
      by the sensory and social context of smoking2, and therefore it is important to reduce the&#xD;
      gap between the female smoker and the counselor. Upon completion of the program, a&#xD;
      certificate of attendance will be awarded to the participants and their organizations for&#xD;
      their contribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Brief gender-specific advice provided by trained women volunteers: The trained women&#xD;
           counselors will use motivational approach to provide smoking cessation advice to female&#xD;
           smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intensive gender-specific intervention provided by experience nurse counselor: The&#xD;
           project will provide intensive counseling at the Centre for Health Promotion (CHP) of&#xD;
           HKU Department of Nursing Studies, female smokers (including all types of tobacco&#xD;
           products such as shisha, electronic cigarettes and heat-not-burn (HNB) which are&#xD;
           available in the market) who require more intensive counseling or advice on nicotine&#xD;
           replacement therapy, upon referral from the women's organizations and trained women&#xD;
           counselors. The smokers will receive face-to-face (or telephone) counseling and a 1 week&#xD;
           supply of Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (4 mg nicotine gum or 10 mg/ 15 mg nicotine&#xD;
           patch) from the nurse counselor, and follow up calls at 1 week, 1-, 3-, 6-, 36- and&#xD;
           72-month post-intervention. Their smoking status, information about usage of nicotine&#xD;
           replacement products and quality of life measures will be assessed. All women reported&#xD;
           to have quit smoking at 6-, 36- and 72-month will be invited for biochemical validation&#xD;
           (measurement of urine / saliva cotinine level). Participants will be invited to do&#xD;
           qualitative interviews (individual / focus group interviews) at the 36-month follow up.&#xD;
           Interviews will be conducted according to participants' smoking status (3 levels:&#xD;
           continuous smoker; those who had quit attempts but relapsed; and those who abstained&#xD;
           from tobacco within the 3-year period) and martial status (2 levels: single; and&#xD;
           married). 30 participants with 5 subjects per group will be recruited. Each interview&#xD;
           will last for 60 minutes and to be conducted by an experienced facilitator at the School&#xD;
           of Nursing, The University of Hong Kong. During each individual interview, the&#xD;
           facilitator will first welcome the participants, obtain written consent, and assure that&#xD;
           the interview will be audio-taped and kept confidential. The facilitator will guide the&#xD;
           discussion using an interview guide and prompt for further information as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IV:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trained women counsellors will observe the women smokers on the street and walk forward&#xD;
      to look for opportunities talking to them. Counsellors will first explain the basic&#xD;
      information of this research and acquire their reliance. After we got the permission to&#xD;
      conduct a small interview, smokers will be asked a few questions about their awareness about&#xD;
      women quitline and obstruction to call the quitline. Each interview will last no more than 10&#xD;
      minutes. We can invite them to participate in a further phone call survey and encourage them&#xD;
      to leave their phone number.&#xD;
