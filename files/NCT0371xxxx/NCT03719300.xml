    <textblock>
      This study, BC-819-18-204, is a Phase 2, open-label, monotherapy, single-arm, multicenter&#xD;
      clinical trial of BC-819 (inodiftagene vixteplasmid) in patients with NMIBC adequately&#xD;
      treated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) whose disease is BCG unresponsive according to&#xD;
      the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BC-819 (inodiftagene vixteplasmid) is a recombinant DNA plasmid that directs the expression&#xD;
      of a potent toxin specifically in malignant cells but not in normal tissue. It has been&#xD;
      designed to exploit the established biology of the H19 gene, which is upregulated and&#xD;
      expressed at high levels only in malignant cells, to produce bacterial diphtheria toxin only&#xD;
      in bladder cancer tissue. BC-819 is administered directly into the bladder to enable maximal&#xD;
      topical exposure to target bladder cancer cells.&#xD;

    <measure>The Percentage of Patients With Baseline CIS That Achieve a Complete Response After Treatment With BC-819 (Measured at 12 Weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Complete response is defined as at least one of the following:&#xD;
Negative cystoscopy and negative (including atypical) urine cytology&#xD;
Positive cystoscopy with biopsy-proven benign or low-grade NMIBC and negative cytology&#xD;
Negative cystoscopy with malignant urine cytology if cancer is found in the upper tract or prostatic urethra and random bladder biopsies are negative&#xD;
The complete response in patients with CIS for this endpoint was documented on or after the Week 12 response assessment and on or prior to the Week 48 assessment. Duration of complete response in patients with CIS was calculated from the documented onset of the complete response to the assessment where the patient no longer met the definition of complete response.</description>

    <description>The incidence of PFS at 48, 72, and 96 weeks as well as time to progression estimated using Kaplan-Meir methods. Progression is defined as the development of T2 or greater disease. Sensitivity analyses was performed and included any of the following as progressions:&#xD;
An increase in stage from Ta or CIS to T1, or&#xD;
Development of T2 or greater, or&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of Life in Patients Treated With BC-819</measure>
    <time_frame>48, 72, and 96 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), a general questionnaire for assessing quality of life in cancer patients, and the Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Questionnaire (QLQ-NMIBC24 ) for patients with NBIMC disease. EORTC QLQ-C30 include five functional scales , three symptom scales, a global health status/quality of life scale, and six single items. QLQ-NMIBC24 include five multi-item symptom scales, one multi-item functional scale, and five single-item measures.These scales range in score 0-100 scale and an for functional scales, a higher a higher score corresponds to greater function or quality of life. For symptom scales, a higher score corresponds to greater symptom burden.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Eligible patients were patients with High Risk Non Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer whose disease was unresponsive to BCG. It was planned to enroll and treat 140 patients (N=140), of which 70 to 100 were estimated to have carcinoma in situ (CIS) (with or without papillary disease).</recruitment_details>

          <title>Single Arm BC-819</title>
          <description>The administration of BC-819 was separated into 2 phases, the induction phase, and the maintenance phase. During the induction phase, patients were to receive an intravesical instillation of BC-819 at a dose of 20 mg/50 mL aqueous solution once per week for 10 weeks according to the induction phase treatment schedule. Upon completion of the induction phase, patients transitioned to maintenance therapy of BC-819 every 3 weeks beginning at Week 12 (Visit 11) and continuing for the next 84 additional weeks until the end of the study, defined as completion of the 96-week visit (Visit 39).</description>

        <title>The Percentage of Patients With Baseline CIS That Achieve a Complete Response After Treatment With BC-819 (Measured at 12 Weeks)</title>
        <description>Complete response is defined as at least one of the following:&#xD;
Negative cystoscopy and negative (including atypical) urine cytology&#xD;
Positive cystoscopy with biopsy-proven benign or low-grade NMIBC and negative cytology&#xD;
Negative cystoscopy with malignant urine cytology if cancer is found in the upper tract or prostatic urethra and random bladder biopsies are negative&#xD;
The complete response in patients with CIS for this endpoint was documented on or after the Week 12 response assessment and on or prior to the Week 48 assessment. Duration of complete response in patients with CIS was calculated from the documented onset of the complete response to the assessment where the patient no longer met the definition of complete response.</description>

During the induction phase, patients were to receive an intravesical instillation of BC-819 at a dose of 20 mg/50 mL aqueous solution once per week for 10 weeks according to the induction phase treatment schedule. Upon completion of the induction phase, patients transitioned to maintenance therapy of BC-819 every 3 weeks beginning at Week 12 (Visit 11) and continuing for the next 84 additional weeks until the end of the study, defined as completion of the 96-week visit (Visit 39).</description>

        <description>Time to recurrence (Kaplan-Meier plot) recurrence is defined as the reappearance or persistence of high-grade disease, or new high-grade disease. Recurrence must be biopsy proven. Persistence, appearance, or presence of lower grade disease was not considered to be a recurrence event</description>

            <description>The administration of BC-819 was separated into 2 phases, the induction phase, and the maintenance phase. During the induction phase, patients were to receive an intravesical instillation of BC-819 at a dose of 20 mg/50 mL aqueous solution once per week for 10 weeks according to the induction phase treatment schedule. Upon completion of the induction phase, patients transitioned to maintenance therapy of BC-819 every 3 weeks beginning at Week 12 (Visit 11) and continuing for the next 84 additional weeks until the end of the study, defined as completion of the 96-week visit (Visit 39).</description>
