  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I study of oncolytic polio/rhinovirus recombinant (PVSRIPO) to&#xD;
      primarily characterize the safety and tolerability of PVSRIPO in patients with AJCC Stage&#xD;
      IIIB, IIIC, or IV melanoma in a modified 3+3 phase 1 trial design. Lesion biopsies and blood&#xD;
      samples will be obtained pre- and post-injection throughout the study for routine&#xD;
      histology/molecular genetic testing and immunologic analysis, respectively. Exploratory&#xD;
      objectives include describing the response rates of PVSRIPO-injected versus non-injected&#xD;
      lesion(s), the number of CD8 positive T cells present in the tumor biopsies before and after&#xD;
      injection of PVSRIPO, and after PVSRIPO administration: the pathologic response in tumor&#xD;
      biopsies, changes in the tumor microenvironment, and how systemic immune cell populations may&#xD;
      change.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Primary Objective of the study is to determine the safety profile of PVSRIPO in Stage&#xD;
      IIIB, IIIC, and IV recurrent melanoma patients as determined by DLTs by cohort, as well as in&#xD;
      those retreated with PVSRIPO, when PVSRIPO is injected intralesionally into 1 to 3 or more&#xD;
      cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions. As planned, up to 18 patients may be treated with PVSRIPO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy material will be obtained from tumor tissue prior to and following virus&#xD;
      administration, which may be subjected to routine histology along with molecular genetic&#xD;
      testing and evaluation of pathological response. Whole blood for immunologic analyses will&#xD;
      also be collected throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine study visits will occur through Day 126. Thereafter, visits will occur every 2-3&#xD;
      months for up to 2 years for subjects who do not progress. For patients with progressive&#xD;
      disease, chart review only will occur every 3 months starting at the time of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who previously participated in Cohorts 0 through 3, who in the opinion of the&#xD;
      investigator, may benefit from continued PVSRIPO administration, may be eligible to receive&#xD;
      additional injections.&#xD;
