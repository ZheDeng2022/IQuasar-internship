  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is Phase II of a study previously registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02812329). Phase&#xD;
      II focuses on adapting and expanding the reach of a previously developed video game aimed at&#xD;
      HIV prevention. The game will be adapted to include web access/distribution and be evaluated&#xD;
      using a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims for Phase II of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further adapt and expand our culturally and socially-tailored videogame to have a greater&#xD;
      focus on HIV testing and counseling (HTC) in addition to HIV prevention in an older age group&#xD;
      of 14-18 year old boys and girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be accomplished by refining the conceptual model of the theoretical mechanisms of&#xD;
      behavior change to be applied specifically within the game. New content will be created with&#xD;
      additional input from 4 focus groups of 5 adolescents each (n = 20, aged 14-18) and these&#xD;
      participants will also play-test the game. In addition, this model will inform new&#xD;
      intervention manuals (&quot;Game Playbooks&quot;) targeting these new outcomes. Building the new&#xD;
      content from focus groups into the game are intended to adapt and expand its scope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A system will be established for the newly adapted game for web access/distribution and&#xD;
      program integration. Work will continue with commercialization partners on widespread&#xD;
      distribution of the adapted game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final piece of the study will be to conduct a randomized controlled trial in 296&#xD;
      adolescents (aged 14-18) to evaluate the acceptability and efficacy of the adapted game on&#xD;
      its new web-based platform compared with a set of control games.&#xD;
