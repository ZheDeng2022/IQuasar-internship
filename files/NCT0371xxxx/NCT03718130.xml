      To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of the hantaan virus (HTNV), puumala virus (PUUV),&#xD;
      and combination HTNV/PUUV DNA vaccine candidates delivered to healthy adults&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) vaccines, such as those to be utilized in this&#xD;
      study, is based on the observation that antigen-encoding DNA plasmids can induce both&#xD;
      cellular and humoral immune responses against various viral and bacterial pathogens. DNA&#xD;
      vaccines are perceived as having a number of potential advantages over other types of&#xD;
      vaccines. For example, DNA vaccines are easily constructed by recombinant technology; easily&#xD;
      and inexpensively manufactured as a well-characterized molecule [DNA plasmid]; and at boost,&#xD;
      not eliminated by prior immune response to the carrier or vector. Furthermore, as nonliving&#xD;
      vaccines, they cannot lead to infection. The object of DNA vaccination is to deliver DNA into&#xD;
      the nuclei of cells capable of presenting the encoded antigen to immune reactive cells that&#xD;
      can elicit an immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 6 randomized groups of 12 subjects each, for a total of 72 subjects.&#xD;
      This approach will ensure at least 60 subjects complete all vaccinations at around 10&#xD;
      subjects per group, taking possible attrition into account. Subjects will receive one dose of&#xD;
      vaccine on each of Days 0, 28, and 56 either intramuscularly or intradermally by&#xD;
      electroporation and will be followed until Day 220.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have demonstrated adequate comprehension of the protocol by achieving a score of at&#xD;
             least 80% correct on a short multiple-choice quiz. Individuals who fail to achieve a&#xD;
             passing score on the initial quiz will be given the opportunity to retest after a&#xD;
             review of the protocol information. Individuals who fail the quiz for the second time&#xD;
             will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have provided written informed consent before screening&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Good health is defined by the absence of any medical condition described in the&#xD;
                  exclusion criteria in a subject with a normal abbreviated physical examination&#xD;
                  including vital signs. If the subject has another current, ongoing medical&#xD;
                  condition, the condition cannot meet any of the following criteria: (1) first&#xD;
                  diagnosed within 3 months of enrollment, (2) is worsening in terms of clinical&#xD;
                  outcome in last 6 months, or (3) involves need for medication that may pose a&#xD;
                  risk to subject's safety or impede assessment of adverse events or immunogenicity&#xD;
                  if they participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  An abbreviated physical examination differs from a complete physical examination&#xD;

                  potential (see definition below) and has not had a vasectomy performed &gt; 1 year&#xD;
                  prior to screening. They must agree not to father a child until 6 months after&#xD;
                  the last vaccination. These subjects must agree to use a barrier method of birth&#xD;
                  control (eg, either condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream or partner usage&#xD;
                  of occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps] with spermicidal&#xD;
                  foam/gel/film/cream/suppository).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of childbearing potential are defined as those who have not been sterilized&#xD;
                  via tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy,&#xD;
                  hysterectomy, or successful Essure® placement (permanent, non-surgical,&#xD;
                  non-hormonal sterilization) with history of documented radiological confirmation&#xD;
                  test at least 90 days after the procedure and are still menstruating or &lt; 1 year&#xD;
                  of the last menses if perimenopausal. For this study, an effective contraceptive&#xD;
                  method is defined as one that results in a failure rate of less than 1% per year&#xD;
                  when it is used consistently and correctly (see the Manual of Procedures [MOP]&#xD;
                  for a list of acceptable methods).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects agree to not donate eggs (ova, oocytes), and male subjects agree to&#xD;
             not donate sperm from the start of screening until at least 6 months after the last&#xD;
             vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
