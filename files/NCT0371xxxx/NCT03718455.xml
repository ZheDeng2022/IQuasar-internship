  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, breast cancer patients who are treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) before&#xD;
      surgery may have a biopsy clip placed in the lymph node at the time of or shortly after&#xD;
      percutaneous biopsy. Following 12-20+ weeks of NAC, pre-surgical localization of the sampled&#xD;
      axillary lymph node using a radioactive seed can be done up to 5 days prior to surgery.&#xD;
      Localization of the sampled lymph node in patients with complete imaging response to NAC can&#xD;
      be technically challenging if the biopsy clip is not sonographically visible. This study is&#xD;
      designed to see if it is feasible to place a Magseed, which is magnetic seed, into the&#xD;
      abnormal node either at the time of fine needle aspiration (FNA) or after NAC, just prior to&#xD;
      surgery, and to be able to accurately identify the abnormal node at the time of surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Part 1: Ten women with biopsy proven breast cancer and metastasis to an axillary lymph node&#xD;
      will have a Magseed placed into the metastatic lymph node AFTER neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      (NAC) and just prior to surgery. These patients will have a non-contrast enhanced breast MRI&#xD;
      development study to evaluate and identify ways to reduce the artifact in the axilla created&#xD;
      by the Magseed. Efficacy of the localization with the Magseed will be available within a week&#xD;
      of the placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Ten additional women with biopsy proven breast cancer and metastasis to an axillary&#xD;
      lymph node will have a Magseed placed into the metastatic lymph node BEFORE NAC. These&#xD;
      patients will have routine contrast enhanced MRIs, mammograms, and ultrasounds before and&#xD;
      after NAC to evaluate treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seed placement: Once a patient has been identified eligible for the research study and has&#xD;
      provided written informed consent the patient will have a Magseed placed into the biopsy&#xD;
      proven lymph node. The Magseed delivery system is identical to the investigators' current&#xD;
      practice using radioactive seeds. The seed is pre-loaded into the needle and is inserted into&#xD;
      the lymph node following local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine. Once the seed is deployed, post&#xD;
      procedure seed location is confirmed sonographically and mammographically with tomosynthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI: Ten no-charge limited non-contrast breast MRIs for research development purposes are&#xD;
      available for this study through the radiology department. Phase 1 participants will enroll&#xD;
      in the study after their pre- and post-NAC imaging has already been performed per routine&#xD;
      clinical practice. These participants will have a single non-contrast enhanced breast MRI&#xD;
      using the investigators' standard non-contrast sequences (axial ideal T1 and T2-weighted,&#xD;
      axial Short-TI Inversion Recovery (STIR), and axial 3D vibrant using a dedicated breast coil,&#xD;
      FOV 28 cm or to fit the patient size, and an image-thickness/image-increment of 5mm/1mm). A&#xD;
      physicist will participate in the scanning of these patients to evaluate the extent of&#xD;
      artifact in the axilla and adjacent breast tissue and optimize scanning parameters to reduce&#xD;
      this artifact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 participants will enroll in the study prior to NAC and have routine contrast enhanced&#xD;
      breast MRIs performed before and after NAC. Clinically indicated MRI scans will be charged to&#xD;
      the patient's insurance company as this imaging is standard clinical practice. The MRI&#xD;
      protocol will use the investigators' standard clinical sequences (axial ideal T1 and&#xD;
      T2-weighted, axial STIR, and axial 3D vibrant using a dedicated breast coil). Once contrast&#xD;
      is injected (gadobutrol 10mmol/10mL) 3D vibrant sequences will be obtained four times after&#xD;
      contrast injection (FOV 28 cm or to fit the patient size, and an&#xD;
      image-thickness/image-increment of 5mm/1mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mammogram: Patients enrolled in the research study will have standard mammographic imaging&#xD;
      before and after NAC, which will include both the breast and axilla as per routine clinical&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound: Patients enrolled in the research study will have standard sonographic imaging&#xD;
      before and after NAC of the breast and axilla as per routine clinical protocol. Post-NAC&#xD;
      ultrasound of the axilla will be a supplemental assessment to breast MRI as the Magseed&#xD;
      artifact may obscure these findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seed Removal: As per the current practice, patients will have targeted axillary lymph node&#xD;
      dissection including both the localized lymph node and sentinel lymph node. Identifying the&#xD;
      lymph node containing the Magseed will require the Sentimag handheld probe in the operating&#xD;
      room. This device which functions similar to the gamma probe has been approved for an&#xD;
      equipment trial starting in August of 2018. Once the lymph node has been excised a specimen&#xD;
      radiograph will be obtained to verify removal.&#xD;
