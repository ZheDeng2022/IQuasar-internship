  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PROPHESY trial is a single centre pilot trial investigating Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) or&#xD;
      Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC) treatment for patients who are bleeding during cardiac&#xD;
      surgery, and who are NOT receiving a vitamin K antagonist agent (e.g. warfarin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will investigate the feasibility of delivering the different components of&#xD;
      the trial, so that investigators can determine if it's feasible to move to a future large&#xD;
      trial that will aim to compare the efficacy and safety of FFP versus PCC in adult patients&#xD;
      who are actively bleeding during cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are ~ 30,000 cardiac procedures performed each year in the United Kingdom (UK), and it&#xD;
      is estimated that ~30% of these cases require plasma transfusion for management of bleeding&#xD;
      during cardiovascular surgery. Bleeding after cardiac surgery that requires blood transfusion&#xD;
      is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, resulting in substantial costs to the&#xD;
      health service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been no clinical trials that have compared the safety and efficacy of FFP versus&#xD;
      PCC in cardiac surgery in patients who are bleeding, and who are not on vitamin K&#xD;
      antagonists. In the UK, FFP transfusion is the standard treatment for management of bleeding:&#xD;
      however, the use of PCC in this setting is rising, with several observational studies now&#xD;
      demonstrating that it is safe, and that its administration is associated with reduced blood&#xD;
      transfusion requirements, albeit no difference in other outcomes. Potential advantages of PCC&#xD;
      over FFP are: increased concentration of clotting factors leading to faster improvement of&#xD;
      reversing coagulopathy; improved ease and speed of administration; reduced fluid volume; and&#xD;
      reduced incidence of immune modulatory side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While observational studies have suggested that PCC can be safely administered in bleeding&#xD;
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the clinical equipoise and, the lack of high quality&#xD;
      evidence means that a randomised control trial is required to compare the clinical efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of both in bleeding patients undergoing cardiac surgery not relating to warfarin.&#xD;
      Prior to such a trial, the investigators will perform a single-centre pilot study to assess&#xD;
      if individual components of a large trial are deliverable.&#xD;

    <description>PCC is a blood product produced through pooling of thousands of human plasmas, which is then treated to inactivate enveloped viruses. From the pooled plasma, vitamin K dependent clotting factors (factors II, VII, IX and X, and protein C and protein S), are selected to produce the concentrated form called PCC.</description>
