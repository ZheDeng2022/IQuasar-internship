  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      a randomized controlled single-blinded study. the hypothesis of this clinical trial is that&#xD;
      disjunctive use of diode laser improve the clinical parameters of periodontists , and there&#xD;
      are significant difference between the conventional treatment and diode laser as an adjunct&#xD;

      A total of 240 sites with deep pocket in 30 systemically healthy patients with chronic&#xD;
      periodontitis, from subjects attending Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST)&#xD;
      Postgraduate Dental Clinic (PDC), the age range were (28-55) year, between Apr 2017 and Oct&#xD;
      2017. Those patients were enrolled in a randomized controlled single-blinded study. For each&#xD;
      patient, full medical and dental history and periodontal examination were recorded. Clinical&#xD;
      parameters such as pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), gingival index (GI) and&#xD;
      plaque index (PI) were evaluated at the baseline. All Patients underwent initial periodontal&#xD;
      therapy; SRP which was performed using a sonic device and hand instruments and the sites were&#xD;
      divided randomly into two groups SRP alone and SRP with adjunctive diode 810 nm laser in the&#xD;
      contralateral sites in the same jaw. The Clinical parameters have been re-evaluated at 1, 3&#xD;
      and 6 months to test the effectiveness of (810 nm, 2 W, pulsed mode, for 20 sec) in treatment&#xD;
      of CP. Diode laser therapy was applied to periodontal pockets in the same day of treatment.&#xD;

PI index score:&#xD;
0 = no plaque in the gingival area&#xD;
= a film of plaque adhering to the gingival margin and adjacent area of the tooth. The plaque may be only recognized by running a probe across the tooth surface.&#xD;
= moderate accumulation of soft debris within the gingival pocket on the gingival and/or on the tooth surface, which can be seen by naked eye.&#xD;
