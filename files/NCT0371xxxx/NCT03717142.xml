  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the LUM Imaging&#xD;
      System in imaging primary and metastatic cancer in the brain. This includes selecting a dose&#xD;
      to determine the initial efficacy of LUM015 for the molecular imaging of low-grade gliomas,&#xD;
      glioblastomas and cancer masses that have metastasized to the brain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this feasibility study is to identify an effective dose of LUM015&#xD;
      for imaging low grade gliomas, glioblastomas and cancer metastases to the brain. The optimal&#xD;
      dose will be used for future studies. Both normal brain tissue and tumor tissue will be&#xD;
      imaged and analyzed using the LUM Imaging device. The LUM Imaging System is a combination&#xD;
      product consisting of the LUM Imaging Device and the imaging agent LUM015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with a possible diagnosis of low grade glioma, glioblastoma and metastases to the&#xD;
      brain, and scheduled for surgical resection, will be screened, recruited. On day of scheduled&#xD;
      surgery, the subject will be administered with LUM015 4 ± 2 hours prior to using LUM Imaging&#xD;
      System during surgery. LUM015 will be administered via peripheral intravenous (IV) injection&#xD;
      as a single dose between 1.0 - 3.0 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the tumor mass is resected, the LUM Imaging Device will be used to scan images of&#xD;
      distinct areas of grossly normal appearing brain tissue and, separately, images of distinct&#xD;
      areas of grossly appearing tumor. Following tumor mass resection, the tumor bed is scanned to&#xD;
      record in vivo images. The resected tissue will also be imaged ex vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will continue to be monitored until hospital discharge and followed through&#xD;
      their first standard of care post-surgical visit. Subjects with adverse events that are&#xD;
      determined to be possibly related to the investigational product will continue to be followed&#xD;
      until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.&#xD;
