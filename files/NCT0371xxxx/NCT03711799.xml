  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been a lack of research on the unique needs of families with autism in the&#xD;
      African-American and Latino communities. The process of screening, evaluation and treatment&#xD;
      for children with autism can be long and arduous, especially in these communities. This often&#xD;
      means that the best interventions for children with autism are not reaching minority&#xD;
      communities. For many families, the complexity of the services system leads to a long wait&#xD;
      after the initial diagnosis before accessing intervention. This means that the children have&#xD;
      delayed access to treatment. Mind the Gap is a study that seeks to provide immediate and&#xD;
      culturally appropriate support for families who have just received diagnosis but have yet to&#xD;
      receive treatment. This support will be provided in families' native languages and, through&#xD;
      the use of phone and video sessions, can accommodate busy schedules. Mind the Gap&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to receive one of two conditions, which are 1.Resources only&#xD;
      (online training modules and paper or on line resource lists, but no peer coaching) 2. Peer&#xD;
      coaching (will receive all online training access). The peer coaches will be recruited from&#xD;
      local parent support agencies. They will not be professionals in the field of ASD, but they&#xD;
      will be trained by the research group on how to access the online tools and how to work whith&#xD;
      families. They will contact the participants via phone or video conference on a weekly basis&#xD;
      and an in- person visit per month for 3 months. Peer coaches will have a monthly call with&#xD;
      participants for an additional nine months.We hope that this study will help the African&#xD;
      American and Latino communities receive services sooner than currently reported. We also hope&#xD;
      that in the future, parent organizations will use these tools to help families that have&#xD;
      recently received an ASD diagnosis will us navigate the complex system of attaining services.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will recruit 140 (35 per site) families that will be referred by pediatricians, school&#xD;
      staff, family resource centers, early intervention agencies, DDS or self-referred using study&#xD;
      referral form, phone or web based referral system. The referral will include consent to be&#xD;
      contacted by the research team. All families will complete the screening survey by phone&#xD;
      (Section 19.2, item 3.1) with a member of the research team. This will be the only survey&#xD;
      that will determine eligibility. If eligible to participate, the participants will be asked&#xD;
      to give an oral consent. The oral consent will allow the research team to randomize the&#xD;
      family to either the Resource Only Group or the Peer Coaching Group. For both conditions, a&#xD;
      written consent will be later obtained when the research team meets with the families for the&#xD;
      intake survey and filling out the measures: Demographic, Family Empowerment Scale, Caregiver&#xD;
      Agency Questionnaire, Caregiver Autism Knowledge Questionnaire, Caregiver Stigma Scale and a&#xD;
      Satisfaction Survey only at end of study. Cultural Capital Survey will only be used once at&#xD;
      the intake survey meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will have access to ParentSquare, a safe, secure platform for program-to-parent and&#xD;
      parent-to-parent communication. ParentSquare has a registration feature where parents can&#xD;
      complete forms and sign up for courses and training modules and to broadcast training.&#xD;
      Parents can choose to be notified via text, email with reminders or updates through the app.&#xD;
      Messages can be private or broadcasted to larger group. There is also a document feature to&#xD;
      allow shared access between parent and coach of parent goals and progress between calls and&#xD;
      visits. Each site will be responsible for monitoring communication of their participants in&#xD;
      Parent Square along with Drexel University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also include up to 40 peer coaches (10 per site) who will be trained to&#xD;
      provide coaching to families for 5 months as a family gains access to services. Peer Coach&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: (1) parent of a child with autism or other similar developmental&#xD;
      disorder; (2) a child over 9 years old and at least 5 years post-diagnosis; (3) some&#xD;
      experience working with parents and/or understanding of the service system and (4) fluent in&#xD;
      English and/or Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Resource only. Families randomized to the resource only condition will have&#xD;
      access to training materials in web-based and paper formats. The will receive the internet&#xD;
      address to access web-based trainings, handouts and materials, including instructions for&#xD;
      each activity and they will receive a binder that includes the information that is available&#xD;
      on line so they can access the information even if they do not have internet access Families&#xD;
      in the resource only condition will not have access to a peer coach through the program. They&#xD;
      will not have access to the on-line support community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer Coaching Condition. Families randomized to peer coaching will receive assistance with&#xD;
      navigating the training program and accessing the system from a trained peer parent coach.&#xD;
      Peer coaches will, as much as possible, be culturally and language-matched with the&#xD;
      participant family. Families in this condition will receive a call from their peer coach who&#xD;
      will set up an initial, in-person meeting either in-home, clinic or community setting&#xD;
      depending on the participant preference. Based on the goal setting interview the peer coach&#xD;
      and the family will choose initial goals to complete in the first week, which will include&#xD;
      (1) completion of a training (typically the What is ASD? Training will be completed first);&#xD;
      (2) completion of one activity related to service access (e.g., phone access; call to service&#xD;
      provider; form completion); and (3) one self-care activity. A timeline for goals will be&#xD;
      developed together based on the family needs. Peer coaches will have a guide for rating the&#xD;
      importance of training and materials for the family based on the interview, and a guide which&#xD;
      will identify triggers (e.g. challenging behavior, safety concerns) to increase the level of&#xD;
      care. Peer coaches will set up a weekly call or video conferences (based on parent&#xD;
      preference), and monthly in person visit with the family to assess goal progress, provide&#xD;
      information, and set up subsequent goals and/or additional support if needed. Monthly visits&#xD;
      and weekly calls will continue for 12 visits up to 4 months). If parents choose to meet via&#xD;
      video conference, a secure, University approved method will be used by coaches (e.g., Zoom,&#xD;
      Skype, Webex). Three of the calls will be audio recorded for research purposes and to provide&#xD;
      feedback to the coaches. Calls will then be reduced to monthly for 9 months. Parent&#xD;
      participants can contact the peer coach at any time as well. Peer coaches will have a script&#xD;
      and materials for each call which will cover a specific topic identified with the family.&#xD;
      Peer coaches will have bi monthly supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer Coach Training. Peer coaches will be hired or referred from local parent support&#xD;
      agencies . Compensation will be specific to each site. Peer coaches are parents of children&#xD;
      with ASD diagnosed at least 5 years ago, fluent in English or Spanish and have some&#xD;
      experience helping other families of children with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer coaches will attend four, 3-hour training sessions in the use of the intervention&#xD;
      materials. They will have a chance to practice using the materials and will learn about&#xD;
      issues related to safety and how to work with families. They will complete citi training and&#xD;
      additional training and role play in the confidentiality. Training will include learning to&#xD;
      use Parentsquare and role playing interviewing and discussing topics with families. Coaches&#xD;
      will have access to scripts for each potential topic and resources to address family needs.&#xD;
      Parent engagement in the intervention will also be measured by (1) enrollment in sessions;&#xD;
      (2) attendance at sessions and peer coach calls/meetings; (3) accessing on-line materials;&#xD;
      (4) completion of on-line trainings; and (5) project attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer coaches will be expected to provide a 24-hour notice if they need to cancel a meeting or&#xD;
      session. They will also be expected to reschedule missed appointments. Also, peer coaches&#xD;
      will not be paid for missed appointments. If the peer coaches misses 3 meetings in a row&#xD;
      without proper cancellation, a member of the research team will have to resume his/her&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
