  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Having the advantages of being minimally invasive and simple, extracorporeal shock wave&#xD;
      lithotripsy (SWL) remains one of the treatment options for renal stones less than 2cm.&#xD;
      Although SWL is the most minimally invasive surgical approach for stone, there are still some&#xD;
      concern about its short and long term side effect. While, there are some evidences that SWL&#xD;
      might lead to increase in new onset hypertension, investigator's recent study suggested it&#xD;
      might also cause worsening of blood pressure control in patient with known hypertension.&#xD;
      Therefore, further studies are needed to confirm the initial finding. This study recruits&#xD;
      patients who have hypertension and are currently diagnosed to have renal stone and planned&#xD;
      for SWL, in order to to investigate the effect of SWL on blood pressure control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent and background information have been obtained, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to either have routine SWL (treatment arm) or 6 months later (control arm). Group&#xD;
      1 patients will have blood pressure monitored for one day at home by an handy automated blood&#xD;
      pressure measuring machine before SWL and 6 months after SWL. Group 2 patients will have&#xD;
      blood pressure monitoring immediately and then 6 months later, just prior to the SWL.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) was first introduced in early 1980's for the&#xD;
      management of urolithiasis. The advantage of being minimally invasive, when compared to other&#xD;
      procedures for stone treatment, made SWL remain one of the treatment options for renal stones&#xD;
      less than 2 cm in the latest guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite considered as the most non-invasive treatment for urinary calculi, there are still&#xD;
      many concerns about the long-term consequence of SWL. In particular, the effect of SWL on&#xD;
      blood pressure is still a controversy topic. In the recent study, investigator has observed&#xD;
      approximately 20% of subjects experienced worsened blood pressure control during the 2-year&#xD;
      follow-up period, including 20/202 (9.95%) previously non-hypertensive subjects who developed&#xD;
      new onset hypertension. The observed incidence of new-onset hypertension was quite similar&#xD;
      those in some reported series. In the literature, there were multiple reports, including case&#xD;
      series and hospital data analyses, 7-9 of development of new-onset hypertension after SWL.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, most of those studies were retrospective and used different definitions of&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But the high incidence of worsening blood pressure control, including 43 (36.4%) of 118&#xD;
      hypertensive subjects who required add-on antihypertensive therapies, observed in our study&#xD;
      was alarming. Because most studies in the literature were just focused on development of&#xD;
      new-onset hypertension, investigator's observation provides supplementary information about&#xD;
      potential effects of SWL on pre-existing hypertension. In general, the average annual&#xD;
      incidence of add-on pharmacotherapy among local hypertensive patients was 4.71-6.41%. 10&#xD;
      Therefore, the add-on therapy rate of 36.4% during the 2-year follow-up was much higher than&#xD;
      that in the general population. Unfortunately, investigator did not include a&#xD;
      non-interventional arm for comparison in the previous study and could not conclude that this&#xD;
      outcome was solely attributable to SWL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, investigator would like to propose a prospective study to assess the effect SWL on&#xD;
      the blood pressure control in patients with known hypertension. Investigator hope the study&#xD;
      results will provide additional information on the long-term effect of SWL on patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effect of extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy on the effect of change in&#xD;
      blood pressure in patients with known hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROTOCOL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria specific to this study will be&#xD;
      prospectively recruited. After obtaining informed consent, patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      either treatment group or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline information, including age, years of diagnosed to have hypertension, current medical&#xD;
      usage, other comorbidities, BMI etc. will be collected from patients. All SWL would be&#xD;
      performed in the Lithotripsy and Uro-investigation Centre of the Prince of Wales Hospital,&#xD;
      and treated by Modulith SLX-F2 Connect (Storz Medical, Switzerland), an electromagnetic&#xD;
      lithotriptor. The treatment would be performed as standard care in our hospital. After SWL,&#xD;
      the patient would be follow-up in clinic as usual. During the 6 months study period, patients&#xD;
      are strongly advised to avoid change in hypertensive medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each blood pressure assessment, the following procedure will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 24-hour blood pressure monitoring - 24-h non-invasive ambulatory BP and HR monitoring&#xD;
           was performed using a validated device and followed the recommended approached. 11 The&#xD;
           blood pressure measurement would be programmed to measure BP every 15 min. Each&#xD;
           recording will be started in the morning and performed throughout a full 24-h period,&#xD;
           during which subjects are allowed to follow their normal daily routine. The analysis of&#xD;
           24-h BP recordings are preceded by removal of artifacts, according to previously&#xD;
           described editing criteria. 12 Recordings are excluded from the analysis when &gt; 10% of&#xD;
           all readings or more than one reading per hour is missed. Computed analysis of the&#xD;
           individual recordings provided 24-h, night-time (23.00-07.00 h), morning-time&#xD;
           (0.7.00-12.00 h), and afternoon/evening-time (12.00- 23.00 h) mean values of SBP, DBP,&#xD;
           and HR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinic blood pressure measurement At each visit, blood pressure will be measured after&#xD;
           patient rested for more than 10 minutes, with repeated measurement 5 minutes apart. The&#xD;
           mean blood pressure will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Any changes in antihypertensive drugs and reasons&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result collected will be used for further analysis&#xD;
