      This study will determine the effectiveness of tele-psychology in treating persons with&#xD;
      spinal cord injury (SCI) with depressed mood in the early period post-rehabilitation&#xD;
      discharge. Depression among individuals with SCI is the most common psychological condition&#xD;
      following an injury; 22% of civilians with SCI and 28% of veterans with SCI experience&#xD;
      depression after injury, which is higher than the able-bodied population (Williams 2015;&#xD;
      Ullrich 2014). Individuals with SCI face many barriers in receiving psychotherapy, such as&#xD;
      lack of accessible transportation, unfamiliarity with community resources, or stigma&#xD;
      associated with seeking treatment for depression, which this project aims to address.&#xD;
      Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), which helps people develop different ways of thinking and&#xD;
      behaving to reduce their psychological distress, will be provided via iPad FaceTime by a&#xD;
      psychologist with expertise in working with persons with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the proposed project are to reduce depressive symptoms, decrease associated&#xD;
      symptoms of anxiety, and to improve satisfaction with life with CBT provided via&#xD;
      tele-psychology. The secondary objective is to show intermediate efficacy of tele-psychology&#xD;
      in persons with SCI with depressed mood.&#xD;

      I. Rationale / Objectives This study will determine the effectiveness of tele-psychology in&#xD;
      treating persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) with depressed mood in the early period&#xD;
      post-rehabilitation discharge. Depression among individuals with SCI is the most common&#xD;
      psychological condition following an injury; 22% of civilians with SCI and 28% of veterans&#xD;
      with SCI experience depression after injury, which is higher than the able-bodied population&#xD;
      (Williams 2015; Ullrich 2014). Individuals with SCI face many barriers in receiving&#xD;
      psychotherapy, such as lack of accessible transportation, unfamiliarity with community&#xD;
      resources, or stigma associated with seeking treatment for depression, which this project&#xD;
      aims to address. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), which helps people develop different ways&#xD;
      of thinking and behaving to reduce their psychological distress, will be provided via iPad&#xD;
      FaceTime by a psychologist with expertise in working with persons with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the proposed project are to reduce depressive symptoms, decrease associated&#xD;
      symptoms of anxiety, and to improve satisfaction with life with CBT provided via&#xD;
      tele-psychology. The secondary objective is to show intermediate efficacy of tele-psychology&#xD;
      in persons with SCI with depressed mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Impact CBT via iPad FaceTime is expected to be a convenient and effective treatment for&#xD;
      depression after SCI with short-term (14-week post-discharge) and intermediate (26-week&#xD;
      post-discharge) benefits. This project would impact individuals with SCI, post-discharge from&#xD;
      rehabilitation, through the provision of an innovative treatment for depression, easing the&#xD;
      transition back to their home and community. Furthermore, CBT treatment will be provided in&#xD;
      the comfort and privacy of the participant's home, therefore combating stigma, as well as&#xD;
      physical and transportation-associated barriers. CBT via FaceTime does pose a potential&#xD;
      confidentiality risk, but the study team will stress that both parties choose a location&#xD;
      (i.e. private office for the psychologist and a private room at home for the participant)&#xD;
      that will minimize this risk. Prior studies have shown a beneficial effect of CBT provided&#xD;
      with tele-psychology among other populations. Telemedicine is rapidly advancing within the&#xD;
      field of medicine; however, its impact on persons with SCI and the use of tele-psychology are&#xD;
      not yet widespread. This proposed study aims to close this gap and can determine whether CBT&#xD;
      via iPad improves mood and quality of life (as measured by satisfaction with life) and can&#xD;
      assess if tele-psychology is an effective and replicable method for providing psychological&#xD;
      care. With evidence from this study elucidating the effectiveness of tele-psychology&#xD;
      utilizing rapidly advancing technology, tele-psychology for individuals with SCI may become&#xD;
      as usual and routine as in-person psychological treatment within several years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Contribution This project provides an innovative approach to treating depression and an&#xD;
      exciting opportunity to understand the treatment effects of our proposed tele-psychological&#xD;
      intervention for individuals with SCI. CBT treatment provided via iPad FaceTime&#xD;
      tele-psychology for depression is a novel approach that can easily be disseminated to other&#xD;
      SCI centers and community hospitals. Hence, medical teams will have an alternative option to&#xD;
      consider during the discharge planning stages of rehabilitation and during their transition&#xD;
      to home.&#xD;
