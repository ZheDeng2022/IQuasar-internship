  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess tolerability and safety of a personalized neo-antigen&#xD;
      vaccine containing up to 15 peptides derived from somatic mutation of the individual&#xD;
      patient's cancer, with CAF09b as adjuvant. The vaccine formulation will be administered in&#xD;
      combination with an approved anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 inhibitor to patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors. The endpoint is the characterization of adverse events (AE) assessed by CTCAE&#xD;
      4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is feasibility to manufacture a personalized neo-antigen vaccine&#xD;
      within 6 weeks of enrolment with the PIONEER pipeline, and to evaluate the immune response&#xD;
      before, during and after treatment with the personalized neo-antigen vaccine. And evaluate&#xD;
      the effect on the immune response correlated to dose escalation of peptides in the vaccine.&#xD;
      The endpoint is to evaluate the induction of adaptive immune responses to the personalized&#xD;
      neo-antigen vaccine measured by functional assays and peptide-MHC multimer stainings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tertiary objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the treatment. The endpoints&#xD;
      will be objective responses (OR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer immunotherapy has shown the ability to improve the survival of patients with multiple&#xD;
      types of advanced cancers. The human immune system can recognize the products of somatic&#xD;
      genetic alterations in tumors, or neo-antigens, which are not expressed on normal cells.&#xD;
      These neoantigens are an attractive immune target because their selective expression on&#xD;
      tumors can minimize immune tolerance as well as the risk of side effects such as autoimmune&#xD;
      reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although neoantigens are ideal targets for cancer immunotherapies, most neoantigens arise&#xD;
      from unique mutations and are not shared between individual patients. Thus,&#xD;
      neoantigen-directed immunotherapy will need to be personalized. Novel technical advances in&#xD;
      next-generation sequencing allow fast and systematic prediction of cancer neoantigens for&#xD;
      each individual patient. Initial attempts of therapeutic cancer vaccination targeting&#xD;
      individual neo-antigens have proven non-toxic and met their immunological endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study investigators will use the proprietary platform PIONEER for fast and accurate&#xD;
      identification of a neo-antigen vaccine tailored to each individual patient. The vaccine,&#xD;
      based on 5-15 peptides derived from a patient's tumor individual neo-antigens, will be&#xD;
      formulated with a novel adjuvant to strengthen CD8+ T cell immunity to cancer. Immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 will be administered both before, during and&#xD;
      after vaccination to unleash the activity of vaccine-induced immune responses.&#xD;
