  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis use is increasing and will only further escalate with legalization of recreational&#xD;
      and medical cannabis use in western countries , with a prevalence greater than 30 % in the US&#xD;
      and most European countries for individuals between 16 and 24 years of age. Approximately 9 %&#xD;
      of those who use cannabis will become addicted. The number goes up to about 1 in 6 among&#xD;
      those who start using cannabis as teenagers and to 25 to 50 % among those who smoke cannabis&#xD;
      daily. The consequences of cannabis abuse in the most prone population (14-25 years of age)&#xD;
      are extremely serious, and may include addiction, altered brain development, poorer&#xD;
      educational outcomes, cognitive impairment, lower income, greater welfare dependence,&#xD;
      unemployment and lower relationship and life satisfaction. There are no available&#xD;
      pharmacological treatments of cannabis use disorder (CUD). Thus, the development of safe and&#xD;
      effective medications for the treatment of CUD is an urgent public health priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preclinical efficacy and available ADMET (Administration, Distribution, Metabolism,&#xD;
      Elimination and Toxicology) in animal and human data suggest that AEF0117, an investigational&#xD;
      new study drug, could constitute a very efficacious and safe treatment for cannabis abuse&#xD;
      disorders. The purpose of this research is to study how AEF0117 influences the subjective&#xD;
      effects of cannabis in subjects with CUD. AEF0117 acts in the same parts of the brain as THC&#xD;
      (tetrahydrocannabinol), the active ingredient of marijuana, and may temporarily alter some of&#xD;
      cannabis's effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single center study in healthy male and non-pregnant female, non-treatment&#xD;
      seeking, cannabis smoking subjects with cannabis use disorder (CUD). The study design will be&#xD;
      a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, multiple dose escalation&#xD;
      study with AEF0117. This study is designed to test the effects of two to four doses of&#xD;
      AEF0117 compared to placebo on primarily peak subjective effects of cannabis as primary&#xD;
      objectives. The secondary objectives are to test the effects of AEF0117 compared to placebo&#xD;
      on cannabis self-administration, on cannabis-induced analgesia and on cognitive performance&#xD;
      in cannabis smoking subjects. The study hypothesis is that AEF0117 will decrease ratings of&#xD;
      cannabis' positive subject effects (e.g., 'good drug effect', high) and decrease cannabis&#xD;
      self-administration compared to placebo and also decrease the other unconditioned effects of&#xD;
      cannabis studied here. Each subject will have a screening visit, then be included for two&#xD;
      6-day inpatient periods separated by a minimum 14-day outpatient washout. Subjects will be&#xD;
      advised that they will receive both active and placebo study medication but will remain&#xD;
      blinded to whether they will receive AEF0117 or placebo on Period A and Period B. Each period&#xD;
      is composed of 5 consecutive days of treatment (active or placebo), one administration per&#xD;
      day. Research staff that interacts with study subjects will also remain blinded to whether&#xD;
      subjects are receiving AEF0117 or placebo. The study duration for the first 3 doses of&#xD;
      AEF0117 is estimated to be approximately up to 10 months from the start of subject&#xD;
      recruitment to the last subject last visit.&#xD;

      Cannabis use is increasing and will only further escalate with legalization of recreational&#xD;
      and medical cannabis use in western countries , with a prevalence greater than 30 % in the US&#xD;
      and most European countries for individuals between 16 and 24 years of age. Approximately 9 %&#xD;

&#xD;
      The preclinical efficacy and available ADMET in animal and human data suggest that AEF0117,&#xD;
      an investigational new study drug, could constitute a very efficacious and safe treatment for&#xD;
      cannabis abuse disorders. The purpose of this research is to study how AEF0117 influences the&#xD;

&#xD;
      This will be a single center study in healthy male and non-pregnant female, non-treatment&#xD;
      seeking, cannabis smoking subjects with cannabis use disorder (CUD). The study design will be&#xD;
      a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, multiple dose escalation&#xD;
      study with AEF0117. This study is designed to test the effects of two to four doses of&#xD;
      AEF0117 compared to placebo on primarily peak subjective effects of cannabis as primary&#xD;
      objectives. The secondary objectives are to test the effects of AEF0117 compared to placebo&#xD;
      on cannabis self-administration, on cannabis-induced analgesia and on cognitive performance&#xD;
      in cannabis smoking subjects. The study hypothesis is that AEF0117 will decrease ratings of&#xD;
      cannabis' positive subject effects (e.g., 'good drug effect', high) and decrease cannabis&#xD;
      self-administration compared to placebo and also decrease the other unconditioned effects of&#xD;
      cannabis studied here. It is hypothesized that AEF0117 will antagonize cannabis effects on&#xD;
      the basis of data: (a) in mice showing that AEF0117 antagonized all unconditioned effects of&#xD;
      THC tested; (b) in rats showing that AEF0117 decreased THC- induced dopamine release, and (c)&#xD;
      in nonhuman primates showing that AEF0117 antagonized THC self-administration and THC-induced&#xD;
      reinstatement of THC seeking. The study is also designed to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of escalating multiple oral&#xD;
      doses of AEF0117 in adult male and non-pregnant female, nontreatment seeking, cannabis&#xD;
      smoking subjects with cannabis use disorder (CUD). In this study, subjects will be closely&#xD;
      monitored through adverse event monitoring and vital signs measurements. This study will be&#xD;
      conducted in adherence to the study protocol, Good Clinical Practices (GCP). Data from this&#xD;
      study will be used to aid the design of future clinical studies in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol represents the first clinical study of AEF0117 in subjects with cannabis use&#xD;
      disorder and the third clinical study of AEF0117 in humans, therefore, the risks and benefits&#xD;
      in this patient population are not well known. The study hypothesis is that AEF0117 will not&#xD;
      precipitate withdrawal in cannabis abusers at any of the doses tested because (a): its&#xD;
      signaling-specific effects only partially modify the activity of the CB1 (cannabinoid&#xD;
      receptor type 1) receptor, and (b) AEF0117 did not precipitate withdrawal in THC-dependent&#xD;
      mice at doses 30 times higher than the ED50 (median effective dose ) antagonizing most of the&#xD;
      behavioral effects of THC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single-center study conducted in the USA. Approximately 48 cannabis-smoking&#xD;
      subjects with cannabis use disorder will be randomized into the study for the first 3 doses&#xD;
      of AEF0117. 16 additional cannabis-smoking subjects with CUD could be randomized into the&#xD;
      study for completion of Cohort 4. The study duration for the first 3 doses of AEF0117 is&#xD;
      estimated to be up to 10 months from the start of subject recruitment to the last subject&#xD;
      last visit. Each subject will have a screening visit, then be included for two 6-day&#xD;
      inpatient periods separated by a minimum 14-day outpatient washout period. Subjects will&#xD;
      provide signed informed consent upon enrollment into the study. Subjects will be advised that&#xD;
      they will receive both active and placebo study medication but will remain blinded to whether&#xD;
      they will receive AEF0117 or placebo in Period A and Period B. Each period is composed of 5&#xD;
      consecutive days of treatment (active or placebo), one administration per day. Research staff&#xD;
      who interact with study subjects will also remain blinded as to whether subjects are&#xD;
      receiving AEF0117 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least two multiple oral doses of AEF0117 will be tested in order to establish a dose&#xD;
      response of AEF0117 effects. The anticipated target dose is 0.2mg (referred to as 1x dose).&#xD;
      The starting dose will be 0.06 mg corresponding to the 0.3x dose. The anticipated doses range&#xD;
      will range between 0.02 and 1.2 mg that are respectively the 0.1x and the 6x dose levels. The&#xD;
      30x dose level has been evaluated in phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers with demonstration&#xD;
      of good safety and tolerability even at this supratherapeutic dose level. At the end of each&#xD;
      cohort, available efficacy, safety and tolerability data will be reviewed for all subjects as&#xD;
      a function of active (AEF0117) versus placebo medication by a data monitoring consortium&#xD;
      consisting of the principal investigator, the sponsor and external representatives of a Data&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The above representatives will receive an unblinded interim&#xD;
      report on these data (Safety and Efficacy Interim Report) and they will only be unblinded to&#xD;
      data from the finalized cohort. The doses administered in cohort 2 and cohort 3 will be&#xD;
      decided according to the decision process summarized below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First cohort dose: 0.06mg (0.3x dose) Second Cohort dose will be either: a. 0.2mg (1x dose)&#xD;
      if the 0.06 mg dose induces a decrease &lt; 70% in cannabis subjective effects; or b. 0.02 mg&#xD;
      (0.1x dose) if the 0.06 mg dose induces a reduction &gt;70% in cannabis subjective effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third cohort dose if second cohort dose = 0. 2 mg then the dose will be either: a. 0.6mg (3x&#xD;
      dose) if 0.2 and 0.06 mg doses do not induce a significant reduction in cannabis subjective&#xD;
      effects; or b. 0.6 mg if the reduction in cannabis subjective effects at 0.2mg is &gt; to the&#xD;
      one at 0.06 mg; or c. 0.02 mg if the reduction induced by 0.06mg is ≤ a significant reduction&#xD;
      induced by 0.2 mg. Third cohort dose if second cohort dose = 0.02 mg: then the dose will be&#xD;
      0.2 mg (1x dose) if the reduction induced by 0.02mg is ≤ the reduction induced by 0.06 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourth cohort dose if third cohort dose = 0. 6 mg then the dose will be: a. 1.2mg (6x dose)&#xD;
      if 0.06, 0.2 and 0.6 do not induce a significant reduction in cannabis subjective effects; or&#xD;
      b. 1.2 mg if the reduction in cannabis subjective effects at 0.6mg is &gt; to the one at 0.2 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned dose escalation schema may be amended based on the ongoing safety and efficacy&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each dose will be tested in an independent cohort of subjects (estimated inclusion of up to&#xD;
      n=16 per dose). Subjects will be recruited in group of 4 subjects until n=12 have completed&#xD;
      each dose cohort to ensure that there is sufficient statistical power to analyze the efficacy&#xD;
      of AEF0117 in attenuating cannabis subjective effects (e.g., good drug effect, high).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both periods of treatment (A and B), eligible subjects will be admitted to the research&#xD;
      center by approximately 1200 h in the afternoon prior to Day 1 and will remain confined at&#xD;
      the research facility until the morning of Day 6. Subjects randomized to Group 1 will receive&#xD;
      AEF0117 in Period A and placebo in Period B. Subjects randomized to Group 2 will receive&#xD;
      placebo in Period A and AEF0117 in Period B. According to the pharmacokinetic properties of&#xD;
      AEF0117 extrapolated from the pharmacokinetic results of the previous phase I studies&#xD;
      (AEF0117 101 and AEF0117-102), a minimum of 14 days of washout will be scheduled between&#xD;
      Period A and Period B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be awakened at approximately 0800 h on study days, will receive food boxes,&#xD;
      will have vital sign measurements (sitting blood pressure, pulse rate, weight) and will&#xD;
      complete a subjective-effects and a sleep questionnaire. Study medication containing either&#xD;
      AEF0117 or placebo will be administered at approximately 0900 h on Days 1-5 of both period A&#xD;
      and period B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma samples for PK and PD (except cortisol, estradiol and progesterone) analysis will be&#xD;
      obtained at predose, 3 h, 9.5 h and 24 h after the first administration and at Day 6 (24 h&#xD;
      after the last administration on Day 5) of each period. Cortisol, estradiol and progesterone&#xD;
      analysis will be obtained at predose on Day1 and on Day6 (at 24h after the last&#xD;
      administration on Day5) of both periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each Study Day, at approximately 1230 h, subjects will receive an&#xD;
      experimenter-administered 'sample' of 6 puffs of cannabis (1 5-second puff/minute). Then at&#xD;
      1250 h, 1310 h, 1330 h, 1400 h and 1415 h, subjects will complete a subjective-effects&#xD;
      questionnaire and a cannabis rating form. At 1330 h, subjects will also complete a cognitive&#xD;
      task battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1, at 1430 h, subjects will receive a baseline evaluation of their pain threshold and&#xD;
      tolerance using the CPT (cold pressor test). They will then receive at 1445 h another&#xD;
      experimenter-administered sample of cannabis. The CPT will be repeated at 30, 60, 90, 120 and&#xD;
      180 min after cannabis administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning at 1415 h on Study Days 2 through 5, subjects will be given the option to&#xD;
      self-administer individual puffs of cannabis (up to 6 puffs/time point) every 2.0 hour until&#xD;
      2030 h (maximum = 24 puffs). Subjects will have to purchase the cannabis puffs using their&#xD;
      study stipends ($2/puff).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabis self-administration and food intake will be recorded and mood, sleep, cognitive and&#xD;
      cardiovascular effects will be measured repeatedly throughout each study day Safety&#xD;
      monitoring (vital sign measurement and adverse event monitoring) will be performed throughout&#xD;
      the study. Subjects will have a safety evaluation on Days 6 of each Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific instruments for evaluating cannabis effects will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) - 44-item VAS instrument which assesses mood, positive&#xD;
           subject effects, physical symptoms, medication effects, drug craving and subjective&#xD;
           ratings of sleep. Based on a cluster analysis, arithmetic means of individual item&#xD;
           scores reduces the 44-items VAS into six subscales including: 'good drug effect',&#xD;
           'irritable', 'anxious', 'bad effect', 'tired' and 'social'. As primary endpoint, the&#xD;
           evaluation of AEF0117 effects on peak changes in the subjective effects of cannabis&#xD;
           (e.g. good drug effect, high) will be assessed using the &quot;Good Drug Effect&quot; subscale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cannabis Rating Form - 5 item VAS scale which evaluates the cannabis effects that they&#xD;
           just smoked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive Performance Battery -A series of 4 tasks measuring attention (Sustained&#xD;
           Attention to Response Task), processing speed (Digit Symbol Substitution Task),&#xD;
           recognition memory (Behavioral Pattern Separation Task) and Reaction Time/Response&#xD;
           Inhibition (Color Stroop).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective Sleep Measures - subjects will wear an Actiwatch® Activity Monitoring System&#xD;
           that records objective sleep outcomes (e.g., sleep latency, sleep efficiency).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep questionnaire - 7-item VAS instrument that assesses the quality of sleep and how&#xD;
           many hours slept the previous night and wakefulness in the morning on Study Days 1-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiovascular effects - sitting heart rate and blood pressure are measured at 0830 h&#xD;
           (baseline i.e., predose) and at 1200 h (3 hours post medication administration). A blood&#xD;
           pressure cuff will be placed on the non-dominant arm with connections to a Sentry II&#xD;
           automated vital signs monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food intake - a wide range of food items will be available ad libitum to subjects&#xD;
           throughout each study day. Restrictions on foods include grapefruits, Seville oranges,&#xD;
           tangelos, grapefruit, orange and apple juices. Daily caloric intake will be calculated&#xD;
           (subject's daily recording of time and quantity of food consumed will be verified by an&#xD;
           examination of food trash).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be monitored by research staff and medical observations and spontaneous&#xD;
      reporting throughout the study. The grading system of adverse events used in this study will&#xD;
      be the grading system proposed by Sibille M., et. al. Specifications on the grading system&#xD;
      for clinical observations and ECG parameters will be based on the publication by Sibille M,&#xD;
      Patat A, et al. Vital signs and laboratory parameters will be based on the FDA vaccine&#xD;
      guidance (The Biologics Blood Vaccines Guidance Compliance, FDA). The planned dosing&#xD;
      escalation schedule can be modified during the course of the study based on the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety data. At the end of each cohort, efficacy and safety data of each cohort from Day 1&#xD;
      through to the morning of Day 6 of each Period will be evaluated in all subjects in this&#xD;
      cohort as a function of active (AEF0117) versus placebo medication by a data monitoring&#xD;
      consortium consisting of the principal investigator, the sponsor and external representatives&#xD;
      of a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The above representatives will receive an unblinded&#xD;
      interim report on these data and they will only be unblinded to data from the finalized&#xD;
      cohort. Interim reports prepared for the evaluation of the dose escalation will be made and&#xD;
      the decision to progress to the next dose or to modify the subsequent dose will be jointly&#xD;
      made by the principal investigator, the sponsor and the external representatives of the DSMB&#xD;
      according to a predefined charter. The planned dose escalation may be modified to include the&#xD;
      repetition of a dose, to escalate to an intermediate dose level (i.e., to a higher or lower&#xD;
      increment of dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, dose escalation and dose administration within the same cohort should discontinue if&#xD;
      at least one of the drug related stopping criteria described below is observed within the&#xD;
      same cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Criterion 1: Occurrence of any serious (grade 4) adverse event (SAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Criterion 2: Occurrence of any severe (grade 3) adverse events (AE) in 2 or more&#xD;
           subjects treated with AEF0117 at any given dose (evaluated after un-blinding during the&#xD;
           study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event criterion 1 or 2 is reached, the dose escalation will be discontinued, unless&#xD;
      the AE is determined by the Investigator, the Sponsor and the external representatives of the&#xD;
      DSMB to be clearly unrelated to the administration of the study medication and has a clear&#xD;
      alternative explanation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Criterion 3: Moderate (grade 2) adverse events (AE's) is at least a safety alert leading&#xD;
           to cautious and closer assessment of safety in other subjects. An upgrading applies if&#xD;
           rapid worsening, concomitant laboratory findings, clinical symptoms and signs occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Criterion 4: Changes in clinical signs grade 2 of the same character (similar&#xD;
           abnormality) in 3 or more subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Criterion 5: Changes in vital signs grade 2 of the same character (similar abnormality)&#xD;
           in 3 or more subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event criteria 3, 4 and 5 are reached, the dose escalation scheme may be modified by&#xD;
      repeating the dose, by lowering the dose or decreasing the increment of dose escalation and&#xD;
      continue the study with a new cohort of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these are the minimum criteria, dose escalation may be suspended on the basis of&#xD;
      other safety information considered to pose a risk to the subjects and agreed to between the&#xD;
      sponsor and the investigator. The number of subjects evaluated for pharmacodynamic endpoints&#xD;
      and safety assessments for dose escalation determination (i.e., 12-16 subjects at each dose&#xD;
      level) is empirically based and not based on a formal sample size determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 12 completers will provide at least 90% statistical power to detect changes&#xD;
      in subjective effects as a function of medication. Based on treatment effects and variability&#xD;
      observed in an earlier study and the hypothesis that AEF0117 will decrease ratings of&#xD;
      cannabis' positive subjective effects (e.g., 'good drug effect'; high), a sample size of 12&#xD;
      would have a 90% power for detecting a mean difference of 36 mm on a 100 mm VAS scale in a&#xD;
      cross-over design at p = 0.05 (two-tailed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mood, physical symptoms, food intake, sleep, cognitive task performance, and cardiovascular&#xD;
      effects will be analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) models. A&#xD;
      cluster analysis of peak subjective-effects ratings to reduce the overall number of&#xD;
      comparisons will be employed. Tests of differences will be based on F statistics with degrees&#xD;
      of freedom corrected, depending on the observed within-subject correlation of the measures,&#xD;
      using the method of Huynh and Feldt. Planned contrasts will be single degree of freedom&#xD;
      comparisons using the appropriate interaction error term. Results will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05, using 2-tailed tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated-measures analysis of variance will be used to assess cannabis's peak analgesic&#xD;
      effects as a function of medication condition (active or placebo AEF0117). Dependent&#xD;
      variables will include pain sensitivity and tolerance and subjective pain effects as assessed&#xD;
      by the pain intensity and bothersomeness scales. For each medication condition, pain&#xD;
      sensitivity and tolerance will be calculated for each participant as the percent of the&#xD;
      baseline pre-dosing CPT response. Results will be considered statistically significant when&#xD;
      p-values are equal to or less than 0.05 using Huynh-Feldt corrections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma pregnenolone, DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone ), testosterone, allopregnanolone,&#xD;
      endocannabinoids (AEA and 2AG), concentrations will be summarized for AEF0117 and placebo&#xD;
      using descriptive statistics. Serum cortisol, estradiol and progesterone concentrations will&#xD;
      be summarized for AEF0117 and placebo using descriptive statistics. Pharmacokinetic Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma AEF0117, THC and the metabolites 11-OH-THC (11-hydroxy-THC) and 11-COOH-THC&#xD;
      (11-carboxy-THC) concentrations will be summarized descriptively by dose and displayed&#xD;
      graphically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluations (adverse events monitoring, vital signs measurements and appearance of&#xD;
      signs of cannabis withdrawal) will be summarized for AEF0117 and placebo by dose level and&#xD;
      pooled doses using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
