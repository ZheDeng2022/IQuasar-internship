      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with early stage invasive disease, surgery can either be a breast conserving&#xD;
      resection of the primary tumor or a mastectomy. Several randomized prospective clinical&#xD;
      trials have indicated that breast conserving surgery with whole breast radiation provides&#xD;
      long term outcomes equivalent to those of mastectomy. The goal of breast conserving surgery&#xD;
      is to remove the primary tumor with surgical margins that are free from invasive or in-situ&#xD;
      disease. A secondary goal is to provide the best possible cosmetic outcome without&#xD;
      retraction, nipple displacement, or excess volume loss from the procedure. For some women&#xD;
      with larger breasts, oncoplastic surgery can be used in which local tissue rearrangements are&#xD;
      performed at the time of surgical resection to maintain optimal breast aesthetics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation is essential component of breast conserving therapy. The use of RT improved&#xD;
      recurrence free, breast cancer specific survival and overall survival in both patients with&#xD;
      negative and positive axillary lymph nodes in the most recent meta-analysis of Early Breast&#xD;
      Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group(EBCTCG)5 which included trials begun before 2000.It&#xD;
      included data from 42080 patients with breast cancer treated in 78 clinical trials that&#xD;
      investigated loco regional treatments between 1952 and 1995.Among those patients were 7311&#xD;
      patients treated in 10 trials comparing radiation vs no radiation after breast conserving&#xD;
      surgery and 9933 patients treated in 25 trials comparing radiation vs no radiation after&#xD;
      modified radical mastectomy. In the trials that investigated radiation as a component of&#xD;
      breast conserving therapy, radiation was shown to reduce the risk of local recurrence by two&#xD;
      thirds and to improve the absolute 15 year overall survival rate by 6% (41% versus&#xD;
      35%).Similarly for patients with positive lymph nodes treated with modified radical&#xD;
      mastectomy, radiation reduced the risk of loco-regional recurrence rate by 21% at 15&#xD;
      years(29% versus 8%), which was associated with a 5% decrease in the 15 year breast cancer&#xD;
      mortality rate (60% versus 55%).A more recent update of the analyses continues to demonstrate&#xD;
      loco-regional and survival advantages for radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if surgical margins are negative after BCS, 30-40% risk of microscopic tumor cells in&#xD;
      tumor bed. Most recurrences (65-80%) are located in vicinity of tumor bed as shown in EORTC6&#xD;
      trial and NSABP-06 trial. It is therefore important to ensure the tumor bed lies well inside&#xD;
      the treatment volume encompassed by tangential fields to whole breast and subsequent tumor&#xD;
      bed boost. There is also a pathological basis for giving boost to tumor bed-residual tumor&#xD;
      foci have been reported in 1-2 cm in around 20-25% patients/ histopathological specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EORTC 22881-108827 trial studied the effect of addition of a boost dose on the primary&#xD;
      tumor bed after lumpectomy in breast conserving treatment for breast cancer.It was found that&#xD;
      47% of local recurrences were in primary tumor bed, at 10 years, the cumulative incidence of&#xD;
      local recurrence was 10.2% versus 6.2% for the 0 Grays and the 16 Grays boost groups (p&lt;&#xD;
      0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumor beds of medially and laterally located tumors are particularly prone to under&#xD;
      dosage if surface landmarks are used as fiduciary points for whole breast RT planning. It is&#xD;
      therefore very important to localize the tumor bed even for whole breast RT planning.Clinical&#xD;
      planning of tumor bed boost volume based on preoperative imaging, surgical note and breast&#xD;
      scar position is very unreliable. Increasingly the breast scar is placed often some distance&#xD;
      from the tumor for wire guided localisation biopsy or better cosmetic outcome. In addition&#xD;
      the practice of oncoplastic surgery where breast tissue is re-positioned following wide&#xD;
      excision to minimize the surgical deficit is becoming standard of care. In this situation the&#xD;
      preoperative imaging bears very little final relation to tumor bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography and ultra-sonography can use the seroma as a surrogate for tumor bed&#xD;
      position, but there are limitations. First, the seroma is only clearly defined in only about&#xD;
      quarter of patients. Second the seroma underestimates the tumor bed defined by implanted&#xD;
      clips.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uncertainty in localizing the tumor bed in medial or lateral tumors can be overcome by&#xD;
      increasing the posterior field borders of whole breast tangents, but only at expense of&#xD;
      increased morbidity of rib cage and lung, and potential mortality in women with left sided&#xD;
      tumors. The heart is the most sensitive organ, a few Gy being associated with risk of heart&#xD;
      disease and every effort needs to be made to exclude the organ from treatment volume. When&#xD;
      localizing the tumor bed boost, increasing the clinical target volume is a crude way of&#xD;
      avoiding geographical miss. This is particularly important in the era of oncoplastic surgery&#xD;
      when the tumor bed may be well away from its primary location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate delineation of the target volume is of utmost importance while delivering tumour bed&#xD;
      boost with external beam radiotherapy. Different institutions use different methods for&#xD;
      delineation of the tumour bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical history and patients' recollection of tumor position, clinical photographs, tattoos,&#xD;
      surgical scar, mammography, surgical clips, ultra-sonography, Computerized tomography (CT)&#xD;
      scan and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the commonly utilized techniques. Many a times,&#xD;
      a combination of one or more of these techniques is considered while delineating the tumor&#xD;
      bed boost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among all the randomized trials assessing role of radiotherapy boost, surgical clips were&#xD;
      used in all patients for assessing boost volume only in the Budapest tria. It was&#xD;
      hypothesized that increasing differences between local failure rates in whole breast&#xD;
      radiotherapy (WBRT) arm versus WBRT+boost arm in Lyon trial (4.5% vs. 3.6%), EORTC trial&#xD;
      (10.2% vs. 6.2%) and Budapest trial (15.5% vs. 6.7%) may well have been due to the different&#xD;
      techniques of tumor bed delineation as the difference in boost doses between all these trials&#xD;
      were not significantly different. Hence an accurate delineation of tumor bed is important as&#xD;
      it may translate into improved local control rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor bed localisation and open or closed cavity BCS: With superficial closure, only the&#xD;
      superficial aspect of the cavity is closed, allowing the formation of a seroma to prevent&#xD;
      deformation of the breast. A full-thickness closure consists of re-positioning of the&#xD;
      surrounding breast tissue and suturing the deep and superficial layers, preventing the&#xD;
      development of significant seroma. There is a paucity of data on the influence of surgical&#xD;
      closure techniques on EB treatment planning. It can be hypothesized that superficial closure&#xD;
      may lead to a better-delineated cavity as a well-visualized seroma has been shown to decrease&#xD;
      inter observer variations nevertheless, it may also lead to a larger treatment volume and&#xD;
      greater late toxicity effects. However, with full-thickness closure, the surgical clips may&#xD;
      be displaced with the approximation of the surrounding breast tissue and not correlate with&#xD;
      the true extend of the cavity. In a recently published single institutional experience,Shaikh&#xD;
      . did not find statistically significant difference in mean cavity visualization scoring&#xD;
      (CVS) or normal tissue dosimetric endpoints between 29 patients who underwent superficial&#xD;
      closure and sixteen patients who underwent full-thickness closure. A higher percentage of&#xD;
      patients who underwent superficial closure had CVS scores &gt;2 (79% vs. 63%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoplastic BCS techniques with parenchymal rearrangement present new challenges to the&#xD;
      localisation of the tumor bed and therefore delivery of local boost radiotherapy. Although&#xD;
      use of whole-breast radiation therapy (RT) is straight forward, difficulties in localization&#xD;
      of the tumor bed for the local RT boost have not been investigated.Thus, in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients who have undergone oncoplastic surgery, the tumor bed is frequently more extensive&#xD;
      and possibly more relocated compared to original presentation. Placement of surgical clips&#xD;
      after tumor resection and before oncoplastic reconstruction may be the most accurate method&#xD;
      to localize the RT local boost field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the boost fields defined on the basis of clinical details have been found to be&#xD;
      erroneous in several studies. Hence, the dimensions as well as depth for tumor bed boost&#xD;
      should be determined either by fluoroscopic or CT combined with surgical clips, or an&#xD;
      ultrasound. The most common prescription isodose for electron boost delivery is 90-95%&#xD;
      isodose. But, in an organ such as breast with multiple edges and curvatures in different&#xD;
      axes, the prescription isodose may not cover the whole target volume uniformly. This problem&#xD;
      is commonly seen when tumors are located at areas where there is a sudden change in the&#xD;
      depths like inflammatory and axillary folds. The depths of soft tissue vary greatly in these&#xD;
      areas and uniform energy electron beam may either underdose the tumor bed, or deliver higher&#xD;
      dose to underlying normal structures. The electrons have limited role in patients with large&#xD;
      breasts, tumors situated at a depth i.e. closer to heart (on left) and lungs and in folds. CT&#xD;
      based planning in three dimensions may help to determine the dose distributions accurately&#xD;
      and help in choosing the optimal energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The margins to be given to tumor bed for defining boost field have also been discussed.&#xD;
      Harrington et al have shown that a boost field marked on the basis of clinical data and&#xD;
      background with a margin of 2 cm all around covers radio logical field with same margin in&#xD;
      only 1/3rd (33%) of patients. Although Vicini et al. showed that a margin of 1 cm around the&#xD;
      tumor covers microscopic disease adequately, in EORTC trial margins of 1.5 cm were given for&#xD;
      microscopically completely excised tumors. Overall, a margin of 1.5-2 cm to the tumor bed has&#xD;
      been reported to cover all sub-clinical disease in patients with clear microscopic margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some institutions have practiced tumor bed boost by 4-6 MV photons. The practice of&#xD;
      delivering boost by photons has declined after widespread availability of electrons due to&#xD;
      higher penetration and increased doses to underlying critical structures. Photons can be used&#xD;
      in patients with small tumor bed as late term sequel of electrons such as telangiectasia may&#xD;
      not be acceptable to some patients treated with electrons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods- Patients will be screened for the study at the time of radiotherapy&#xD;
      simulation for External beam radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size has not been calculated as this is a pilot study.Twenty patients will be&#xD;
      accrued for the purpose of this study. The patients will be divided into three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A- Patients who underwent open cavity BCS Group B- Patients who underwent closed cavity&#xD;
      BCS Group C- Patients who underwent oncoplasty Inclusion Criteria- All patients undergoing&#xD;
      Breast Conservative Surgery (Open Cavity/Closed Cavity) or Oncoplasty will be eligible for&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria-1.Patients undergoing Neoadjuvant chemotherapy will not be eligible for&#xD;
      the purpose of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.All patients undergoing Modified Radical Mastectomy will not be eligible for the purpose of&#xD;
      this study Informed consent will be taken for all patients at the time of Radiotherapy&#xD;
      simulation. All patients will first receive external beam Radiotherapy to the whole breast to&#xD;
      a dose of 40 Grays /15#/3 weeks. The patients will then be planned for boost radiation to the&#xD;
      tumor bed to a dose of 12.5 Grays/5#.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of surgical clips with a treatment planning CT scan for the lumpectomy site&#xD;
      for electron boost and to determine the appropriate energy will be used for tumor bed boost&#xD;
      delineation For the boost planning CT scan a small thermocol wedge will be used, with a&#xD;
      pillow under the shoulder to make the surface as flat as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pT size in HPR of lumpectomy plus a margin of 2 cm in all directions is the approximate&#xD;
      size of the boost field. The margins of this field are marked on the skin with the center of&#xD;
      scar as the center of the field and copper wire is placed on the markings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 mm slice thickness CT scan will be taken in the treatment position. After the scan&#xD;
      acquisition the data will be transferred to the Varian Eclipse treatment planning system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-operative cavity depicted on the CT images will be contoured section by section. All&#xD;
      available images will be assigned a cavity visualization score (CVS) as per the British&#xD;
      Columbia Cancer Agency Cavity visualization score 0-No visible seroma, 1-scar/shadow,&#xD;
      2-seroma identifiable but with significant (&gt;30%) uncertainties, 3-seroma identifiable with&#xD;
      minor (&lt;30%) uncertainties, 4- seroma easily identifiable, generally homogeneous with some&#xD;
      blurring of margin, 5-seroma clearly identifiable, homogeneous with sharp boundaries. The&#xD;
      mean cavity visualization score will be determined for each group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CTV will be generated by using a 15 mm uniform expansion from the lumpectomy cavity but&#xD;
      limited by skin and chest wall. The CTV will be extended by an additional 10 mm uniform&#xD;
      expansion to generate the PTV Treatment plans for tumor bed boost irradiation will be made&#xD;
      using both electrons and photons with 3DCRT technique for each patient and comparison will be&#xD;
      made for various dosimetric variables. The photon beam plan will only be generated for&#xD;
      purposes of dosimetric study and will not be used for treatment of the patients The following&#xD;
      dosimetric variables will be determined for each patient -seroma cavity volume (ccs). PTV&#xD;
      volume (ccs).In addition the ratio between the PTV volumes to the whole breast volume will be&#xD;
      determined. The Radiation Conformity Index (RCI) will be determined for both set of plans. It&#xD;
      was first defined by Knoos et al and a revised definition appeared in ICRU 62 It is the ratio&#xD;
      of volume of the PTV to the volume that receives 95% prescribed dose or higher (RCI= V PTV/ V&#xD;
      95%). The Dose Homogeneity Index (DHI) will be determined for both set of plans (DHI). It is&#xD;
      ratio of dose received by 95% of PTV volume to the dose received by 5% of PTV volume (DHI=&#xD;
      D≥95%(within PTV) / D≥5% (within PTV) ). The dose received by several normal structures will&#xD;
      be determined for both set of plans-normal ipsilateral breast tissue (Whole breast volume-&#xD;
      PTV volume), contralateral breast, ipsilateral lung, contralateral lung and heart The borders&#xD;
      of the portal will be modified based on the position of the lumpectomy cavity/seroma of the&#xD;
      scan and marked on the patient. The boost irradiation for all patients will be done using&#xD;
      electrons. The energy of electrons required will be decided from the depth of the lumpectomy&#xD;
      cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition the cosmesis will be determined for all the patients prior to starting&#xD;
      radiotherapy, at the time of conclusion of radiotherapy and 6 months post completion of&#xD;
      radiotherapy. This will be done by using the criteria suggested by Harris et al&#xD;
