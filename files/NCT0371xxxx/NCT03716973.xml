  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look into the effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in reducing&#xD;
      chronic neuropathic pain in patients who have not had previous spinal surgery. This will be&#xD;
      assessed by comparing the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) questionnaire responses before and&#xD;
      after the SCS intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also investigate the effect of HD frequency parameters on the improvement of quality&#xD;
      of life, sleep and any adverse events following the spinal cord stimulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used for patients with chronic&#xD;
      neuropathic pain following back surgery (a condition known as Failed Back Surgery Syndrome&#xD;
      (FBSS)). Although the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also&#xD;
      recommends SCS for chronic neuropathic pain without previous back surgery, clinical outcome&#xD;
      data is much needed in this patient group. Conventionally, patients receiving SCS are&#xD;
      provided with tonic stimulation settings (where they feel tingling and paraesthesia); however&#xD;
      newer methods include high-density stimulation (HD) that provides higher energy allowing the&#xD;
      voltage to be reduced to subthreshold parameters, hence minimizing the tingling and&#xD;
      paraesthesia. HD stimulation is widely offered to patients with SCS as part of routine&#xD;
      clinical practice, although no known studies have yet investigated HD settings in patients&#xD;
      with neuropathic pain without previous spinal surgery. Therefore, the purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to determine the effectiveness of HD settings in patients without previous spinal surgery&#xD;
      undergoing SCS. 20 patients without previous spinal surgery who are deemed suitable for SCS&#xD;
      as part of NICE guidelines 159 pathway will be recruited for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients have a trial of SCS where they will be offered HD settings. If successful (&gt;50%&#xD;
      improvement in pain scores) they will be offered permanent implant. Those patients whose pain&#xD;
      does not improve with HD settings will be further offered conventional tonic stimulation for&#xD;
      one more week. Those patients who do not respond to both tonic and HD settings will be&#xD;
      excluded and will not have permanent implant. This will also allow us to investigate the&#xD;
      patient's preference between the HD neurostimulator settings and conventional tonic settings.&#xD;
      We will also investigate the response to these stimulator settings on health related quality&#xD;
      of life. Patients will complete quality of life questionnaires at Baseline, 1-month, 3-months&#xD;
      and 12-months post-implant.&#xD;
