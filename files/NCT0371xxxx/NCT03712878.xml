  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well a 2-step approach to stem cell transplant works in&#xD;
      treating participants with blood cancers. Giving chemotherapy and total body irradiation&#xD;
      before a lymphocyte (white blood cell) and stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of&#xD;
      cells in the bone marrow including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells.&#xD;
      By giving the donor cells in two steps, the dose of lymphocytes given can be tightly&#xD;
      controlled and they can be made more tolerant to the body. When the healthy lymphocytes and&#xD;
      stem cells from a donor are infused into the participant, they may help the participant's&#xD;
      bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the&#xD;
      transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells&#xD;
      called graft versus host disease. Giving tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil may stop this&#xD;
      from happening.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess whether providing a patient with &quot;5+5&quot; dosing in a 2 step matched related donor&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) increases the percentage of patients who&#xD;
      achieve full donor chimerism earlier as defined by 98% or greater donor T cell chimerism at&#xD;
      28 days post HSCT (d+28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess day (d) +90 chimerism in patients receiving &quot;5+5&quot; dosing. II. To assess post&#xD;
      HSCT relapse rates in patients receiving &quot;5+5&quot; dosing. III. To assess rates of grade II-IV&#xD;
      graft versus host disease (GVHD) in patients receiving &quot;5+5&quot; dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess treatment-related mortality (TRM) in patients receiving &quot;5+5&quot; dosing.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provide signed and dated informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a hematological malignancy or any type of dyscrasia in which allogeneic HSCT is&#xD;
             thought to be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a related donor who is no more than a 1-antigen mismatch at the human leukocyte&#xD;
             antigen (HLA)-A; B; C; DR loci in the GVHD direction with the patient. (Patients with&#xD;
             a syngeneic donor may be treated on this therapeutic approach, but their outcomes will&#xD;
             not be part of the statistical aims of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  LVEF (left ventricular end diastolic function) of &gt;= 45%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DLCO (diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide) &gt;= 50% of predicted&#xD;
             corrected for hemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FEV-1 (forced expiratory volume at 1 second &gt;= 50% of predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum bilirubin =&lt; 1.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 2.5 x upper&#xD;
             limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance of &gt;= 60 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) score =&lt; 5 points&#xD;
             (patients with greater than 5 points will be allowed for trial with approval of the&#xD;
             principal investigator [PI] and at least 1 co-investigator [co-I] not on the primary&#xD;
             care team of the patient). This is an adjustment to account for healthy patients who&#xD;
             meet the spirit of this protocol but have histories that result in higher than HCT-CI&#xD;
             5 points. An example is a patient with a solid tumor malignancy in their remote&#xD;
             history (adds 3 points to HCT-CI total) where the treatment for the malignancy&#xD;
             occurred years to decades before and there has been complete recovery of toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a Karnofsky performance score (KPS) &gt;= 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of reproductive potential (defined as women under the age of 50 years still&#xD;
             menstruating within 2 months of HSCT despite past history of chemotherapy) will be&#xD;
             counseled to use highly effective contraception including oral, intramuscular (IM), or&#xD;
             patch contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), diaphragm, cervical cap, or&#xD;
             contraceptive implant. Pharmacological avoidance of pregnancy and suppression of&#xD;
             menstruation may be instituted during the HSCT inpatient stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men will be asked to abstain from sexual relations during the treatment period of the&#xD;
             HSCT stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DONOR: All donors are selected and screened for their ability to provide adequate&#xD;
             infection-free apheresis products for the patient in a manner that does not put the&#xD;
             donor at risk for negative consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received alemtuzumab or rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) within 8 weeks or&#xD;
             horse ATG within 6 weeks of the transplant admission. This exclusion criterion will be&#xD;
             documented by the absence of these drugs in the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with evidence of another malignancy, exclusive of a skin cancer that requires&#xD;
             only local treatment, should not be enrolled on this protocol without the specific&#xD;
             approval of the PI. If the PI disregards this criterion (example of this is localized&#xD;
             prostate cancer not yet requiring treatment), the rationale must be documented in the&#xD;
             study binder). This exclusion criterion will be documented by the absence of these&#xD;
             drugs in the medical record.&#xD;
