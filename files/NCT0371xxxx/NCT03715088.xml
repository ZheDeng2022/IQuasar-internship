    <textblock>
      It is established that resistance training improves metabolic health; however, the mechanisms&#xD;
      of this process are not fully understood. A biologically active substance, irisin, has&#xD;
      recently received interest in the scientific community with respect to its effects on energy&#xD;
      expenditure and weight loss. The purpose of this study is to compare the different irisin&#xD;
      release response during a resistance exercise training session. The study will compare&#xD;
      individuals two different age groups (young adults: age 18-30; older adults: age 65-75)&#xD;
      living with obesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Background: Worldwide, the number of individuals living with obesity has doubled over the&#xD;
      past thirty years. The growing prevalence of obesity is concerning as obesity is known to be&#xD;
      one of the main risk factors for many chronic conditions, such as Type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it is important that the impact of different types of&#xD;
      exercise are understood to properly prescribe exercise interventions to individuals living&#xD;
      with obesity. Recently, there has been increased interest for a biologically active&#xD;
      substances that are secreted during muscle contraction, myokines, regarding their effects on&#xD;
      metabolism during exercise. Specifically, a novel myokine, named irisin, has caught the&#xD;
      attention of numerous researchers. Irisin has been shown to play an important role in&#xD;
      increasing energy expenditure, reducing body weight, and improving glucose metabolism by&#xD;
      adipocyte metabolism. As of now, the majority of research has focused on irisin release&#xD;
      during endurance activity; however, there is limited research on irisin secretion during&#xD;
      resistance exercise training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement of Objectives: The purpose of this pilot study is to first determine whether irisin&#xD;
      secretion increases during an acute session of resistance exercise training with obese&#xD;
      individuals; and second, to determine whether changes in irisin levels during an acute bout&#xD;
      of resistance exercise training can be seen in different age groups for obese individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Fifteen young and fifteen old participants will be recruited via advertisement&#xD;
      in the local newspaper, on radio stations, and on posters. Inclusion criteria include&#xD;
      individuals aged between either 18-30 or 65-75 years old, classified as obese according to&#xD;
      their BMI (&gt;30 kg/m2), inactive defined as engaging in less than 150 minutes of moderate to&#xD;
      vigorous aerobic exercise, not currently engaged in a resistance exercise training program,&#xD;
      no previous diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes, and having no injuries or conditions that would&#xD;
      prevent them from performing a resistance exercise training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measure: The primary outcome measure in this study will be the change in&#xD;
      irisin levels during resistance exercise training. A validated enzyme immunoassay kit from&#xD;
      Phoenix Pharmaceutical Inc. (EK-067-16) will be used to measure irisin. Our group already has&#xD;
      experience with this equipment and these procedures, which has been validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance Exercise Session: Participants will come for their first visit at which time they&#xD;
      they will perform a test to determine their maximal strength [1-repetition maximal (1-RM)]&#xD;
      for each exercise included in the program. During their second visit, participants will&#xD;
      perform 10 different resistance exercises consisting of three sets of 8-10 repetitions, at&#xD;
      80% of 1-RM. A 60-second rest will occur between sets. This exercise protocol was selected&#xD;
      based on literature that suggests that the protocol and the intensity do not enhance&#xD;
      mitochondria biogenesis. Also, this protocol was shown to be well tolerated by obese and&#xD;
      older individuals.&#xD;
