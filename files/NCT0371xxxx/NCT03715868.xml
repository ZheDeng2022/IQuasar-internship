  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery is associated with a high risk of postoperative AKI with significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. To date, no preventive or therapeutic measures exist to prevent&#xD;
      this. According to the data from animal trials, a preoperative diet with a deficiency of&#xD;
      milk-derived proteins may be a new preventive measure in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will investigate whether one week of changing the diets protein source to a&#xD;
      non-milk-derived one prior to surgery effectively induces renal protection from post-surgery&#xD;
      AKI in humans. Patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery are randomized into two arms. In&#xD;
      the non-milked-derived based diet arm, patients receive an appropriate formula diet based on&#xD;
      a protein source other than milk derived proteins. In the control arm, patients are provided&#xD;
      with a formula diet based on milk-protein. Total amount of calories and proteins is not&#xD;
      restricted and - due to randomization - assumed not to be significantly different between the&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery is associated with a high risk of postoperative AKI with significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Acute kidney injury (AKI) constitutes a significant complication in&#xD;
      hospitalized patients with an incidence of about 30%. Depending on existing comorbidities, a&#xD;
      mortality of up to 60% occurs in critically ill or postoperative patients with AKI. To date,&#xD;
      no preventive or therapeutic measures exist to prevent this. According to the data from&#xD;
      animal trials, a preoperative diet low in sulfur-containing amino acids may be a new&#xD;
      preventive measure in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will investigate whether one week of changing the diets protein source to a&#xD;
      non-milk-derived one prior to surgery effectively induces renal protection from post-surgery&#xD;
      AKI in humans. Patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery are randomized into two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the non-milked-derived based diet arm, patients receive an appropriate formula diet based&#xD;
      on a protein source other than milk derived proteins. The formula diet replaces the regular&#xD;
      diet completely from day -7 until the scheduled cardiothoracic surgery. The amount of formula&#xD;
      diet is based on individual calculations to cover the patients daily energy demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control arm, patients are provided with a formula diet based on milk-protein,&#xD;
      accordingly. Total amount of calories and proteins is not restricted and - due to&#xD;
      randomization - assumed not to be significantly different between the two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the clinical trial is to investigate whether a preoperative diet with&#xD;
      a deficiency of milk-derived proteins leads to a reduction of AKI incidence within 72 hours&#xD;
      after surgery. AKI is defined according to 'Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes'&#xD;
      (KDIGO) classification as an increase in serum creatinine of ≥0.3 mg/dl within 48 hours, or&#xD;
      an increase of serum creatinine to ≥1.5 times baseline, which is known or presumed to have&#xD;
      occurred within the prior 7 days, or a reduction of urine output to &lt;0.5ml/kg/hour for more&#xD;
      than 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline creatinine will be assessed prior to the start of the surgical procedure. The time&#xD;
      frame for the following assessments with respect to the primary endpoint will be 72 hours&#xD;
      from the onset of ischemia (cross-clamping). Blood samples will be obtained at 24 hours, 48&#xD;
      hours, and 72 hours after cross-clamping. Hourly urine output will be assessed as long as a&#xD;
      Foley-catheter is in place.&#xD;
