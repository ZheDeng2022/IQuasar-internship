  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to look at how using an injectable marker called&#xD;
      TraceIT can help with the radiation treatment planning process. TraceIT is a gel that&#xD;
      dissolves in the body over time and can be injected and is visible on many types of images&#xD;
      that can be used in the treatment planning process. If the exact edges of negative tumor&#xD;
      margins can be marked before treatment planning, it is thought that the area receiving&#xD;
      radiation can be more personalized, thus potentially reducing unnecessary radiation to areas&#xD;
      that are cancer-free.&#xD;

    <description>Following successful tumor resection, TraceIT Tissue Marker will be applied in 0.2 to 0.5 mL injections at 5 locations to mark the tumor bed: superiorly, inferiorly, laterally, medially, and center of resection. The marginal injections will be within 3 mm of the resection edge and within 5 mm deep. The center of the resection bed will be injected within 5 mm deep if possible.&#xD;
Within 6 weeks after surgery, a CT simulation scan will be performed per normal protocol for patients receiving surgery followed by adjuvant therapy. This scan will be used to generate the IMRT treatment plan&#xD;
Two treatment plans will be performed per patient using the simulation CT scan. One will be the standard of care treatment plan and will be the basis of the actual radiation treatment they receive. The second treatment plan will be based on utilizing the TraceIT hydrogel markers as a guide for the resection bed.</description>
