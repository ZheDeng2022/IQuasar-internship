  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the abatacept&#xD;
      drug product converted from drug substance by a new drug substance process (Treatment A)&#xD;
      relative to the current drug substance process (Treatment B) following a single dose (750 mg)&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) infusion in healthy participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be admitted to the clinical facility the day prior to dosing (Day -1) and&#xD;
      will be confined until at least 24 hours post-dose. On Day 1, eligible participants will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either Treatment A or Treatment B. The randomization will be&#xD;
      stratified by weight categories: &gt;= 60 to &lt; 70 kg, &gt;= 70 to &lt; 80 kg, &gt;= 80 to &lt; 90 kg, and &gt;=&#xD;
      90 to &lt;= 100 kg.&#xD;
