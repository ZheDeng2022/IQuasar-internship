  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying the removal of a subset of white blood cells (called&#xD;
      alpha/beta T cells) from the donor product using a cell separation device before the product&#xD;
      is transplanted into the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device used to remove the α/βT cells in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -CliniMACS® TCR α/β Reagent System&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients who receive an allogeneic (using another person as the donor) stem cell transplant&#xD;
      (SCT) are at risk for developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The word &quot;graft&quot; refers to the donor blood cells that you will receive during the transplant.&#xD;
      The word &quot;host&quot; refers to the person receiving the cells. GVHD is a complication of&#xD;
      transplantation where the donor graft attacks and damages some of the participant's tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GVHD may occur when the T cells (a type of white blood cell that helps protect the body from&#xD;
      infection) from the donor react against normal tissues or organs in the body. There are two&#xD;
      basic types of GVHD:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute GVHD often occurs early (generally first 3-6 months after SCT) may affect skin,&#xD;
           gastrointestinal tract (stomach and intestines) and liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic GVHD often occurs later (Usually after 3-6 months after SCT) and may affect many&#xD;
           organs and significantly diminish quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To confirm the diagnosis of acute or chronic GVHD, the participant may be asked to have a&#xD;
      biopsy (a small sample of the participant's tissue to look at under the microscope) of the&#xD;
      skin, gut, or, rarely, the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigator are investigating a pre-transplant intervention&#xD;
      aimed to prevent GVHD by processing the donor product with the Miltenyi CliniMACS TCR α/β&#xD;
      Reagent System. The Reagent System will remove certain cells (called T-Cell Receptor (TCR)&#xD;
      α/β positive T-cells) that are thought to cause GVHD from donor product before it is given to&#xD;
      the participant. By selectively removing this specific type of T cells from the donor&#xD;
      product, the investigators hope to reduce the risk for GVHD without reducing the efficacy of&#xD;
      the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved CliniMACS α/β T cell&#xD;
      depletion system for use in the US, but this system is approved by the European Medicines&#xD;
      Agency (EMA) and used in Europe&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    The study was prematurely closed to enrollment due to feasibility issues, as the site has&#xD;
    promising upcoming competing trials, and the study was already not enrolling at a rate&#xD;
