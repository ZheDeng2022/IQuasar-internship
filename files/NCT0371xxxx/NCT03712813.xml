      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of low intensity vibration (LIV) delivered&#xD;
      for 10 minutes twice daily for 12 months on skeletal muscle function, in terms of energetic&#xD;
      capacity measured by power generation on a stationary bicycle, among patients with early&#xD;
      stage breast cancer planned to initiate aromatase inhibitor therapy who do not currently&#xD;
      participate in regular exercise, compared to a wait- listed control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase II, two arm, single-center study designed to compare the effect of&#xD;
      LIV versus wait-list control on the clinical parameter of energetic capacity, or power&#xD;
      generation, in patients with early stage breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy&#xD;
      over a 12-month period. The primary endpoint is the 12-month change in energetic capacity&#xD;
      since baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective To compare the effect of LIV delivered for 10 minutes twice daily for 12&#xD;
      months on skeletal muscle function, in terms of energetic capacity measured by power&#xD;
      generation on a stationary bicycle, among patients with early stage breast cancer planned to&#xD;
      initiate aromatase inhibitor therapy who do not currently participate in regular exercise,&#xD;
      compared to a wait- listed control&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the effect of LIV versus wait-listed control upon muscle contractile&#xD;
           properties including peak power, fatigue resistance, and recovery, measured by&#xD;
           isokinetic knee extension&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the effect of LIV versus wait- listed control upon body composition (lean&#xD;
           mass, total adiposity) measured by DXA scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the effect of LIV versus wait- listed control upon bone mineral density (T&#xD;
           score) measured by DXA scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the effect of LIV versus wait- listed control upon muscle adipose&#xD;
           infiltration measured by muscle density on peripheral quantitative CT imaging of the&#xD;
           proximal and distal tibia and radius&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare the effect of LIV versus wait-listed control on trabecular and cortical&#xD;
           volumetric bone mineral density by high resolution peripheral quantitative CT of the&#xD;
           distal and diaphyseal tibia and radius&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To compare the effect of LIV versus wait- listed control on serologic markers of bone&#xD;
           turnover, including TGF-beta and NTX&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To compare the effect of LIV versus wait- listed controls upon patient reported outcome&#xD;
           measures of fatigue (measured by the Basic Fatigue Inventory), muscle ache, and joint&#xD;
           pain (measured by PRO-CTCAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To describe the feasibility of LIV in this patient population, defined by patient&#xD;
           compliance and follow up with the intervention&#xD;
