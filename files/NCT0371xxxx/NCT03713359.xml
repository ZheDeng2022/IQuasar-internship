      The study is conducted to evaluate the safety and Immunogenicity of Measles-Rubella combined&#xD;
      vaccine MRVAC produced by POLYVAC (phase 3) on Vietnamese volunteers and to demonstrate&#xD;
      non-inferiority on the immunogenicity of MRVAC in comparison to MR vaccine produced by Serum&#xD;

      A phase III, Randomized, control study to compare the immunogenicity and safety of MRVAC&#xD;
      vaccine produced by POLYVAC with MR vaccine licensed in Vietnam produced by Serum Institute,&#xD;
      India.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the safety of MRVAC produced by POLYVAC on Healthy Vietnamese volunteers from 1&#xD;
           - 45 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluate the safety by the ratio of participants having following symptom/signs:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The ratio of immediate adverse events (local adverse events and systemic adverse&#xD;
                events), within 30 minutes after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The ratio of participants having local and systemic adverse events (including&#xD;
                unexpected adverse events) occur within 28 days after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The ratio of serious adverse events (SAEs) occur from day 0 to day 28 after&#xD;
                vaccination. (SAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the immunogenicity of MRVAC produced by POLYVAC on the healthy volunteers from&#xD;
           1 - 45 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The rate of sero-conversion;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  GMT (Geomatric mean Antibody titer) after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparison the safety and immunogenicity between MRVAC and control vaccine.&#xD;
