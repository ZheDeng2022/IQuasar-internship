  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a significant burden to the individual and society with post-surgical pain&#xD;
      identified as a research priority for the speciality of anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to explore the relationship between IENFD and pain after caesarean section&#xD;
      and to explore the characteristics of post-caesarean section pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that reduced pre-operative IENFD at the surgical site will correlate with&#xD;
      risk of developing CPSP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the existing evidence, chronic pain after caesarean section appears to have an&#xD;
      incidence between 12-18%; with the current Scottish caesarean section rate, this equates to&#xD;
      approximately 3000 young, active women each year. Their lives may be affected by pain leading&#xD;
      to increased analgesic use, a restriction of daily activities, decreased quality of life, and&#xD;
      increased utilisation of healthcare services. The National Institute of Academic Anaesthesia&#xD;
      (NIAA) has undertaken a priority setting exercise with 1700 patients and clinicians and&#xD;
      declared the prevention of chronic post-surgical pain as one of its top 10 research&#xD;
      priorities for the speciality of Anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IENFD is calculated by counting the number of nerve fibres crossing the basement membrane&#xD;
      through direct visualisation of a skin biopsy that has undergone immunohistochemical&#xD;
      staining. Skin biopsy is minimally invasive and allows visualisation of small fibre&#xD;
      nociceptors that are not suitable for identification or study through nerve conduction&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is emerging evidence from clinical studies that chemotherapy induced peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy (CIPN) patients have altered sensory innervation compared to healthy controls. In&#xD;
      both colorectal cancer and multiple myeloma, pre-oncological treatment reductions in IENFD&#xD;
      were associated with changes in physical testing, confirming a subclinical sensory deficit.&#xD;
      The degree of loss of IENFD correlates with development of mechanical hyperalgesia and&#xD;
      patients with greater sensory loss at baseline developed more symptoms during and after&#xD;
      chemotherapy. To date there have been no studies that have examined the relationship between&#xD;
      a patient's pre-operative IENFD and the development of chronic post-surgical pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single cohort observational study shall recruit women undergoing elective caesarean&#xD;
      section within the Simpson's Centre for Reproductive Health (SCRH). All women shall be sent a&#xD;
      patient information sheet with a covering letter one week prior to the date of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There shall be five discrete data collection points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before caesarean section: a researcher shall collect patient demographic data,&#xD;
           information about their general health and ask the patient to complete a Hospital&#xD;
           Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale (HADS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the time of caesarean section: a punch biopsy shall be taken from the incision site&#xD;
           and be sent for INEFD testing. This will be carried out once surgical anaesthesia has&#xD;
           been achieved thereby not causing any discomfort to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24 hours post caesarean section: The patient's electronic record shall be consulted, if&#xD;
           there has been any traumatic events (e.g. death or significant injury to the baby) then&#xD;
           we shall remove the patient from the study to prevent causing any further emotional&#xD;
           distress. The participant will be informed of this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A researcher shall ask the patient to complete the BPI (omitting section 9 that is&#xD;
      non-applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ 3 &amp; 6 months post caesarean section: The patient's electronic record shall be consulted, if&#xD;
      there has been any traumatic events (e.g. death or significant injury to the baby) then we&#xD;
      shall remove the patient from the study to prevent causing any further emotional distress.&#xD;
      The participant will be informed of this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A researcher shall contact participants by phone and, if they have pain, ask them to complete&#xD;
      the following questionnaires: HADS, BPI and S-LANSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A researcher shall attempt to contact the patient twice via telephone, leaving a message if&#xD;
      able, but if there is no answer or response then an assumption will be made that the&#xD;
      participant wishes to longer be involved. No further attempts at contact will be made.&#xD;
