The module includes 35 questions Assessing symptoms and side effects of treatment, social function and body image/sexuality .This scale includes seven symptoms subscales that measure pain, swallowing, senses problems, speech problems, trouble with social eating, trouble with social Contact, and less sexuality, and also has 11 subscales related with teeth, opening mouth, dry mouth, sticky saliva, coughing, ill feeling, weight loss, weight gain, use of painkillers, nutritional supplements, and feeding tubes. Standardize the original scores, with scores ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing more serious problems.</description>
