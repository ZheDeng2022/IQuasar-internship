      Breast cancer patients with ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node metastasis are defined as&#xD;
      Ⅲc stage (N3) according to the newly published 8th AJCC TNM staging system. No concret guide&#xD;
      line was supported to such patients. It is still pending whether to exert supraclavicular&#xD;
      lymph node dissection to breast cancer patients with ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the clinical significance and complication of supraclavicular lymph node&#xD;
      dissection for breast cancer patients with ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node metastasis,&#xD;
      the investigators randomize patients into two groups, one group is supraclavicular lymph node&#xD;
      dissection with radiotherapy group, the other group is radiotherapy group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of deaths from cancer in women&#xD;
      worldwide. Breast cancer patients with ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node metastasis are&#xD;
      defined as Ⅲc stage (N3) according to the newly published 8th AJCC TNM staging system.&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes are similar for patients with ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node&#xD;
      metastases at first presentation and for patients with recurrent ipsilateral supraclavicular&#xD;
      lymph node metastases. The survival rate was lower in patients with ipsilateral&#xD;
      supraclavicular lymph node metastases than in patients with lower axillary or subclavian&#xD;
      nodal involvement. No concrete guide line was supported to such patients. It is still pending&#xD;
      whether to exert supraclavicular lymph node dissection to breast cancer patients with&#xD;
      ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node metastasis. Patients with ipsilateral supraclavicular&#xD;
      lymph node metastases who were treated with surgery or radiotherapy and achieved good neck&#xD;
      control were reported to achieve better survival than those for whom surgical treatment or&#xD;
      irradiation did not result in good local control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node metastases should be offered a combined&#xD;
      modality approach, including systemic therapy, surgery, and radiotherapy. Furthermore, local&#xD;
      treatment, usually including axillary and supraclavicular lymph node, either by surgical&#xD;
      clearance or by radical radiotherapy, can prevent the tumor cells from drainage, might be&#xD;
      play a more important role. However, the role of surgical removal of the supraclavicular&#xD;
      nodes is uncertain compared with radical radiotherapy. To our knowledge, the available&#xD;
      literature comparing these two local treatments of ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node&#xD;
      metastases is scarce. Furthermore, the studies comparing the outcome of dissection of&#xD;
      supraclavicular lymph node combined with local radiotherapy and radiotherapy of&#xD;
      supraclavicular lymph node is also rare. All the related reports up to date have mixed them&#xD;
      up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the clinical significance and complication of supraclavicular lymph node&#xD;
      dissection for breast cancer patients with ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node metastasis,&#xD;
      we randomize patients into two groups, one group is supraclavicular lymph node dissection&#xD;
      with radiotherapy group, the other group is radiotherapy group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in addition to investigating the role of surgical removal of the supraclavicular&#xD;
      nodes in Chinese patients, we also try to reveal the potential difference between these two&#xD;
      treatments, hoping to bring more insight into clinical practice.&#xD;
