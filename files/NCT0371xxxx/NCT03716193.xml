  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will take measurements of a variety of tumors involving the skin in order to&#xD;
      assess changes in tumor oxygen from hyperoxygenation therapy and standard cancer-directed&#xD;
      treatments, to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of using in vivo Electron Paramagnetic&#xD;
      Resonance (EPR) Oximetry to obtain clinically useful measurements of tumor oxygen levels from&#xD;
      cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients in this study will receive standard of care therapy for their cancer at the&#xD;
      discretion of their treating physician(s). All subjects will be assigned to one of the four&#xD;
      cohorts for which they qualify; there is no randomization and no stratification within the&#xD;
      cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 - Patients who will receive definitive surgery for a primary malignancy of the skin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 - Patients who will receive definitive radiation (+/- concurrent systemic therapy)&#xD;
      for a primary malignancy of the skin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3 - Patients who will receive palliative radiation (+/- concurrent systemic therapy)&#xD;
      for any tumor involving the skin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 4 - Patients who will receive systemic therapy alone (without radiation) for any tumor&#xD;
      involving the skin&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled in this study will undergo two initial measurements of their tumor&#xD;
      oxygen level. On the first day, a small metal disc (less than 1 cm in diameter) called a&#xD;
      SPOTChip will be placed on the surface of the tumor, and held in place using an adhesive. The&#xD;
      patient will then be positioned (lying down or sitting) between a set of two magnets that are&#xD;
      used to measure the oxygen level in the tumor. A small plastic oxygen detector will be placed&#xD;
      on the skin over the tumor. These devices will be used to take a measurement of the tumor's&#xD;
      oxygen level at baseline, then while breathing oxygen through a clear plastic facemask, and&#xD;
      then a final time after the oxygen facemask has been removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the measurements are taken, a small amount (20-50 microliters) of India ink will be&#xD;
      injected into the tumor using a small (28-gauge) needle. The India ink will make a permanent,&#xD;
      dark blue/black colored mark on the tumor. The ink leaves a permanent tattoo in the spot&#xD;
      where it is injected, unless it is physically removed surgically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will return for another measurement, at least 2 days later. This measurement will&#xD;
      use the India ink that was previously injected (described above) and there will no longer be&#xD;
      a need to use the SPOTChip. For the India ink tumor oxygen measurement a small piece of wire&#xD;
      (called a loop resonator) will be placed over the tumor and held in place using medical honey&#xD;
      and saran wrap or tape. The Investigator will first take a measurement of the tumor's oxygen&#xD;
      level at baseline, then while breathing oxygen through a clear plastic facemask, and then the&#xD;
      mask will be taken the tumor's oxygen level will be measured as it returns to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have surgical excision of the tumor (cohort 1) will not have any further&#xD;
      measurements after this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are being treated with radiation therapy (cohorts 2 &amp; 3), will come back for&#xD;
      weekly measurements of the tumor during treatment, followed by one additional measurement one&#xD;
      month after they have completed the course of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients being treated with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or other systemic therapies without&#xD;
      radiation (cohort 4), will come back for measurements every 3-4 weeks around the time of&#xD;
      their regular infusion, followed by one additional measurement one month after they complete&#xD;
      the course of systemic therapy.&#xD;
