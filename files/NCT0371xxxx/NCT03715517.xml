    <textblock>
      This project proposes to compare epidural versus spinal anesthesia in patients having liver&#xD;
      resection surgery. The investigators hypothesize that spinal anesthesia will result in&#xD;
      improved blood pressure control postoperatively and reduce the amount of intravenous fluids&#xD;
      required after surgery. Spinal anesthesia is expected to provide the same pain control&#xD;
      benefits as epidurals, with faster recovery of function. Spinal anesthesia may be a simple&#xD;
      and effective way to improve and enhance the recovery in the increasing number of patients&#xD;
      requiring liver resection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic resection surgery (hepatectomy) for primary or metastatic malignancy is a major&#xD;
      operation involving large, painful upper abdominal incisions, as well as considerable&#xD;
      postoperative physiological derangements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uncontrolled postoperative incisional pain results in significant respiratory impairment,&#xD;
      delayed mobilization, and augmentation of the surgically-induced stress response, placing&#xD;
      patients at increased risk of postoperative complications and chronic post-surgical pain.&#xD;
      Acute pain management with high-dose parenteral opioids further compounds this risk.&#xD;
      Multimodal opioid-sparing therapy, and regional anesthesia in particular, is therefore an&#xD;
      essential component of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways and patient-centred&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthesia using neuraxial block (intraoperative spinal anesthesia or thoracic&#xD;
      epidural anesthesia) followed by postoperative continuous thoracic epidural analgesia (CTEA;&#xD;
      postoperative administration of epidural local anesthetic and/or opioid) is the best method&#xD;
      for treating pain following large abdominal surgeries, including liver resection, and has&#xD;
      been shown to improve postoperative respiratory function and decrease respiratory&#xD;
      complications in other surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the effects of intraoperative neuraxial block and postoperative CTEA on fluid&#xD;
      balance, systemic hemodynamics, and functional recovery after hepatic resection surgery&#xD;
      remain controversial. CTEA is frequently associated with postoperative hypotension, resulting&#xD;
      in increased perioperative intravenous (IV) fluid administration, red blood cell transfusion,&#xD;
      and vasopressor use in liver resection patients. For major hepatectomies, CTEA may also be an&#xD;
      independent risk factor for postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI), presumably due to&#xD;
      impairment of renal autoregulation. Excessive IV fluid administration in the postoperative&#xD;
      period is associated with significant weight gain, often necessitating diuretic therapy;&#xD;
      delayed return of gastrointestinal function; increased need for packed red blood cell (pRBC)&#xD;
      transfusion due to hemodilution; increased infective complications due to this increased pRBC&#xD;
      transfusion rate; and increased length of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, concerns remain about the use of CTEA following liver resection surgery due to&#xD;
      the potentially increased risk of epidural hematoma formation in the setting of postoperative&#xD;
      coagulopathy. This concern has resulted in unplanned delays in epidural catheter removal&#xD;
      postoperatively, due to persistent coagulation abnormalities, prolonging hospitalization by&#xD;
      1-3 d in up to 15% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These concerns about the consequences of excess fluid administration and the safety of CTEA&#xD;
      for liver resection surgery have prompted the use of alternative and/or ancillary analgesic&#xD;
      techniques, particularly for major resections and in patients with preoperative liver&#xD;
      dysfunction, for whom a prolonged period of postoperative coagulopathy is anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative spinal anesthesia (SA) using local anesthetic (LA) and/or opioid (most&#xD;
      commonly intrathecal morphine [ITM]) for neuraxial block without CTEA is frequently used as&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia for various surgeries. Spinal anesthesia using ITM without LA has&#xD;
      been reported in four randomized and three non-randomized studies of patients undergoing&#xD;
      liver resections. ITM has provided superior analgesia to IV patient-controlled analgesia&#xD;
      (IV-PCA) with opioids, and equivalent analgesia to epidural infusions. Compared with CTEA&#xD;
      and/or IV-PCA, ITM was associated with reduced IV fluid administration; earlier mobilization,&#xD;
      and resumption of normal dietary intake; decreased incidence of respiratory complications;&#xD;
      and decreased hospital length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal anesthesia using both LA and ITM may provide an additional benefit by providing a&#xD;
      degree of preemptive analgesia, as well as by decreasing the stress and inflammatory&#xD;
      response, thereby possibly decreasing the incidence of surgical stress-related complications&#xD;
      such as postoperative delirium. High-spinal anesthesia (HSA) uses larger doses of LA to&#xD;
      achieve a &quot;high&quot; block for this purpose. HSA combined with ITM has been used in cardiac&#xD;
      surgery, and decreases the stress and inflammatory response to surgery; facilitates early&#xD;
      extubation; improves postoperative analgesia; decreases the incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      delirium; and decreases intensive care unit (ICU) readmissions. Neither the use of HSA (with&#xD;
      or without ITM) for analgesia following non-cardiac surgical procedures, nor the&#xD;
      effectiveness of SA with ITM versus CTEA following hepatic resection surgery has been&#xD;
      investigated to date.&#xD;

The QoR-15 is a 15-item patient-completed questionnaire including items measuring pain, physical comfort, psychological support, emotional state, and independence in activities of daily living over the preceding 24 hours. Items are rated on a 10-point scale, with higher subscale (item) and total scale values indicating a better outcome. The scale's validity (content, criterion, and construct), reliability (test-retest and internal consistency [inter-item and split-half coefficients]), responsiveness (minimal clinically important difference [MCID] = 8.0), acceptability, and feasibility properties have been well-established.</description>

    <time_frame>7 days after surgery or until hospital discharge, whichever occurs earlier</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) Short Form v1.0 - Sleep Disturbance (SD) 8a scale assesses self-reported perceptions of sleep quality, sleep depth, and restoration associated with sleep. The 8-item self-report version (Short Form [SF]) of the PROMIS® SD 8a scale included in this study queries sleep disturbance symptomatology based on the past 7 days, with each item rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (almost always). All item scores are summed to calculate a total raw score where higher scores indicate more severe sleep disturbance symptomatology. Psychometric evaluations of the 8-item PROMIS® SF SD 8a in a wide range of patient populations have provided support for its high reliability (test-retest, internal consistency) and validity (convergent, divergent, face, construct). A smaller between-group increase from baseline (preoperative) to 7-day postoperative PROMIS® SF SD 8a T-scores indicates a better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>72 hours after surgery or until hospital discharge, whichever occurs earlier</time_frame>
    <description>The Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score (OBAS) is a patient-reported outcome measure of seven pain-related quality-of-life indicators: (1) pain intensity at rest (scored 0-4, 0 = minimal pain, to 4 = maximum imaginable pain); patient-reported distress with respect to five opioid-related adverse effects (each scored 0-4, 0 = not at all, to 4 = very much): (2) vomiting, (3) itching, (4) sweating, (5) freezing, and (6) dizziness; and (7) patient satisfaction with pain treatment (scored 0-4, 0 = not at all, to 4 = very much). To calculate the OBAS score, the scores for items 1-6 and 4 minus the score for item 7 are summed for a total scale score range of 0 to 28, with lower values indicating a better outcome.</description>
