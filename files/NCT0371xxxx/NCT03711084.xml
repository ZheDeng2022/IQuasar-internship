  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine potential differences in neurocognitive responses to food-related&#xD;
      cues, physiological and appetite responses as well as subsequent energy intake following the&#xD;
      consumption of preloads differing in sweetness and/ or postprandial metabolic effects in&#xD;
      healthy normal weight subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excess consumption of caloric sweeteners, together with the high availability of palatable&#xD;
      food cues are some of the factors for the alarming high rates of overweight and obesity.&#xD;
      Although non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) are used to decrease energy content of foods and&#xD;
      beverages, there is an on-going debate on the relationship between NNS intake, obesity and&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk. Caloric sugars have a differing effect on physiological responses&#xD;
      compared to NNS. However it is almost wholly unknown how NNS consumption affects eating&#xD;
      behaviour and cognitive processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study compares the performance on food related neurocognitive tasks following the&#xD;
      consumption of the test preloads on 5 visits. In particular, sucrose, glucose, maltodextrin,&#xD;
      water or a natural high potency sweetener from leaf extract will be ingested as single test&#xD;
      agents in randomized order. Water will be used as a control for gastric distension and&#xD;
      non-sweet, whereas maltodextrin will be used as a non-sweet control for carbohydrate content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to attend a screening visit at the Neuroscience and Psychiatry&#xD;
      Unit of the University of Manchester on a morning after overnight fast. Participants' weight&#xD;
      and height, fasting blood glucose and blood pressure will be measured. This will be followed&#xD;
      by some questionnaires regarding general health status, weight and dieting history and eating&#xD;
      behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who satisfy the inclusion criteria, will be then invited to take part in the&#xD;
      full study. This will require 5 separate visits at the University of Manchester, which will&#xD;
      be scheduled between 11.30 and 13.30. Participants will have to attend these visits after&#xD;
      having fasted for 3-4 hours and will be asked to have their regular breakfast in the morning&#xD;
      before the testing session, and then not eat or drink anything else for 3-4 hours until they&#xD;
      come in the lab for the testing session. Water will be allowed up to 1 hour prior to your&#xD;
      testing session. Prior to each testing session participants will be asked to have the same&#xD;
      breakfast, and they will have to provide a picture of the breakfast each time to ensure&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 5 visits correspond to 5 test beverages, both the participants and the investigators are&#xD;
      blinded to the study treatments. Blood will be collected at 0 (before the consumption of the&#xD;
      test beverage), 15, 30 and 60 min after the consumption of the drink. Participants will also&#xD;
      be asked to rate their feeling of hunger, fullness etc using visual analogue scales (VAS) at&#xD;
      the same time points 0, 15, 30 and 60 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen min after the consumption of the drink, participants will complete a set of&#xD;
      computer-based tasks. They are designed to capture behaviour in response to food cue&#xD;
      presentation. This will last approximately 15 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty min after the consumption of the drink, a lunch buffet will be served and participants&#xD;
      will be free to eat as much or as little as they like until feeling comfortably full. Each&#xD;
      session is anticipated to last for approximately 1 hour.&#xD;
