      Background: In pediatric anesthesia, selection of the appropriate endotracheal tube (ETT)&#xD;
      size is an important task because the inappropriate one may lead to much complication. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to compare between the subglotic diameter and the epiphysis diameter of&#xD;
      radius measured by ultrasonography for prediction of optimum endotracheal tube size in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients aged from 1 to 6 years will be scheduled for elective surgery under general&#xD;
      anesthesia and intubation, were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly divided into&#xD;
      three groups according to method of choosing the tube size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aged group (n =49): determined the optimal endotracheal tube size according to age of the&#xD;
      child (internal diameter [ID] in mm = [age in years + 16] /4) suggested by Cole.4 Subglottic&#xD;
      diameter group (n =49): The subglottic transverse diameter was estimated with ultrasonography&#xD;
      on the middle of the anterior region of the neck at the level of cricoid cartilage.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pediatric anesthesia, selection of the appropriate endotracheal tube (ETT) size is an&#xD;
      important task because the inappropriate one may lead to much complication. Oversized tubes&#xD;
      cause airway edema, post- extubation stridor, subglottic stenosis, or cartilaginous ischemia,&#xD;
      smaller ones increase the resistance to gas flow and risk of aspiration, insufficient&#xD;
      ventilation, and poor monitoring of end tidal gases.Therefore, many methods have been&#xD;
      suggested recently to precisely predict the optimal size of ETT in children to avoid any&#xD;
      harmful complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the anesthesiologists choose the appropriate ETT size by using calculating formulae&#xD;
      which are based on the children's descriptive data such as weight, height or age. The Cole's&#xD;
      equation (internal diameter [ID] in mm = [age in years + 16] / 4) is still considered as one&#xD;
      of the prevalent methods in spite of its poor prediction power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone and cartilage growth of the body are supposed to be related to each other, therefore&#xD;
      some measurements of body growth as bony cartilage growth of the hand are worthy of attention&#xD;
      as a marker of tracheal diameter specially bone measurements for the hand is generally&#xD;
      accepted as the indicator of growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, the transverse diameter or width of the child's fifth fingernail has been used to&#xD;
      select the size of ETT. However, a few reports have stated that it is unreliable method to&#xD;
      predict the correct tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epiphyseal transverse diameter of the distal radius measured by ultrasonography is a good&#xD;
      predictor of the appropriate ETT size. This formula can be rephrased in a tidy way as&#xD;
      follows: ETT (mm) = (29.5 + EpiRad [mm])/8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasonography could be a reliable, safe, and non-invasive modality for evaluation of&#xD;
      the upper airway at the level of subglottic region which considered the narrowest diameter of&#xD;
      upper airway and may be helpful to estimate the proper size endotracheal tube. Ultrasound&#xD;
      offers a number of advantages compared to other competitive imaging modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is to find the best, easier way and most safe method to select the optimum ETT size for&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare between the subglotic diameter and the epiphysis diameter of radius measured by&#xD;
      ultrasonography for prediction of optimum endotracheal tube size in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Gap:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, it is the first study conducted in Egypt to evaluate the value of&#xD;
      ultrasonography in selecting the appropriate endotracheal tube size in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selecting the ideal endotracheal tube size is a challenging issue needing more appropriate&#xD;
      method for selection. Up till now, no ideal method is present and most physicians depend upon&#xD;
      roughly calculated formulas for choosing the size. These methods depend mainly upon patients'&#xD;
      age. Here, we used ultrasonography as a simple and accurate method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient &amp; Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be done at Mansoura University Children's Hospital over a three month&#xD;
      duration starting from October 2018 till January 2019. Informed consents will be obtained&#xD;
      from patients' guardians or parents and the participant data will be kept confidential. All&#xD;
      participants are free not to participate in the research at any time without penalty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated using Medcalc 15.8 (https://www.medcalc.org/). The primary outcome&#xD;
      of interest is the incidence of appropriate tube selection. Previous studies found that the&#xD;
      incidence of appropriate tube selections were 74.7% using subglottic US, 45.3% for Cole's&#xD;
      formula and 90% for epiphyseal diameter (Gnanaprakasam &amp; Selvaraj, 2017; Rajanalini &amp; Anitha,&#xD;
      2018). Using the difference between subglottic &amp; cole's (29.4%): sample size = 49 per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged from 1 to 6 years will be scheduled for elective surgery under general&#xD;
      anesthesia and intubation, were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly divided into&#xD;
      three groups (49 patients each) according to method of choosing the tube size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aged group (n =49): determined the optimal endotracheal tube size according to age of the&#xD;
      child (internal diameter [ID] in mm = [age in years + 16] /4) suggested by Cole.4 Subglottic&#xD;
      diameter group (n =49): The subglottic transverse diameter was estimated with ultrasonography&#xD;
      on the middle of the anterior region of the neck at the level of cricoid cartilage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epiphyseal diameter group (n =49): the epiphyseal transverse diameter of the distal radius&#xD;
      was estimated with ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross sectional observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intravenous cannula was inserted and secured. General anesthesia was induced by inhalation&#xD;
      of sevoflurane or intravenous administration of intravenous anesthetic as thiopental sodium&#xD;
      (5 mg/kg). Muscular relaxation was achieved with atracurium (0.5mg/kg) to facilitate ETT&#xD;
      intubation under direct laryngoscopy. The lungs were ventilated with 100% oxygen via a&#xD;
      facemask before intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Size of the initial tube was selected as follows: Aged group determined ETT size according to&#xD;
      age of the child (internal diameter [ID] in mm = [age in years + 16]/4) suggested by Cole.4&#xD;
      In subglottic diameter group, the subglottic diameter was estimated with B-mode&#xD;
      ultrasonography (Korean, Siemens, Acuson, x300) with a 10-13-MHz linear probe positioned on&#xD;
      the midline of the anterior neck. The evaluation began by identifying the true vocal folds as&#xD;
      paired hyperechoic linear structures that moved with respiration and swallowing before&#xD;
      patients were paralyzed. The probe was then moved caudally to visualize the cricoid arch&#xD;
      which appears as an arched, rounded and hypoechoic structure. The transverse air-column&#xD;
      diameter was measured at the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage after patients were&#xD;
      paralyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurements of the subglottic diameter was used to select the size of the outer diameter&#xD;
      of ETT by the equation [ETT OD=0.55*(subglottic diameter) +1.16, R2= 0.90 for un-cuffed].9 In&#xD;
      epiphyseal diameter group , The epiphyseal transverse diameter of the distal radius was&#xD;
      measured by B-mode ultrasonography (Korean, Siemens, Acuson, x300) with a 10-13-MHz linear&#xD;
      probe, the internal diameter of ETT was selected by using the equation internal diameter of&#xD;
      ETT (mm) = (29.5 + EpiRad [mm])/8 (EpiRad: transverse diameter of the distal radius).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tracheas were intubated with an uncuffed Mallinckrodt ETT with a Murphy's eye. The&#xD;
      tracheal tube place was confirmed by auscultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correct ETT size was considered optimal when an audible air leak around the tube at an&#xD;
      inspiratory airway pressure was detected between 10-30 cmH2O, with the head and neck in a&#xD;
      neutral position. The presence of an air leak was assessed by closing off the pop-off valve&#xD;
      and allowing pressure to rise slowly until an audible leak was heard using a stethoscope. If&#xD;
      there was no audible leak when the lung were inflated to a pressure of 30 cm H2O, the tube&#xD;
      was exchanged with one that was 0.5 mm smaller. But if a leak occurred at an inflation&#xD;
      pressure of less than ten cm H2O, the ETT was exchanged for one with the 0.5 mm larger tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient descriptive data, size of the selected ETT, number and size of the optimum tube,&#xD;
      number of re-intubation due to incorrect size of ETT either smaller or larger were recorded.&#xD;
      Subglottic transverse diameter (mm) and time of intubation were measured. After intubation,&#xD;
      pulse, respiratory rate, arterial blood saturation, capnograghy and airway pressure were&#xD;
      recorded during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any airway complications after extubation as edema, stenosis or stridor were also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data from the three groups will be tabulated and compared with each other using the&#xD;
      appropriate statistical methods according to the type of values whether parametric or&#xD;
      non-parametric. P value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
