      Background Vascular liver disorders (VALDI) are rare diseases, for which knowledge on risk&#xD;
      factors, appropriate methods of diagnosis, effect of therapy and prognosis still need to be&#xD;
      improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study This project aims to study risk factors, methods of detection, therapy and&#xD;
      prognosis in order to elaborate and disseminate updated recommendations for the optimal&#xD;
      management of patients with VALDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study Data on patients will be collected from baseline (the date of diagnosis)&#xD;
      up to 3 years. During this period, data on clinical condition, laboratory results, diagnostic&#xD;
      tests, interventions and outcome will be collected anonymously using standardised review of&#xD;
      medical charts by one special trained investigator. Only patients with VALDI are eligible to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;

      Background Vascular liver disorders (VALDI), including Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS),&#xD;
      non-cirrhotic vascular liver disorders (VLD) and idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension&#xD;
      (INCPH) are rare diseases that mainly affect children and young adults. These diseases are&#xD;
      related to alterations in hepatic macrocirculation (hepatic veins, portal vein) or&#xD;
      microcirculation (small portal veins, sinusoids or both) in the absence of cirrhosis. Even&#xD;
      though various types of VALDI differ in presentation and etiology, they still share in part&#xD;
      underlying causes and mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most studies on VALDI aim at clarifying etiology, natural history and management have been&#xD;
      retrospective and are based on a relatively small number of patients. A European Union FP5&#xD;
      funded project from 2003 to 2005 (EN-Vie) performed several prospective observational&#xD;
      studies, in which 157 patients with BCS and 102 patients with acute VLD were included.&#xD;
      However, chronic VLD and INCPH were not included in the EN-Vie project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prothrombotic disorders are found in 65 to 85% of patients with BCS or VLD, but only 20-40%&#xD;
      of INCPH patients. By contrast, chronic inflammatory conditions are more frequently&#xD;
      encountered in patients with INCPH and VLD than in those with BCS. There is evidence for a&#xD;
      significant genetic influence in patients with INCPH. Still, in over 40% of INCPH patients&#xD;
      the cause remains unknown. The reason for these differences in causes among the various&#xD;
      VALDI, as well as the mechanisms for specific sites of thrombosis according to the underlying&#xD;
      conditions remain obscure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VALDI complications mostly consist in gastrointestinal bleeding, refractory ascites,&#xD;
      bacterial infections, hepatocellular carcinoma, and ultimately liver failure. Such&#xD;
      complications are observed in approximately 60%, 20% and 15% of patients with BCS, VLD and&#xD;
      INCPH, respectively. The incidence of bleeding related to portal hypertension is as high as&#xD;
      20 % patients-year in patients with VLD or INCPH. Recurrent or extensive thrombosis may&#xD;
      jeopardize liver transplantation or lead to high morbidity and mortality complications, e.g.&#xD;
      intestinal infarction. Moreover, complications related to the underlying disorders&#xD;
      superimpose on those directly related to VALDI, and particularly so for acquired blood&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of VALDI has been recently evaluated in large prospective European studies. (a) A&#xD;
      recent update on BCS cohort showed a good outcome with a strategy comprising anticoagulation&#xD;
      therapy and, when needed, angioplasty, stenting, TIPS, or liver transplantation. Similarly,&#xD;
      anticoagulation at the early stage of VLD has been shown to prevent thrombus extension and,&#xD;
      in 40% of the cases, to be accompanied by recanalization. The results of these studies have&#xD;
      had an impact much beyond the field of primary VALDI. Actually it proved instrumental in&#xD;
      developing novel and promising strategies with anticoagulation for the management of&#xD;
      cirrhosis, a chronic parenchymal liver disease much more common than VALDI. (b) By contrast,&#xD;
      for patients with chronic VLD prospective follow-up data are not available. Retrospective&#xD;
      data suggest that anticoagulation is not associated with excessive bleeding. However, in&#xD;
      patients at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to portal hypertension and a mild or&#xD;
      moderate risk of recurrent thrombosis, the benefit-risk ratio of anticoagulation therapy is&#xD;
      particularly unclear. Furthermore, the time point, if any, when anticoagulation shifts from a&#xD;
      beneficial to a detrimental effect, has not been explored. (c) The natural history of INCPH&#xD;
      evaluated in only 3 retrospective surveys indicates that the incidence of extrahepatic VLD is&#xD;
      surprisingly high, whereas advanced liver disease or hepatopulmonary syndrome may occur in up&#xD;
      to 15% of patients. Therefore, anticoagulation therapy, TIPS and liver transplantation have&#xD;
      also been proposed in patients with INCPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Although recent studies have provided a marked impetus to the field of clinical research on&#xD;
      VALDI, crucial information is still lacking, particularly in the areas of etiology, inherited&#xD;
      factors, and treatment. Etiology is still unknown in 40% of the patients; genetic data are&#xD;
      incomplete, therapeutic trials, although badly needed have never been performed, so that&#xD;
      recommendations for treatments (with potentially fatal side effects in these high bleeding&#xD;
      risk population) rely on limited data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims Identification of incident and prevalent cases of VALDI as a basis for the&#xD;
      implementation of future studies, namely interventional randomised control studies,&#xD;
      observational studies, and prognostic studies including the identification of new biomarkers&#xD;
      for these diseases through the analysis of the prospectively recorded data according to&#xD;
      consensual management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will allow to obtain:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence estimates Increased numbers of patients candidates to future studies Homogeneous,&#xD;
      robust and consistent criteria for diagnosis, follow-up and treatment, allowing clearly&#xD;
      defined cohorts of patients to be constituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identify the collections of biological and tissue samples stored in the same conditions, for&#xD;
      future the identification of novel biomarkers. Samples will have to be linked to high quality&#xD;
      clinical, laboratory and imaging data for translational studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Create a basis for continuous collections for a large variety of research purposes including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognostic research Systems biology research including (epi)genetic research Clinical trials&#xD;
      using various design adapted for rare diseases Health care policies and cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      studies&#xD;
