      This study aims to institute a province-wide registry leveraging the availability of a new&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography tracer, [18F]-DCFPyL and PET expertise across Ontario centers to&#xD;
      improve our ability to characterize patterns of recurrence and personalize therapies in men&#xD;
      with recurrent prostate cancer after primary treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This registry study will provide Ontario centres access to a new Positron Emission Tomography&#xD;
      (PET) tracer, [18F]-DCFPyL, to improve our ability to identify areas of prostate cancer&#xD;
      recurrence in men who have undergone surgical removal of their prostate gland (radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy) or radiation of their prostate (external beam radiation, brachytherapy or a&#xD;
      combination of both) and there is a suspicion of recurrence of the cancer. Men with suspected&#xD;
      persistent or recurrent disease can be identified on the basis of a rising Prostate Specific&#xD;
      Antigen (PSA) blood test, or the presence of node positive disease at the time of their&#xD;
      surgery, or a PSA blood test continues to be detectable within 3 months after their surgery.&#xD;
      It is the aim of this study to determine if [18F]-DCFPyL PET/CT can potentially identify&#xD;
      areas of prostate cancer recurrence not seen with usual imaging (bone scan/CT scans) and&#xD;
      impact the management of the disease. A report of the results of the [18F]-DCFPyL PET/CT will&#xD;
      be provided to the participating physicians to determine a treatment plan. As part of the&#xD;
      patient eligibility for [18F]-DCFPyL PET/CT participating physicians will complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire after the [18F]-DCFPyL PET/CT information is provided to report how the results&#xD;
      impact patient management. Actual interventions following completion of the [18F]-DCFPyL&#xD;
      PET/CT will be tracked by linkage to provincial registries. Six centres across Ontario will&#xD;
      participate in the registry study which is expected to take 4 years to complete with an&#xD;
      additional one year of follow-up to capture patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREP Phase 2 was initiated to investigate the hypothesis that conventional imaging is not&#xD;
      adding to the information provided by PSMA PET/CT alone. PREP Phase 2 will retain the same&#xD;
      study design as Phase I but will remove bone scan and computed tomography as criteria for&#xD;
      entry into the study except for those patients with higher PSA (&gt;10 ng/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identical cohort sizes will be accrued in Phase 2 to permit comparison of detection rates&#xD;
      with similar confidence intervals with and without conventional imaging. Transition to PREP&#xD;
      Phase 2 occurred when overall accrual to PREP exceeded 80% of target.&#xD;
