    <textblock>
      Background:It has been reported in previous studies that more motor units are fired with&#xD;
      electrical stimulation than voluntary muscle contraction, and even high intensity currents&#xD;
      provide 10-30% more contractions than voluntary muscle contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:This study was planned to compare the effectiveness of high voltage pulsed galvanic&#xD;
      (HVPG) stimulation, Russian current and isometric exercise on quadriceps femoris (QF)&#xD;
      isometric muscle strength in healthy young women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:Forty-six healthy young women were included in the study (mean age=21.02 ± 1.27).&#xD;
      Before and after the training, the dominant side QF isometric muscle strength of participants&#xD;
      was assessed with the Isokinetic Dynamometer . The peak torque and average torques of the&#xD;
      participants were recorded after the test. The training was planned as HVPG current for the&#xD;
      the first group (n = 16), as Russian current for the second group (n = 15) and as isometric&#xD;
      strengthening for the third group (n = 15). All treatments were performed under&#xD;
      physiotherapist supervision for a total of 15 sessions for 3 days a week for 5 weeks.&#xD;

      Muscle strength, Isokinetic strength measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dominant side QF isometric muscle strength (torque measurements) of the participants was&#xD;
      assessed with the Isokinetic Dynamometer . Before the test, participants were subjected to a&#xD;
      standard warm-up of 5 minutes and evaluations were carried out using a standard seat. The&#xD;
      back of the seat was angled 105 ° backward to provide 75 ° flexion at the body. The knee was&#xD;
      positioned at an angle of 60 ° and was fixed with bands around the body, waist, hip and&#xD;
      ankle. Participants had no previous experience with isokinetic dynamometer testing,&#xD;
      therefore; it was started with a trial whose protocols were same with QF isometric muscle&#xD;
      strength measurement protocols. Then participants QF isometric muscle strength was measured&#xD;
      by three 10-second maximal isometric contraction. Rest periods of 3 seconds between each&#xD;
      contraction were given. Each participant held the sides of the seat with both hands during&#xD;
      the test. Verbal encouragement was made throughout the whole test to obtain maximum strength&#xD;
      from the participants. The peak torque and average torques of the participants were recorded&#xD;
      after the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High Voltage Pulsed Galvanic Current:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The instrument was automatically set to a pulse rate of 100 μs while the pulse frequency was&#xD;
      set to 60 pulses / sec. In order to avoid fatigue, the intermittant form of the current was&#xD;
      selected and the transition time / rest time was set to 4 sec. impulse / 12 sec. The total&#xD;
      output voltage of the device ranged from 0 to 500 volts and the current intensity was&#xD;
      increased until the sensible contraction of the applied muscle was achieved without causing&#xD;
      too much sense of discomfort. Stimulation was performed after the body and knee were&#xD;
      positioned and stabilized at 75 ° flexion and 60 ° flexion angle, respectively. One of the 6&#xD;
      * 8 cm carbonated electrodes was placed in the distal portion of the vastus medialis, while&#xD;
      the other one was placed in the proximal portion of the vastus lateralis. This placement was&#xD;
      intended to stimulate a large proportion of the muscle fibers of the QF muscle.The HVPG was&#xD;
      applied for a total of 20 minutes. Current intensity was increased to obtain optimal muscle&#xD;
      contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Russian Current In the treatment with the Russian current, a protocol developed by Kots, also&#xD;
      known in the literature as &quot;Russian Technique&quot;, was used. In the treatment with the Russian&#xD;
      movement, a protocol developed by Kots, also known as &quot;Russian Technique&quot;, was used in the&#xD;
      literature. There were 10 muscle contractions per treatment session in this protocol. Each&#xD;
      contraction lasted for 10 seconds and a resting time of 50 seconds were given for the next&#xD;
      contraction (transition: rest ratio was 1/5).The position of the participants in the&#xD;
      application and the placement of the electrodes were same as the the other application.&#xD;
      Current intensity was increased until tetanic muscle contraction was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isometric Exercise:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body and knee of the participants in the isometric exercise group were positioned and&#xD;
      stabilized at 75 ° flexion and 60 ° flexion angle, respectively as in the stimulation groups.&#xD;
      Participants were asked to do 10 repetitions as 10 seconds of maximum voluntary contractions&#xD;
      and 10 seconds of rest.&#xD;
