  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PROPhecy study aims to detect the presence of atrial fibrillation/flutter in patients who&#xD;
      have suffered an embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) using 30 day cardiac&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the presence of any of the following features on long-term heart rhythm&#xD;
      monitoring (holter monitoring) or heart ultrasound (transthoracic echocardiogram), either&#xD;
      individually or in combination, will have additional predictive value for the detection of&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation lasting 30 seconds or longer on 30 day holter monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  greater than 100 premature atrial beats in 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  greater than 2 runs of atrial tachycardia (4 or more non-sinus beats) in 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Left atrial enlargement on transthoracic echocardiogram&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PROPhecy study uses prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring to detect atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation/flutter in patients who have had an embolic stroke within six months, where no&#xD;
      cause of stroke was found. Following informed consent, an external cardiac rhythm monitor&#xD;
      will be attached to each participant. Participants will be instructed to wear the device as&#xD;
      much as possible over the 30 day study period. If atrial fibrillation/flutter is detected&#xD;
      before 30 days, participants may stop wearing the monitor and will be contacted to discuss&#xD;
      changing their antithrombotic strategy for stroke secondary prevention as per standard of&#xD;
      care. Recorded cardiac rhythm data will be transmitted for central interpretation and results&#xD;
      will be sent to the PI, with copies provided for the patient's stroke neurologist and primary&#xD;
      care practitioner for clinical continuity of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by telephone once per week for the duration of the 30 day&#xD;
      study period. Following device return patients will be followed for two years and will&#xD;
      receive telephone follow-ups at 90 days, 1 year, and 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the PROPhecy study is to prospectively validate those features on holter monitor&#xD;
      and echocardiography identified as predictive of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients&#xD;
      with embolic strokes of undetermined source (ESUS). Our overall goal is to determine whether&#xD;
      all patients with ESUS should be referred for extended rhythm monitoring, or whether these&#xD;
      criteria can be used to refer patients more selectively for this more resource-intensive&#xD;
      diagnostic procedure.&#xD;

    <description>Our primary outcome is new detection of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter lasting 30 seconds or longer after 30 days of cardiac monitoring. Holter and echocardiography reports will be examined for features identified as being significantly associated with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation/flutter on univariate analysis in the EMBRACE trial: ((1) &gt;100 premature atrial beats in 24 hours, (2) two or more runs of 4 atrial beats or more in 24 hours, or (3) left atrial volume index &gt;26 mL/m2 on transthoracic echocardiography) will be compared against controls with &quot;benign&quot; holters and echocardiograms (ie. Those with &lt;100 premature atrial beats in 24h, 1 or fewer runs of atrial tachycardia, and lacking left atrial enlargement).</description>

    <measure>Predictive value of &quot;high-risk&quot; holter and echocardiogram features and presence of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical, holter and echocardiography correlates will be compared for those with and without atrial fibrillation/flutter on extended cardiac monitoring. Correlation between the &quot;high-risk&quot; features on holter monitoring and echocardiography identified in the EMBRACE trials (see Primary Outcome Measure description) and our prospective 30-day cardiac monitoring will be completed to assess predictive value of these features detected on cardiac diagnostic testing.</description>

        The study population will include patients age 55 years and older who have had an embolic&#xD;
        stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). Participants will be recruited from the stroke ward&#xD;
        at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) and the Stroke Prevention Clinic at VGH.&#xD;
