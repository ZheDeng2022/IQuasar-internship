  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive surgeons have a prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal complaints of&#xD;
      up to 86% due to the exposure to static loading, awkward postures, work pressure, and&#xD;
      patient's wellbeing. Researchers have developed postural interventions to counteract the&#xD;
      prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints and disorders, such as robot-assisted surgeries,&#xD;
      arm-support systems, and rotatable handle pieces. An alternative intervention is to implement&#xD;
      work breaks during the surgeries, which has shown to give promising results including that&#xD;
      surgery duration does not prolong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to simulate 90-min laparoscopic surgery activities in the&#xD;
      laboratory and compare two intervention situations with the control situation. The control&#xD;
      situation is without work breaks. The two intervention situations include 2.5-min breaks&#xD;
      provided two times, i.e. after every 30-min work period, which are passive (rest) or active&#xD;
      (targeted mobilization exercises). The assessment is based on changes in muscular activity on&#xD;
      the back and upper extremities, back and upper extremity postures, feelings of discomfort,&#xD;
      and work performance.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Average heart activity over time period baseline (0 min) to end (90 min) of each experimental condition</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous recording electrocardiography allows calculating the heart rate, a parameter reflecting the central stress state of the participant. The average heart rate will be calculated per time period.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline (0 min) to directly after (90 min) each experimental condition</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Peg-Transfer Board (Simulab, Seattle, WA, USA), subjects will perform this task for exaclty 1 minute. Time is recorded after one repetition is finished and final performance for the overall minute is recorded as well.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed at 90 min, directly after each experimental condition</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Hart and Staveland's NASA Task Load Index (TLX) method, workload is assessed for 6 dimensions where participants put a cross on one of the 21 lines on the 21-point scales, which range from left (very satisfied; way too much; much to short; clearly increased) to right (very unsatisfied; way too few; much to long; clearly reduced).</description>
