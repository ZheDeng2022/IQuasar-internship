  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder (BD) is a frequent and lifelong recurrent mood disorder with&#xD;
      treatment-resistant depressive episodes. Importantly, depressive symptoms and cognitive&#xD;
      decline are major determinants of functionality and quality of life in this clinical&#xD;
      population. There is robust evidence that individuals with BD have neurocognitive deficits&#xD;
      (especially in memory and executive functioning domains) compared to the healthy population.&#xD;
      These deficits are present in all mood states and can greatly affect patients' functional&#xD;
      capacity, often more so than mood symptoms themselves. Many pharmacological treatments for BD&#xD;
      adversely affect cognition, and those that are beneficial can be difficult to use. There is&#xD;
      thus a pressing need to identify a safe, easy-to-use medication that can target both&#xD;
      cognitive deficits and depressive symptoms in BD. It is expected that Brexpiprazole&#xD;
      adjunctive treatment will be efficacious in treating BD type I depression by improving mood&#xD;
      symptoms, as well as cognitive capacity and global functioning, and that such changes will be&#xD;
      accompanied by concurrent alterations in associated brain structures.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The estimated lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorders is 0.55% for bipolar type I and 1.65%&#xD;
      for bipolar type II. In the long term, patients with a bipolar disorder spend on average 60%&#xD;
      of their time in depressive states, with intermittent hypomanic or manic phases. Moreover,&#xD;
      the depressive episodes tend to become more frequent and difficult to treat as they grow in&#xD;
      number and/or frequency. Many studies have demonstrated that even so-called stabilized&#xD;
      bipolar patients will go through frequent subsyndromal depressive symptoms during a&#xD;
      significant portion of any given year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bipolar depression is heavily loaded with general symptoms of psychomotor retardation,&#xD;
      anergia, hypersomnolence, hyperphagia, decreased motivation, anhedonia and cognitive&#xD;
      difficulties. All these functions are modulated by dopamine, and strategies aimed at&#xD;
      improving dopaminergic function are frequently used to resolve residual symptoms of bipolar&#xD;
      depression. Brexpiprazole is a new serotonin-dopamine antagonist which possesses unique&#xD;
      capabilities with partial dopaminergic (D2) agonistic activities. Moreover, like other&#xD;
      atypical agents, Brexpiprazole is a potent antagonist of the 5-HT2a receptor, as well as the&#xD;
      adrenergic α1b and α2c receptors, and is a 5-HT1a post-synaptic agonist. These properties&#xD;
      enable the molecule to provide antidepressant potentiating capabilities. While Brexpiprazole&#xD;
      is currently recognized for its capacity to potentiate antidepressant effects in unipolar&#xD;
      depression, there is still a need to evaluate the molecule's effect in bipolar depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depressive symptoms and cognitive deficits are major determinants of functionality and&#xD;
      quality of life in individuals with bipolar disorders. Cognitive problems tend to increase&#xD;
      with the number of mood episodes, psychotic symptoms, and anxiety. Further, certain&#xD;
      medications (and especially polypharmacy) can increase cognitive decline in the long term. As&#xD;
      the average age of the patient population increases, risk for cognitive decline due to aging&#xD;
      and prolonged medication use is of importance. From a neuroanatomical perspective, current&#xD;
      neuroscience literature has related treatment with Aripiprazole to improved memory&#xD;
      performance and structural changes in the hippocampus in patients at an early stage of&#xD;
      psychosis. The chemically and pharmacologically related compound Brexpiprazole is thus a&#xD;
      promising candidate for targeting both depressive symptoms and cognitive deficits observed in&#xD;
      bipolar depression given its partial agonistic activity at the D2 receptor and, possibly,&#xD;
      because of its 5-HT7 antagonistic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of bipolar depression is further complicated by the knowledge that, in the&#xD;
      long-term, use of antidepressants may be associated with manic/hypomanic switches, rapid&#xD;
      cycling, and mixed features. These further increase the risk of cognitive decline and&#xD;
      suicidality. In fact, the suicide rate in bipolar disorders is relatively high compared with&#xD;
      other disorders, with certain studies reporting that up to 50% of bipolar patients will&#xD;
      attempt suicide. Further, mortality is considerably higher among patients with bipolar&#xD;
      disorders as compared to the general population given patients' high risk for diabetes and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disorders (considerably increased by valproate and antipsychotic treatment).&#xD;
      In the prevention of excess mortality, selection of first-line medications with a smaller&#xD;
      effect on weight is essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, an interesting new phenotype for the personalized treatment of bipolar disorders is&#xD;
      dysregulated biological rhythms (i.e., sleeping and eating patterns). This is a core&#xD;
      etiopathological feature of bipolar disorders, and has been associated with obesity, cancer,&#xD;
      and accelerated mortality in the general population. It has been previously shown that a&#xD;
      majority of patients with bipolar disorders show a specific pattern of disorganized activity&#xD;
      rhythm that is associated with treatment resistance, mood lability and obesity. It was&#xD;
      recently reported that Aripiprazole can correct this type of disorganized rhythm. Based on an&#xD;
      animal model, this effect is linked to dopaminergic activity. It is expected that&#xD;
      Brexpiprazole will have a similar effect. This is supported by a recent sleep study of&#xD;
      Brexpiprazole in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder that found an improvement of&#xD;
      most sleep parameters in addition to decreasing daytime sleepiness and improving mood&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, insulin resistance is shown to be one of the most robust predictors of a more&#xD;
      chronic course of bipolar disorder. C-reactive protein (CRP) was shown to be two times&#xD;
      greater in patients with insulin resistance compared to those without. Higher CRP is thus&#xD;
      considered to be a predictor of treatment-resistance and cardiovascular risk in this clinical&#xD;
      population. Most importantly, treatment response has been associated with decreasing CRP,&#xD;
      decreasing insulin resistance, and decreasing depressive symptoms. As such,&#xD;
      treatment-resistant bipolar depression can be viewed as a metabolic mood syndrome that is&#xD;
      associated with a cognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, there is a need to improve the repertoire of treatments for bipolar&#xD;
      depression. One would favor strategies that procure a rapid onset of action as well as a low&#xD;
      risk of switching to hypomania and weight gain. Finally, one would favor strategies that&#xD;
      would procure relief for the most frequent and persistent symptoms of bipolar depression,&#xD;
      such as psychomotor retardation, cognitive deficits, and reversed neurovegetative symptoms.&#xD;
      Thus, the current study will evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of an adjunctive,&#xD;
      variable dose of Brexpiprazole treatment in bipolar depression.&#xD;
