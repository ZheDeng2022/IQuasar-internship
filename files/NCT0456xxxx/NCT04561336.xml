  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-profit phase II, open-label, single-arm study of cetuximab plus avelumab in&#xD;
      patients with RAS WT mCRC treated in first line with chemotherapy in combination with an&#xD;
      anti- EGFR drug that have had a clinical benefit (complete or partial response) from&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy (OS) of avelumab and cetuximab&#xD;
      combined in pre-treated RAS wild type metastatic colorectal cancer patients. Tumor&#xD;
      measurements by computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be&#xD;
      performed every 8 weeks from the beginning of treatment to determine response to treatment.&#xD;
      Response will be evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1&#xD;
      (RECIST 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will continue until disease progression, significant clinical deterioration,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, any criterion for withdrawal from the trial or trial drug is&#xD;
      fulfilled. Treatment may continue past the initial determination of disease progression per&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 if the subject's performance status has remained stable, and if in the opinion of&#xD;
      the Investigator, the subject will benefit from continued treatment and if other criteria are&#xD;
      fulfilled as outlined in the protocol.&#xD;
