  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study evaluates the effect of carbon fiber brace design on forces across the&#xD;
      ankle joint. Research suggests that ankle arthritis develops after ankle fracture, in part,&#xD;
      due to elevated forces on the cartilage. It is expected that carbon fiber braces can be&#xD;
      designed to reduce forces in the ankle joint and thereby reduce the risk of developing&#xD;
      arthritis following traumatic injury. In this study, brace geometry will be varied to&#xD;
      determine how these changes influence the forces experienced by ankle cartilage. The proposed&#xD;
      study will provide evidence that can be used by clinicians and researchers to design braces&#xD;
      that most effectively reduce forces on ankle cartilage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this line of research is to investigate the effects of carbon fiber&#xD;
      custom dynamic orthosis (CDO) design on the forces and contact stress at the ankle, with the&#xD;
      goal of reducing the development of post traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) in the ankle.&#xD;
      Research suggests that ankle arthritis develops, in part, due to increased contact stresses&#xD;
      within the ankle joint following fracture. It is expected that reducing articular contact&#xD;
      stress at the ankle has the potential to delay or prevent the development of PTOA. CDOs have&#xD;
      been shown to significantly improve function following extremity injury, and show promise for&#xD;
      offloading the injured limb after severe lower extremity injuries. Therefore, the proposed&#xD;
      effort is designed to evaluate how different CDO design factors influence offloading and&#xD;
      therefore the reduction of forces and articular contact stress at the ankle following&#xD;
      traumatic lower limb injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult participants who have sustained a traumatic ankle fracture of the tibial pilon will be&#xD;
      evaluated while wearing carbon fiber braces of varied geometry. The primary dependent measure&#xD;
      is ankle joint contact stress. Following consent and enrollment computerized tomography (CT)&#xD;
      images will be used to determine the geometry of the joint articular surfaces. Ankle contact&#xD;
      stress will be calculated using discrete element analysis and biomechanical data collected in&#xD;
      subsequent data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be cast and fit for three CDOs with varied geometry. Participants will be&#xD;
      blinded to the design variation of each device and will only know them as CDO-A, CDO-B, or&#xD;
      CDO-C. Testing will be completed under 4 conditions: No-CDO, CDO-A, CDO-B, CDO-C, with each&#xD;
      bracing condition (A/B/C) representing a CDO design variant. Physical performance measures&#xD;
      will incorporate tests of agility, speed, and lower limb power to ensure that changes to&#xD;
      device design do not negatively affect physical function. Questionnaires will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate participants' current and desired activity level, pain with and without CDO use,&#xD;
      satisfaction with the devices, perception of comfort and smoothness between devices, and&#xD;
      preference between CDOs. Semi-structured interviews will be completed to fully capture the&#xD;
      participant's perspective. Lower limb forces and motion will be assessed using a computerized&#xD;
      motion capture system and force plates in the floor. Forces between the foot and CDO will be&#xD;
      measured using force sensing insoles, and muscle activity data will be collected using&#xD;
      surface electromyography. Devices will be mechanically tested, and participant demographic&#xD;
      and anthropometric data will be recorded.&#xD;

Each CDO will differ from the others in design and will be labeled as CDO-A, CDO-B and CDO-C. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of six CDO testing sequences (ABC, ACB, BCA, BAC, CAB, CBA) to prevent testing order from influencing study results.
