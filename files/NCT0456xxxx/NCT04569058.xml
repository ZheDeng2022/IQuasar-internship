    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by variable&#xD;
      presentation of difficulties with socialization, reciprocal communication, and&#xD;
      restrictive/repetitive behaviors. An increasingly higher prevalence of ASD is documented in&#xD;
      each successive epidemiological survey and the disorder is now estimated to affect up to 2%&#xD;
      of youth in the general population. This rise in prevalence is in part attributed to improved&#xD;
      recognition of autism in intellectually capable populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There exists no established pharmacological treatment for the core features of ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current practice consists of well-established evidence-based pharmacotherapies that are&#xD;
      available for the management of comorbid psychiatric disorders, in order to improve quality&#xD;
      of life and reduce symptom severity in ASD. Clinical trials of available treatment options&#xD;
      reveal that compared to general population, individuals with ASD may be more susceptible to&#xD;
      adverse effects of medications which could be dose-related, and may have lower adherence to&#xD;
      treatment. New treatments for core deficits in ASD are needed; an intervention requiring no&#xD;
      medication may offer better compliance and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common psychiatric disorder&#xD;
      recognized in youth and adults with ASD, and greatly adds to their morbidity and dysfunction,&#xD;
      particularly in those with intact intellectual capacity. The prevalence of ADHD in the&#xD;
      general population of school-age children is approximately 3% to 5%, although some reports&#xD;
      show even higher incidence. Nearly two-thirds of referred populations of youth (ranging from&#xD;
      59-83%) and adults (ranging from 37-68%) with ASD suffer from ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both ADHD and ASD have strong shared heritable components according to the evidence from twin&#xD;
      and family studies. Up to 15% of youth with ADHD suffer from ASD and experience greater&#xD;
      morbidity and dysfunction. This confounding effect of ASD seems to be symptom dependent and&#xD;
      not contingent upon reaching full diagnostic threshold. In fact, up to a third of ADHD youth&#xD;
      without ASD diagnosis still struggle with persistent symptoms of ASD (henceforth termed&#xD;
      autistic traits [ATs]) and associated compromised outcomes. Presence of ATs is associated&#xD;
      with a more complicated course of ADHD, characterized as increased comorbid psychopathology,&#xD;
      more impaired interpersonal, school, family, and cognitive functioning. Anti-ADHD medications&#xD;
      effectively mitigate core symptoms of ADHD, but offer no improvement in the ATs. Youth with&#xD;
      ADHD continue to suffer from the impairments associated with ATs that prognosticate a&#xD;
      compromised course in multiple domains of functioning despite effective treatment of ADHD.&#xD;
      Treating comorbid ATs in patients with ADHD could prevent functional deterioration, and&#xD;
      improve long term outcomes. As yet, there exists no known treatment for the core features of&#xD;
      ASD or ATs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel treatment approach for social and cognitive deficits is based on transcranial&#xD;
      application of Light Emitting Diode (LED), an invisible, non-ionizing electromagnetic wave.&#xD;
      Referred to as Transcranial Photobiomodulation, tPBM consists of exposing bilaterally the&#xD;
      frontal brain to a non-ionizing electromagnetic wave. The transcranial photobiomodulation&#xD;
      (tPBM) is invisible, penetrates the skin and skull into brain tissue, is non-invasive, and&#xD;
      minimally dissipated as thermal energy. The benefits of tPBM are wavelength specific. A&#xD;
      mitochondrial enzyme, the cytochrome c oxidase, is the primary chromophore for the tPBM at&#xD;
      wavelengths of 830-850 nanometers. What follows is, increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#xD;
      production, through the respiratory chain. Ultimately, the increased ATP leads to increased&#xD;
      energy metabolism for the cell, and it is hypothesized that a signaling cascade is also&#xD;
      activated promoting cellular plasticity and cytoprotection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unique properties of the tPBM have led to novel therapeutic applications in neurology, for&#xD;
      treatment following acute ischemic stroke subjects, and in dermatology for treatment of&#xD;
      alopecia. In psychiatric care, tPBM has been shown to be safe, effective and well tolerated&#xD;
      compared the sham treatment in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These properties of the tPBM have led to novel therapeutic applications in neurology. In&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke subjects, acute treatment with the tPBM led to significantly better&#xD;
      outcome as compared to sham. These results were confirmed in a different cohort of stroke&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderate severity of illness. Both studies on stroke subjects showed no&#xD;
      significant difference in rate of adverse events, as well as serious adverse events, between&#xD;
      the tPBM and sham treated subjects. The tPBM has also been used as a treatment of alopecia&#xD;
      and in animal models for methanol-induced retinal toxicity. The tPBM is already widely used&#xD;
      for non-invasive assessment of brain function (replacing functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging in studies of infants and young adults, under the name of Near Infrared Spectroscopy)&#xD;
      underscoring the relatively low risk of tPBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed treatment with tPBM has been previously studied in patients with Major Depressive&#xD;
      Disorder (MDD). MDD has been associated with deficits in brain bioenergetic metabolism. In an&#xD;
      experimental model of depression, the mitochondrial respiratory chain (the cellular site for&#xD;
      energy production) was found to be inhibited by chronic stress. Depressed subjects have also&#xD;
      significantly lower production of ATP (an energy vector) in their muscle tissue and greater&#xD;
      incidence of deletions in their mitochondrial DNA. Data from magnetic resonance spectroscopy&#xD;
      in subjects with MDD showed that response to the augmentation of a selective serotonin&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with triiodothyronine (a thyroid hormone) is associated with&#xD;
      restoration of the levels of ATP in the brain. A preliminary open study in 10 depressed&#xD;
      subjects has shown that the tPBM was safe, effective and well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, a proof of concept study was conducted with tPBM, in an open label,&#xD;
      prospective design with 10 patients with a diagnosis of ASD between ages 18 and 55. Five&#xD;
      patients met the rigorous responder criteria, and a statistically significant improvement was&#xD;
      observed in all clinician and patient rated measures at midpoint and endpoint. Efficacy&#xD;
      measures revealed that tPBM substantially improved ATs in 7 patients (70%), and was well&#xD;
      tolerated with no treatment-limiting side-effects or serious adverse events. Adherence rate&#xD;
      among participants was 98%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings suggest that tPBM may be a promising treatment for core social deficits&#xD;
      associated with ASD and is a safe, feasible treatment approach. The major risk of tPBM when&#xD;
      using a laser as the light source is associated with accidental retinal exposure, when beams&#xD;
      are projected through the lens, with increased risk of macular degeneration. LED light does&#xD;
      not share the same risk level as laser light sources. Based on these promising results, this&#xD;
      novel treatment approach is safe, well-tolerated and associated with statistically and&#xD;
      clinically significant improvements in symptoms of ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers hypothesize that tPBM will be safe and effective in the treatment of ATs in&#xD;
      youth with ADHD, and will improve social functioning, which stimulants do not address.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aforementioned proof-of-concept study was blessed with a fast pace of recruitment, with 10&#xD;
      participants over a period of 18 months, despite its demanding nature for our patients. Even&#xD;
      faster and more efficient recruitment along with a less demanding schedule for our patients&#xD;
      is possible. Telemedicine substitutes for face-to-face office visits through a remote,&#xD;
      two-way video-conference through secure Internet access. Telemedicine use in the clinical&#xD;
      setting has successfully provided specialist advice with favorable patient outcomes,&#xD;
      satisfaction, and costs. Clinical trials are the gold standard for evaluating new therapeutic&#xD;
      opportunities in medicine, efforts aimed at improving their efficiency are needed to&#xD;
      facilitate patient participation in a manner that reduces dropout, and Telemedicine may offer&#xD;
      such opportunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers propose an open label trial to assess the safety and efficacy of tPBM in&#xD;
      improving ATs in ADHD youth with comorbid ATs. Eligible participants will be youth with&#xD;
      adequately treated ADHD who present with comorbid ATs of at least moderate severity.&#xD;
      Participants will receive tPBM daily for 8 weeks. Participants who meet eligibility criteria&#xD;
      will be mailed the tPBM device. They will be able to administer the treatment in the comfort&#xD;
      of home, at scheduled intervals. Accurate application of tPBM, its safety, and efficacy will&#xD;
      be assessed during regular scheduled meetings with study clinician. These meetings will all&#xD;
      be conducted via telemedicine with HIPAA compliant communication technology. Safety of and&#xD;
      treatment response to tPBM will be monitored by parent- and clinician-rated measures during&#xD;
      regularly scheduled visits. The study will address the question whether tPBM is effective for&#xD;
      the treatment of ATs in youth with ADHD, and whether it is acceptable among our patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain aspects of tPBM render it a feasible intervention. It can be delivered at home. It&#xD;
      does not require ingestion of any substances. It is possible that the exposure to tPBM might&#xD;
      be more acceptable than use of medications among some minority groups. This intervention does&#xD;
      not require providers with specific cultural expertise or second language proficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tPBM treatment can be completed in the comfort of participants' homes, while monitoring&#xD;
      their safety and response during scheduled medicine visits. The advantage of the tPBM&#xD;
      treatment approach compared to pharmacotherapy is that adherence can be easily monitored.&#xD;
      This study will answer whether tPBM has an effect on ASD symptoms in ADHD and whether it is&#xD;
      acceptable among our patients, for whom frequent visits otherwise would be prohibitive or&#xD;
      render it inaccessible. As such, the researchers propose the inclusion of a telemedicine&#xD;
      visits in this study protocol.&#xD;
