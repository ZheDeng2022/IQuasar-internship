      Evaluation of the role of Ultrasound Elastography in differentiation between benign and&#xD;

      Doppler ultrasound.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymph nodes are part of the body immune system which are located throughout the body&#xD;
      including head and neck, armpit, and groin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphadenopathy is defined as an abnormality in the size or character of lymph nodes caused&#xD;
      by the invasion or propagation of either inflammatory or neoplastic cells into the nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differentiation of malignant from benign lymph nodes is essential because it predicts the&#xD;
      patient prognosis and help in the decision making regarding the management plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On ultrasound, gray scale sonography helps to evaluate nodal morphology, whilst color doppler&#xD;
      is used to assess vascular pattern. The qualitative criteria for malignancy were heterogenous&#xD;
      hypoechoic cortex, irregular margins, lack of hyperechoic fatty hilum and abnormal blood&#xD;
      vessels penetrating the lymph nodes capsule.The avascular or hilar patterns were defined as&#xD;
      LNs with normal vascularity pattern, and the peripheral or mixed (peripheral and hilar)&#xD;
      pattern as LNs with abnormal vascularity pattern. On B-mode and color doppler ultrasound,&#xD;
      there is no specific criteria for differentiating metastatic lymph nodes from reactive lymph&#xD;
      nodes with 100% accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is the reference standard for differentiating metastatic lymph&#xD;
      nodes from reactive lymph nodes. However, restrictions of fine-needle aspiration biopsy are&#xD;
      that it is an invasive procedure, and it is not possible to perform for lymph nodes smaller&#xD;
      than 5 mm.Therefore, a simple, reliable, and non-invasive imaging modality for&#xD;
      differentiating malignant lymph nodes is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound elastography (UE) is a rather new, non-invasive imaging technique that can be used&#xD;
      to depict tissue stiffness and elastic properties. Ultrasound elastography (UE) can be&#xD;
      divided broadly into 2 groups depending on the type of tissue displacement:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Strain elastography (SE): measures tissue displacements along the axis of an applied&#xD;
           force.Strain elastography provides semi - quantitative scores based on elastographic&#xD;
           pattern (scores based on percentage of stiff area within the lesion) and strain ratio&#xD;
           (ratio between the lesion and the background tissue).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Shear wave elastography (SWE): measures a different type of waves that is also produced&#xD;
           when tissues are mechanically stimulated. Shear wave elastography is also a quantitative&#xD;
           method of analysis for elasticity images using shear wave speed (m/s) or elastic modulus&#xD;
           (kPa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound elastography (UE) is easy, rather cheap, non-invasive, and quick to perform, well&#xD;
      tolerated by patients, and offers a strong diagnostic power.&#xD;
