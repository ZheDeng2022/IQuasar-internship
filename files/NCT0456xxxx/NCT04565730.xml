    <textblock>
      Childbirth is one of the most painful experiences for a woman. Labor and period of pregnancy&#xD;
      is associated with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders for a woman. The demands of&#xD;
      pregnancy and childbirth make patients vulnerable to psychiatric disorders such as postpartum&#xD;
      depression (PPD), anxiety, and stress disorders. Women with postpartum psychiatric disorders&#xD;
      have high mortality rates. The most common postpartum psychiatric disorder is PPD. PPD occurs&#xD;
      any time in pregnancy or in the first four weeks after delivery. It may lead to complications&#xD;
      such as emotional lability in the mother. This situation may also effect the child.&#xD;

      Childbirth is one of the most painful experiences for a woman. Labor and period of pregnancy&#xD;
      is associated with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders for a woman. The demands of&#xD;
      pregnancy and childbirth make patients vulnerable to psychiatric disorders such as postpartum&#xD;
      depression (PPD), anxiety, and stress disorders. Women with postpartum psychiatric disorders&#xD;
      have high mortality rates. The most common postpartum psychiatric disorder is PPD. PPD occurs&#xD;
      any time in pregnancy or in the first four weeks after delivery. It may lead to complications&#xD;
      such as emotional lability in the mother. This situation may also effect the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postpartum depression (PD) has become the most frequent complication of childbirth. Its&#xD;
      prevalence has been estimated as 10%-15% and its formation is affected by several factors&#xD;
      such as lack of social support, previous history of depression, and personal vulnerability.&#xD;
      There are several studies about PD in the literature, some discuss about the relation of pain&#xD;
      and PD, some discuss about the relation of epidural anesthesia and PD. However, there is no&#xD;
      study that compares different anesthesia methods (general anesthesia vs spinal anesthesia) on&#xD;
      development of postnatal depression after cesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the different anesthesia methods (general anesthesia vs&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia) on development of postnatal depression after cesarean delivery. The&#xD;
      secondary aim is to decrease the ratio of postnatal depression after cesarean delivery.&#xD;

    <description>After applying standard ASA monitoring; 2-2,5 mg/kg propofol, and 0,6 mg/kg rocuronium IV will be performed for general anesthesia induction, and then orotracheal intubation will be performed. The patients will be placed in the supine position. General anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane in the mixture of oxygen-fresh air. Controlled mechanical ventilation will be initiated with a tidal volume of 8-10 ml/kg at 12 breaths per minute (I:E ratio 1:2), a fresh gas flow rate of 2 L per min, end tidal CO2 value at 30-35 mmHg, and peak airway pressure of maximally 30 cm H2O. All patients will undergo cesarean delivery surgery with the same technique by the same surgical team.</description>

    <description>A standardized spinal anesthesia will administrated to the patients. After skin disinfection, 25G needle will used for puncture at the level of L2-L3 or L3-L4. After observing the cerebrospinal fluid, 15 mg bupivacaine (marcain spinal heavy) will be administered into the subarachnoid space. The level of anesthesia below T6 will be controlled.</description>

    <description>Preoperative and postoperative evaluation Pre-operative data will be collected 1 to 2 hrs before operation. Preoperative anxiety level will be assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale.&#xD;
Patients will be asked to complete the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) on the morning of discharge, 1 months and 3 months days after delivery. An online survey will be conducted post-Cesarean delivery to investigate the primary outcome of PND using EPDS, and those will not complete the online survey received phone calls to conduct the follow-up surveys.</description>
