  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of autologous DC&#xD;
      vaccine in patients with later stage of gastric cancer. The DC vaccine is gene modified with&#xD;
      gastric cancer specific antigen MG-7.&#xD;

      All eligible patients will receive two cycles of treatment, every 21 days is a treatment&#xD;
      cycle. The follow-up time will start from the next day after the end of the second cycle of&#xD;
      treatment, and last for 48 ±1 weeks (the follow-up time is 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36&#xD;
      weeks, 48 weeks). During the treatment and follow-up period, if disease progression or&#xD;
      intolerable side effects develop, the patient can voluntarily request to be withdrawn from&#xD;
      the study, or the investigators can determine that the patient be removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DC and CTL are immune cells. PD-1 monoclonal antibody is an immune checkpoint inhibitor.&#xD;
      According to the relevant experience of similar cells or drugs, some patients may have&#xD;
      delayed or early pseudo-tumor progression after receiving immunotherapy, which needs to be&#xD;
      judged by investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the screening period is no more than 14 days. After the screening examination&#xD;
      and evaluation, the eligible patients will enter the treatment period. The treatment and&#xD;
      follow-up are carried out according to the procedure. The follow-up period: tumor imaging&#xD;
      evaluation and related clinical indicator evaluation are carried out at the 4th week (± 1&#xD;
      week), the 12th week (± 1 week), the 24th week (± 1 week), the 36th week (± 1 week) and the&#xD;
      48th week (± 1 week) after the treatment. The patients should also complete the corresponding&#xD;
      safety inspection and evaluation before leaving the group. During the follow-up period, the&#xD;
      patients who do not have disease progression but do leave the group should continue to be&#xD;
      evaluated according to the original frequency until the end of the follow-up period or the&#xD;
      start of other anti-tumor treatment.&#xD;
