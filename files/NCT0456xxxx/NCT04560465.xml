  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double blinded randomized controlled trial in which cases were given 1000mg intravenous&#xD;
      tranexamic acid into 1L of intravenous normal saline and control were given 10mls of placebo&#xD;
      water for injection into same amount of intravenous fluid. outcome of both groups in terms of&#xD;
      intraoperative blood loss, duration of surgery, postoperative packed cell volume and total&#xD;
      blood loss with risk of blood transfusion were then determined.&#xD;
