      Introduction The posterior Quadratus Lumborum Block (pQLB) has been used in postoperative&#xD;
      pain management after Cesarean Section (CS). However, there are no data about pQLB safety in&#xD;
      pregnants, at increased risk of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). The purpose of the&#xD;
      present study was to explore the efficacy and the safety of adding epinephrine to ropivacaine&#xD;
      for bilateral pQLB vs. bilateral pQLB performed with ropivacaine alone in CS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Fifty-two pregnants were consecutively allocated to one of 2 groups [e-pQLB (0.375%&#xD;
      ropivacaine+100 mcg epinephrine) or pQLB (0.375% ropivacaine)] and the investigators&#xD;
      evaluated if the adjunct of epinephrine to ropivacaine increases of efficacy (measured as&#xD;
      opioid consumption during the first 24 postoperative hours, time for first request of opioid&#xD;
      and pain values reported by patients) and the safety (measured as peak and plasmatic&#xD;
      concentration of ropivacaine) of pQLB.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND The posterior Quadratus Lumborum Block (pQLB) is a posterior abdominal wall block&#xD;
      in which local anesthetic (LA), administered posteriorly to Quadratus Lumborum (QL) muscle,&#xD;
      spreads underneath intermedium layer of thoracolumbar fascia, into a triangular space named&#xD;
      lumbar interfacial triangle. This interfascial plane is in close relation to thoracic&#xD;
      paravertebral (PV) space. Local anesthetic spread into this space could explain analgesic&#xD;
      efficacy of pQLB1. Compared to lateral QLB, in which LA is administered laterally to QL&#xD;
      muscle, pQLB is safer (needle tip is separated from the peritoneum by QL muscle) and easier&#xD;
      to perform (injection point is more superficial). Posterior QLB efficacy has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in major abdominal surgery. In Cesarean Section (CS) pQLB efficacy vs placebo&#xD;
      and superior efficacy vs TAP block was showed. Ropivacaine arterial concentration after QLB,&#xD;
      in laparoscopic gynaecological surgery has been studied. To the best of our knowledge no&#xD;
      author investigated pQLB safety in obstetric population, at increased risk of local&#xD;
      anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) because of physiological modifications occurring during&#xD;
      pregnancy (increased cardiac output, increased arterial and venous blood tissue flow,&#xD;
      decreased concentration of plasma binding protein). Adding epinephrine to local anesthetic,&#xD;
      determining a delayed AL systemic reabsorption and a reduced plasmatic concentration, could&#xD;
      improve pQLB efficacy and safety, as demonstrated for Transversus Abdominal Plain (TAP) block&#xD;
      and sciatic and femoral block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Patients were consecutively allocated into one of two groups: e-pQLB (0.375%&#xD;
      ropivacaine+ 100 mcg epinephrine) or pQLB (0.375% ropivacaine). Before surgery, under local&#xD;
      anesthesia, 2 venous accesses were founded, one for fluids and drugs injection and the second&#xD;
      one, contralaterally, for venous samples only. During surgical procedure standard hemodynamic&#xD;
      monitoring was provided; fetal wellbeing was registered by cardiotocographic monitoring.&#xD;
      Supplemental oxygen has was provided by Venturi mask. SA was administered in sitting&#xD;
      position, at L3-4 lumbar interspace, using hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% 9 mg plus sufentanil 5&#xD;
      mcg. Surgical procedure started when T4 level has been reached. Posterior QLB was&#xD;
      administered at the end of surgical procedure, with patient in supine position, under&#xD;
      monitoring and after cleaning the skin with surgical solution (ChloraPrep, Carefusion, 244&#xD;
      LTD, UK). A Sonosite M-Turbo echograph ( FUJIFILM Sonosite Europe, Amsterdam, Netherlands)&#xD;
      and a broadband (5-8 MHz) convex probe covered with a sterile plastic sheath have been used.&#xD;
      The probe was placed at the level of the anterior superior iliac spine and moved cranially&#xD;
      until the three abdominal wall muscles were identified. The external oblique muscle was&#xD;
      followed posterolaterally until its posterior border was found. The probe was tilted down to&#xD;
      identify the bright hyperechoic line that corresponds with the intermediate layer of the&#xD;
      thoracolumbar fascia. The needle (Ultraplex 360, B.Braun Melsungen, Germany) was inserted in&#xD;
      plane from medial (anterior) to lateral (posterior). The optimal point of injection was&#xD;
      determined using hydrodissection. In e-pQLB group ropivacaine 0.375%+epinephrine 100 mcg 20&#xD;
      ml for each side was administered; in pQLB group ropivacaine 0.375% 20 ml for each side was&#xD;
      administered. After block, venous samples (2 ml each) were performed at 10, 30, 45, 60, 120&#xD;
      minutes. The ropivacaine concentration was set at 2.2 mcg/ml, which represents the venous&#xD;
      threshold value of systemic toxicity14. To evaluate LAST patients have been asked for&#xD;
      perioral tingling, metallic taste, tinnitus, visual disturbance or slurred speech at the time&#xD;
      that each blood sample has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative ketorolac 30 mg and acetaminophen 1 g were administered. After surgery, in&#xD;
      Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), a PCA pump was connected to patients and programmed to&#xD;
      deliver 1 mg morphine bolus on demand with a lock out interval of 8 min and no background&#xD;
      infusion. All patients received regular intravenous paracetamol 1g 6 hourly and intravenous&#xD;
      ketorolac 30 mg 12 hourly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental procedure Chemicals, reagents and equipment Methanol and acetonitrile were HPLC&#xD;
      grade and were purchased from VWR Chemicals (Radnor, PA, USA). Water was purified by&#xD;
      Millipore Synergy-UV-System (Bedford, MA, USA). 20 % ammonium hydroxide solution was provided&#xD;
      by Carlo Erba Reagents (Milan, Italy), acetic acid 99-100% and phosphoric acid ≥ 85% were&#xD;
      provided by Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Ropivacaine and Ropivacaine-d7 hydrochloride&#xD;
      (used as internal standard, IS) were purchased by USP (Rockville, MD, USA) and Toronto&#xD;
      Research Chemicals (North York, ON, Canada), respectively. Neostigmine methylsulphate was&#xD;
      provided by LGC Standards (Luckenwalde, Germany).OASIS HLB SPE cartridges (3 mL, 60 mg) were&#xD;
      supplied by Waters (Milford, MA, USA). PTFE disposable filters (0.45 µm) were purchased from&#xD;
      Membrane solutions (Plano, TX, USA). Visiprep DL SPE Vacuum Manifold was purchased by&#xD;
      Supelco/Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The heating block &quot;Pierce - Reacti-Therm III&quot; was&#xD;
      purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). Centrifuge 5415D supplied by&#xD;
      Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany).1 mg mL-1 stock solutions of ropivacaine and ropivacaine-d7 were&#xD;
      prepared in methanol. Working standard solution dilutions were prepared from these latter&#xD;
      solutions and were finally diluted by serial dilution to spike blank plasma samples for the&#xD;
      construction of matrix-matched calibration curve in order to have final ropivacaine&#xD;
      concentrations in the interval of 0.8 - 13.2 ng mL-1. Working solutions were stored at -20 °C&#xD;
      and prepared daily. Stock solutions were analysed regularly up to six month after the&#xD;
      preparation to assess their stability in the time and whether there was degradation of the&#xD;
      analytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma sampling Patients' blood samples (5 mL) were collected in tubes containing&#xD;
      ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and were added to 25 µL of 20 mg mL-1 neostigmine&#xD;
      methylsulfate solution to block esterase activity in the plasma14. The samples were stored in&#xD;
      ice-water bath for 10-15 min and then centrifuged at 1300 × g at 4°C for 5 min to obtain&#xD;
      plasma. Collected plasma samples were stored at -20 °C until analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample preparation A modified procedure of Toonoka K was used. A 0.2-mL-aliquot of plasma&#xD;
      sample was added to 0.3 mL of purified water and vortex-mixed. The diluted sample was spiked&#xD;
      with 25 µL of a methanolic solution of ropivacaine-d7 (IS) (85.0 ng mL-1) and added to 0.5 mL&#xD;
      of 4 % phosphoric acid solution. The mixture was vortex-mixed and centrifuged (16110 × g, 2&#xD;
      min). The supernatant is then loaded on the OASIS HLB SPE cartridge which was previously&#xD;
      conditioned with 2 mL of methanol and equilibrated with 2 mL of purified water. After the&#xD;
      washing steps with 2 mL of 5% methanol solution and 2 mL of 2% ammonium hydroxide in a 10%&#xD;
      methanol solution, sample was eluted with 2 mL of methanol/ 2% acetic acid (70/30, v/v)&#xD;
      solution. The extract was next evaporated under a stream of nitrogen at 30°C and the dry&#xD;
      residue was dissolved in 0.2 mL of the mobile phase and filtrated prior to LC-MS/MS analysis&#xD;
      (10 μL injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LC-MS/MS analysis Analyses were carried out using a LC system Perkin Elmer Series 200 Micro&#xD;
      Pump equipped with a PE Series 200 auto sampler (Perkin Elmer, USA). The chromatographic&#xD;
      separations were obtained under gradient conditions at room temperature (25°C) using a&#xD;
      reverse phase HPLC column Kinetex 2.6 µm EVO C18 100 Å (100 × 3 mm) (Phenomenex, USA) with&#xD;
      C18 guard column (4 mm × 2 mm) (Security Guard, Phenomenex, USA). The mobile phase was&#xD;
      composed of ammonium hydroxide 0.53 mM pH 10.3 (mobile phase A) and acetonitrile (mobile&#xD;
      phase B) and the flow rate was 0.3 mL min-1. The gradient profile began at 70 % A and held&#xD;
      for 1 min, then changed to 25 % in 2 min and held for 3 min. The profile returned to 70 % A&#xD;
      in 1 min and held for 1 min (total run: 8 min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Canada) was equipped with an&#xD;
      Electro Spray Ionization (ESI) source, and was set in positive ionization mode (source&#xD;
      temperature: 450 °C; ionspray voltage: 5500 V; ultra-pure nitrogen as curtain and collision&#xD;
      gas; ultra-pure air as nebulizer and auxiliary gas). One precursor ion and two product ions&#xD;
      (two transitions) for ropivacaine and ropivacaine-d7 were monitored by MRM (Multiple Reaction&#xD;
      Monitoring): 275.2 m/z &gt; 126.1 m/z (most abundant ion used for quantification) and 275.2 m/z&#xD;
      &gt; 84.2 m/z (Figure 1). Collision energy (CE), declustering potential (DP), entrance potential&#xD;
      (EP), and collision cell exit potential (CXP) were adjusted in MRM mode for each transition&#xD;
      monitored in order to reach the highest sensitivity for all the analytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma samples, used for the construction of five points matrix-matched calibration curves,&#xD;
      were previously tested and shown to contain no residues of the compounds of interest. The&#xD;
      ropivacaine concentration levels were set as follows: 0.82, 1.64, 3.28, 6.56 and 13.12 ng&#xD;
      mL-1. The correlation between concentration and the detector response was determined by using&#xD;
      a weighted (1/x) linear regression model (equation y = 0.117x + 0.00409; correlation&#xD;
      coefficient r &gt; 0.998; relative accuracy percentage for each point of the curve within the ±&#xD;
      5 % of the expected concentrations). Sample was appropriately further diluted to obtain&#xD;
      concentrations of ropivacaine within the calibration ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main performance characteristics of the method were evaluated. Limit of detection (LOD)&#xD;
      and limit of quantification (LOQ) values were 0.30 and 0.82 ng mL-1 of ropivacaine,&#xD;
      respectively. Repeatability expressed as intra-day coefficient of variation (CV %) was in the&#xD;
      interval of 1.99 - 11.44 % whereas intermediate precision expressed as inter-day CV % was in&#xD;
      the interval 7.61 - 13.60 %. Recovery percentages were 99.03 - 110.7 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Sample size estimation was based on a recent article from Hansen et al,&#xD;
      who demonstrated that transmuscular quadratus lumborum block for elective CS significantly&#xD;
      reduces postoperative opioid consumption and prolongs time to first opioid request when&#xD;
      compared to placebo. In this single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled study, the mean 24&#xD;
      hours postoperative oral morphine equivalents was 65,3 mg vs 94,3 mg in the control group.&#xD;
      Our primary hypothesis was that epinephrine added to ropivacaine for pQLB would result in a&#xD;
      minimum 30% reduction of opioid consumption in the first 24 postoperative hours. Based on&#xD;
      previous studies on opioid consumption, a SD of 40% was estimated. A sample size of at least&#xD;
      35 patients would give 80% power to detect a 30% reduction in opioid consumption, using&#xD;
      t-tests with α=0,05. Fifty-two patients, twenty-six per group were included in the study to&#xD;
      allow missing data or dropouts. The analysis was performed using Stata IC/15.1 (Stata Corp)&#xD;
      and Microsoft Excel. Ordinal data and continuous data were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank sum&#xD;
      test and Student's t-test as appropriate. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess normality of&#xD;
      data distribution and the sd-test to verify equality of variances. For non-normally&#xD;
      distributed data, a Mann-Whitney test was performed. Differences between categorical data&#xD;
      were analyzed using the χ 2 or Fisher's exact test. Variables were presented as means (SD) or&#xD;
      median (range). The data were given as ratio of means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).A&#xD;
      mixed-effects model for repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess the treatment-by time&#xD;
      interaction; the p value included Box's conservative F test for the lack of compound symmetry&#xD;
      assumption. The investigators applied log-rank tests to compare Kaplan-Meier plots, for&#xD;
      duration of time until first analgesic request. Statistical significance level was 0.05%.&#xD;
