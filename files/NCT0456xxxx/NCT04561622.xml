  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this project is to identify behavioral specificities of the proactive&#xD;
      emotional brain among bipolar patients, compared to healthy subjects. These could contribute&#xD;
      to some of the emotional processing biases that can be observed in these patients. To achieve&#xD;
      this goal, two behavioral tasks will be administer (emotional stroop and emotional stimuli&#xD;
      categorization task) to bipolar patients and control subjects, and their performances will be&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;

      This is a case-control non-interventional study comparing bipolar patients to matched healthy&#xD;
      controls during one assessment visit at the University Hospital of Grenoble.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimentation phase takes place in three stages: first, the experimenter collects&#xD;
      demographic data (age and level of study, lack of medical history and treatments that may&#xD;
      interfere with the task). For bipolar subjects, it also collects the type of bipolarity, the&#xD;
      type and date of the last episode, the age of the onset of the disease and the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, the subject performs a classic Stroop task lasting 3 to 5 minutes, including&#xD;
      instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the subject performs the two main tasks: the emotional Stroop task lasting about 20&#xD;
      minutes and then the task of emotional stimuli categorization lasting about 15 minutes.&#xD;

    <description>Classic Stroop task The subject names one of the 3 colors of the crosses on a sheet.Then, the subject must read the words written on the sheet for 45 seconds.These are the words: RED, BLUE and GREEN, written in black color. The subject must name the color of the word.&#xD;
Emotional Stroop task This is a computed task in which the patient is asked to answer both as accurately and as quickly as possible.&#xD;
The target stimulus is an emotional face of joy or anger, surmounted by the word &quot;joy&quot; or &quot;anger&quot;.The subject must respond using the arrow corresponding to the face he sees.&#xD;
A training phase is offered to the subject.&#xD;
3 / Categorization task For each trial the participant will visualize a short emotional film or not. Then, the participant will have to choose, the emotion corresponding to what he just saw. A training period is offered too.</description>
