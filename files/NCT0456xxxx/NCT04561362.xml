  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is evaluating a drug called BT8009 alone and in combination with&#xD;
      nivolumab in participants with advanced solid tumors associated with Nectin-4 expression or&#xD;
      in participants with advanced solid tumor malignancies having renal insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goals of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Find the recommended dose of BT8009 that can be given safely to participants alone and&#xD;
           in combination with nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about the side effects and effectiveness of BT8009 alone and in combination&#xD;
           with nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about BT8009 alone and in combination with nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about BT8009 alone in patients with kidney disease&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BT8009 consists of a Bicycle peptide (BicycleÂ®) which binds selectively to Nectin-4, and is&#xD;
      covalently attached to a spacer and a cleavable linker attached to a cytotoxin (MMAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Phase I/II, multicenter, first-in-human, open-label dose-escalation study of&#xD;
      BT8009 given as a single agent given once weekly and in combination with nivolumab. There are&#xD;
      three parts to this study. Part A is a dose escalation in patients with select advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors primarily designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of BT8009 as monotherapy or in&#xD;
      combination with nivolumab and to determine a recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). Following a&#xD;
      selection of a recommended Phase II dose (RP2D), part B, a dose expansion portion, will be&#xD;
      initiated with the primary objective of clinical activity of BT8009 as a monotherapy or in&#xD;
      combination with nivolumab in patients with select advanced solid tumors. Part C will&#xD;
      evaluate safety and tolerability of chosen RP2D of BT8009 in patients with renal&#xD;
      insufficiency.&#xD;
