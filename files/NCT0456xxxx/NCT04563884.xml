      The care of deafness in children is difficult and the relevance of interventions is difficult&#xD;
      to evaluate based on audiometric measurements alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generic pediatric quality of life tools have been validated and used, among other things, to&#xD;
      assess the quality of life of children with deafness. However, these non-specific tools do&#xD;
      not make it possible to precisely target which factors and interventions are the most&#xD;
      important for the quality of life in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Achieving a score to monitor the quality of life objectively over time is fundamental to&#xD;
      verify the effectiveness of interventions, and assess the impact on the child. There is&#xD;
      currently no validated test in French for any of these uses and populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to adapt the questionnaires &quot;PEACH&quot;, &quot;SSQ child (SSQ-C)&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;SSQ parents (SSQ-P)&quot; to the French child, and statistically measure their internal and&#xD;
      external validity by comparing them to a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validation of these three tests (PEACH, SSQ-P, SSQ-C) would make it possible to assess&#xD;
      the hearing performance and quality of life of almost the entire pediatric population, for&#xD;
      use in both clinical and academic practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal sensorineural hearing loss is a frequent pathology, affecting around 800 newborns&#xD;
      per year in France, or an incidence of 0.8 to 1.3 per 1000 births, comparable to other&#xD;
      industrialized countries. It can affect the development of speech and language and lead to&#xD;
      impaired quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that children with hearing loss score lower on general quality-of-life&#xD;
      measurement tools, compared to their normal-hearing peers. A poorer quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with sensorineural hearing loss may also reflect physical, academic, social or&#xD;
      emotional difficulties. They are also exposed to an increased risk of poor development of&#xD;
      language and social skills, as well as an increased risk of developing psychiatric&#xD;
      pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The care of deafness in children is difficult and the relevance of interventions is difficult&#xD;
      to evaluate based on audiometric measurements alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generic pediatric quality of life tools have been validated and used, among other things, to&#xD;
      assess the quality of life of children with deafness. However, these non-specific tools do&#xD;
      not make it possible to precisely target which factors and interventions are the most&#xD;
      important for the quality of life in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Achieving a score to monitor the quality of life objectively over time is fundamental to&#xD;
      verify the effectiveness of interventions, and assess the impact on the child. There is&#xD;
      currently no validated test in French for any of these uses and populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Parents' Evaluation of Aural/Oral Performance of Children (PEACH) is a hetero-evaluation&#xD;
      score used to study the quality of a child's communication from an early age (from 4 months&#xD;
      in some studies) and up to 13 years. This tool is specifically designed for children with&#xD;
      hearing aids or a cochlear implant. It has been translated into Swedish and Spanish and used&#xD;
      in numerous international publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ) is an adult self-assessment score&#xD;
      assessing, in three categories, the performance of speech comprehension, spatial hearing and&#xD;
      hearing quality. It is widely used internationally in its adult version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This adult score has been adapted and used for the pediatric population in a&#xD;
      hetero-evaluation score by parents (SSQ-P) from 5 years old, and a simplified score (SSQ-C)&#xD;
      usable by children&gt; 11 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the authors of the adult SSQ also prepared and validated a Handicap&#xD;
      questionnaire to target the impact of hearing loss on quality of life, and integrated into&#xD;
      the SSQ self-assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to adapt the questionnaires &quot;PEACH&quot;, &quot;SSQ child (SSQ-C)&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;SSQ parents (SSQ-P)&quot; to the French child, and statistically measure their internal and&#xD;
      external validity by comparing them to a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validation of these three tests (PEACH, SSQ-P, SSQ-C) would make it possible to assess&#xD;
      the hearing performance and quality of life of almost the entire pediatric population, for&#xD;
      use in both clinical and academic practice.&#xD;
