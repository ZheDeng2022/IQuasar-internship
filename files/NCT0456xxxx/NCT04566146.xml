  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate if pain severity, scapular upward rotation angle and upper trapezius/serratus&#xD;
      anterior isometric strength ratio can predict patient's response to scapular training in&#xD;
      patients with subacromial impingement syndrome.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS) is the most commonly diagnosed shoulder disorder. In&#xD;
      literature shoulder impingement is reported between 48% and 65% of all painful shoulder&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coordinated coupled motion between the scapula and humerus, the so-called scapulohumeral&#xD;
      rhythm (SHR), is needed for efficient arm movement. Reduced scapular mobility reduces the&#xD;
      acromio-humeral distance during arm abduction and therefore increases the risk for shoulder&#xD;
      impingement syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) are tools designed to improve decision making in clinical&#xD;
      practice by assisting practitioners in making a particular diagnosis, establishing a&#xD;
      prognosis, or matching patients to optimal interventions based on a parsimonious subset of&#xD;
      predictor variables from the history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain severity will not be predictor for treatment success in patients suffering from&#xD;
      subacromial impingement syndrome treated with scapular training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scapular upward rotation angle will not be predictor for treatment success in patients&#xD;
      suffering from subacromial impingement syndrome treated with scapular training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ratio of upper trapezius /serratus anterior isometric strength will not be predictor for&#xD;
      treatment success in patients suffering from subacromial impingement syndrome treated with&#xD;
      scapular training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does pain severity, scapular upward rotation angle and upper trapezius/serratus anterior&#xD;
      isometric strength ratio predict patient's esponse to scapular training in patients with&#xD;
      subacromial impingement syndrome?&#xD;

    <measure>Measuring of scapular upward rotation angle using two bubble inclinometer</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Scapular upward rotation will be measured by using two bubble inclinometers. All patients will be assessed in a relaxed, standing (barefoot) position. One inclinometer is Velcro taped perpendicular to the humeral shaft, just above the humeral epicondyle. The resting position of the humerus will be recorded. The other inclinometer will be placed on the superior border of the spine of the scapula. Next, the patient will instruct to perform shoulder abduction to 100° with full elbow extension, neutral wrist flexion/extension and with the thumb leading to ensure vertical alignment of the inclinometer.&#xD;
When the inclinometer placed on the humerus reached 100°, the therapist records the degree of scapular upward rotation from the inclinometer placed on the spine of the scapula, each patient will perform one test, and then the measurement will recorded.</description>

    <measure>Measuring isometric scapular muscle strength using handheld dynamometer (HHD) then calculation of Upper Trapezius/Serratus Anterior strength ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Upper trapezius isometric strength testing:&#xD;
The patient will seat, and the dynamometer will be placed over the superior scapula. The patient then will be asked to elevate the shoulder against resistance.&#xD;
Serratus anterior isometric strength testing:&#xD;
The patient will lay supine with the elbow and shoulder in 90° flexion. The resistance will be applied to the ulna at the olecranon process along the humeral axis. For measurement of the ratio, the isometric strength of both upper trapezius and serratus anterior will be assessed using hand-held dynamometer (HHD) and then the UT/SA ratio will be calculated. Strength = ((HHD reading in Newtons) x (distance)) Bodyweight in kilograms</description>
