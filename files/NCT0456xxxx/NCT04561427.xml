  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Narcolepsy is a rare disease that affects 0.05% of the general population. It is&#xD;
      characterized by a dysregulation of the sleep wake regulation that leads to uncontrolled&#xD;
      sleep episode during day and a disorganized sleep during night. These symptoms are due to a&#xD;
      loss of hypocretin neurons in the brain leading to an inability to maintain wake properly.&#xD;
      The physiopathology of this rare disease still needs investigations. Since we are a reference&#xD;
      center for this disease, we propose to use patients files to better describe and document the&#xD;
      sleep characteristics of these children, the cognitive performances, the effects of&#xD;
      narcolepsy treatments on sleep architecture and the metabolic status of these children.&#xD;
