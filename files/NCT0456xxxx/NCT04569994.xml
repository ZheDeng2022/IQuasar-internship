  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the safety and tolerability of the new investigational product&#xD;
      NNC0363-0845, its concentrations in the blood and its effect on the blood sugar for the&#xD;
      treatment of diabetes. The study consists of 3 parts. The first part of the study is&#xD;
      conducted in healthy people, while the second part involves people with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      (T1D). Part 3 of this trial involves also people with T1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will test how NNC0363-0845 is tolerated by the body, how it is taken up in the&#xD;
      blood, how long it stays there and how much the blood sugar is lowered. Healthy volunteers&#xD;
      will either get NNC0363-0845 or placebo - which treatment is decided by chance. Participants&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes will either get NNC0363-0845 or insulin degludec (TresibaÂ®), also&#xD;
      decided by chance. It is the first time that NNC0363-0845 is tested in humans. Participants&#xD;
      will get one dose of NNC0363-0845 or placebo or insulin degludec injected into their left&#xD;
      thigh. Participation in the study will last for up to 6 weeks. There will be one Informed&#xD;
      Consent visit and 6 clinic visits with the study doctor. Healthy volunteers will have blood&#xD;
      sampling to measure blood sugar and the concentration of the investigational product in the&#xD;
      blood. Participants with type 1 diabetes will have a clamp experiment where the blood sugar&#xD;
      is measured and controlled for up to 42 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Part 3, the total duration of the trial for each individual is expected to be&#xD;
      approximately 3-9 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants cannot be in the study if the study doctor thinks that there are risks for their&#xD;
      health. Women can only take part in the study if they are of non-child bearing potential.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Male subject or female subject of non-child bearing potential. Non-child bearing&#xD;
             potential being defined as surgically sterilised (i.e. documented hysterectomy,&#xD;
             bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or being postmenopausal (defined as&#xD;
             no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause) prior to the day of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 18-55 years (both inclusive) at the time of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Considered to be generally healthy based on the medical history, physical examination,&#xD;
             and the results of vital signs, electrocardiogram and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
             performed during the screening visit, as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Part 2 and 3 (subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus):&#xD;

          -  Considered to be generally healthy (except for type 1 diabetes mellitus and sequelae&#xD;
             of diabetes which may only be of mild severity) based on the medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, and the results of vital signs, electrocardiogram and clinical laboratory&#xD;
             tests performed during the screening visit, as judged by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
