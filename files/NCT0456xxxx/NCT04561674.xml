    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop, implement and determine the effects of web-based&#xD;
      education programs for patients undergoing colostomy and ileostomy.The study is a randomized&#xD;
      controlled experimental research with a pre-test post-test control group design. The study&#xD;
      group of the research consisted of individuals, who have an abdominal stoma procedure at a&#xD;
      Training and Research Hospital operating under the Ministry of Health in Turkey. 35&#xD;
      individuals were enrolled to the experiment and control groups (N=70). The study group of the&#xD;
      hospital was determined as a result of the power analysis performed on an average number of&#xD;
      150 patients, on whom a stoma is opened within a year, with an estimated effect rate of 0.824&#xD;
      and a SD of 0.45, the power being 0.80 and confidence interval p:0.05, as a total of 50&#xD;
      patients, 25 in the experiment group and 25 in the control group. Taking into consideration&#xD;
      the data loss that may be experienced, it was planned to enrol 35 individuals to the&#xD;
      experiment group and 35 individuals to the control group. The patients were randomly assigned&#xD;
      to each group. Homogeneity of patients randomized to the experiment and control groups was&#xD;
      checked with a t-test. Research data were collected using an Information Form, Stoma&#xD;
      Complications Assessment Form and City of Hope-Quality of Life-Ostomy Questionnaire and Stoma&#xD;
      Care Knowledge Assessment Test.&#xD;

      The study is a randomized controlled experimental research with a pre-test post-test control&#xD;
      group design. The study group of the research consisted of individuals, who have an abdominal&#xD;
      stoma procedure at a Training and Research Hospital operating under the Ministry of Health in&#xD;
      Turkey. 35 individuals were enrolled to the experiment and control groups (N=70). The study&#xD;
      group of the hospital was determined as a result of the power analysis performed on an&#xD;

      individuals to the experiment group and 35 individuals to the control group. The patients&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to each group. Homogeneity of patients randomized to the experiment&#xD;
      and control groups was checked with a t-test. The stages of the research design were&#xD;
      determined completely in accordance with the CONSORT diagram. Data were collected using an&#xD;
      Information Form, Stoma Complications Assessment Form and City of Hope-Quality of Life-Ostomy&#xD;
      Questionnaire and Stoma Care Knowledge Assessment Test. The study data were analysed with&#xD;
      average, standard deviation, frequency, student t test, paired sample t test, variance&#xD;
      analysis, Fisher's exact chi-square test, Fisher-Freeman-Halton test and Yates continuity&#xD;
      correction test. Significance was assessed at a level of p&lt;0.05.&#xD;

    <description>Stoma Care Knowledge Assessment Test was applied to the patients in the experimental group.This was prepared in light of the literature in order to assess the patients' level of knowledge on stoma. There are 17 items in the test. An example question is given below: The stool coming out of the stoma causes irritation on the skin surrounding it. The options are true, false and I do not know.</description>
