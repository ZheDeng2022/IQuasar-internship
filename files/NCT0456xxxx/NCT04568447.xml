  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most frequent causes of motor dysfunction in aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore important to use rehabilitative therapeutic approaches that may prevent the&#xD;
      development of motor complications when possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imoove® is a device dedicated to rehabilitation and fitness and has the capacity to increase&#xD;
      muscle tenfold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is focused on quantifying the efficacy of IMOOVE® as a treatment method for&#xD;
      improving joint mobility, posture and autonomy in PD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of PD-related postural abnormalities is probably multifactorial as well as&#xD;
      widely indefinite, and this could compromise treatment choices and efficacy. In addition to&#xD;
      dystonia and rigidity, proprioceptive and sensorimotor disintegration as well as peripheral&#xD;
      degenerative processes (myopathy, skeletal and soft tissue changes) have been proposed as&#xD;
      causative factors of abnormal trunk postures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the body is educated in the Elispheric® movement it relearns the original vertebral&#xD;
      motion, and postural control necessary for any action by the body, the professional can then&#xD;
      perform effective vertebral reeducation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Elispheric® movements are created by a motorised plate. This unique technology impulses&#xD;
      the body through a centrifugal force in three planes. This force trains the body in its&#xD;
      natural spirals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performance result is based on the fact that Imoove restores the all freedom of movement,&#xD;
      strength, precision and it works on the basic skeletal posture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is an exploratory study, in order to verify if the project is adequate, to establish its&#xD;
      feasibility and to obtain information that allows to determine the size of the sample of the&#xD;
      definitive study, 30 consecutive PD outpatients will be recruited for the IMOOVE® treatment.&#xD;
