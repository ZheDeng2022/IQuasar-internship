  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective observational trial. Data of 4 hospitals will be used to find out&#xD;
      the efficacy of conservative treatment in rotator cuff tear.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Rotator cuff tear is known as its symptoms which are pain, limited shoulder range of&#xD;
      motion(ROM), and the clicking sound of the shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On recent research by Health Insurance Review &amp; Assessment Service, the number of rotator&#xD;
      cuff tear patients has increased from 508155 to 704838 during 2013-2017. And also the&#xD;
      research reported that the difference of effect between surgical treatments and non-surgical&#xD;
      treatments was unremarkable. So in most cases, non-surgical treatments are applied primarily&#xD;
      on rotator cuff tear except for some serious cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical therapy and medication are well known for the currently known non-surgical and&#xD;
      conservative treatments, but research reported on the treatment of rotator cuff tear by using&#xD;
      Korean medicine treatment so far has its weak level. Therefore, it is expected that this&#xD;
      study will demonstrate the efficacy of the treatment of rotator cuff tear in Korean medicine&#xD;
      treatment and will further pave the way for non-surgical treatment of rotator cuff tear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, The investigators conducted an observational trial to analyze the effectiveness of&#xD;
      Korean medicine treatment in rotator cuff tear. Retrospective data will be extracted using&#xD;
      electronic medical records and computerized data of hospitalized patients. Based on this,&#xD;
      investigators will conduct research in the form of a prospective survey and analyze the&#xD;
      causal relationship and factors using the two data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hospital's medical records will be used to analyze the patient's condition during the&#xD;
      hospitalization period and to determine the situation after the end of treatment through a&#xD;
      questionnaire. The questionnaire will be developed after consultation with experts from the&#xD;
      musculoskeletal system and related societies, and will be used for the questionnaire.&quot;&#xD;
