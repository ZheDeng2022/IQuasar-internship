  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancers are the third most common cancer in the world. In advanced stages of&#xD;
      colorectal cancers, peritoneal carcinomatosis and intraabdominal acid development occur.&#xD;
      Although stomach cancer is the 5th most common cancer in the world, it is the third cancer&#xD;
      with the highest mortality. Pancreatic cancer is one of the highest mortality cancers&#xD;
      worldwide. Likewise, in advanced stages of stomach and pancreatic cancer, peritoneal&#xD;
      carcinomatosis and intra- abdominal acid development occur. It is known that the immune&#xD;
      system plays an important role in tumor development or destruction of tumor. Recent studies&#xD;
      have shown that tumor cells develop escape mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment to escape&#xD;
      from host immunity. It has been reported that differentiation of T cells towards Th2 and&#xD;
      regulatory T cells is also effective in tumor progression(6). Changes in the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment and immune checkpoints are important mechanisms that lead to escape from the&#xD;
      immune system. Immune checkpoints are on the agenda especially after 2018 Nobel Prize and&#xD;
      they are important molecules in revealing the relationship.In our study, it is aimed to&#xD;
      evaluate whether there is a difference in immune control points in patients with end-stage&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer compared to patients without&#xD;
      malignancy, and the relationship of these parameters with patient survival and tumor spread&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;

      Colorectal cancers are the third most common cancer in the world. In advanced stages of&#xD;

      microenvironment and immune checkpoints are important mechanisms that lead to escape from the&#xD;
      immune system. Immune checkpoints are on the agenda especially after 2018 Nobel Prize and&#xD;
      they are important molecules in revealing the relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 (PD-1) and its ligand, PD-L1, is an immune control point that&#xD;
      acts by blocking T cell receptor signal transduction and co-stimuli. T cell immunoglobulin&#xD;
      and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3) are mostly expressed on interferon-gamma-producing T cells, Tregs,&#xD;
      dendritic cells, B cells, macrophages, natural killer cells (NK) and mast cells. Enhanced&#xD;
      regulation of TIM-3 expression is associated with autoimmune diseases. High TIM-3 expression&#xD;
      is associated with suppression of T cell responses and T cell depletion characterized by loss&#xD;
      of T cell functions during chronic viral infections and during tumor development. With the&#xD;
      clinical success of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab and nivolumab for&#xD;
      melanoma and lung cancer, immune checkpoints have received more attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of the immune system in colorectal cancers has been demonstrated, especially in&#xD;
      recent studies, with the effects of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and immune control&#xD;
      points on TILs or immune control point ligands on patient survival. Studies in the literature&#xD;
      usually include immunological examinations of patient blood or tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many publications in the literature on the study of immunological markers from acid&#xD;
      fluid samples for various reasons. In these studies, T and B cell subtypes were examined from&#xD;
      acid fluids samples taken from patients with spontaneous ascites, especially ovarian cancer&#xD;
      and liver cirrhosis. In the only study conducted on gastrointestinal cancers,&#xD;
      immunophenotyping was performed in intraabdominal ascites and blood in 22 advanced&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tumor patients, and some cell subgroups were associated with clinical&#xD;
      worsening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, there is no study on immune control points from intra-abdominal acid&#xD;
      fluids specific to gastric and colorectal cancer. In our study, it is aimed to evaluate&#xD;
      whether there is a difference in immune control points in patients with end-stage colorectal&#xD;
      cancer, gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer compared to patients without malignancy, and the&#xD;
      relationship of these parameters with patient survival and tumor spread mechanisms.&#xD;
