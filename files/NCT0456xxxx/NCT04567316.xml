      The main objective of this trial is to investigate the basic pharmacokinetics of BI 1358894&#xD;
      and its metabolites, total radioactivity, including mass balance, excretion pathways and&#xD;
      metabolism following a single oral dose of [14C] BI 1358894 in Part 1 and to investigate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of BI 1358894 and its metabolite(s) following multiple-dose treatment over&#xD;
      21 days with non- radiolabelled compound of BI 1358894 in Part 2.&#xD;
