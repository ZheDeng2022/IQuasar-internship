  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate and compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of a&#xD;
      single dose of two solid dosage formulations of JNJ-64140284 in plasma and urine in healthy&#xD;
      male participants under fed and fasting conditions; and to investigate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of two solid dosage formulations of JNJ 64140284 versus placebo after single&#xD;
      oral dose administration in healthy male participants under fed and fasting conditions in&#xD;
      Part 1; to investigate the safety and tolerability of JNJ-64140284 versus placebo after&#xD;
      single oral dose administration (or 1 divided dose, if applicable) (ascending dose levels) in&#xD;
      healthy male participants; and to characterize the PK of a single dose (or 1 divided dose, if&#xD;
      applicable) of JNJ-64140284 in plasma in healthy male participants in Part 2; and to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of food on the PK of a single (or 1 divided dose, if applicable)&#xD;
      therapeutic relevant dose of JNJ 64140284 in healthy male participants; and to investigate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of JNJ-64140284 versus placebo after single oral dose&#xD;
      administration at a therapeutic relevant dose (or 1 divided dose, if applicable) in fed&#xD;
      conditions in Part 3.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a pharmaceutical (investigational or non investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product.</description>
