  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current research has shown that an imbalance in the Kinurenine pathway plays a role in the&#xD;
      physiopathology of neurogenerative and mental disorders (with a decrease in neuroprotective&#xD;
      metabolites and an increase in neurotoxic products). So far the research has concentrated on&#xD;
      the enzymes IDO, KAT, KMO, 3HAO and QPRT which are the key players in this pathway. Several&#xD;
      polymorphisms affecting these enzymes have been associated with certain disorders&#xD;
      characterized by a deregulation of the inflammation and immune response (McCauley et al&#xD;
      2009,Tardito et al 2013, Lee et al 2014), but no studies have ever tried to find a link&#xD;
      between these enzymes and suicidal behavior. The investigators hypothesize that people who&#xD;
      have attempted to commit suicide will have pro-inflammatory genetic variations affecting the&#xD;
      kynurenine pathway.&#xD;

    <description>The frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms, measured as a percentage, will be compared with the number of suicide attempts, the lethality, the method used and the intensity of suicidal ideation in the Suicide group. The polygenic risk score is calculated as a weighted sum of the risk alleles resulting from the study using GWAS (genome-wide association study) summary statistics data. This score is not calculated on a scale but as a relative risk compared to the unaffected population.</description>
