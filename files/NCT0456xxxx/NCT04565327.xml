  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using&#xD;
      hyperpolarized carbon-13 (13C) pyruvate can be useful for evaluating early treatment response&#xD;
      in patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally&#xD;
      advanced) or spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate is&#xD;
      different from standard clinical MRI contrast (e.g. gadolinium) in that it provides&#xD;
      information on how a tumor processes nutrients. MRI is used to see tumor uptake and breakdown&#xD;
      of hyperpolarized carbon-13 pyruvate molecules, which can tell how the tumor processes&#xD;
      nutrients. Hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate MRI may help in understanding how the tumor responds&#xD;
      to the treatments patients may be receiving.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the signal-to-noise ratio of 13C pyruvate metabolism (peak 13C&#xD;
      lactate/pyruvate ratio, 13C lactate/pyruvate area-under-the-curve (AUC) ratio, and apparent&#xD;
      rate constant for pyruvate-to-lactate conversion, kPL) in the target tumor (primary tumor&#xD;
      and/or abdominal metastases) in Cohort A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the percent changes in the target tumor (primary tumor and/or abdominal&#xD;
      metastases) 13C pyruvate metabolism (peak 13C lactate/pyruvate ratio, 13C lactate/pyruvate&#xD;
      AUC ratio, and kPL) between pre-treatment scan and scan obtained at 4-week (+/-2 weeks)&#xD;
      following treatment initiation in Cohort B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the repeatability of 13C pyruvate metabolism measures in the target tumor&#xD;
      (primary tumor and/or abdominal metastasis) in patients with same-day repeated dose in Cohort&#xD;
      A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether the baseline or the changes in the target tumor (primary tumor&#xD;
      and/or abdominal metastases) 13C pyruvate metabolism at 4 weeks following treatment&#xD;
      initiation are associated with the best objective response as defined by Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria on subsequent clinical computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      scans in Cohort B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore 13C pyruvate metabolism between the primary tumor and abdominal metastases&#xD;
      (when present) both at baseline and following treatment in both Cohort A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A: Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate intravenously (IV) over less&#xD;
      than one minute then undergo MRI over 5 minutes at baseline in the absence of unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B: Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate IV over less than one minute&#xD;
      then undergo MRI over 5 minutes at baseline and 4 weeks after beginning treatment in the&#xD;
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both cohorts, patients may receive an optional second hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate&#xD;
      dose and undergo MRI within 15 to 60 minutes following the completion of the first scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months&#xD;

    <description>ICC will be used to estimate the intra-subject agreement to assess repeatability of tumor HP 13C pyruvate metabolism in patients with same-day repeated dose.

    <measure>Cohort B: Best Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks after treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response for patients in Cohort B will be defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 on subsequent clinical CT scans. For the purpose of response assessment in this pilot study, we will group patients either as having disease control when the best response is complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) on subsequent clinical CT scans, or having disease progression when the best response is progressive disease (PD) on subsequent CT scans. Comparisons the baseline or changes in the target tumor 13C pyruvate metabolism at 4 weeks (+/-2 weeks) after treatment initiation between the disease control group and disease progression group (as defined by RECIST on subsequent clinical CT scans) will be made using the Mann-Whitney tests.</description>
