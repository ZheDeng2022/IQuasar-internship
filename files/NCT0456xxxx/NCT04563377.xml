    <textblock>
      The primary object of the study is to assess the safety profile of candidate vaccines&#xD;
      ChAdOx1.HTI and MVA.HTI administered sequentially in healthy HIV-1/2 negative adult&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the study will assess the immune responses generated of the candidate vaccines&#xD;
      ChAdOx1.HTI and MVA.HTI administered sequentially in healthy HIV-1/2 negative adult&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 healthy, HIV-negative adult volunteers will receive one vaccination of CHAdOx1.HTI&#xD;
      followed by a one vaccination of MVA.HTI 8 weeks later.&#xD;
