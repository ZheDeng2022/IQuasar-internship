  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a relationship exists between Week 6 vedolizumab&#xD;
      therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and Week 30 Faecal calprotectin (FCP).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, retrospective, and longitudinal study of participants with IBD&#xD;
      (UC or CD) receiving vedolizumab between years 2015 and 2020. The study will determine the&#xD;
      real-world evidence of vedolizumab, its relationship with TDM, biomarkers of inflammation,&#xD;
      and its effect on clinical outcomes in a real-world setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll approximately 5,500 participants. Participants will be enrolled in 2&#xD;
      cohorts: TDM Cohort and Historical Cohort. The study will have a retrospective data&#xD;
      collection of the participants from PSP between the years 2015 and 2020. The study will&#xD;
      include longitudinal analysis of data collected in a subset of Takeda Canada PSP,&#xD;
      specifically for those participants on vedolizumab, some of which received biomarker testing&#xD;
      and TDM at pre-specified intervals during their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Canada. The overall time for data collection in&#xD;
      the study will be approximately 5 years.&#xD;

    <measure>TDM Cohort: Correlation Between Week 6 Vedolizumab TDM and Week 30 FCP</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 30 after the first dose of vedolizumab</time_frame>
    <description>The relationship between vedolizumab TDM at Week 6 and FCP levels at Week 30 will be studied using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Multivariate analyses will be performed to control for possible confounding factors such as age, sex, disease type (CD/UC), duration, prior immunomodulator/biologic therapy, vedolizumab start and end dates, vedolizumab dose, vedolizumab frequency, and albumin. FCP will be used as a surrogate marker for disease severity, and by extension drug efficacy, with higher levels indicating poor drug efficacy, and low to non-detectable levels indicating increased drug efficacy. The FCP level will be detected in participant's stool 30 weeks after the participant's first dose of vedolizumab.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TDM Cohort: C-reactive Protein (CRP) Level at Week 30</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 30 after the first dose of vedolizumab</time_frame>
    <description>The CRP level will be detected in participant's blood 30 weeks after the participant's first dose of vedolizumab. CRP will be used as a surrogate marker for disease severity, and by extension drug efficacy, with higher levels indicating poor drug efficacy, and low to non-detectable levels indicating increased drug efficacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TDM Cohort: Disease Score for Crohn's Disease (CD) Participants Based on Harvey-bradshaw Index (HBI) at Week 30</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 30 after the first dose of vedolizumab</time_frame>
    <description>Disease activity scores of CD participants will be based on HBI. It consists of clinical parameters: general well-being (0 equal to [=] very well to 4 = terrible), abdominal pain (0 = none to 3 = severe), number of liquid or soft stools per day, abdominal mass (0 = none to 3 = definite and tender), and complications (8 items; 1 score per item). The total score is sum of sub scores, where score less than (&lt;) 5 = remission, 5 to 7 = mild disease activity, 8 to 16 = moderate disease activity and greater than (&gt;) 16 = severe disease activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TDM Cohort: Disease Score for Ulcerative Colitis (UC) Participants Based on Partial Mayo Score at Week 30</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 30 after the first dose of vedolizumab</time_frame>
    <description>Disease activity scores of UC participants will be based on Partial Mayo score. It consists of 3 sub-scores: stool pattern, most severe rectal bleeding of the day, and global assessment by physician, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9. Here, higher scores indicates more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Categorized Based on Dose Escalation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) up to Week 30 after first dose of vedolizumab</time_frame>
    <description>Dose escalation will be defined as a change from doses every 8 weeks to every 6 or 4 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TDM Cohort: Number of Participants Categorized Based on Treatment Persistence at the end of the TDM Study at Week 30</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 30 after the first dose of vedolizumab</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment Persistence will be defined whether the participant is still on the treatment at the end of the TDM study.</description>

    <measure>Treatment Duration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) up to Week 30 after the first dose of vedolizumab</time_frame>
