  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year, alcohol use disorder (AUD) generates millions of emergency department (ED) visits&#xD;
      and hospital admissions, costing the U.S. health sector over $90 billion. These hospital&#xD;
      admissions are critical opportunities to start patients on addiction pharmacotherapy, but&#xD;
      factors like medication non-adherence and post-discharge relapse contribute to frequent&#xD;
      re-admissions. Two single-dose interventions are well suited to facilitate treatment&#xD;
      retention and prevent re-admissions due to their prolonged, adherence-independent effects:&#xD;
      extended-release (XR) naltrexone injection and intravenous (IV) ketamine infusion. These have&#xD;
      not been thoroughly investigated in the hospital setting among high-utilizer, safety-net&#xD;
      populations. Therefore, the investigators aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test the feasibility of randomizing hospitalized patients (n=45-60, age 18-65) with&#xD;
           multiple AUD-related admissions to treatment with either extended-release (XR)&#xD;
           naltrexone, intravenous (IV) ketamine, or no single-dose medication, all with enhanced&#xD;
           linkage to care. Feasibility outcomes such as recruitment rate, patient acceptability,&#xD;
           post-discharge follow-up rate, and adverse events will help to identify key lessons for&#xD;
           a future comparative effectiveness study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Estimate the 30-day re-admission rate for patients randomized to treatment with XR&#xD;
           naltrexone, with IV ketamine, or no single-dose medication, all with enhanced linkage to&#xD;
           care. The investigators hypothesize that the re-admission rate will be lower for each of&#xD;
           the two single-dose medication groups than for the &quot;linkage-alone&quot; group.&#xD;
