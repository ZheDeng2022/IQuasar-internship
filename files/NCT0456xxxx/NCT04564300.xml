  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is still no one who has studied how oral contraceptive use affects recovery in trained&#xD;
      women after repeated high-intensity workouts. Consequently, a well-controlled study is&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is designed as a controlled cohort study, where 20 oral contraceptive users will&#xD;
      be compared with 20 non-users. After initial preliminary examination and habituation to the&#xD;
      test procedures, the subjects will start the intervention in week 2 of their menstrual cycle&#xD;
      / active contraceptive pill cycle. Before and 3h, 24h and 48h after 3 intense strength&#xD;
      training sessions performed 2 days in a row, blood samples will be taken, muscle soreness&#xD;
      measured and performance tests performed. The day before the first training session and over&#xD;
      the 4 trial days, the subjects will receive a standardized diet.&#xD;
