  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are twofold. The first primary objective is to evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability of atomoxetine (40 mg/day for 3 days then 80&#xD;
      mg/day thereafter) as compared to placebo for 6 weeks plus a psychosocial platform comprised&#xD;
      of motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (MET-CBT) among&#xD;
      adolescents (ages 14 to 19 years) with alcohol use disorder as confirmed by the Diagnostic&#xD;
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fifth Edition (DSM-5™). The second primary&#xD;
      objective is to leverage a human laboratory paradigm and ecological momentary assessment&#xD;
      (EMA) methods to evaluate the effects of atomoxetine on intermediate phenotypes associated&#xD;
      with alcohol use and outcomes in clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proof-of-concept study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group, single-site study designed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      tolerability of atomoxetine for alcohol use disorder among adolescents ages 14 to 19 years.&#xD;
      In addition, this project will test the effects of atomoxetine, as compared with placebo, on&#xD;
      responses to in vivo alcohol cue exposure in the human laboratory setting. After obtaining&#xD;
      consent/parent permission/assent, youth and, if younger than 18 years, their parent will&#xD;
      complete a medical history interview to screen for eligibility. Youth will also be screened&#xD;
      for eligibility. If eligible for the study, participants will be randomized in an approximate&#xD;
      1:1 ratio (targeting 21 participants per group - 42 participants total) to either atomoxetine&#xD;
      or placebo for 6 weeks. Atomoxetine will be dosed at 40 mg/day for three days then increased&#xD;
      to the maintenance dose of 80 mg (active) taken orally once daily (QD) for an additional 5.5&#xD;
      weeks. Participants randomized to the placebo condition will be given an equal number of&#xD;
      visually matched capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be seen in the clinic at the in-person screening appointment, the&#xD;
      randomization/baseline session, and at 8 other times during the study. Three follow-up&#xD;
      telephone interviews will occur at 2 weeks and three and six months after the last in-clinic&#xD;
      visit. At the randomization/baseline visit and after 4 weeks of investigational product&#xD;
      administration (i.e., Study Week 7), participants will undergo a human laboratory paradigm&#xD;
      (i.e., alcohol cue reactivity assessment). In addition, participants will complete EMA on a&#xD;
      smartphone throughout the day in their daily lives.&#xD;
