      Objectif Principal&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the intensity and frequency of pain episodes in patients with cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      followed at the cystic fibrosis center of Rouen University Hospital, Normandy, France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectifs secondaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the relationship between pain and disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the relationship between pain and the age of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the pain locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the use of pharmacological or nonpharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the procedural pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients seen for routine planned visits complete a self-administered retrospective&#xD;
      questionnaire about pain during the last 3 months, and a prospective diary during the two&#xD;
      weeks following the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary evaluation criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensity and frequency of pain are evaluated with the prospective diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pain intensity is assessed by validated scales adapted to the patient's age (scale&#xD;
           ranging from 0 to 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
           0 to 6 years : numerical rating scale assessed by the parents. 4 to 7 years : Faces Pain&#xD;
           Scale Revised. Children 6 years and older, adolescents and adults: numerical rating&#xD;
           scale self-reported&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pain frequency is completed twice a day (morning and evening) on the prospective&#xD;
           pain diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary evaluation criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The disease severity, estimated using recent forced expiratory volume in one second&#xD;
           (FEV1) (best measurement of the year before bronchodilator, collected in the patient's&#xD;
           medical record)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain locations, pharmacological or nonpharmacological treatment and procedural pain are&#xD;
           evaluated using the diary and the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data and characteristics of cystic fibrosis are collected using the medical&#xD;
           file.&#xD;
