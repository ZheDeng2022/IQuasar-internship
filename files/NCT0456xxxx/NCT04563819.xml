    <textblock>
      Hip Dysplasia, or Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a congenital disorder of the&#xD;
      hip joint characterized by a shallow, or dysplastic hip socket, with potential risks of&#xD;
      developing progressive joint dislocation, early osteoarthritis from young adulthood and&#xD;
      serious functional disability. The Hip Cohort Study is the first longitudinal,&#xD;
      population-based hip &quot;phenobank&quot; which includes standardized ultrasound examinations of the&#xD;
      newborn hip, radiographs at skeletal maturity (around 19 years), as well as clinical data and&#xD;
      DNA samples from the participants. The combination of genetic analyses with the rich&#xD;
      radiological and clinical data collected at different life stages during the first two&#xD;
      decades of life will enable identification of biological pathways (advanced genetic analyses)&#xD;
      that are significantly associated with different radiological indices of hip dysplasia. This&#xD;
      will allow for early, targeted treatment of the DDH disease and thus reduce the risk of later&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.&#xD;

      Study population and DNA samples Clinical and radiological follow up of Hip Cohort Study&#xD;
      members born during 1989 (n=4004, response rate 52%) and those revealing sonographically&#xD;
      immature or dysplastic hips in the newborn period during 1988 and 1990 (n= 480, response rate&#xD;
      67.7%) was performed during 2007- 2009, thereby enabling characterisation of DDH in 2406&#xD;
      subjects. In 1779 of these, salivary samples were collected with consent, and DNA was&#xD;
      extracted and stored in Professor Bill Ollier's laboratory at the University of Manchester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial Hip Cohort Study is well described in ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01818934.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genome-wide genotyping, SNP and CNV association analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA samples will be sent to the Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian&#xD;
      University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Norway, for the genome-wide SNP (single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphism) genotyping. For this study, we will use the latest version of&#xD;
      Illumina Core Exome array, covering known genes, selected exones and promoter regions, as&#xD;
      well as a backbone of common genetic variation allowing for imputation of genotypes that will&#xD;
      widen the genomic content we will examine. Thus, this array will provide sufficient coverage&#xD;
      of the genome for biological pathway analyses. Initial quality control will be performed in&#xD;
      Illumina's Genome Studio Software. Subsequent quality control will be performed as described&#xD;
      in the paper by Anderson et al in order to avoid common confounding factors such as batch&#xD;
      effect (Lam et al 2020, Anderson et al 2010). Coverage of the genome-wide variation will be&#xD;
      further improved by imputation of non-genotyped SNPs using directly genotyped SNPs and&#xD;
      linkage disequilibrium information from the Haplotype Reference Consortium. Imputation will&#xD;
      be performed using Impute2 software, according to recommended guidelines (Howie et al, 2011).&#xD;
      In addition to the pathway analysis, an overall association analysis will be performed to&#xD;
      uncover SNPs associated with DDH. For these analyses, standard quality control and&#xD;
      statistical methods will be used (Purcell et al, 2007). Copy number variations (CNVs) will be&#xD;
      determined using PennCNV (Wang, Li, Hadley et al, 2007) and their association with hip&#xD;
      dysplasia indices will be examined using regression analyses. Given our current sample size,&#xD;
      we have about 50% power to detect a variant in this sample (frequency of 20% of hip&#xD;
      dysplasia, and a similar allele frequency and OR of the top candidate in GDF5). However,&#xD;
      using multiple phenotypes and genetic analyses, we will be able to explore the genetics of&#xD;
      hip dysplasia and hip shape in a unique way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological Pathway Analyses: The use of conventional genome-wide association methods does not&#xD;
      fully explore the potentially complicated relationships between genetic variants, or between&#xD;
      the proteins resulting from the genetic variants. Pathway- and network-based analysis methods&#xD;
      have been developed to help address this problem ((e.g. Wang, Li, Bucan et al 2007; Torkamani&#xD;
      et al 2008; Baranzini et al 2009; Eleftherohorinou et al 2009; Perry et al 2009; Peng et al&#xD;
      2010). These methods typically combine evidence of multiple genes/SNPs within a particular&#xD;
      biological pathway, in order to establish if a pathway may be implicated in the development&#xD;
      of a phenotype. Permutation methods are often employed to assess the significance in these&#xD;
      analyses. This type of analysis may also help to interpret the biological meaning of&#xD;
      association signals. This approach will allow the exploration of the relative contributions&#xD;
      of different biological mechanisms possibly underlying DDH, using genetic information to&#xD;
      group genes into putative pathways and relate them to different anatomical and clinical&#xD;
      features of DDH. For the current study, biological pathways will be obtained from established&#xD;
      databases, such as the Gene Ontology and Reactome databases, and other public resources&#xD;
      (Ashburner et al, 2000; Croft et al, 2014). Pathways will be analysed in MAGMA, using the&#xD;
      genome-wide SNP and/or CNV information to identify underlying biological pathways for an&#xD;
      individual radiological index (de Leeuw et al, 2015). Distinctive biological mechanisms&#xD;
      related to radiological indices may be identified through pathway analyses. To date, most&#xD;
      predictors of severe DDH outcome have been based on clinical and x-ray findings, and on&#xD;
      evaluation of the patient's functional impairment. We will, using multivariable prognostic&#xD;
      models, construct a more focused, multivariate model for the prediction of improvement, based&#xD;
      not only on traditional clinical and radiological risk factors but also on novel genetic&#xD;
      information and imaging biomarkers.&#xD;
