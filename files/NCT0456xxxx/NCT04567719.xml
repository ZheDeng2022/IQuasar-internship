  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alteration in the sense of taste is a frequent symptom that is closely linked to chemotherapy&#xD;
      exposure, lowering quality of life and nutritional status. Malnutrition is of particular&#xD;
      concern in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), as malnutrition is associated with many&#xD;
      negative outcomes from radical cystectomy (the surgical procedure in MIBC), which include&#xD;
      higher morbidity, poor wound healing, and higher rate of infections after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is essential to understand taste changes among participants receiving chemotherapy for&#xD;
      MIBC to create future treatment trials.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived strength of taste for the bitter and sweet tastes</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (0-14 days prior to initial chemotherapy) until day of surgery (prior to participant undergoing surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Taste solution testing using Spectrum(TM) Descriptive Analysis Method. Taste perception is measured on an ordinal scale (e.g. Moderate, Strong, Very Strong).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in nutrition status</measure>
    <time_frame>0-14 days prior to initial chemotherapy until (before) day of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA).The PG-SGA Short Form consist of four questions for the participant to rate their weight, food intake, any symptoms they are experiencing and their activity level, with each answer having a numerical correspondence. That score will be combined with the providers health assessment of weight loss, other health conditions that could affect nutrition, any present symptoms and physical exam; again each evaluation will be given a numeric value. The combined scores will determine the participants level of health; with A being well nourished, B being moderate/ suspected malnourished and C being severely malnourished.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in body composition</measure>
    <time_frame>0-14 days prior to initial chemotherapy until (before) day of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Bodystat Quadscan 4000® will measure body fat, lean muscle mass and hydration by placing electrodes on the participants hands and feet. This will show either a resistance or reactance of the electrical flow to determine change in body composition, if any.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TAS2R38 expression in tongue and tumor/ tumor- adjacent tissues</measure>
    <time_frame>0-14 days prior to initial chemotherapy until (before) day of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Tongue scraping and tumor tissue will be collected and tested for TAS2R38 in the DNA, RNA and protein.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences between nutrition status at protocol scheduled visits</measure>
    <time_frame>0-14 days prior to initial chemotherapy until (before) day of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Wilcox signed- rank test will compare each score to determine the changes. The scores will be calculated as either positive or negative numbers. If the total score is positive this will indicate that these measurements are related to taste perception. A negative score will show they are not.</description>
