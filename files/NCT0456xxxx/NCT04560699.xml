    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy of targeted individualised&#xD;
      physiotherapeutic treatment on aromatase inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial asks a critical, previously unaddressed, question of clinical importance about&#xD;
      management of musculoskeletal (MSK) pain secondary to aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment of&#xD;
      hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Many breast cancer survivors taking AIs experience&#xD;
      muscle and/or joint pain, which may cause many to stop taking AIs and may inhibit exercise or&#xD;
      physical activity, despite its known health benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapeutic treatment is considered a standard management strategy for many MSK pain&#xD;
      conditions, in which targeted specific exercise therapy is now as an evidence-based&#xD;
      management strategy with proven effectiveness and patient satisfaction. Thus, referral to&#xD;
      physiotherapy would be a natural strategy in women who experience MSK pain as an adverse&#xD;
      effect to AI therapy. However, it is unclear if physiotherapeutic treatment has similar&#xD;
      effects on AI induced MSK pain as in primary MSK pain. Two systematic review (one with a&#xD;
      meta-analysis) have assessed the effect of different pain management strategies for&#xD;
      AI-induced MSK-pain and found great uncertainty in the effects of exercise, relaxation&#xD;
      techniques and acupuncture. They also found limited evidence on the subject and moderate to&#xD;
      low quality of the studies included. The evidence on the subject is clearly limited but the&#xD;
      need for a treatment option to minimize the side-effects of the AI medication real and&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted individualised physiotherapeutic treatment is tailored for the affected (painful)&#xD;
      tissue/joint/region specifically and is based on extensive experience and evidence from MSK&#xD;
      physiotherapy in rheumatic and orthopedic patient population. Targeted individualised&#xD;
      physiotherapy treatment take into account the individual patient, her constitution, the&#xD;
      painful tissue/region/joint (e.g. its biomechanics, physiological properties, and&#xD;
      inflammatory activity), and is adjusted according to day-to-day variations in pain and&#xD;
      progressed based on the interaction between changes in symptoms and function and tissue&#xD;
      healing. Such approach is expected to yield a greater effect on MSK pain, than a generic&#xD;
      exercise program. Further, targeted treatment programs are delivered by trained&#xD;
      physiotherapists, who have specific clinical training and experience in clinical management&#xD;
      of patient and handling MSK pain, which is also expected to yield better clinical outcomes&#xD;
      than programs delivered by people without clinical training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altogether it is very likely that a targeted physiotherapy treatment will be of significant&#xD;
      benefit to breast cancer survivors with AI induced MSK pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to compare targeted individualized physiotherapeutic treatment and medical care&#xD;
      with medical care alone on aromatase inhibitor associated musculoskeletal pain in female&#xD;
      breast cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that targeted physiotherapeutic treatment and medical care reduces&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain significantly in women with aromatase inhibitor associated&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain when compared to medical care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan is to include 120 participants from the oncology department at Rigshospitalet,&#xD;
      Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will partake in the study for a total of 26 weeks. During the first 12 week the&#xD;
      intervention group will receive the physiotherapeutic treatment twice a week. The medical&#xD;
      care visits are place at the first visit to the clinic, week 13 and week 26.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The plan is to include 120 participants from the oncology department at Rigshospitalet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will partake in the study for a total of 26 weeks. During the first 12 week the&#xD;
      intervention group will receive the physiotherapeutic treatment twice a week. The medical&#xD;
      care visits are place at the first visit to the clinic, week 13 and week 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation of participants and sequence generation The randomization list will be&#xD;
      computer-generated based upon permuted random blocks of variable size (4 to 6 in each block).&#xD;
      The allocation ration will be 1:1 (1 targeted physiotherapeutic treatment (TPT)+ medical care&#xD;
      (MC) for each 1 MC) stratified according to upper or lower MSK pain site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biostatistician or his delegate will develop the randomisation scheme for allocation&#xD;
      subjects to the two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators, study coordinators, clinical staff, study staff, and other personnel directly&#xD;
      involved in the study, will be blinded to the group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and staff involved in the physiotherapy treatment are not blinded to the group&#xD;
      allocation. Information that could potentially unblind otherwise blinded staff will not be&#xD;
      shared, and will be stored in facilities with limited access until the study is completed.&#xD;
      Unblinding of blinded personnel does not preclude the related participants' continued&#xD;
      participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attendance to the physiotherapy sessions and the medical doctor appointments will be recorded&#xD;
      in the case report form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator and clinical staff will monitor each participant for evidence of adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs) throughout the study. The investigator will assess and record any AE in detail&#xD;
      including the date of onset, description, severity, duration and outcome, relationship of the&#xD;
      AE to study treatment, and any action(s) taken. AEs, whether in response to a query, observed&#xD;
      by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the participant will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A participant may withdraw from the study at any time without this impacting on any future&#xD;
      investigations and/or treatments at the site, by the Investigators in this study or by other&#xD;
      staff associated with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant withdraws from the study, the procedures outlined for the closest assessment&#xD;
      visit is sought to be completed within 2 weeks, and preferably prior to the initiation of&#xD;
      another therapy. However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any&#xD;
      new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to treat&#xD;
      the participant's condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion. The investigator may discontinue any&#xD;
      participant's participation for any reason, including an AE, safety concerns or failure to&#xD;
      comply with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be discontinued from the study immediately if any of the following occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory results or AEs, which rule out continuation&#xD;
           of the study treatment, as determined by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure to adhere to the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at any point in time between randomization and the week-26 visit the investigator feels&#xD;
      that the patient's clinical course is not acceptable within the normally applied paradigms of&#xD;
      AIMSS, the patient should be taken out of the study. The clinician's judgment will be&#xD;
      required to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to implement this step or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to avoid any loss to follow-up participants for the efficacy assessment and&#xD;
      meaningful analysis of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator has the right to terminate this study at any time. Reasons may&#xD;
      include the following, but are not restricted to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of events in this or other studies that indicate a potential health hazard&#xD;
           to participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unsatisfactory participant enrolment. Determination of Sample Size This is a superiority&#xD;
           study with the main outcome being change in pain from baseline to end of study (week&#xD;
           13), measured with the BPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given a standard deviation of 2.5 a total sample size of 100 is required to obtain a power of&#xD;
      0.85 (actual power is 0.887) to detect a mean group difference in the change from baseline of&#xD;
      1.5 points at a significance level of 0.05 and using a balanced design (1:1 randomization).&#xD;
      Allowing for drop-outs the study aims at recruiting and randomize 120 participants, which&#xD;
      would yield a power of 0.935 to detect the above difference at the 0.05 level of&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power and sample size analyses were conducted using 'SAS Power and Sample Size' (SAS&#xD;
      Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disposition of participants The number of randomized patients will be summarized as total&#xD;
      using counts and percentages. The number of patients either completing or permanently&#xD;
      discontinuing the study will be summarized using counts and percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the assessment of superiority, the intention-to-treat (ITT) protocol population is used&#xD;
      in the primary analysis, as it is the most conservative approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ITT population consist of all randomized patients irrespective of whether the patient&#xD;
      actually received study intervention or the patient's compliance with the study protocol, in&#xD;
      the treatment group to which the participant was assigned at randomisation. A patient will be&#xD;
      considered randomised as soon as a treatment is assigned by according to the allocation&#xD;
      sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistical analysis plan that describes the details of the planned statistical analyses&#xD;
      will be produced by the principal investigator and a biostatistician or his delegate before&#xD;
      last patient's last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of changes from baseline and construction of confidence intervals (CI) for&#xD;
      continuous measures will be based on a repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA;&#xD;
      including group as the main factor and baseline measure as covariate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Superiority will be claimed if the computed 95% confidence interval of the estimated group&#xD;
      difference in the change from baseline in the BPI does not include 0 in the ITT population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical tests will be two-sided and statistical significance will be claimed if the&#xD;
      computed p-value is equal to or less than 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use paper case report forms (CRF) and an in-house custom built electronic data&#xD;
      capture system (Cirkeline) and REDCap (internet survey system for the 6-week assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paper based CRF allows for on the go registration of participation in the TPT + MC group as&#xD;
      well as registration from the structured interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cirkeline allows individual patients to supply questionnaire data at clinical visits via&#xD;
      touch-screens in the clinic, as well as entering of study related data by the staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REDCap allows the participants to fill out the questionnaires from home via a secure web&#xD;
      browser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the trial, all data will be merged and stored in a database created by the&#xD;
      Parker Institutes database manager.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The applications meet all regulatory standards and allow management of all activities related&#xD;
      to clinical trials that ensures optimal resource use and safety according to good clinical&#xD;
      practice and data protection legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulatory Standards Participant confidentiality Participant medical information obtained by&#xD;
      this study is confidential, and disclosure to third parties other than those noted below is&#xD;
      prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the participant's permission, medical information may be shared with his or her personal&#xD;
      physician or with other medical personnel responsible for the participant's welfare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the data from this study are published, the presentation format will not include names,&#xD;
      recognizable photos, personal information or other data which compromises the anonymity of&#xD;
      participating participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in accordance with the Data Protection Act and follow the General&#xD;
      Data Protection Regulation. The study data management and data security procedures is&#xD;
      approved by the Regional Knowledge Centre on Data Protection Compliance on behalf of the&#xD;
      Danish Data Protection agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be entered into a study database for analysis and reporting. Any data captured&#xD;
      electronically will be stored electronically in a separate database according to standard&#xD;
      procedures at The Parker Institute. Upon completion of data entry, the databases will be&#xD;
      checked to ensure acceptable accuracy and completeness. System backups and record retention&#xD;
      for the study data will be consistent with The Parker Institute standard procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
