  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects enrolled in this study are eligible for the seasonal influenza vaccine. The purpose&#xD;
      of this research study is to figure out if increasing individuals' awareness of the benefits&#xD;
      of herd immunity, specifically to the local pediatric oncology community, can improve&#xD;
      vaccination uptake rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify associations with influenza vaccine hesitancy,&#xD;
      including parental demographics and altruism score, in families with healthy children&#xD;
      attending two pediatric practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, in the cohort of families with baseline vaccine hesitancy, to assess the effectiveness&#xD;
      of a pilot educational intervention focusing on the development of herd immunity for&#xD;
      pediatric oncology patients by measuring:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The change in vaccine hesitancy scores pre- and post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The rate of influenza vaccine uptake compared to historic controls from previous&#xD;
           influenza seasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another aim is to explore the relationship between baseline influenza vaccine hesitancy rates&#xD;
      and baseline altruism scores. Effectiveness of this intervention is dependent on parental&#xD;
      altruism levels; therefore, the study team also seeks to determine if there is an association&#xD;
      between parental altruism and vaccine hesitancy for their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-arm prospective cohort study. The study will enroll legal guardians of&#xD;
      children who are influenza vaccine-eligible to measure their vaccine hesitancy scores,&#xD;
      altruism scores, and the impact of an educational intervention focused on herd immunity on&#xD;
      the guardians' vaccine hesitancy score.&#xD;
