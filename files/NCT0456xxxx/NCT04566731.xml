    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study in which subjects with the&#xD;
      non-fluent/agrammatic and semantic variants of primary progressive aphasia (naPPA and svPPA,&#xD;
      respectively) will undergo language testing and structural and functional brain imaging&#xD;
      before and after receiving 10 semi-consecutive daily sessions of real or sham transcranial&#xD;
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with modified constraint-induced language therapy&#xD;
      (mCILT). Language testing and brain imaging will be repeated immediately after completion of&#xD;
      and up-to 24 weeks following completion of treatment. The investigators will examine changes&#xD;
      in language performance induced by tDCS + mCILT compared to sham tDCS + mCILT. The&#xD;
      investigators will also use network science to analyze brain imaging (fMRI) data to identify&#xD;
      network properties associated with baseline PPA severity and tDCS-induced changes in&#xD;
      performance. This study will combine knowledge gained from our behavioral, imaging, and&#xD;
      network data in order to determine the relative degrees to which these properties predict&#xD;
      whether persons with PPA will respond to intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The central framework for the project is a double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study in&#xD;
      which subjects with the non-fluent/agrammatic and semantic variants of primary progressive&#xD;
      aphasia (naPPA and svPPA, respectively) will undergo language testing and structural and&#xD;
      functional brain imaging before and after receiving 10 semi-consecutive daily sessions of&#xD;
      real or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with modified&#xD;
      constraint-induced language therapy (mCILT). Language testing and brain imaging will be&#xD;
      repeated immediately after completion of and up-to 24 weeks following completion of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with naPPA and svPPA will be randomized to one of two study arms: tDCS+mCILT or sham&#xD;
      stimulation+mCILT paired with pre- and post-stimulation imaging and behavioral measures.&#xD;
      Equal numbers of subjects with naPPA and svPPA will be randomized to the tDCS + mCILT and&#xD;
      sham + mCILT study arms. The study is double-blinded, in that neither the subject nor the&#xD;
      study personnel administering tDCS or sham stimulation will know which arm of the study the&#xD;
      subject has been randomized into. Study coordinators will administer tDCS by entering a&#xD;
      pre-determined code that has been programmed into the device by another member of the study&#xD;
      team. Data will be digitally audio-recorded and analyzed off-line, such that study team&#xD;
      members performing data coding and analysis will likewise be blinded to the treatment&#xD;
      condition of each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject participation in this protocol will occur during 36 planned visits that will span&#xD;
      approximately 12 months. The events of the study visits are described below:&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)</intervention_name>
    <description>tDCS is a type of non-invasive brain stimulation in which small electrical currents are applied to the scalp via 2 electrodes. The current, 1.5 mA, is approximately of the same intensity as the current provided by a 9-volt battery. To deliver the current, electrodes that are placed in saline soaked sponges. They will be attached to the left side of your head; they will be held in place with an elastic cap. For both real and sham stimulation the electrodes will be placed on the scalp.</description>

    <description>tDCS is a type of non-invasive brain stimulation in which small electrical currents are applied to the scalp via 2 electrodes. During sham stimulation, the current, 1.5 mA, will be delivered for a short amount of time and then turn-off. To deliver the current, electrodes that are placed in saline soaked sponges. They will be attached to the left side of your head; they will be held in place with an elastic cap. For both real and sham stimulation the electrodes will be placed on the scalp. Most people cannot tell the difference between real and sham stimulation.</description>

    <intervention_name>Modified Contraint-Induced Language Therapy (mCILT)</intervention_name>
    <description>Modified constraint-induced language therapy (mCILT) is a behavioral language therapy that invokes use-dependent learning in communicative interactions by requiring spoken output and restricting use of alternative forms of communication, such as gestures, as a substitute for spoken output. Other key elements of CILT include massed practice of goal-directed speech and shaping of desired responses by increasing response demands as participants improve. MCILT differs from traditional constraint-induced language therapy (CILT) in three ways: 1) it will be done as an individual therapy with the examiner in the role of a communication partner; 2) treatment will be delivered in short sessions (1 hour rather than a more typical 3-4 hour session); 3) targeting nouns + semantically related verbs to generate noun + verb phrases in treatment, a modification that may be better suited to addressing syntactic structure.</description>
