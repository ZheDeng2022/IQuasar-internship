  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to investigate a potential mechanism of successful CBT for panic&#xD;
      disorder, i.e., the reduction of excessive anxious apprehension and fear responses to&#xD;
      panic-related body symptoms in the context of CBT treatment. In the present non-randomized&#xD;
      interventional study, effects of cognitive behavior therapy on reported symptoms and fear&#xD;
      responses to panic-related body symptoms are investigated. It is expected that symptom&#xD;
      improvement during CBT is associated with a decrease in the activation of the brain's fear&#xD;
      network to panic-related body symptoms.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Changes in fear responses to body symptoms in the course of CBT are investigated in patients&#xD;
      with PD by applying a highly standardized hyperventilation task (provoking panic-related body&#xD;
      symptoms) prior to and after a manualized CBT or a waiting period. Activation of the brain's&#xD;
      fear network (defensive activation) is indexed by the potentiation of the startle eyeblink&#xD;
      response.&#xD;

    <description>The Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) is self-rating assessing panic disorder and agoraphobia severity with five factor analytic derived subscale scores (panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobic avoidance, health concerns, functional impairment) and a total score indicating the global severity. The questionnaire was specifically developed for monitoring changes during psychotherapy or psychopharmacological treatments. Total score range: 0 to 57. Higher scores indicate worse severity of panic symptomatology.</description>
