    <textblock>
      With an incidence of more than 11,600 new cases per year in France and an annual number of&#xD;
      deaths close to the incidence rate, adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is a public health&#xD;
      problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the predictive value of response to the 1st line of&#xD;
      chemotherapy of mutated KRAS ctDNA (circulating tumor DNA) in unresectable metastatic or&#xD;
      locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinomas.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      With an incidence of more than 11,600 new cases per year in France and an annual number of&#xD;
      deaths close to the incidence rate, adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is a public health problem&#xD;
      especially since there is a significant increase in its incidence. incidence (+ 417% between&#xD;
      1980 and 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most often diagnosed late, pancreatic adenocarcinoma is managed at a metastatic stage in 60&#xD;
      to 70% of cases with a very poor prognosis (8.7 to 11.1 months median survival with current&#xD;
      chemotherapies). The first line of chemotherapy therefore represents a major issue in the&#xD;
      management of these unresectable patients. There are few predictive markers of response to&#xD;
      chemotherapy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. It is conventionally evaluated by scanner every 2&#xD;
      to 3 months. The response to chemotherapy is associated with a good prognosis while&#xD;
      non-response has a poor prognosis and requires a 2nd line of treatment if the patient is able&#xD;
      to receive it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A KRAS mutation is present in approximately 70-90% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Its&#xD;
      research on tissue sampling (fine needle aspiration or anatomo-pathological specimen) is not&#xD;
      carried out routinely because no prognostic or predictive value of KRAS mutations has been&#xD;
      demonstrated. New high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques have been developed and now allow&#xD;
      a blood sample to detect and quantify circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), including KRAS&#xD;
      mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very few studies have investigated the change in cDNA levels during 1st line chemotherapy in&#xD;
      unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the predictive value of response to the 1st line of&#xD;
      chemotherapy of mutated KRAS cDNA in unresectable metastatic or locally advanced pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
