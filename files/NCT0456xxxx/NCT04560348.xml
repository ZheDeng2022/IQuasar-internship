    <textblock>
      University students are vulnerable to mental health problems due to the various challenges&#xD;
      they have to face in university life. However, few studies have been conducted to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of university counseling programs in Hong Kong. This project aims at&#xD;
      developing and systematically evaluating a culturally adapted and adventure-based cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral intervention (aCBI) program to decrease psychological distress and improve various&#xD;
      mental health outcomes for Chinese university students in Hong Kong. The aCBI program was&#xD;
      delivered in a form of general education course in a university setting. Single group&#xD;
      Pre-posttest design was adopted.The program was evaluated its effectiveness in reducing&#xD;
      psychological distress, perceived stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, negative thoughts&#xD;
      and negative emotions and increasing positive thoughts and positive emotions.&#xD;
