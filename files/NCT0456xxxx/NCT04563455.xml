  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between grip endurance, disability&#xD;
      of upper extremity and quality of life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper extremity functions affect the quality of life at different levels in patients with&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the current literature; it has been shown that grip endurance&#xD;
      is associated with upper limb functions. However, there is no study investigating the&#xD;
      relationship between grip endurance and quality of life in patients with RA. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate the relationship between grip endurance, disability of upper&#xD;
      extremity, and quality of life in patients with RA.&#xD;
