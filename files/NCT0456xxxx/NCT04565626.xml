  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During an acute hospitalization, deconditioning from decreased mobility can lead to&#xD;
      functional decline. Muscle weakness can lead to frailty, which is linked to falls,&#xD;
      immobility, rehospitalisation, institutionalization, and mortality. Many elderly do not&#xD;
      regain muscle mass similar to prior to hospitalization and are discharged with worse than&#xD;
      baseline function. Early mobilization and physical rehabilitation can improve or prevent loss&#xD;
      of function in hospitalized patients. Weekend physiotherapy ensures gains made in mobility&#xD;
      during the week are maintained, however, the benefit of additional weekend physiotherapy on&#xD;
      acutely hospitalized Internal Medicine adult patients remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given this uncertainty, the investigators propose a randomized controlled trial pilot study&#xD;
      to examine the outcomes of additional unsupervised physiotherapy. Patients randomized to&#xD;
      intervention would receive a Medical Exercise Bike Pedal Exerciser to allow for an additional&#xD;
      20 minutes a day of un-supervised physiotherapy both during the week and on weekends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deconditioning will be measured for all study participants while hospitalized. After hospital&#xD;
      discharge, patients will be telephoned on post-discharge day 3, to assess patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and quality of life, and post-discharge day 30 to collect data regarding&#xD;
      clinical outcomes (ER visits, re-hospitalizations, and falls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that it is feasible and safe to have additional unsupervised&#xD;
      physiotherapy in the elderly population hospitalized for an acute illness on a medical ward&#xD;
      and that this will result in improvement in function at discharge due to decreased hospital&#xD;
      acquired deconditioning with improved mobility, quality of life and subsequent decreased&#xD;
      readmission for falls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      After obtaining written informed consent from eligible patients, study staff will randomize&#xD;
      patients, collect demographics and hospital admission details from patients' hospital charts,&#xD;
      and complete the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) for all patients. The CCI will be completed&#xD;
      using information gathered from patients' hospital chart. They will then perform the Barthel&#xD;
      Index (BI) and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) to determine a baseline physical&#xD;
      ability of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BI measures the extent to which patients can function independently and has mobility in&#xD;
      their activities of daily living (ADL). The SPPB is a group of measures that combines the&#xD;
      results of the gait speed, chair stand and balance tests (Guralnik et al., 2000). It has been&#xD;
      used as a predictive tool for possible disability and can aid in the monitoring of function&#xD;
      in older people. The Charlson Comorbidity Index categorizes and scores the comorbidities of&#xD;
      patients. The CCI can be used to predict short term and long-term outcomes such as function,&#xD;
      hospital length of stay and mortality rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target sample size will be 75. This will be divided between intervention and no&#xD;
      intervention (control). Patients will be allocated to either intervention with peddle bike&#xD;
      for additional unsupervised exercise or current standard of care as control group.&#xD;
      Randomization will be done using RedCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to intervention would receive a Medical Exercise Bike Pedal Exerciser&#xD;
      Mini Peddler to allow for an additional 20 minutes a day of un-supervised physiotherapy both&#xD;
      during the week and on weekends. Patients would be provided with an information pamphlet on&#xD;
      the benefits of staying active during a hospitalization. Each bike will have an LCD monitor&#xD;
      to keep track of patient use. They will receive a short teaching session on how to properly&#xD;
      use the bike and record their use in their log. Exercise time (in minutes), distance (in&#xD;
      kilometers) and calories will be recorded off the bike LCD monitor after each session and&#xD;
      recorded in the patient's daily exercise log. They will also be assisted with follow-up&#xD;
      meetings with the research therapist, and the involvement of the family (if available) from&#xD;
      the outset, which has previously been shown to improve compliance. Patients randomized to the&#xD;
      Bike Pedal Exerciser intervention will be assessed daily by the study staff &amp; the medical&#xD;
      team to ensure patients remain safe for use of the bike.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants (both intervention and control) will receive a Stepwatch to monitor their&#xD;
      activity. This will be worn at all times in the study with the purpose to measure overall&#xD;
      activity between the two groups. The investigators will manually remove the activity of the&#xD;
      peddle bike from their overall activity in the intervention group to give a baseline activity&#xD;
      rate. This will be to monitor for baseline activity in both groups and ensure that the&#xD;
      intervention participants are not substituting the peddle bike for usual daily activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deconditioning will be measured for all study participants on study day 3 and study day 6 (or&#xD;
      the day of discharge) using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test and Short Physical Performance&#xD;
      Battery. For the TUG, patients will be asked to stand up from a chair, walk three metres,&#xD;
      turn around, and walk back to the chair and sit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After hospital discharge the research staff will follow up with all patients for 2 brief&#xD;
      telephone interviews. On day 3 after discharge, Patient Satisfaction surveys* will be&#xD;
      conducted by to assess patient satisfaction with their experience with their hospital stay &amp;&#xD;
      Peddle Bike program. They will also conduct the European Quality of Life, 5 dimensions*&#xD;
      (EQ-5D-5 L) instrument to assess quality of life. At 30 days after randomization, the&#xD;
      research staff will contact patients to conduct a brief interview consisting of: a functional&#xD;
      status assessment (Barthel Index) and to collect data regarding clinical outcomes (ER visits,&#xD;
      re-hospitalizations, and falls). Each telephone interview is expected to last approximately&#xD;
      10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peddle bikes will remain in a patient's room for the duration of their hospitalization and/or&#xD;
      enrollment and will be cleaned between patient use to decrease risk of contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are assessed daily by their medical team as part of their standard care when&#xD;
      hospitalized. If the team flags the patient as being incapable of using the peddle bike&#xD;
      safely (i.e. patient is delirious or aggressive), the patient will be removed from the study.&#xD;
