    <textblock>
      This project is focused on Veteran patients 65 and older with chronic pain. In this project,&#xD;
      the investigators will understand the impact of a contextual patient generated data (PGD).&#xD;
      Contextual PGD are data about what is important to patients, information about the Veterans&#xD;
      social and home contexts (for example, how the Veterans medications are stored and how much&#xD;
      help they receive from others). In this study the investigators will talk with Veterans with&#xD;
      chronic pain and the Veterans informal caregivers (family members or friends who help them)&#xD;
      and find out about how they are coping with chronic pain and what information might be&#xD;
      helpful to provide to the Veterans healthcare team. Then, the investigators will talk to&#xD;
      clinicians about information that might be helpful to them. The investigators will collect&#xD;
      contextual PGD and use it to develop a computer application for collecting contextual PGD and&#xD;
      displaying it to patients and doctors in a visit. The investigators will also test the impact&#xD;
      of having contextual PGD in a visit on patient satisfaction with the Veterans care plan and&#xD;
      how well they are able to follow the care plan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators proposal addresses the use of patient generated data (PGD) - an innovative&#xD;
      approach to deliver patient centered care to older Veterans that is characterized by&#xD;
      attention to patient priorities, values, and goals. The investigators clinical focus is on&#xD;
      chronic pain in older Veterans, which is widespread. PGD broadly encompasses many sources and&#xD;
      types of data. The investigators will categorize contextual PGD into 3 core components 1)&#xD;
      relational PGD (patient-clinician relationship and patient individual differences such as&#xD;
      pain catastrophizing) 2) whole person PGD (what matters to the patient including patient&#xD;
      preferences), and 3) behavioral PGD (pain self-efficacy and patient actions related to health&#xD;
      , pain management, functional status). The investigators study is mixed methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In aim 1 the investigators will: Prioritize content for contextual PGD profile displays to&#xD;
      support patient centered care for geriatric Veterans with chronic pain. The investigators&#xD;
      will conduct focus groups with geriatric Veterans with chronic pain and the Veterans&#xD;
      caregivers to explore Veterans' perspectives on the content of the PGD profile displays and&#xD;
      the Veterans attitudes toward them. The investigators will conduct focus groups with&#xD;
      clinicians about desired content of the PGD profile displays specific to pain management. The&#xD;
      investigators will iteratively prioritize PGD elements in accordance with pain care&#xD;
      management needs of geriatric patients, incorporating results of a card sort exercise&#xD;
      performed by clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In aim 2 the investigators will :Develop a prototype contextual PGD profile display and&#xD;
      evaluate its usability. The investigators will develop a prototype clinician-facing PGD&#xD;
      profile display containing PGD elements and guides to interpretation/use for clinicians. The&#xD;
      investigators will refine the PGD profile display prototype with clinicians in user-centered&#xD;
      design sessions. The investigators will broadly assess usability in a simulation study with&#xD;
      primary care clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In aim 3 the investigators will: Examine the impact of contextual PGD profile displays on&#xD;
      patient adherence, pain function, satisfaction, and shared decision making in a randomized&#xD;
      trial. The investigators will evaluate operationalization of the pain care plan and the&#xD;
      shared decision making processin the visit by coding study visit recordings. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess the impact of contextual PGD by comparing patient adherence to pain&#xD;
      care regimens, pain function, patient satisfaction, and shared decision making process for a&#xD;
      sample of 150 geriatric patients with chronic pain in VA primary care clinics. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare between-subjects visits that include access to contextual PGD&#xD;
      profile displays to visits without access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators primary hypothesis is that access to contextual PGD profile displays during&#xD;
      a clinical visit will result in better adherence to the pain care plan at 30 days, compared&#xD;
      with no PGD profile display.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the project the investigators will work with stakeholders in clinic settings and&#xD;
      implementation of the electronic health record to ensure future implementation can be&#xD;
      optimized.&#xD;
