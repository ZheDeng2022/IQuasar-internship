  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active comparator-controlled phase Ⅲ trial&#xD;
      using non-inferior design. A total of 290 patients with prostate cancer who were suitable for&#xD;
      endocrine therapy were enrolled into the screening period from D-21 to D-10 before&#xD;
      administration. Eligible subjects were treated with bicalutamide tablets (Casodex®, 50&#xD;
      mg/day) from D-10 (± 3d) before administration and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive&#xD;
      LY01005 3.6 mg or ZOLADEX® 3.6 mg after completion of pretreatment. All subjects were&#xD;
      administered once every 28 days for three doses until intolerable toxicity, disease&#xD;
      progression requiring other anti-tumor treatments, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up,&#xD;
      death or the end of the whole study. Blood samples were collected at the specified time&#xD;
      points of the screening period, before/behind each dose to detect serum testosterone, LH, FSH&#xD;
      and PSA. Safety evaluation (including vital signs, physical examination, laboratory tests, 12&#xD;
      ECG, adverse events, etc.) was conducted as required in the protocol.&#xD;
