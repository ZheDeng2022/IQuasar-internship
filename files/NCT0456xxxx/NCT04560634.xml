  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and rationale: The best agent to prevent spinal-induced hypotension is still&#xD;
      uncertain but norepinephrine showed fewer effects on heart rate and cardiac output. In septic&#xD;
      patients norepinephrine has been shown to produce an &quot;endogenous fluid challenge&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: We aim to assess if patients with impaired diastolic function (46% of pregnant&#xD;
      women at term) are less able to maintain indexed cardiac output in response to norepinephrine&#xD;
      infusion during spinal-induced vasoplegia. We also aim to assess if fetal wellbeing is&#xD;
      related to maternal cardiac output during spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We will assess by echocardiogram the diastolic function before surgery and will then&#xD;
      start continuous non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring with a ClearSight® monitor (ClearSight®,&#xD;
      Edwards Lifescience, Irvine, CA) and perform a fluid challenge to relate diastolic&#xD;
      disfunction with fluid responsiveness. Hemodynamic monitoring will continue throughout the&#xD;
      surgery. Norepinephrine infusion will start concomitantly to beginning of spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      and will stop 5 minutes after uterotonic medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: We aim to assess if patients with diastolic disfunction are less able to maintain&#xD;
      cardiac output in response to norepinephrine infusion during spinal anesthesia induced&#xD;
      vasoplegia. We also aim to assess if fetal wellbeing is related to maternal cardiac output&#xD;
      during spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery.)&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Norepinephrine</intervention_name>
    <description>Norepinephrine is administered as a continuous infusion at 0.05 mcg/kg/min and is kept to maintain systolic blood pressure within 90-120% of baseline during spinal anaesthesia. The infusion is started at the same time cerebrospinal fluid is obtained, immediately before injection of spinal medications, through a small-bore tubing connected directly to the peripheral intravenous catheter. It is stopped 5 minutes</description>

    <description>All patients are connected to a ClearSight® monitor (ClearSight®, Edwards Lifescience, Irvine, CA) by an inflatable finger cuff placed on the midphalanx of hand middle or ring finger with no radial artery catheter and its heart reference system (HRS) is zeroed at the level of the patient's midaxillary line.&#xD;
The ClearSight® monitoring is started in the pre-anaesthesia room and calibrated for 5 minutes before recording. The monitoring continues throughout the procedure until patient transfer in the recovery room. All data are anonymously collected on a USB pen for statistical analysis.</description>
