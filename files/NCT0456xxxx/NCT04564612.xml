    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are: to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of&#xD;
      BIIB091 modified release (MR) formulations in healthy participants after single dose&#xD;
      administration in the fasted state (Part 1); to evaluate the PK profile of the BIIB091&#xD;
      immediate release (IR) tablet formulation in healthy participants after single dose&#xD;
      administration (Part 1B); to determine the relative bioavailability of single doses of the&#xD;
      selected BIIB091 regimen in healthy participants taking a proton pump inhibitor (PPI)&#xD;
      compared to healthy participants not taking a PPI, to determine the relative bioavailability&#xD;
      of single doses of the selected BIIB091 regimen in healthy participants taking a cytochrome&#xD;
      P450 (CYP)3A4 inhibitor compared to healthy participants not taking a CYP3A4 inhibitor (Part&#xD;
      2); to evaluate the PK of the selected BIIB091 regimen in healthy participants after multiple&#xD;
      dose administration (Part 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are: to determine the relative bioavailability of a&#xD;
      single dose of the BIIB091 MR formulations compared to that of the IR drug in capsule (DiC)&#xD;
      reference formulation in healthy participants in the fasted state, to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of single doses of BIIB091 when administered as MR formulations in healthy&#xD;
      participants in the fasted state (Part 1); to determine the PK of a single dose of the&#xD;
      BIIB091 IR tablet formulation in the fed and fasted state in healthy participants, to&#xD;
      evaluate the PK profiles of the BIIB091 IR tablet formulation in healthy participants after&#xD;
      administration of divided total daily doses over a 24 hour period in the fasted or fed state,&#xD;
      to determine the relative bioavailability of a single dose or divided dose of the BIIB091 IR&#xD;
      tablet formulation compared to that of the IR DiC reference formulation in healthy&#xD;
      participants in the fasted state, to determine the PK of a single or divided dose of the&#xD;
      BIIB091 IR tablet formulation administered with an alternative meal composition in healthy&#xD;
      participants, to assess the safety and tolerability of a single or divided dose of BIIB091&#xD;
      when administered as the IR tablet formulation and IR DiC reference formulation in healthy&#xD;
      participants in fed or fasted state (Part 1B); to confirm the PK profiles of the selected&#xD;
      BIIB091 regimen in healthy participants after single dose administration, and to establish a&#xD;
      reference exposure for the assessment of drug interaction, to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of single doses of BIIB091 when administered as the selected BIIB091 regimen in&#xD;
      healthy participants taking a PPI, to assess the safety and tolerability of single doses of&#xD;
      BIIB091 when administered as the selected BIIB091 regimen in healthy participants taking a&#xD;
      CYP3A4 inhibitor (Part 2); to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of BIIB091&#xD;
      when administered as the selected BIIB091 regimen in healthy participants (Part 3).&#xD;
