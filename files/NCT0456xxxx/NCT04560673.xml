  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how well duloxetine and neurofeedback training work in&#xD;
      treating patients with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy. Duloxetine is a type of&#xD;
      serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that increases the amount of certain&#xD;
      chemicals in the brain that help relieve depression and peripheral neuropathy. Neurofeedback&#xD;
      training is a type of therapy that uses an electroencephalograph (EEG) and a computer&#xD;
      software program to measure brain wave activity and may help teach patients with peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy (nerve damage) how to change their own brain waves to lower their feelings of&#xD;
      neuropathy and help improve their overall quality of life. Giving duloxetine and&#xD;
      neurofeedback training may work better in treating peripheral neuropathy caused by&#xD;
      chemotherapy compared to duloxetine or neurofeedback training alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine if the combination of duloxetine (DL) and neurofeedback (NFB) is superior to DL&#xD;
      or NFB alone in treating chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the optimal number of neurofeedback sessions needed to result in long-term&#xD;
      relief of CIPN in a large cohort of cancer survivors and across socioeconomic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Examine baseline brain signatures as a predictor of response to neurofeedback (NFB) and&#xD;
      to duloxetine and determine who will require more sessions of NFB to achieve relief of&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Examine if the combination of DL + NFB (than those getting DL or NFB alone) or a larger&#xD;
      number of NFB sessions results in better improvements in cancer-related symptoms, physical&#xD;
      functioning, and quality of life (QOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive neurofeedback training over 1 hour each 3-5 times weekly for up to&#xD;
      5 weeks. Patients also receive duloxetine orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 5 weeks in the&#xD;
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive neurofeedback training session over 1 hour 3-5 times weekly for up&#xD;
      to 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP III: Patients receive duloxetine PO QD for 5 weeks in the absence of unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>The primary analysis will be a linear model comparing the mean difference in the change of the unpleasantness subscale of the (PQAS)Pain Quality Assessment Scale from baseline to the end of treatment (5 weeks) between the combination arm, the duloxetine (DL), and the neurofeedback (NFB) arm while adjusting for the stratification factor.

    <measure>Change in PQAS unpleasantness score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 5 up to week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Will use analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to evaluate whether chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) differs across the three subgroups with 0, 10 or 15 additional sessions of NFB, among the participants from the NFB + DL group who report at least 1-point clinical improvement in CIPN at week 5. The analysis will adjust for the baseline outcome (at week 5), time with CIPN symptoms (minimization factor), and other covariates such as age, sex, cancer stage, time since diagnosis, and cancer type, as appropriate. Pain Quality Assessment Scale (0-10) 0-No pain-10 Most Intense Pain Imaginable.</description>
