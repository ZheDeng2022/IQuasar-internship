  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor impairment is one of the most common result of a stroke, which causes disability and&#xD;
      difficulties in activities of daily living. This motor impairment can concern the upper limb&#xD;
      or the lower limb, or both. Several studies investigates the efficacy of different treatment&#xD;
      approaches on upper limb and hand function. None of them combined exercise in a virtual&#xD;
      context with Action Observation Therapy, consisting in watching an action before doing it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the addition of Action Observation Therapy (AOT) to Virtual Reality (VR)&#xD;
      in the rehabilitation of upper limb impairment in subacute stroke patients. Half of&#xD;
      participants will see a video demonstrating the exercise to be performed before its actual&#xD;
      execution, while the other half will see a video of a natural landscape followed by the same&#xD;
      exercises the other group performs. All the patients will receive additional usual treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the intervention will be conducted using a system composed by multiple&#xD;
      devices, which are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HTC Vive (HTC, headset e Steam station): three-dimensional viewer used for the&#xD;
           implementation of the immersive virtual environment, allows both the visualization of&#xD;
           the videos and of the exercises to be performed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leap Motion Controller (infrared camera): contactless device for tracking the movement&#xD;
           of the patient's fingers and hand;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Zed Mini (RGB binocular camera and depth camera): Stereo Labs' Zed Mini stereoscopic&#xD;
           camera is mounted on the HTC Vive viewer to allow virtual elements to be overlapped&#xD;
           within the environment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cometa Wavetrack (transmitter/receiver and Inertial Measurement Units): system for upper&#xD;
           limb movement tracking through the use of four wireless inertial sensors applied to the&#xD;
           chest, to the arm and to the forearm of the participant through elastic bands and to the&#xD;
           hand of the participant through skin-compatible double-sided adhesive patches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the devices have been tested to ensure safety of the participants and are provided with&#xD;
      the appropriate documentation of declaration of conformity according to the European&#xD;
      reference regulations. A careful risk analysis was carried out to ensure the safety of the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the devices will be working simultaneously during each session of treatment. For the&#xD;
      experimental group, the instrumentation will be used to see the video of the exercises that&#xD;
      the participants will be later asked to perform and to actually perform them; in the control&#xD;
      group, it will be used to see a video of a natural landscape with a 180° perspective and to&#xD;
      perform the same exercises than the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The devices will be used both for the execution of the exercises both to collect information&#xD;
      listed in the outcomes section as secondary outcomes: in particular, these information will&#xD;
      be provided by the Leap Motion and by the Cometa Wavetrack devices.&#xD;

Reaching and grasping: the participant is requested to grab a wooden cube with the paretic hand and place it into a bowl positioned in front of him; the cube will appear in a different place every time;&#xD;
Goalkeeper: the participant is requested to block a ball coming towards him with the paretic hand; the ball will appear in a different place every time;&#xD;
Occupational task: the participant is requested to grab four cans, one at time, with the paretic hand and place them on four targets placed on a hemispherical arch.&#xD;
Each exercise provides six levels of increasing difficulty.</description>
