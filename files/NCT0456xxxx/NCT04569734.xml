  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this multi-center study will be to assess the feasibility and safety of left&#xD;
      atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion with the WATCHMANâ„¢ device using a standardized&#xD;
      intra-procedural intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) protocol under moderate sedation for&#xD;
      procedural guidance. By eliminating the need for general anesthesia, the hope is to show a&#xD;
      reduction in procedural time, decrease use of supplemental invasive procedures (central&#xD;
      venous line, invasive arterial pressure monitoring and transesophageal echocardiography) and&#xD;
      quicker patient recovery time. This approach can decrease healthcare resource utilization and&#xD;
      safely simplify left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a prospective, non-randomized multicenter registry of 100 patients&#xD;
      undergoing LAA closure with the WATCHMAN device (possibly with WATCHMAN FLX when approved)&#xD;
      utilizing an intra-procedural ICE probe under moderate sedation. The primary feasibility&#xD;
      endpoint will be ability to successfully implant the WATCHMAN device. Implant success is&#xD;
      defined as confirmation of the device-specified release PASS (Position, Anchor, Size, Seal)&#xD;
      criteria, successful device release, and adequate seal (defined as a residual leak &lt;5 mm) as&#xD;
      assessed by a core lab interpretation of the TEE 45 days post-implant. The primary safety&#xD;
      endpoint will be a composite of major complications (major bleeding [intracranial bleeding,&#xD;
      or bleeding requiring blood transfusion], pericardial effusion requiring pericardiocentesis&#xD;
      or surgery, device embolization, procedural-related stroke, or procedural related death).&#xD;
      Additional measured end points will be: freedom from conversion to general anesthesia and/or&#xD;
      standard TEE during implant, the incidence and the size of iatrogenic atrial septal defect on&#xD;
      45 day TEE. The ICE procedural images will also be collected and analyzed by an independent&#xD;
      committee composed of non-implanting interventionalist, and an imaging specialist. The images&#xD;
      will be graded in quality as optimal (TEE equivalent), acceptable (adequate but not as&#xD;
      detailed as TEE), and inadequate. This prospective study, along with its endpoints will be&#xD;
      registered in clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;
