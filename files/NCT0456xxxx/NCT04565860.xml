    <textblock>
      Composite resins have been widely used in the last years to restore teeth due to increases in&#xD;
      patients' esthetic expectations. Therefore optical and mechanical properties of composite&#xD;
      resins were being developed day by day. Although there have been many in vitro studies about&#xD;
      bulk-fill composite in the literature, the number of clinical trials is insufficient.&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of bulk-fill&#xD;
      composite about placement technique (bulk-filling and incremental techniques) in Class II&#xD;
      carious lesions using the criteria of the World Dental Federation (FDI) and the United States&#xD;

      Composite resins have been widely used in the last years to restore teeth due to increases in&#xD;
      patients' esthetic expectations. Therefore optical and mechanical properties of composite&#xD;
      resins were being developed day by day. Composite resin restorations have the main advantages&#xD;
      such as conservative cavity preparation, preserving healthy dental tissue, and strengthening&#xD;
      the remaining tooth structure. Furthermore, according to clinical studies, high clinical&#xD;
      performance and good longevity have been reported. Traditionally, the composite resins are&#xD;
      placed in increments of 2 mm that are cured separately (incremental technique. The&#xD;
      incremental technique provides sufficient light penetration and monomer conversion. However,&#xD;
      there are many disadvantages to the incremental technique. For instance, bonding failure,&#xD;
      blood, or saliva contamination of between layers, the difficulty of application in limited&#xD;
      access in small cavities, and to be time-consuming. Because of these, manufacturers have&#xD;
      presented a &quot;bulk-fill composites&quot;, which could be polymerized in a single layer up to 4-5 mm&#xD;
      thick to the market. Bulk-fill composites can be described as composites that are&#xD;
      sufficiently polymerizable in a single layer up to 4 mm thick. Bulk-fill composites that were&#xD;
      introduced in recent years can be manipulated faster and more convenient in the cavity&#xD;
      compared to conventional hybrid composites. In addition, these materials present good&#xD;
      mechanical properties such as marginal adaptation, sealing properties, fracture strength,&#xD;
      wear-resistance, and long-term clinical success. Clinical studies are required to clearly&#xD;
      describe the clinical behavior of the materials. Although there have been many in vitro&#xD;
      studies about bulk-fill composite in the literature, the number of clinical trials is&#xD;
      insufficient. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of&#xD;
      bulk-fill composite about placement technique (bulk-filling and incremental techniques) in&#xD;
      Class II carious lesions using the criteria of the World Dental Federation (FDI) and the&#xD;
