    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bile duct cancer is cancer of the slender tubes of the biliary tract. These tubes carry bile&#xD;
      through the liver. Such cancer tumors often have an abnormal or mutated gene. Researchers&#xD;
      think a mix of drugs can slow the progression of gene-mutated cancers of the biliary tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if using a combination of trametinib and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) increases the period&#xD;
      of time it takes for a person s bile tract carcinoma (BTC) to get worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults age 18 and older with BTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and cancer history.&#xD;
      Their ability to do their normal activities will be assessed. They will have blood and urine&#xD;
      tests. They will give a tumor sample. They will have heart tests. They may talk with a heart&#xD;
      doctor. They may have an eye exam. They may have a tuberculosis test. They will have computer&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. They may have magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) scans of the chest, abdomen, pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will repeat some screening tests throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take HCQ and trametinib tablets by mouth daily in 28-day cycles. They will&#xD;
      have study visits once a month. They will take the drugs until they have bad side effects or&#xD;
      the drugs stop working.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have one more tumor biopsies during the treatment. They will have blood&#xD;
      taken often.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month after treatment ends, participants will have a safety follow-up visit. Then they&#xD;
      will be called or emailed every 6 months for the rest of their life....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Among the new cases of bile tract carcinoma (BTC) that are diagnosed every year in the&#xD;
           United States, there are approximately 6,500 cases of gallbladder carcinoma, 3,000 cases&#xD;
           of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 3,000 cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current treatment options for patients with cholangiocarcinoma are limited and take no&#xD;
           account of the known biological and genetic heterogeneity in these diseases. Median&#xD;
           survival for advanced disease remains poor at approximately 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activating KRAS mutations are frequently detected in all subtypes of BTC and can be&#xD;
           found in up to 40% of BTC, predominantly in perihilar and distal cholangiocarcinoma&#xD;
           (CCA). However, pharmacological inhibition of mutated KRAS has demonstrated little&#xD;
           clinical benefit in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trametinib is a reversible, highly selective allosteric inhibitor of mitogen-activated&#xD;
           extracellular signal regulated kinases MEK1 and MEK2. Tumor cells with KRAS mutations&#xD;
           commonly have hyperactivated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathways in which&#xD;
           activated MEK is a critical component. However, tumors are able to overcome MEK&#xD;
           signaling inhibition by trametinib through upregulation of autophagy pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) inhibits lysosomal acidification and prevents the degradation&#xD;
           of autophagosomes, to suppress autophagy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trametinib has been approved by FDA for the treatment of melanoma as a single agent or&#xD;
           for the treatment of other cancers if tumors carry BRAF mutation. Hydroxychloroquine are&#xD;
           approved for the treatment of malaria, lupus erythematosus and acute or chronic&#xD;
           rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preclinical studies have shown that combined treatment of trametinib plus HCQ elicited&#xD;
           striking tumor regression in animal model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine whether the 5-month progression free survival (PFS) of the trametinib plus&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) combination in subjects with refractory bile tract carcinoma (BTC)&#xD;
      with KRAS mutation exceeds 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histopathological confirmation of BTC or carcinoma highly suggestive of a diagnosis of&#xD;
           BTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor must have KRAS mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection,&#xD;
           transplantation or ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have measurable lesion by RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least two weeks washout period from previous therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG less than or equal to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate renal, hepatic and bone marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The study is open-labeled phase 2 study. It is designed to enroll total 30 patients with&#xD;
      refractory BTC, to test the hypothesis that treatment with a combination of HCQ and&#xD;
      trametinib prevents cancer progression/recurrence. We propose that this combination will have&#xD;
      relative safety profile and antitumor efficacy in BTC patients with KRAS mutation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial because of&#xD;
             their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction&#xD;

                  first dose of study treatment. Muscular activities, such as strenuous exercise,&#xD;

                  investigator (PI) may impair absorption of study drugs)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any other condition that would, in the Investigator s judgment, contraindicate&#xD;
                  the patient s participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or&#xD;
                  compliance with clinical study procedures, e.g., infection/inflammation,&#xD;
                  intestinal obstruction, unable to swallow medication (patients may not receive&#xD;

             cured with undetectable HCV viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known prior severe hypersensitivity to study drugs or any component in its&#xD;
             formulations (CTCAE v5.0 grade &gt;= 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because study therapy can cause fetal&#xD;
             harm. Because there is potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary&#xD;
             to treatment of the mother with study therapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if&#xD;
             the mother is treated with study drugs.&#xD;
