  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, non-randomized and single-center phase II clinical study,&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety, tolerance, and efficacy of Camrelizumab in combination with Apatinib&#xD;
      in patients with Radioactive Iodine-refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (RAIR-DTC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 10 patients who met the study criteria will be enrolled in 1 years and&#xD;
      treated with Camrelizumab plus Apatinib in PUMCH. The investigators will follow up and&#xD;
      collect subjects' data to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment, including objective&#xD;
      response rate (ORR) and Progression-free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS), until&#xD;
      disease progression or death.&#xD;
