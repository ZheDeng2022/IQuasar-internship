      The primary objective of the study is the development of a mathematical model for predicting&#xD;
      potassium kinetics during and after the dialytic session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the definition of a correlation between the kinetics of intra and extra-cellular&#xD;
           concentrations of potassium during and after the dialytic session and the onset of&#xD;
           arrhythmias;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the use of the mathematical model to modify the blood concentration of potassium by&#xD;
           acting on the composition of the dialysis bath in order to minimize the risk of onset of&#xD;
           arrhythmias during and after dialysis.&#xD;

      Type of study: spontaneous interventional, non-pharmacological, exploratory, prospective,&#xD;
      monocentric. Eligible patients undergo hemodialytic treatment associated with the normal&#xD;
      clinical pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into a Period A and a Period B. Period A includes the enrolment phase&#xD;
      (Step 0), the laboratory and instrumental measurement phase (Step 1), the development phase&#xD;
      of the mathematical model of potassium kinetics (Step 2) and the validation phase of the&#xD;
      mathematical model (Step 3). Period B includes the phase of the use of the mathematical model&#xD;
      for modulating the blood concentration of potassium and minimizing the risk of onset of&#xD;
      arrhythmias during and after dialysis (Step 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of 6 evaluable, outpatient patients with chronic kidney&#xD;
      failure who need to perform hemodialysis thrice weekly for their survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of drop out of a patient will be enrolled another patient to arrive at 6 patients&#xD;
      evaluable both at the end of Period A and at the end of Period B of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests will be sent to two laboratories: the Bologna Metropolitan Unique Laboratory&#xD;
      for urea dosing, and the Laboratory of U.O. Nephrology Dialysis and Transplantation for&#xD;
      intracellular potassium dosage and for the dosage of extracellular potassium, sodium,&#xD;
      calcemia, bicarbonatemia, blood sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of intracellular potassium will be carried out by selective ion probe. The&#xD;
      first phase (Step 1) is characterized by the execution of measurements of intra and&#xD;
      extracellular potassium concentration, and the assessment of the concentration of urea, blood&#xD;
      sugar and plasma electrolytes that are closely related to the kinetics of potassium. Body&#xD;
      impedance analysis will be taken at the beginning and end of dialysis to estimate the size of&#xD;
      intra and extracellular volumes in which the solutes are contained and the variation of these&#xD;
      secondary volumes to dehydration obtained through dialytic treatment. During dialysis&#xD;
      starting at 8:00 a.m., measurements will be taken every 30 minutes to estimate how widespread&#xD;
      and convective processes of dialytic treatment affect potassium kinetics. At the same time as&#xD;
      blood samples, 12-derived ECGs will be performed to record cardiac electrical activity in&#xD;
      conjunction with the measurement of the concentration of electrolytes and in particular&#xD;
      extra/intra cellular potassium. Particular attention will be given to the recognition of&#xD;
      rhythm alterations such as premature ventricular or supraventricular contractions,&#xD;
      alterations in corrected QT interval, and the eventual onset of actual arrhythmias. After 60&#xD;
      minutes of the end of dialysis, hourly measurements of urea, blood sugar, intra-and&#xD;
      extracellular potassium, ECG will be repeated. Body impedance analysis will be repeated 60&#xD;
      minutes after the end of dialysis and at the end of the observation period (7:00 p.m.) after&#xD;
      7 hours after the end of dialysis. Measurements after the end of dialysis are necessary to&#xD;
      evaluate the rebound of solutes at the plasma level due to the slow balance between solutes&#xD;
      in the intravascular space and solutes in the extravascular space. Body impedance analysis&#xD;
      after the end of dialysis are necessary to assess whether the redistribution of solutes&#xD;
      between intra and extravascular compartment corresponds to a change in the ratio of&#xD;
      intra-to-extracellular volumes. ECG recordings are also required at this stage at the same&#xD;
      time as blood samples to assess the appearance after dialysis of premature ventricular or&#xD;
      supraventricular contractions, alterations in the corrected QT interval, and the eventual&#xD;
      onset of actual arrhythmias. Such electrocardiographic alterations may be affected by&#xD;
      potassium rebound and can alter the relationship between intracellular and extracellular&#xD;
      potassium. The expected time to complete the measurement phase on all 6 patients enrolled is&#xD;
      4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled in the study will undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hemodialytic therapy using 240-minute hemodiafiltration with on line reinfusion of the&#xD;
           endogenous ultrafiltrate (HFR) on Flexya® hemodialysis machine (Medtronic, Mirandola,&#xD;
           Italy), the filter used will be the HFR filter (Medtronic, Mirandola, Italy) a&#xD;
           double-chambered filter used for the HFR dialytic technique. The first part of the&#xD;
           filter consists of a high-flux polyphenylene membrane hemofilter. Through the hemofilter&#xD;
           an endogenous ultrafilter is obtained by separating a share of blood from plasma water&#xD;
           thanks to a mechanical ultrafiltration process. The hourly flow of endogenous&#xD;
           ultrafilter is automatically obtained based on the transmembrane pressure values within&#xD;
           the hemofilter. The endogenous ultrafiltrate produced is then conducted from the&#xD;
           hemofilter to a cartridge containing a neutral resin where a process of adsorption takes&#xD;
           place thanks to an adsorbent surface of 700 m2/gram of resin. After the adsorption, the&#xD;
           ultrafiltrate is returned to the blood in the whole which, in turn, reaches the second&#xD;
           part of the HFR filter. The second chamber of the HFR filter is a low-flow polyphenylene&#xD;
           filter where weight loss and diffusive processes occur. The blood flow from vascular&#xD;
           access will be maintained at values &gt; 250 ml/minute, the flow of dialysis fluid will be&#xD;
           500 ml/minute. Weight loss during dialytic treatment will be prescribed according to the&#xD;
           patient's clinical needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess potassium, sodium, bicarbonatemia, calcemia, urea and blood sugar values, being&#xD;
           the kinetics of potassium closely linked to that of other solutes (e.g. through global&#xD;
           variations in osmolarity resulting in changes in intra- and extra-cellular volumes, and&#xD;
           the participation of pumps among interacting multiple ions). The dosage of potassium,&#xD;
           bicarbonate, calcium, sodium, glucose and urea will be carried out every 30 minutes for&#xD;
           a total of 9 blood samples for the dialytic session (Hemodialysis 1). After 60 minutes&#xD;
           of the end of the dialytic session each patient will undergo 7 blood samples for intra&#xD;
           and extracellular potassium, bicarbonate, ionized calcium, sodium, urea, blood sugar&#xD;
           every 60 minutes (Post-Hemodialysis 1). At the beginning of the next dialysis&#xD;
           (Hemodialysis 2) blood samples of potassium, sodium, bicarbonatemia, calcemia, urea,&#xD;
           blood sugar in particular will be performed to check the degree of potassium rebound in&#xD;
           the interdialytic interval. During Hemodialysis 2 no further blood tests or instrumental&#xD;
           examinations will be carried out and the patient should not remain under observation in&#xD;
           the post-hemodialysis period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess both extracellular potassium and intracellular potassium during dialysis sessions&#xD;
           and in the hours following dialysis itself according to the time interval expected. The&#xD;
           measurement of intracellular potassium will be carried out by selective ion probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ECG with 12-derived electrocardiograph for 5 minutes for a total of 16 ECG paths per&#xD;
           patient per dialytic session. The ECG will be performed at the same time as blood&#xD;
           samples every 30 minutes for a total of 9 tracks per dialytic session. After 60 minutes&#xD;
           of the end of the dialysis session each patient will undergo a new ECG track every 60&#xD;
           minutes for a total of 7 ECGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (e) Body impedance analysis using Electro fluid graph machine® (Akern, Pontassieve, Italy) to&#xD;
      assess each patient's extra intracellular compartments at time 0 (dialysis start) at 240&#xD;
      minutes (end of dialysis), after 60 minutes after the end of dialysis and after 7 hours after&#xD;
      the end of dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (f) Use of the Natrium sensor (Medtronic, Mirandola, Italy) during HFR dialytic treatment to&#xD;
      compare the conductivity values measured by Natrium with the blood levels of electrolytes&#xD;
      measured during the dialytic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase (Step 2) of the study consists of the development of a mathematical model of&#xD;
      solutes kinetics in hemodialysis and during the post-dialytic phase. The mathematical model&#xD;
      will be able to simulate with reasonable precision the performance of some of the main&#xD;
      solutes and, in particular, the extra and intra-cellular potassium concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of the mathematical model can take place when Step 1 data obtained from all 6&#xD;
      patients enrolled were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mathematical model will be developed by Prof. Mauro Ursino, Department of Electrical&#xD;
      Electronic and Information Engineering, University of Bologna. The model will have the&#xD;
      characteristics of predicting: a) the variation in the total body mass of intracellular and&#xD;
      extracellular potassium during and after the dialytic session; b) the kinetics of intra and&#xD;
      extracellular potassium concentration during dialysis and for the first 7 hours after the&#xD;
      dialytic treatment. The mathematical model of potassium kinetics will include the&#xD;
      Na/K/ATPase-dependent pump, which is the main active transport mechanism, the passive&#xD;
      diffusion mechanism of potassium from intracellular compartment to extracellular compartment,&#xD;
      the spread of potassium through the dialysis membrane, the variation in intradialytic volume,&#xD;
      the rebound of potassium and solutes after dialysis, the role of plasma osmolarity. The model&#xD;
      will include two compartments (intra and extra-cellular), the exchange of fluid volumes for&#xD;
      osmosis and ultrafiltration, the kinetics of different solutes, the exchange by diffusion.&#xD;
      The expected time to complete Step 2 out of 6 evaluable patients is 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3. The model developed at the previous point will be used to simulate the temporal&#xD;
      kinetics of solutes, and in particular potassium, during the intradialytic phase and in the&#xD;
      early hours after dialysis. For this purpose, the model predictions will be compared with the&#xD;
      in vivo results. Possibly &quot;fitting&quot; and minimization techniques will be used to estimate&#xD;
      those parameters of the model with an incomplete physiological knowledge. The differences&#xD;
      between model and data will be carefully analysed to understand whether they are due to&#xD;
      measurement errors only, individual variability, or model defects. In the latter case, the&#xD;
      changes to exceed the model limits will be settled. In the second case (individual&#xD;
      variability) the investigators will look for methods of online estimation, to adapt the model&#xD;
      to the individual patient. The mathematical model software will be implemented in the Flexya&#xD;
      hemodialysis machine for its application during a normal online HFR session in patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. During dialysis starting at 8:00 a.m., solute measurements (intra-and&#xD;
      extracellular potassium, urea, blood sugar, bicarbonatemia, sodium, calcemia) will be taken&#xD;
      every 30 minutes to estimate the deviation between the values predicted by the mathematical&#xD;
      model to the various measurement gaps and the values actually measured by laboratory tests.&#xD;
      At the same time as blood samples, 12-derived ECGs will be performed. After 60 minutes of&#xD;
      dialysis, hourly measurements of the solutes and ECG will be repeated. Body impedance&#xD;
      analysis will be repeated 60 minutes after the end of dialysis and at the end of the&#xD;
      observation period (7:00 p.m.) after 7 hours after the end of dialysis. Measurements after&#xD;
      dialysis are required for model validation and to assess the correspondence between the real&#xD;
      concentration of solutes and the values predicted by the model. Body impedance analysis after&#xD;
      the end of dialysis are necessary to assess whether the redistribution of solutes between&#xD;
      intra and extravascular compartment corresponds to a change in the ratio of&#xD;
      intra-to-extracellular volumes. ECG recordings are also required at this stage at the same&#xD;
      time. The expected time to complete Phase 3 out of 6 evaluable patients is 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 4. The model, which has already been validated, is used to determine the potassium&#xD;
      profile in the dialysis bath, able to ensure the optimal trend of intracellular potassemia in&#xD;
      order to identify the correct form of potassium trend, able to minimize risk factors and&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of arrhythmias. The expected time to complete Step 4 is 4 months.&#xD;
