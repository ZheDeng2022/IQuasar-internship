      1. Inclusion of 5 families Inclusions will be made by the clinical genetics department of&#xD;
           the Rouen University Hospital (monocentric study) and will correspond to trios of&#xD;
           parents + child with unexplained developmental abnormalities. The inclusion of patients&#xD;
           will be integrated in routine care and will have as immediate benefit for the included&#xD;
           families the extensive analysis of the proband and their parents' genomes by short and&#xD;
           long read sequencing techniques, which represent the most comprehensive diagnostic tests&#xD;
           for developmental diseases, and which are not currently routinely available. Inclusion&#xD;
           in clinical genetics by clinicians accustomed to prescribing genome-wide analyses will&#xD;
           allow clear and complete information to families. Collection of consents. The trio's DNA&#xD;
           will already be available at the molecular genetics laboratory, and a new blood sample&#xD;
           may be proposed if necessary. Collection of sperm from the father.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identification of a large set of de novo mutations. Extraction of blood DNA and sending&#xD;
           for sequencing of the complete genome to the National Centre for Research in Human&#xD;
           Genomics (CNRGH, Evry), in the framework of a collaboration already initiated. Analysis&#xD;
           of the sequencing data thanks to the already existing expertise in Rouen. Identification&#xD;
           of about 40-120 de novo mutations per trio. At this stage: interpretation of the&#xD;
           variations identified with the secondary objective of identifying the cause of the&#xD;
           disease in children. Long read genomes will allow to phase the de novo variants to the&#xD;
           paternal or to the maternal haplotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Search for de novo mutations in paternal sperm samples. Extraction of spermatic DNA.&#xD;
           Design of a sequencing panel targeting the genetic variations identified in the&#xD;
           different trios. Preparation of the libraries, targeted high throughput sequencing at&#xD;
           great depth thanks to the techniques and equipment already operational. Specific search&#xD;
           for the de novo variations identified in the probands (in 2.), with for each evaluation&#xD;
           of (i) the presence of the variation in the sperm sample, (ii) the quantity of&#xD;
           mosaicism, reflecting the proportion of carrier spermatozoa and therefore the risk of&#xD;
           recurrence, (iii) the presence of my variation in the blood sample of both parents in&#xD;
           deep sequencing.&#xD;
