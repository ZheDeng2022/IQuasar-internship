  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized pilot trial to test the feasibility and acceptability (primary outcomes)&#xD;
      of a virtual cognitive behavioral program for insomnia for survivors of various cancer types.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are to examine the preliminary effects on reducing insomnia severity from&#xD;
      baseline to post-intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), is an evidenced-based insomnia program&#xD;
      that is recommended by the American College of Physicians and can be delivered using&#xD;
      session-by-session treatment manuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among cancer survivors, CBT-I has only yielded small-to-moderate sized improvements in&#xD;
      several aspects of sleep, including sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, and wake after&#xD;
      sleep onset as compared with inactive control conditions. Moreover, systematic reviews of&#xD;
      CBT-I with cancer survivors have found high rates of attrition and low attendance. Thus,&#xD;
      while CBT-I for cancer survivors is promising, further adaptation is needed to demonstrate&#xD;
      greater feasibility and larger effects. Additionally, CBT-I is traditionally delivered&#xD;
      in-person, which is not feasible for many cancer survivors. Barriers include time&#xD;
      limitations, travel, and illness burden constraints, as well as a paucity of trained CBT-I&#xD;
      providers. Telehealth delivery of CBT-I is an innovative approach to address these barriers&#xD;
      to care and enhance uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention being tested in this study was informed by a 4-10 session CBT-I protocol and&#xD;
      adapted based on interviews the investigators conducted with cancer survivors with insomnia&#xD;
      to learn about their sleep-related challenges, suggestions, and preferences for intervention&#xD;
      delivery, as well as a systematic review and meta-analysis the investigators published in&#xD;
      Sleep Medicine Reviews in 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and randomization into 1 of 2&#xD;
      study arms: the Adapted Virtual Intervention Group or a Control Group (Enhanced Usual Care;&#xD;
      referral for behavioral sleep medicine and sleep hygiene handout). Participants will be in&#xD;
      this research study for approximately 2 months. It is expected that about 40 people will take&#xD;
      part in this research study.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be asked to rate the enjoyableness, convenience, helpfulness, odds of future use, and overall satisfaction (1=very low to 5=very high) of the program in exit interviews, which will use open-ended questions and response probes to explicate each rating.</description>

    <measure>Change in Insomnia Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>T0 (Baseline)- T1(Post-Intervention): 1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Change in insomnia severity (T0-T1) will be assessed using the validated Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Scores of 15 or higher on the ISI indicate clinically significant insomnia.</description>

    <time_frame>T0 (Baseline)- T2(1 Month Post-Intervention Follow Up): 2 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective Sleep: Measured via sleep diary (T0-T2). Total sleep time, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, and wake after sleep onset will be assessed using a sleep diary (i.e., timings of sleep/wake, timings of being in bed) for 1-2 weeks to achieve 7 consecutive days of sleep reporting at each timepoint.</description>

    <description>Objective Sleep: Measured via actigraphy data collection (T0-T1). During the same time period as participants complete the sleep diary, objective sleep will be assessed among a subgroup of approximately 10 participants in the intervention arm (counterbalanced) using actigraphy devices to calculate: total sleep time, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and a Mean Activity Score (actigraph counts/min).</description>
