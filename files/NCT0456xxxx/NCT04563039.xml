      The AEROLITH Clinical Study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Applaud Acoustic&#xD;
      Enhancer when used in conjunction with conventional ureteroscopic laser lithortipsy (URS-LL)&#xD;
      in the treatment of subjects with urinary stones. The clinical study is a prospective,&#xD;
      multicenter, two-arm, randomized, double blinded study. A total of 196 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study at up to 15 investigational sites located in the U.S.&#xD;

    <description>Applaud's Acoustic Enhancer is provided in a lyophilized form. After reconstitution, it is a liquid, containing micron-scale particles that are made of a perfluoroalkane gas core with a lipid shell. The device is intended to be used with cleared/approved pulsed laser systems in fragmenting urinary stones (calculi) in the upper (superior) pole, lower (inferior) pole, and interpolar region of the kidney, pelvis of the kidney, and proximal ureter.</description>
