  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lyndra is developing an oral, extended release (ER) formulation of risperidone (LYN-005)&#xD;
      presented in a capsule dosage form with the intent of reducing the frequency of dosing&#xD;
      orally-administered medications to once weekly or less and thereby improving the management&#xD;
      of schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study LYN-005-C-004 will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      multiple dose administration of the ER formulation at two dose levels of LYN-005 relative to&#xD;
      IR risperidone.&#xD;

      LYN-005-C-004 is a blinded, multiple-dose, randomized, parallel group, safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and PK study of LYN-005 in subjects with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder in general good health. Eligible subjects must be clinically stable&#xD;
      and receiving a therapeutic dose of an approved oral antipsychotic drug for a minimum of 6&#xD;
      weeks at the time of Screening. Enrolled subjects will be evaluated under steady-state&#xD;
      conditions on commercially-available IR risperidone tablets and then assigned in blinded&#xD;
      fashion either to LYN-005 weekly or continued encapsulated IR risperidone daily for 3 weeks&#xD;
      to attain (or continue) steady-state exposure.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Although treatment assignment is blinded; the dose level is not blinded. The dose of LYN-005 (14 or 28 mg)/IR risperidone (2 or 4 mg/day) administered will be based on the subject's current antipsychotic medication dose. Randomization will be stratified by risperidone dose (LYN-005 14 mg/IR risperidone 2 mg/day [low dose] and LYN-005 28 mg/IR risperidone 4 mg/day [high dose], with a maximum of 16 subjects enrolled in each stratum. Within each stratum, subjects will be randomized on a 3:1 basis to either LYN-005 or risperidone, respectively.</masking_description>
