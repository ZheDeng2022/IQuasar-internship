  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the development of endoscopy, patients with suspected gastrointestinal tract disease can&#xD;
      be evaluated with further management. Upper esophageal tract including esophagus, stomach and&#xD;
      duodenum, and colon are easily to be evaluated in daily practice. However, small bowel,&#xD;
      located between stomach and colon, is a long tortuous organ about 4-6 meter long and causing&#xD;
      difficulty in optical evaluation. Since Prof. Swain and Iddan invented video capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy(VCE) from over 20 years ago.[1] VCE is increasingly used in evaluation of small&#xD;
      bowel disease across the world.[2, 3] Originally, VCE is composed of one front lens, with&#xD;
      flashlight and battery to take images during its passage throughout small bowel. Wireless&#xD;
      device were also implanted for transmission of the video signal for further diagnosis.[4] In&#xD;
      recent decades, new generation of VCE have better image quality, longer battery life and more&#xD;
      frequent images taken. Therefore, VCE is recommended as the first line treatment in obscure&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding(OGIB) by multiple societies.[5-7] The efficacy of capsule endoscopy&#xD;
      in evaluating patients with OGIB is good, but not perfect. The current diagnostic yield of&#xD;
      VCE in patients with OGIB is from 35% to 77%.[8-11] Part of OGIB patients still can't be&#xD;
      diagnosed using current conventional capsule endoscopy. The current forward looking lens may&#xD;
      cause some difficulties, including inability to visualize the duodenal papilla, blind points&#xD;
      missed by capsule endoscopy. In recent years, another type of panoramic side view capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy was developed.[12] The CapsoCam Plus (Capsovision) capsule has four cameras&#xD;
      allowing the exploration of the small bowel through 360° lateral viewing and makes papilla&#xD;
      stably visualized. However, this system does not include a recording system so the capsule&#xD;
      endoscope has to be collected by the patient after defecation in order for the film to be&#xD;
      downloaded which may be a disadvantage compared with the conventional capsule endoscopy. In&#xD;
      previous studies, the diagnostic yield of conventional capsule endoscope and panoramic side&#xD;
      view capsule endoscope were comparable while visualization of duodenal papilla is more&#xD;
      frequent in using panoramic side view capsule endoscopy. [13-15] However, most studies are&#xD;
      done in single arm historical control or randomized controlled study, which may be influenced&#xD;
      by the uneven distribution of OGIB patients in both groups. To date only one simultaneous&#xD;
      capsule endoscopy study using both capsule endoscope in the same patient is available to data&#xD;
      using older version of conventional capsule endoscope and panoramic side view capsule&#xD;
      endoscope .[16] The efficiency between two capsule endoscopies were comparable in terms of&#xD;
      diagnostic yield and image quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we aimed to conduct this study to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency between two&#xD;
      capsule endoscopies. The aim of this study was to evaluate (1) visualization of duodenal&#xD;
      papilla (2) diagnostic concordance (kappa value) of the conventional capsule endoscopy&#xD;
      (Olmypus endocapsule 10) and panoramic side view (CapsoCam Plus) capsule endoscopy in the&#xD;
      same OGIB patient. The clinical experience and satisfaction of both capsule endoscope by the&#xD;
      patient and the physicians will be also be assessed.&#xD;

      Materials and Methods Patients 30 Patients with occult gastrointestinal bleeding aged 20-85&#xD;
      years old will be enrolled from Endoscopy Center for Diagnosis and Treatment, Taipei Veterans&#xD;
      General Hospital. Patients needed to have negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy&#xD;
      for potential bleeding source within 12 months prior to the capsule examination. Patient with&#xD;
      suspected or confirmed gastrointestinal tract obstruction, pacemaker use or unwilling to&#xD;
      swallow the capsule endoscope will be excluded. Female at child bearing age will receive&#xD;
      urine HCG test for pregnancy evaluation. Pregnant patients will be excluded. All patients&#xD;
      will be given informed consent before inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capsule Endoscopy procedure The Endocapsule (EC-10) and CapsoCam Plus (Capsovision) capsule&#xD;
      will be used. The Endocapsule is 26mm x 11mm in size and 3.3g in weight. It has 160° angle of&#xD;
      view with 12 hours of battery life, 2 frame per second sampling rate. One antenna unit will&#xD;
      be packed on the patient's waist during examination adjacent to a recorder. [17] The CapsoCam&#xD;
      Plus capsule is 31mm x 11mm in size and 4g in weight. It has a field of view of 360° with at&#xD;
      least 15 hours of battery life, takes 20 images per second maximum, (4 frames per second from&#xD;
      each of the four cameras). No other accessories are needed during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small-bowel preparation will be performed in patients before capsule ingestion as routine&#xD;
      practice and previously published guidelines. [19] The patients will take one pack of&#xD;
      GI-Klean powder(polyethylene glycol) in 1000ml water followed by 1000ml water at 6-8 pm the&#xD;
      night before capsule endoscopy. Then they will take another pack of GI-Klean&#xD;
      powder(polyethylene glycol) in 1000ml water followed by 1000ml water at 5AM on the morning on&#xD;
      the day of capsule endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of examination, the patients will take 10ml of simethicone fluid first. Then&#xD;
      they'll ingest the two capsules, with 1.5 hour between and in a randomized order (using&#xD;
      sealed envelopes). After capsule endoscopy entered small bowel, the patient will take a light&#xD;
      meal at least 4 hours after the 2nd capsule endoscope ingestion. They'll take dinner as&#xD;
      usual. The capsule endoscope will be collected by the patient using a specified capsule&#xD;
      collecting system during defecation. If no capsule endoscope was noted in the stool in 3&#xD;
      days. The patient will received through 20mg sennosides on the 3rd night. The patients will&#xD;
      return back the capsule endoscope, antenna and recorder after getting the capsule endoscope.&#xD;
      For patient who didn't collect capsule endoscope in 15 days, abdominal x-ray plain film will&#xD;
      be taken to evaluate the status of capsule endoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capsule endoscopy review For each case, the two capsule films will read in a randomized order&#xD;
      by three experienced physicians (one &gt;250 VCE examinations, two &gt;100 VCE examinations). None&#xD;
      of the physicians had experience of panoramic side view capsule endoscopy(&lt;5) before this&#xD;
      study. The two readings will be done blindly. The reading frames will be were available to&#xD;
      each reader, and suggested not faster than a rate of 15 images per second. The cases will be&#xD;
      classified into concordant positive, concordant negative, and discordant cases. For&#xD;
      discordant cases, a third reviewer will conduct the clarification of the CE images for&#xD;
      confirmation and confirmed during a conference by all three experienced readers. An image per&#xD;
      image comparison will be performed and the complete film will be read a second time when&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study will be (1) ampulla of the vater detection rate and (2) the&#xD;
      concordance between the two capsule examinations with a kappa value&gt;0.5. The secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will be the small bowel cleansing quality, technical failure rate, transit and&#xD;
      operation time, capsule endoscopy completion rate, video record reliability, diagnostic&#xD;
      yield, safety profile and the physicians' and patients' satisfaction with the capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of the outcome measurement will be defined as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ampulla of Vater detection rate: the number of examinations in which the ampulla was&#xD;
           clearly identified over the number of the overall number of patients receiving VCE&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data interpretation: All endoscopic findings will be systemically recorded according to&#xD;
           location, endoscopic features and clinical significance, and in relation to procedure&#xD;
           indications, as P0 (low probability), P1 (intermediate pcccrobability), or P2 (high&#xD;
           probability) as in previous descriptions [18]. Nonsignificant (P0) lesions and images&#xD;
           located outside the small intestine were not considered. For per patient analysis, the&#xD;
           final diagnosis of P1 or P2 lesions will be used according to the description of the&#xD;
           most important or the most relevant lesion or group of lesions. The sensitivity of each&#xD;
           capsule examination will be assessed, with true-positive cases being calculated as the&#xD;
           sum of positive cases obtained from the Endocapsule 10 or CapsoCam plus readings,&#xD;
           including expert review of discordant cases. In a per lesion analysis, each lesion (up&#xD;
           to three main lesions found from capsule reading) or group of lesions will be analyzed&#xD;
           independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diagnostic Yield: VCE will be defined as 'positive' when at least one clinically&#xD;
           significant finding (P2) was identified; the rate of &quot;positive&quot; VCE (ie, DY) will be&#xD;
           calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Small bowel cleansing quality: The small-bowel cleansing will be scored by estimating&#xD;
           the amount of clearly visible mucosa using the scale proposed by Esaki et al. [19]. The&#xD;
           images of the small intestine will equally be separated into 3 segments according to&#xD;
           SBTT. The cleansing quality will be graded according to fluid transparency and mucosal&#xD;
           invisibility. The fluid transparency will be graded into grade 1, Clear fluid without&#xD;
           obscuring vision, grade 2 Slightly dark fluid minimally obscuring vision, grade 3 Opaque&#xD;
           fluid partly obscuring vision and grade 4 Turbid fluid severely obscuring vision. The&#xD;
           mucosal invisibility will be graded as Grade 1, &lt;5% in duration of 50% bubbles or&#xD;
           residues, grade 2 5%-15%, grade 3 15%-25% and grade 4 &gt;25%. The overall image quality&#xD;
           will be categorized into Grade A 3-5, Grade B 6-8 and Grade C 9-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Technical failure: it will be defined as any encountered technical problem due to one or&#xD;
           more system components (such as capsule device, downloading system, and/or workstation)&#xD;
           influencing the generation of the video.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Transit and operating times: Gastric transit time, will be defined as the time between&#xD;
           the first and the last gastric image. Small-bowel transit time (SBTT), will be defined&#xD;
           as the timeframe between the first and the last small-bowel image. Total capsule&#xD;
           endoscope time will be defined as the time between the first and the last image captured&#xD;
           by the capsule. Reading time will be defined as the time doctors read the full capsule&#xD;
           endoscopic images.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Capsule endoscopy completion rate: the number of examinations in which the colon was&#xD;
           reached during the operating time over the overall number of patients receiving VCE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Video record reliability: the video record reliability will be evaluated according to a&#xD;
           quantitative scoring system as described before, the images of the small intestine will&#xD;
           equally be separated into 3 segments according to SBTT. The scoring system is defined as&#xD;
           following: 3 points - excellent: when less than 5 total frames and no consecutive&#xD;
           non-evaluable frames were observed. 2 points - good: when ≥5 to &lt;10 total frames or one&#xD;
           sequence with &lt;5 consecutive non-evaluable frames were observed. 1 point - fair: when&#xD;
           ≥10 to &lt;15 total frames, or one sequence with &lt;10 consecutive non-evaluable frames were&#xD;
           observed. 0 points - poor: when ≥15 total frames, or multiple sequences, or one sequence&#xD;
           with ≥10 consecutive non-evaluable frames were observed.[13] The video record&#xD;
           reliability will be evaluated only in completed capsule endoscopy cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Safety profile: As reported in previous studies on front-viewing capsules [1,21], we&#xD;
           will focus our attention on capsule aspiration, at time of ingestion, and capsule&#xD;
           retention. Capsule retention will be defined as the persistence of the capsule within&#xD;
           the patient's intestinal tract, evaluated by an abdominal x-ray plain film, 15 days&#xD;
           after capsule ingestion. There is 1 % chance of capsule endoscope retention in&#xD;
           gastrointestinal tract and patients in whom the capsule was retrieved by elective&#xD;
           surgery and/or by endoscopic procedures will also be considered as capsule retention.&#xD;
           Any other incident and/or adverse event, reported as potentially related to VCE by the&#xD;
           local investigator, will be documented and classified according to previously published&#xD;
           international guidelines.[20]&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Patients' Satisfaction Questionnaire: For evaluation of the convenience and satisfaction&#xD;
           of the patient about two capsule endoscopy, the patient will be asked to fill a&#xD;
           questionnaire about the capsule endoscopy procedure after the capsule endoscopy&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Physician's satisfaction evaluation: For evaluation and further recommendation of the&#xD;
           physician on two different capsule endoscopy about their convenience and efficacy,&#xD;
           physician will be asked to fill up a satisfaction sheet after capsule endoscopy&#xD;
           procedure and image analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Statistical analysis In a recent study, the detection rate of ampulla vater is 81.7 % in&#xD;
      panoramic view capsule endoscopy and 9.6% in conventional capsule endoscopy. 18 patients are&#xD;
      needed to give the study 80% power atα=0.05%.[21] For evaluation of interobserver agreement,&#xD;
      the calculated sample size for detection of was 27 patients in order to obtain a satisfying&#xD;
      estimation of concordance, with an 80% power, of the kappa interobserver agreement&#xD;
      coefficient between paired (Endocapsule 10(Olympus) and CapsoCam Plus(Capsovision)) capsule&#xD;
      readings, taking into account the positive diagnostic yield of VCE in OGIB reaches about 60%.&#xD;
      With an estimation of 10% dropout rate, 30 patients will be needed for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The median with inter-quartile range (IQR) and range will be provided for non-normally&#xD;
      distributed variables, whereas the mean ± standard deviation (SD) for normally distributed&#xD;
      variables. The paired T test will be used to compare technical outcomes among two capsule&#xD;
      endoscopies (ie, operative time and video records reliability). The 2-tailed Fisher exact&#xD;
      test will be used to compare the diagnostic yield. To compare the sensitivity of Endocapsule&#xD;
      10and CapsoCam Plus, a Mac-Nemar test will be used with the exact test of the binomial law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For statistical analysis, SPSS software version 26.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) in a&#xD;
      Windows XP (Microsoft, Seattle, Washington,USA) environment will be used. A P value of &lt;0.05&#xD;
      was considered significant.&#xD;
