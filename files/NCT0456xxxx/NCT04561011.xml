  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Individuals with neurological conditions (stemming from brain injury or stroke)&#xD;
      can experience high levels of emotional distress leading to decreased quality of life and&#xD;
      increased health care costs. Though mental health problems are prevalent and disabling, they&#xD;
      often go untreated for various reasons, such as access to specialized care, rural and remote&#xD;
      location, lack of time, or concerns about stigma related to seeking care. Internet delivered&#xD;
      cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) overcomes barriers to face-to-face therapy by often&#xD;
      reaching a much wider group of patients who experience unequal access to health care. The&#xD;
      internet based program is based on cognitive behaviour therapy, which is an evidenced-based&#xD;
      treatment that helps patients identify and modify thoughts and behaviours that contribute to&#xD;
      their mental health concerns. ICBT has been shown to be effective in improving psychosocial&#xD;
      outcomes such as depression and anxiety, along with disability and quality of life among&#xD;
      persons with chronic health conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Despite evidence for ICBT among those with other chronic conditions, its efficacy&#xD;
      has yet to be evaluated among those with neurological conditions such as brain injury and&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of the current study is to pilot an ICBT program developed through a&#xD;
      patient oriented approach to improve overall wellbeing among those with mild traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this project, an ICBT program for those with mild traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      developed through an patient oriented approach (Phase 1) will be piloted amongst a small&#xD;
      group of participants (n=20) to examine acceptability, feasibility, and limited efficacy. At&#xD;
      the end of the program, participants will be asked to complete a brief semi-structured&#xD;
      interview examining barriers and facilitators to the ICBT program. Participant feedback from&#xD;
      the interviews will be used to further improve the ICBT program to meet the needs of the&#xD;
      population. The results from the study will be used to guide larger studies to evaluate&#xD;
      effectiveness of the program in a community setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Impact: Ultimately, the proposed project aims to improve overall wellbeing and&#xD;
      access to health care service for those who have mild traumatic brain injury and mental&#xD;
      health concerns.&#xD;

    <description>ICBT provides online structured self-help modules over several months based on the principles of CBT in combination with weekly guidance through emails and telephone calls. The course comprises 6 online lessons that provide psychoeducation about: 1) symptom identification and the cognitive behavioural model; 2) thought monitoring and challenging; 3) de-arousal strategies and pleasant activity scheduling; 4) graduated exposure/pacing; 5) memory and attention; and 6) relapse prevention. Participants will also have the opportunity to ask any questions regarding the content of the program materials and will receive a response from their Guide within 48-72 hours. Guide will spend ~15 mins. per week/per participant. All Guides have completed a university program (psychology or social work) and are registered clinicians or students working under supervision of a registered clinician.</description>
