      Aim of the work is to evaluate the use CHA2DS2-VASc score in predicting no-reflow phenomenon&#xD;
      and its impact on short term primary percutaneous coronary intervention outcomes (in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality) and long term (6 months) incidence of MACE ( major adverse cardiac event ) in&#xD;
      patients with ST segment elevation Myocardial infarction who underwent primary primary&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Large intracoronary thrombus burden is known to be associated with reduced procedural success&#xD;
      during the Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PPCI), larger infarct size, increased&#xD;
      ischemic complications and mortality. No-Reflow phenomenon is related to higher incidence of&#xD;
      complications, and short- and long-term morbidity and mortality in acute STEMI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many risk factors were suggested, Tragically there's no widely accepted risk&#xD;
      stratification method to anticipate these complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHA2DS2-VASc score is a sum of several risk factors for thromboembolism. It is considered a&#xD;
      clinical indicator of thromboembolic diseases and is recommended by the current guidelines&#xD;
      for the estimation of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we evaluate the use CHA2DS2-VASc score as a novel rapid simple tool for&#xD;
      predicting No-reflow and clinical outcomes among patients with STEMI who underwent primary&#xD;
      PCI.&#xD;
