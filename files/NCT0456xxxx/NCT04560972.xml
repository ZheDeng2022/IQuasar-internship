    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of LB-100 when given together with&#xD;
      carboplatin, etoposide, and atezolizumab for the treatment of untreated extensive-stage small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer. Drugs such as carboplatin and etoposide work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab,&#xD;
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread. LB-100 has been shown to make anticancer drugs (chemotherapy)&#xD;
      work better at killing cancer. LB-100 blocks a protein on the surface of cells called PP2A.&#xD;
      Blocking this protein makes the tumor cells that express PP2A divide. This allows standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs such as carboplatin, etoposide, and atezolizumab work better at killing&#xD;
      the tumor cells since these drugs work best at destroying cells that are dividing. Giving&#xD;
      LB-100 in combination with standard chemotherapy drugs may work better to treat&#xD;
      extensive-stage small cell lung cancer compared to standard chemotherapy drugs alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor&#xD;
      LB-100 (LB-100) when given in combination with standard carboplatin/etoposide/atezolizumab in&#xD;
      treatment naive patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess objective response rate (ORR). II. To assess progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
      III. To assess overall survival (OS). IV. To assess duration of overall response (DOR). V. To&#xD;
      assess safety and adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of LB-100. II. The biomarkers relevant to LB-100 and the disease&#xD;
      state as well as their correlation to clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of LB-100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive LB-100 intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes on days 1 and 3,&#xD;
      atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1, carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1, and&#xD;
      etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: After completion of induction therapy, patients receive LB-100 IV over 15&#xD;
      minutes on days 1 and 3 and atezolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 30 days, and patients&#xD;
      who discontinue study treatment without disease progression are followed every 6-8 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
