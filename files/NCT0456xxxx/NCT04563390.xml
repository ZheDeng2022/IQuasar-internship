      The main aim of this study is to validate and test the clinical effectiveness of the&#xD;
      projection-based augmented reality system in cockroach phobia exposure therapy through an RCT&#xD;
      that includes three conditions: (i) projection-based augmented reality therapy, (ii) usual&#xD;
      treatment (in vivo exposure), (iii) waiting list control. In addition, it is intended to&#xD;
      analyze the potential of the eye-tracking technology as a tool for evaluating the clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness in cockroach phobia treatment.&#xD;

      The measurement of attentional biases as a clinical evaluation tool in anxiety disorders is&#xD;
      presented as a valuable instrument capable of evaluating changes in the automatic cognitive&#xD;
      processes that are involved in their maintenance. However, the variability between the&#xD;
      different methodologies used for its measurement has produced a lack of empirical consistency&#xD;
      that supports the use of this tool with a clinical purpose. The appearance and implementation&#xD;
      of eye tracking technology in experimental studies has made it possible to overcome this&#xD;
      problem. Despite this, to our knowledge, there are still no studies that implement this&#xD;
      technology in the clinical field as a tool for evaluating therapeutic effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific phobia is the anxiety disorder with the highest prevalence and, specifically the&#xD;
      animal subtype, is one of the most prevalent (3.8%), producing a significant interference and&#xD;
      high comorbidity. Despite that in vivo exposure therapy is the treatment of choice for&#xD;
      specific phobia, the high dropout rates and difficulties in its application pose major&#xD;
      limitations for its therapeutic implementation. The emergence of technologies such as&#xD;
      augmented reality (AR) has made it possible to overcome these barriers, offering new ways of&#xD;
      applying exposure therapy. AR technology offers the capacity to interact with the stimulus in&#xD;
      the real world, facilitating the therapeutic process and the generalization of its results.&#xD;
      Some studies have tested the effectivity and efficacy of the AR technology in small animals&#xD;
      exposure treatment revealing promising results. However, these studies used a version of AR&#xD;
      that requires the use of a device placed on the participant's head (HDM-Head Mounted Display)&#xD;
      which can cause dizziness and back pain in some participants and limits the therapist-patient&#xD;
      communication. An improved version of the AR system based on projection helps to solve this&#xD;
      problem, allowing a more natural interaction with the stimulus and the therapist and greater&#xD;
      comfort. The preliminary efficacy of this system has been tested in a case study but, so far,&#xD;
      there is no RCT evaluating the efficacy of this AR system. Therefore, in this work two&#xD;
      objectives are pursued, firstly, to test and validate a projection-based AR system in the&#xD;
      phobia of cockroaches treatment and, secondly, to evaluate the clinical potential of the&#xD;
      eye-tracking technology as a specific measure to assess changes in cognitive processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) will be conducted following the Consolidated Standards of&#xD;
      Reporting Trials (CONSORT: http://www.consort-statement.org) and the SPIRIT guidelines&#xD;
      (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Intervention Trials). Participants (N=96) will&#xD;
      be randomized into three groups (after receiving a SP diagnosis - DSM-5): 1) Projection-based&#xD;
      augmented reality therapy (P-ARET); 2) In vivo Exposure therapy (IVET); and 3) a waiting list&#xD;
      control group (WL). Participants in the WL will be randomly assigned to one of the two&#xD;
      treatment conditions after spending time on the waiting list (1 week) for ethical reasons.&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment and 1-, 6-, and 12-month&#xD;
      follow-ups.&#xD;
