      Sonazoid as a new generation of ultrasound contrast agent.This study based on the features of&#xD;
      Sonazoid specific angiography and his mechanical index, the role of Sonazoidin in the&#xD;
      differential diagnosis of benign and malignant focal liver lesions in different liver&#xD;

      Sonazoid as a new generation of ultrasound contrast agent, was liver specificity (Kupffer&#xD;
      cells), macrophages at the very stable period, Kupffer imaging contrast enhancement effect&#xD;
      for more than 1 hour, it is mainly used for focal liver lesions of blood vessels and Kupffer&#xD;
      phase of ultrasonic imaging, facilitate early detection of small lesions (&lt; 1 cm). Until now,&#xD;
      Sonazoid has been mainly focused on liver focal lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most liver cancer patients in China are associated with chronic liver disease, and more than&#xD;
      80% of liver disease patients are in advanced stage at the time of treatment. Differential&#xD;
      diagnosis is still a challenge for enhanced CT / MRI. About 40% of HCCs lack arterial phase&#xD;
      enhancement and 40% - 60% of small lesions do not show elution in venous phase. The existing&#xD;
      imaging methods have low sensitivity in detecting small lesions, and it is difficult to&#xD;
      detect lesions smaller than 1 cm. Studies have found that the sensitivity of CT and MRI is of&#xD;
      60 - 94.4% and 58.5 - 93% respectively when the tumor diameter is larger than 1 cm. When the&#xD;
      tumor diameter is less than 1 cm, the sensitivity of CT and MRI to detect tumors is reduced&#xD;
      to 33 - 45% and 33 - 67%, respectively. The diagnostic efficiency of conventional&#xD;
      ultrasonography for small lesions, especially in patients with chronic hepatitis B or&#xD;
      cirrhosis, is poor. Although the diagnostic efficiency of conventional contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasound in the diagnosis of small lesions with chronic hepatitis B or liver cirrhosis has&#xD;
      a certain improvement, there is still a large rate of missed diagnosis. In addition, ordinary&#xD;
      ultrasound, conventional contrast-enhanced ultrasound, CT and MRI are very poor in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of liver cancer differentiation, especially for highly differentiated liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sonazoid is a second generation ultrasound contrast agent, which is composed of microbubbles&#xD;
      containing chemically stable and insoluble Perfluorobutane (PFB) gas and a hard shell of&#xD;
      phosphatidylserine sodium (2-3 μ m in diameter) wrapped in the outer layer. These&#xD;
      microbubbles can generate stable nonlinear oscillations in a low-power acoustic field and&#xD;
      generate echoes at the second harmonic frequency of the transmitted pulse for enhanced&#xD;
      contrast harmonic imaging . In addition to the ability of real-time angiography, Sonazoid&#xD;
      microbubbles can be engulfed by Kupffer cells in the intrahepatic reticuloendothelial system&#xD;
      to produce liver parenchymal imaging Usually 10 minutes after intravenous injection of&#xD;
      Sonazoid contrast agent, Kupffer phase image appears, and normal liver parenchyma is enhanced&#xD;
      . Therefore, at this stage, malignant lesions with little or no Kupffer cells are clearly&#xD;
      demonstrated due to the lack of contrast media. In addition, because Sonazoid microbubbles&#xD;
      can resonate without rupture under moderate ultrasonic pressure, Kupffer phase (Kupffer&#xD;
      phase) imaging can be stable for more than several hours, which is beneficial to whole liver&#xD;
      scanning . Because Sonazoid has the advantages of ultra long time development and good&#xD;
      stability, Sonazoid has significant clinical advantages in the diagnosis of small liver&#xD;
      cancer lesions, liver cirrhosis background liver cancer and highly differentiated liver&#xD;
      cancer.. However, these studies based on Sonazoid are all small sample studies and subjective&#xD;
      qualitative differential diagnosis methods, and lack of systematic analysis and research.&#xD;
      Therefore, based on the advantages of the new ultrasound contrast agent, using qualitative&#xD;
      analysis and quantitative analysis method to collect large samples, systematically explore&#xD;
      the standardized diagnosis scheme and diagnostic efficiency of liver cancer with different&#xD;
      liver background, which has important clinical significance for early diagnosis, early&#xD;
      detection and improving the accuracy of diagnosis of liver cancer.&#xD;
