  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The device involved in this trail is a diagnostic software with a Prospective, Multicenter,&#xD;
      Self Controlled design. FFRCT diagnostic performance was calculated by CardioSimFFRct&#xD;
      Analysis software, and the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive&#xD;
      value and negative predictive performance of FFRCT for myocardial ischemia were calculated&#xD;
      per-patient level and per-vessel level with invasive FFR value as gold standard.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a single arm, open label, prospective trial. Measurement of FFR during&#xD;
      invasive cardiac catheterization represents the &quot;gold standard&quot; for assessment of the&#xD;
      hemodynamic significance of coronary artery lesions. As we know, the major disadvantage of&#xD;
      FFR is that it has to be measured invasively. CardioSimFFRct Analysis software is a&#xD;
      non-invasive method to determine FFR which computes the hemodynamic significance of Coronary&#xD;
      Artery Disease (FFRCT) from coronary computed tomography angiography（CCTA）data of the subject&#xD;
      by using computational fluid dynamics.The FFR derived from FFR-CT will be compared with&#xD;
      invasive FFR as gold standard.Moreover CardioSimFFRct also simplifies the coronary artery&#xD;
      into a one-dimensional piping model, omits grid engineering, and greatly reduces the&#xD;
      complexity of pretreatment.Based on the pressure loss along the pipe flow and the local&#xD;
      pressure loss, a fast method for FFR calculation in engineering is proposed. The calculation&#xD;
      time can be reduced to several minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FFRct from CardioSimFFRct Analysis software is mainly based on CCTA images to image the&#xD;
      coronary arteries. Through three-dimensional reconstruction of the coronary arteries and&#xD;
      computational fluid Dynamics (CFD) technology, the simulation of blood flow in the blood&#xD;
      vessels is realized to extract the coronary blood flow reserve score (FFR).FFRct has the&#xD;
      following characteristics such as the FFR value can be measured noninvasively, without&#xD;
      additional damage to patients, avoiding the risks brought by invasive surgery, and the side&#xD;
      effects brought by drugs during invasive surgery.FFRct can realize the examination quickly,&#xD;
      save the time of doctors' coronary functional assessment, and simplify the process of&#xD;
      coronary functional assessment.It also has the function of three-dimensional reconstruction&#xD;
      of blood vessels, which makes it convenient for users to view the whole structure of coronary&#xD;
      arteries and make artificial correction.The results of FFRct have high repeatability and are&#xD;
      easy for users to evaluate.&#xD;
