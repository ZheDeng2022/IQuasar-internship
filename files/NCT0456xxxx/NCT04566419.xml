      The primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of post-operatory HFNC in reducing&#xD;
      the incidence of hypoxemia after gynecological oncology surgery, compared to the standard&#xD;
      application of O2 through a Venturi mask; The secondary objectives are to investigate the&#xD;
      occurrence and entity of lung atelectasis, to evaluate diaphragmatic function and respiratory&#xD;
      discomfort, and to evaluate the incidence of respiratory complications after seven days in&#xD;
      the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into two groups: HFNC and Control. The patients will be studied&#xD;
      with preoperative lung and diaphragmatic ultrasound. Standard general anesthesia will be&#xD;
      administered in the two groups. Ultrasound will be performed at arrival in the recovery room&#xD;
      (RR) and before discharge from the RR. In the HFNC group, high-flow O2 will be administered;&#xD;
      in the control group standard O2 therapy with Venturi mask will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial blood gas analysis upon arrival in the RR and after two hours of O2 therapy in both&#xD;
      groups will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of post-operative respiratory complications will be monitored in the seven days&#xD;
      following surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative hypoxemia presents in 10-50% of patients undergoing surgery, and it is&#xD;
      associated to unfavourable prognosis. Anesthesia-induced paralysis, the use of high oxygen&#xD;
      concentrations (O2) and inadequate level of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP),&#xD;
      capnoperitoneum, Trendelenburg position, prolonged duration of surgery, contribute to&#xD;
      pulmonary atelectasis, which are the principal cause of postoperative hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of high flow nasal cannulas (HFNC) has been recently studied in the treatment of&#xD;
      hypoxemic patients in intensive care unit and in the immediate post-operatory period after&#xD;
      abdominal and cardio-thoracic surgery. The role of post-operative HFNC in patients undergoing&#xD;
      major gynecological oncology surgery has yet to be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung ultrasound is a safe and accurate bedside tool that allows to investigate pulmonary&#xD;
      aeration and atelectasis developement. Diaphragmatic ultrasound is a recent bedside technique&#xD;
      useful to assess diaphragm performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of post-operatory HFNC in reducing&#xD;
      the incidence of hypoxemia after gynecological oncology surgery, compared to the standard&#xD;
      application of O2 through the Venturi mask. The secondary objectives are to investigate the&#xD;
      occurrence and entity of lung atelectasis, to evaluate diaphragmatic function and respiratory&#xD;
      discomfort, and to evaluate the incidence of respiratory complications after seven days in&#xD;
      the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Length:&#xD;
&#xD;
      this is an interventional, prospective, randomized (with standard and experimental groups)&#xD;
      monocentric study. The study will be 12-months in length and it will be carried out in the&#xD;
      operating rooms of the 6° floor of the IRCCS Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino&#xD;
      Gemelli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients eligible for recruitment will be randomized with a computerized system and will&#xD;
      be included in wither the HFNC or C group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival in the operating room lung and diaphragmatic ultrasound will be performed&#xD;
      according to the international recommendations of Point of Care. A SonoSite ultrasound with&#xD;
      Convex probe, with abdominal presetting and depth set at 9-12 cm, will be used. The&#xD;
      ultrasound probe will be positioned between the ribs with the marker facing cranially and&#xD;
      position perpendicular to the thoracic cage, oriented along the longitudinal axis of the&#xD;
      patient. The image generated this way will show the superior rib on the left the screen and&#xD;
      the inferior rib on the right of the screen, both represented by acoustic shadowing. The&#xD;
      pleural line will appear between the costal shadows as a slightly curved and eco-reflective&#xD;
      line. In the healthy lung, it is possible to appreciate pleural &quot;sliding&quot; generated by the&#xD;
      movements of the visceral pleura against the parietal pleura during each breath. This&#xD;
      movement will be more pronounced along the lung bases and more blurred at the apices.&#xD;
      Horizontal lines at regular intervals below the pleura that may be appreciated represent&#xD;
      reverberation artefacts that are defined as &quot;A lines.&quot; On the other hand, the &quot;B lines,&quot; that&#xD;
      are also know as &quot;comets&quot; are artefacts produced by the interface of the normally aerated&#xD;
      lung parenchyma with higher-density areas. These will present as vertical lines that start&#xD;
      from the pleura and develop up to the end of the image, covering the A lines and consensual&#xD;
      to respiratory movements. Twelve images will be acquired, one for each thoracic section&#xD;
      obtained through the following method: for each hemithorax, anterior, posterior and lateral&#xD;
      portions will be recognized relative to the anterior and posterior axillary lines,&#xD;
      respectively. Each section will be further subdivided into superior and inferior by the&#xD;
      intermammillary line. The posterior images will be acquired with the patient lying in lateral&#xD;
      decubitus. A score ranging from 0 to 3 according to Monastesse criteria will be assigned to&#xD;
      each of the 12 quadrants. For each quadrant the worst (higher) score will be considered,&#xD;
      indicating more severe aeration loss. Individual scores will be added to calculate the&#xD;
      cumulative lung ultrasound (LUS) score (0-36).&#xD;
&#xD;
      0: Normal aeration = visualization of pleural sliding and A lines parallel to the pleura with&#xD;
      &lt; 3B lines.1: Mild loss of aeration = ≥3 B lines or multiple subpleural consolidations&#xD;
      separated by normal pleura. 2: Moderate loss of aeration = multiple and coalescent B lines of&#xD;
      multiple subpleural consolidations separated by thickened or irregular pleura. 3. Severe loss&#xD;
      of aeration = parenchymal consolidations or multiple subpleural consolidations greater than&#xD;
      1×2 cm in dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For diaphragmatic ultrasound a linear high frequency probe will be used. The operator&#xD;
      identifies the caudal border of the costophrenic sinus as the zone of transition from the&#xD;
      artefactual representation of the aerated lung to the visualization of the diaphragm and&#xD;
      liver on the right side. The diaphragm will be identified by the two hyperechoic lines of&#xD;
      pleural and peritoneal membranes. In M-mode, both the respiratory phases are represented in&#xD;
      the same frame. The diaphragm thickness at end-inspiration (TEI), at end-expiration (TEE)&#xD;
      will be measured and the thickening fraction (TF) will be calculated using the formula TF =&#xD;
      (TEI - TEE)/TEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical and respiratory parameters from the patients' medical records will also be&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A venous access will be placed, according to normal clinical practice. The use of neuro-axial&#xD;
      blocks (spinal or epidural), as well as the placement of a central venous catheter, arterial&#xD;
      catheter, a second large bore venous access, will be left to the judgement of the anesthesist&#xD;
      in charge of the patient. The induction of general anesthesia will follow a preoxygenation&#xD;
      with inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) =1 for three minutes. The intraoperative mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation settings will be standardized, with tidal volume set at 8ml/kg of predicted body&#xD;
      weight, PEEP 5 cmH2O, respiratory frequency set to maintain PaCO2 within physiological&#xD;
      limits, I:E ratio of 1:2. In case of intraoperative arterial desaturation (SpO2 &lt; 95%)&#xD;
      different techniques will be adopted in the following order: recruitment maneuvers, increase&#xD;
      in PEEP, and increase in FiO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After awakening from general anesthesia the patients will be moved to the RR where standard&#xD;
      multiparametric monitoring will be started, an arterial blood sample will be drawn for blood&#xD;
      gas analysis and a second lung and diaphragmatic ultrasound will be performed following the&#xD;
      same criteria already listed above. Respiratory rate and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for&#xD;
      discomfort and dyspnoea will be filled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point, the patients selected for the C group will undergo conventional O2-therapy&#xD;
      Venturi mask. In the patients belonging to the HFNC group, high flow O2 (60 lt/min) will be&#xD;
      administered through the use of nasal cannulas with the Opti-Flow circuit. In both groups the&#xD;
      starting FiO2 will be 21% and will be increased of necessary to obtain a SpO2&gt;92. After two&#xD;
      hours of therapy a new arterial blood gas analysis, a third lung-diaphragmatic ultrasound,&#xD;
      respiratory rate, a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for discomfort and dyspnoea will be noted,&#xD;
      before the patients are transferred to the ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the seventh day after surgery all of the eventual episodes that may be classified as&#xD;
      postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) will be recorded (hypoxemia, pleural effusion,&#xD;
      lung edema, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),&#xD;
      bronchospasm, lung aspiration, pneumothorax).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations Sample Dimension The literature indicates that roughly 50% of&#xD;
      patients, treated with O2 therapy, develops hypoxemia one hour from extubation. Assuming that&#xD;
      in the experimental branch (arm) that percentage is 15%, considering a strength of 90% and an&#xD;
      alpha =0.05, a sample size of 66 patients will be obtained (33 per branch), at which a 20% of&#xD;
      dropout will be added to reach the final sample size of N = 80 patients (40 per arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis The sample will be described in its clinical and demographic characteristics&#xD;
      through the techniques of descriptive statistics. In particular, quantitative variables will&#xD;
      be represented though the following measurements: minimum, maximus, range, mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation, or median and interquartile range. Qualitative variables will be represented&#xD;
      through absolute frequencies and percentages. The normality of continuous variables will be&#xD;
      validated through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The primary aim will be reached comparing the&#xD;
      two proportions through the Chi-squared test, while the change in Pa/FiO2 at the different&#xD;
      time points, among the two groups of patients will be assessed by the Student's t-test. The&#xD;
      secondary objective of comparing the incidence of PPC after seven days in the two branches&#xD;
      will be also attained through the Chi-squared test. The p-value&lt;0.05 indicates statistical&#xD;
      significance. All of the statistical analysis will be done with SPSS 25.&#xD;
