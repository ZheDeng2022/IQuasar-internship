  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than half of the cases with macrometastatic sentinel lymph node (SLN) have non-SLN&#xD;
      metastasis and leaving these nodes in-situ may impair the survival. This study assessed the&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of intraoperative SLN frozen section examination and scrape cytology as a&#xD;
      possible solution for management of SLN positive patients. Clinical early stage endometrial&#xD;
      cancer patients who underwent SLN algorithm and intraoperative frozen section or scrape&#xD;
      cytology to evaluate SLN status for metastasis were analyzed retrospectively. Intraoperative&#xD;
      examination findings were compared with final pathology results and diagnostic accuracy of&#xD;
      frozen section and scrape cytology were evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frozen section: Lymph nodes up to 2 mm were embedded as a whole. Lymph nodes between 2-5 mm&#xD;
      were cut in half along their long axis and nodes larger than 5 mm were sliced in neat,&#xD;
      parallel slices at 2-3 mm intervals-slicing was perpendicular to the long axis of the node.&#xD;
      Then whole of the SLNs were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and examined by frozen&#xD;
      section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scrape Cytology: SLNs were cut into 3-mm-thick pieces along their long axis. If the lymph&#xD;
      node was smaller than 3 mm, it was cut in half. Both sides of the pieces were scraped&#xD;
      separately by an edge of a glass slide or a lancet gently. Obtained materials were smeared&#xD;
      immediately onto a slide and placed in ethanol for fixation. Then, all slides were stained&#xD;
      with H&amp;E and examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results were reported to the surgeon as positive (metastatic) or negative with the&#xD;
      numbers of lymph nodes. After intraoperative examination, lymph nodes were put into formalin&#xD;
      solution and sent for final pathologic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses were performed using SPSS Version 21.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NYC, USA).&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to determine whether the data were normally distributed.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics of continuous variables were compared between groups using&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test. The Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test (when chi-square test&#xD;
      assumptions do not hold due to low expected cell counts) were used to compare categorical&#xD;
      variables between groups. Continuous variables were presented as median and min-max values,&#xD;
      whereas categorical variables were presented as number and percentage. A p value of &lt;0.05 was&#xD;
      considered statistically significant. Performance of each protocol to predict treatment&#xD;
      success was assessed using confidence intervals with respect to sensitivity, specificity,&#xD;
      positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.&#xD;
