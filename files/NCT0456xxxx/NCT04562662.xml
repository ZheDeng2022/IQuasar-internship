  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to evaluate mediVR-KAGURA guided therapy for the treatments of physical and&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunctions regardless of baseline disease in a prospective interventional design.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients sit on an upright chair, wear a head-mounted display (HMD) and grab two handheld&#xD;
      controllers in a motion-tracked three-dimensional space called &quot;room scale&quot; of the&#xD;
      mediVR-KAGURA (mediVR, Inc. Toyonaka City, Osaka, Japan). mediVR-KAGURA can provide users&#xD;
      with &gt;90 frames per second (fps) graphic operation with an approximately 110° viewing angle&#xD;
      and accurate three-dimensional tracking technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, we evaluate conventional and maximum reaching distances at 0°, 45°, and 90° level&#xD;
      surface for the left hand (0L, 45L, 90L) and at 90°, 135°, and 180° level surface for the&#xD;
      right hand (90R, 135R, or 180R) for calibration in a sitting position. During rehabilitation,&#xD;
      patients are instructed to touch a fixed objects or catch a falling objects at the&#xD;
      pre-specified height and distance levels in each degree. Horizontal distances were classified&#xD;
      into three categories, namely long, middle, and short which were calculated using the&#xD;
      following formulas: 0.9 * maximum reaching distance, 0.9 * (conventional + maximum reaching&#xD;
      distances)/2, and conventional reaching distance respectively. A falling object disappeared&#xD;
      at a 20 cm height for safety if the patients missed to catch it. The purpose of reaching&#xD;
      hands was to stimulate and break down body trunk balance, and to train participants to&#xD;
      balance for stable walking. By thinking about the timing and distance and recognizing the&#xD;
      next targets repeatedly, cognitive function was simultaneously stimulated for dual-task&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 7 parameters of the rehabilitation programs can be set like as follows: (1) distance&#xD;
      (short, middle or long), (2) direction (0L, 45L, 90L, 90R, 135R, or 180R), (3) height of&#xD;
      object, (4) size of object (center or outline), (5) size of sensing sphere of the controller,&#xD;
      (6) falling speed of the square box (from 0 to 300 cm/s), and (7) intervals for each task.&#xD;
      Participants first underwent practical programs to familiarize themselves with mediVR-KAGURA&#xD;
      guided rehabilitation, followed by rehabilitation programs. Provision of the rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs will be personalized.&#xD;

    <description>The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. Shorter score means a better outcome. The minimum value could be 5 seconds or less, and the maximum value could be infinity (cannot complete the test).</description>

    <measure>Change in Trail Making Test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (pre-intervention), immediately after the first intervention, average of 1, 3 and 6 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Trail Making Test (TMT) is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. Shorter score means a better outcome. The minimum value could be 15 seconds or less, and the maximum value could be infinity or be defined as 300 seconds when patients cannot complete the test.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Functional Independence Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (pre-intervention), immediately after the first intervention, average of 1, 3 and 6 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is an assessment tool that aims to evaluate the functional status of patients throughout the rehabilitation process following a stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury or cancer. Higher score means a better outcome. The minimum value is 18, and the maximum value is 126.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline (pre-intervention), immediately after the first intervention, average of 1, 3 and 6 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg Balance Scale (or BBS) is a widely used clinical test of a person's static and dynamic balance abilities. Higher score means a better outcome. The minimum value is 0, and the maximum value is 56.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline (pre-intervention), immediately after the first intervention, average of 1, 3 and 6 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test is a 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment. Higher score means a better outcome. The minimum value is 0, and the maximum value is 30.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Self Rating Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (pre-intervention), immediately after the first intervention, average of 1, 3 and 6 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Self Rating Depression Scale (SDS) is a psychiatric measuring instrument having descriptive words and phrases that indicate the severity of depression for a time period. Lower score means a better outcome. The minimum value is 20, and the maximum value is 80.</description>
