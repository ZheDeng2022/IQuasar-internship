  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia quality and safety have improved over the past decades, thanks to improved&#xD;
      monitoring devices. No nociception monitoring is currently part of the standard of care.&#xD;
      Usually, hemodynamic parameters are used to evaluate nociception (heart rate, HR, and mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure, MAP), but none of them are specific. However, nociception evaluation is&#xD;
      critical. Indeed, where excess of nociception can lead to arterial hypotension and&#xD;
      respiratory depression, insufficient nociception can lead to acute postoperative pain, which&#xD;
      is followed by persistent chronic pain in 10-50% of patients. Different monitoring devices&#xD;
      have been developed but none of them are still used in current practice. Recently developed,&#xD;
      the nociception level (NoL) index (MEDASENSE BIOMETRICS Ltd®, Ramat Gan, Israel) is an index&#xD;
      of nociception, based on a nonlinear algorithm combination of heart rate, heart rate&#xD;
      variability, photoplethysmograph wave amplitude, skin conductance, skin conductance&#xD;
      fluctuations, and their time derivatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robotic surgeries have started to spread over the world 20 years ago, claiming to be&#xD;
      mini-invasive with less hemorrhage complications, with better success based on the technical&#xD;
      advantages of the robot allowing better access during anatomical challenges procedures.&#xD;
      Robotic surgery has been suggested to decrease pain during surgery and post-operatively,&#xD;
      because of the decreases abdominal wall constraints induced by the robotic arms compared to&#xD;
      the surgeon arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational prospective non-interventional monocentric study intend to evaluate the&#xD;
      performance of the NoL index to discriminate protocol-defined nociceptive from non&#xD;
      nociceptive stimuli during robotic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients, scheduled for a robotic surgery procedure, will be orally informed about the&#xD;
      study during the anesthesia consultation. During the procedure, the anesthesia procedure will&#xD;
      be the same for all patients, as part of the usual care in our department. The NoL monitor&#xD;
      will be added for the purpose of this study, but the results will be hidden from all&#xD;
      physicians. All settings will be left the physician in charge. At the end of the surgical&#xD;
      procedure, before transfer to the recovery room, data for the monitor will be extracted on a&#xD;
      dedicated universal serial bus (USB) key. Files will be safely stored under RedCap before&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia quality and safety have improved over the past decades, thanks to improved&#xD;
      monitoring devices. Excess of anesthetics could lead to arterial hypotension which has been&#xD;
      shown to be associated with increased cardiovascular events. On the other hand, insufficient&#xD;
      anesthetics could lead to awareness and memorization during general anesthesia (GA). Whereas&#xD;
      almost all drugs currently used in the operating room (OR), have a validated monitoring tool,&#xD;
      no nociception monitoring is currently part of the standard of care. Usually, hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters are used to evaluate nociception (heart rate (HR), and mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      (MAP)), but none of them are specific and several factors in the OR influence these&#xD;
      parameters. There is growing interest in the literature for nociception monitoring. Indeed,&#xD;
      where excess of nociception can lead to arterial hypotension and respiratory depression,&#xD;
      insufficient nociception can lead to acute postoperative pain, which is followed by&#xD;
      persistent chronic pain in 10-50% of patients. Opioids per se can also induce nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, hyperalgesia for remifentanil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different monitoring devices, like the surgical pleth index, pupillometry or the &quot;Analgesia&#xD;
      Nociception Index&quot;, have been developed, based on several variables and algorithms, but none&#xD;
      of them are still used in current practice. One of the major reason is that although they&#xD;
      might had some effects on clinical parameters or drugs consumption, none of them had any&#xD;
      influence on patient outcome. Recently developed, the nociception level (NoL) index&#xD;
      (MEDASENSE BIOMETRICS Ltd®, Ramat Gan, Israel) is an index of nociception, based on a&#xD;
      nonlinear algorithm combination of heart rate, heart rate variability, photoplethysmograph&#xD;
      wave amplitude, skin conductance, skin conductance fluctuations, and their time derivatives.&#xD;
      One of the first study to report the ability of the NoL index to discriminate noxious from&#xD;
      non-noxious stimuli with high sensitivity and specificity was performed in 2016. In that&#xD;
      randomized trial (continuous infusion of remifentanil target 2 versus 4 ng/ml) enrolling 58&#xD;
      patients undergoing a large range of surgery, the NoL index was superior than the hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters alone to characterize nociception. In a study enrolling 72 patients randomized&#xD;
      within 6 remifentanil concentration targets undergoing several surgical procedures by the&#xD;
      same authors, the NoL index was not affected by remifentanil doses, whereas it had an&#xD;
      dose-dependent hemodynamic effect on HR and MAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robotic surgeries have started to spread over the world 20 years ago, claiming to be&#xD;
      mini-invasive with less hemorrhage complications, with better success based on the technical&#xD;
      advantages of the robot allowing better access during anatomical challenges procedures.&#xD;
      Debates recently arise based on the procedures cost and the little (or lack) of evidence of&#xD;
      mini-invasive procedures in patients with cancers. Robotic surgery has been suggested to&#xD;
      decrease pain during surgery and post-operatively, in gynecologic, thoracic, and general&#xD;
      procedures although results are controversial, because of the decreases abdominal wall&#xD;
      constraints induced by the robotic arms compared to the surgeon arms. To our knowledge, none&#xD;
      of these studies evaluated pain based on a nociception monitoring device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational prospective non-interventional monocentric study intend to evaluate the&#xD;
      performance of the NoL index to discriminate nociceptive from non nociceptive stimuli during&#xD;
      robotic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients, scheduled for a robotic surgery procedure, will be orally informed about the&#xD;
      study during the anesthesia consultation. During the procedure, the anesthesia procedure will&#xD;
      be the same for all patients, as part of the usual care in our department. Patients will be&#xD;
      closely monitored by electrocardiogram, intermittent blood pressure by arm cuff, continuous&#xD;
      pulse oximetry by finger probe, neuromuscular monitoring by train-of-four (TOF)-Cuff,&#xD;
      bispectral index (BIS) monitoring using the BIS forehead 4-sensor. The NoL monitor will be&#xD;
      added for the purpose of this study, but the results will be hidden. The probe will be placed&#xD;
      on the hand contralateral to the blood pressure arm cuff. Anesthesia will be delivered by&#xD;
      target-controlled infusion of remifentanil and propofol by two separate infusion pumps. Once&#xD;
      consciousness will be lost and a TOF calibration done, neuromuscular blockade will be&#xD;
      performed by rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg. All settings will be left the physician appreciation.&#xD;
      Different stimuli (nociceptive and non-nociceptive) are defined according to protocol (such&#xD;
      as intubation, incision, surgical haemostasia, urinary track catheter…) and their time of&#xD;
      arrival will be collected in a Case Report Form. At the end of the surgical procedure, before&#xD;
      transfer to the recovery room, data for the monitor will be extracted on a dedicated USB key.&#xD;
      Files will be safely stored under RedCap before analysis.&#xD;
