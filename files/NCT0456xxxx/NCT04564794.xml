      Stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy is a reference examination for the detection and&#xD;
      monitoring of coronary patients, and this examination has already been the subject of&#xD;
      multiple validation studies, including for the stratification of the prognosis of these&#xD;
      patients, information that can usefully guide therapeutic choices (medical treatment,&#xD;
      myocardial revascularization, ...). The arrival of new solid-state cameras has been a real&#xD;
      technological leap for this examination, making it possible to significantly improve the&#xD;
      quality of the images and also to drastically reduce the activities of injected&#xD;
      radiopharmaceuticals and thus the exposure of patients and staff to ionizing radiation.&#xD;
      Today, this reduction in the activity of injected radiopharmaceuticals is taking place in a&#xD;
      growing number of nuclear medicine departments. The injected activities are reduced up to a&#xD;
      third of those injected in the past (this is indeed the case in the population we propose to&#xD;
      study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the value of the prognostic stratification obtained with stress myocardial perfusion&#xD;
      scans recorded with low activity on semiconductor cameras is not yet known. In particular,&#xD;
      the implications are unknown in terms of the risk of death of the different parameters&#xD;
      studied (normal or abnormal examination, extent of myocardial ischemia and infarction&#xD;
      sequelae, impact on left ventricular function in post-stress and resting states, etc.).&#xD;
