  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial (RCT) was designed. Fourteen completely edentulous participants&#xD;
      were randomly allocated into two equal groups. All participants received two implants in the&#xD;
      inter-foraminal area with ball attachments. Participants in the control group were&#xD;
      rehabilitated with conventionally manufactured Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) maxillary&#xD;
      complete denture and mandibular implant overdentures while participants in intervention group&#xD;
      received digital light processed (DLP)-printed photo-polymerizable PMMA Nextdent maxillary&#xD;
      complete denture and mandibular implant overdentures. Follow-up appointments were scheduled&#xD;
      at 3,6, and 12 months where data of Oral Health Impact Profile 19(OHIPEDENT19) was used to&#xD;
      assess the OHRQoL (oral health related quality of life). In addition, denture retention was&#xD;
      measured using digital force gauge device. Data were collected and statistically analyzed.&#xD;

    <description>Oral Health Impact Profile 19 (OHIPEDENT19) was used to assess the OHRQoL (oral health related quality of life). The questionnaire was translated to Arabic and validated (S2).24 The profile consisted of 19 questions each with score 0 to 4 (impaired) on Likert scale; accordingly, for each patient the minimum score was 0 and maximum score was 76.</description>

    <measure>Overdentures' retention</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The retention was measured at baseline (day of delivery), three months thereafter, after six months then after 12m by a digital force gauge device (Extech's Model 475055 Digital Force Gauge FLIR Commercial Systems, Inc.) that measures tension or compression force (pull/push) to values of up to 980 Newton.25 The snap hook of the device engaged a screw fixed to the geometric center of denture bases using self-cure acrylic resin. Then pulling action was applied till the denture separation recording the amount of retention in Newton.</description>

    <description>The bite registration records with their corresponding master casts were digitalized using an extra oral desktop 3D scanner (3shape D850) and then stored as standard triangulation language (STL) files (Figure 1). The STL files were then imported to Dental system PREMIUM3 design software (3Shape Dental System 2018) for model analysis, surveying and blocking out, designing full permanent denture bases, and for virtual teeth set-up following the recorded inter-arch space</description>
