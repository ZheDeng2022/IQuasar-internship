    <textblock>
      This multicentre, randomised controlled trial will enrol 1000 patients presenting with septic&#xD;
      shock to the emergency department (ED) of participating hospitals in Australia and New&#xD;
      Zealand. Participants will receive haemodynamic resuscitation with either a restricted fluids&#xD;
      and early vasopressor regimen or a larger initial IV fluid volume with later introduction of&#xD;
      vasopressors if required. Clinical care including the type of resuscitation fluid and&#xD;
      vasopressor agent, will otherwise be in accordance with accepted standard care and according&#xD;
      to clinician discretion. The study intervention will be delivered for at least 6 hours and up&#xD;
      to 24 hours post-randomisation. Participants will be followed for up to 12 months and&#xD;
      outcomes analysed on an intention-to-treat basis.&#xD;

      The ARISE FLUIDS study is a multicentre, randomised, parallel group clinical trial of a&#xD;
      restricted fluids and early vasopressor strategy compared to a larger initial IV fluid volume&#xD;
      and later vasopressors for the haemodynamic resuscitation of patients with septic shock&#xD;
      presenting to the ED. It will be conducted in hospitals in Australia and New Zealand with&#xD;
      1000 patients recruited over a 3-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient meeting all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      randomised to receive haemodynamic resuscitation using either a restricted fluid and early&#xD;
      vasopressor regimen (vasopressors arm) or a larger initial fluid resuscitation volume (fluids&#xD;
      arm) followed by later introduction of vasopressors (if required). The intervention will be&#xD;
      commenced in the ED and delivered for at least 6 hours, and up to 24 hours post-randomisation&#xD;
      if admitted to the ICU or other critical care area where the study protocol can be faithfully&#xD;
      delivered. Treatment will revert to usual care as determined by the treating clinician when&#xD;
      the patient is transferred to a non-critical care ward. All enrolled participants will be&#xD;
      followed up and assessed for the defined study outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be identified using a systematic approach to screening and assessment of&#xD;
      patients with possible sepsis presenting to the ED in accordance with standard clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

If persisting hypotension and/or hypoperfusion commence a vasopressor infusion (e.g. noradrenaline) and titrate according to local practice to achieve target MAP.

    <description>An fluid bolus of up to 1000ml will be administered over a maximum of 1 hour, if required, for persisting hypotension and/or hypoperfusion. Reassess at least hourly to 6 hours post-randomisation, then as clinically required in conjunction with the protocol. Further IV fluid boluses of 500ml are recommended as clinically indicated to achieve the target MAP. The target MAP will be determined by the treating clinician. Haemodynamic resuscitation will be guided by usual clinical assessment including vital signs, mentation, perfusion, and urine output until the treating clinician determines fluid resuscitation is no longer clinically required. A minimum of 2-3 L (30 ml/kg), including pre-randomisation fluids, is recommended within 3 hours of ED arrival consistent with the SSC guidelines, unless clinically contraindicated. Vasopressors may be commenced if blood pressure remains below target despite optimal fluid resuscitation as determined by the treating clinician.</description>
