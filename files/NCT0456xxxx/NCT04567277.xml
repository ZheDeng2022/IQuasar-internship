  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute hydrocephalus is a common complication following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Early&#xD;
      and emergency insertion of external ventricular drain (EVD) is standard treatment of acute&#xD;
      post-SAH hydrocephalus. According to the high risk of infection associated with EVD, the&#xD;
      study evaluates the outcome of early EVD conversion to ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) in&#xD;
      poor-grade SAH patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was performed on patients diagnosed with high grade SAH (WFNS 4-5) who undergo EVD&#xD;
      within 24 hours of their admission. The conversion of EVD to VPS is performed within 7-10&#xD;
      days of EVD insertion, defined as early VPS group. The ventricular catheter is inserted in&#xD;
      lateral ventricle using the same burr hole of EVD or the contralateral Kocher's point. All&#xD;
      ruptured aneurysms could be closed by endovascular techniques or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to discontinuing EVD or its conversion to VPS within 7 to 10 days of insertion.&#xD;
      At day 5-7 of EVD insertion, the EVD level is elevated from 15 cmH2O to 25 centimeter of&#xD;
      water (cmH2O) gradually. The patients is evaluated during the 48 hours for cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid (CSF) volume discharge, neurological consciousness, and hydrocephalus within brain CT&#xD;
      scan acquired at the end of 48 hours of observation. If the daily CSF fluid discharge will be&#xD;
      greater than 100 ml, brain CT scan shows evidence of HCP, there is any CSF leak from around&#xD;
      the catheter, or the patient experiences GCS drop for 2 points or more, EVD is converted to&#xD;
      VPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVD conversion to VPS is postponed if there is any evidence of CSF infection within the last&#xD;
      CSF analysis obtained 48 hours before VPS placement, patient experiences fever (&gt;38.5Â° C)&#xD;
      without any other source, or there is any evidence of severe vasospasm in transcranial&#xD;
      Doppler (TCD) imaging or brain CT angiography. Otherwise, The EVD is discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients, a brain CT scan is taken to evaluate the location of shunt 24 hours after&#xD;
      VPS placement. Forty-eight hours after VPS placement, lumbar puncture (LP) is performed to&#xD;
      collect CSF for ruling out the possibility of shunt infection or ventriculitis. Shunt&#xD;
      malfunction (approved by imaging or signs of HCP) is reported if it occurred within 3 months&#xD;
      of VPS placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When VPS malfunction is diagnosed it is revised. CSF infection is considered if there is a&#xD;
      positive culture or ratio of CSF white blood cell count (WBC)/ red blood cell count (RBC) to&#xD;
      blood WBC/RBC was more than 3. All patients is evaluated for clinical condition using&#xD;
      modified Rankin scale (mRs) at discharge and 6 months later.&#xD;
