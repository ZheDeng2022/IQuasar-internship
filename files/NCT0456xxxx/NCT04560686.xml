  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well bintrafusp alfa before surgery works in treating&#xD;
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer for which the patient has not received treatment in&#xD;
      the past (untreated) and that can be removed by surgery (resectable). Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      bintrafusp alfa may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving bintrafusp alfa before surgery may help&#xD;
      lower the risk of the cancer coming back after surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the rate of major pathologic response (MPR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bintrafusp alfa intravenously (IV) on days 1, 15, and 29 in the absence of&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Within 4-6 weeks after last dose of bintrafusp alfa, patients undergo&#xD;
      surgery at the discretion of the treating surgeon. Within 8 weeks after surgery, patients may&#xD;
      receive chemotherapy or undergo radiation therapy at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 5 years.&#xD;
