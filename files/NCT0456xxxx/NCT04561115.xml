  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate bioequivalence of IVIG-PEG with Gamunex-C&#xD;
      (IVIG-C) at steady-state as determined by comparing total Immunoglobulin G (IgG) area under&#xD;
      the concentration-time curve during the defined dosing interval ([AUC0-τ] either every 3&#xD;
      weeks [AUC0-21 days] or every 4 weeks [AUC0-28 days]) and maximum concentration in a dosing&#xD;
      interval (Cmax) in participants diagnosed with primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI)&#xD;
      currently receiving chronic IVIG replacement treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive Gamunex-C by means of an infusion pump at an individualized dose (based on historical IVIG treatment dose) between 200 to 800 mg/kg per infusion at an infusion rate of 1 mL/kg/min or up to 8 mL/kg/min depending on participant tolerance. The subject's usual mg/kg dose (given on either a 3 or 4 week repeating schedule) will be the same mg/kg dose and schedule that the subject was receiving prior to entering screening. This mg/kg dose and schedule will be used throughout the study duration. Note that the weight of the subject will be measured at each visit and if the subject's weight changes, the actual weight at each visit will be used to calculate amount of drug (mg) to be administered. Gamunex-C will be administered every 3 weeks or 4 weeks for at least 6 or 5 doses for an approximate maximum duration of up to 6 months.</description>

             are not ≥500 mg/dL, the subject will be a Screen Failure, but may be rescreened&#xD;
