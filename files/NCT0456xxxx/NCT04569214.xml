      The purpose of the present clinical study is to test the efficacy of two doses of PAZ320 in&#xD;
      diabetic patients already on treatment with metformin, in order to assess and quantify its&#xD;
      effect on postprandial glucose and insulin levels after a standard meal composed of rice,&#xD;
      compared to placebo.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The extent and duration of PAZ320 effect on postprandial blood glucose levels in type II diabetic patients will be assessed under treatment with metformin, over 4 hours after the intake of a standard meal, using an implanted continuous glucose monitoring device.</description>

    <description>The secondary safety endpoint is number subjects with occurrences of following AEs: injury, surgery, accidents, or illnesses, and significant abnormalities in clinical laboratory values, psychological testing, or physical examination findings. In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure will be considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients diagnosed with type II diabetes since at least one year, not presenting any&#xD;
             complications of their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients under treatment with Metformin up to 3g/day, given twice or three times&#xD;
             daily. Metformin doses should not exceed 3g/day, and should be well tolerated by the&#xD;
             patients, its dose should have been stable for the last 3 months before inclusion in&#xD;
             the study. Metformin should be taken in the morning of the visit only after the test&#xD;
             meal is taken. The next doses of metformin will be taken with meals after the visit,&#xD;
             in the habitual order the patient is used to take. The patients should not stop taking&#xD;
             metformin during the study, but continue as usual, except that in the mornings of the&#xD;
             visits, as the patients arrive in fasting conditions, metformin should be taken after&#xD;
             the test meal. If a concomitant combination with an oral anti diabetic agent is given,&#xD;
             because of elevated HbA1c levels, it should be taken together with metformin after the&#xD;
             test meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age - between 35 and 65, male and female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Females should not be pregnant or breast feeding, women of child bearing potential&#xD;
             should guarantee anti-contraceptive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. BMI (body mass index) - between 25 and 32.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) lower than 9%, and higher than 6.5%, HbA1c&#xD;
             will be determined in the first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who are able to collaborate during the entire duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with other underlying diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, renal&#xD;
             disease, peripheral vascular disease or any condition considered to be a complication&#xD;
             of diabetes, should be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients treated with insulin subcutaneous injections or with GLP-1 agonists, or by&#xD;
             alpha-glucosidase inhibitors or by glinides should not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. HbA1c higher than 9%, or lower than 6.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women who are either pregnant or lactating&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participation in another clinical study in the month preceding recruitment into the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who cannot guarantee compliance.&#xD;
