  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator wish to provide a blend of two essential oils with comparable antiemetic&#xD;
      properties; Peppermint essential oil (Mentha x Piperita) and lemon tree essential oil (Citrus&#xD;
      Limon). Dry inhalation of these essential oils is safe, but effectiveness has not been&#xD;
      determined. Studies on the subject present a questionable methodology. This is why we are&#xD;
      proposing this study to measure the effectiveness of this mixture of essential oils on&#xD;
      chemo-induced nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a first step before a possible study to compare the effects of essential oils&#xD;
      with those of a placebo.&#xD;
