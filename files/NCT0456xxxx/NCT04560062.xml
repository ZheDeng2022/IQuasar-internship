  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol reflects the second part of a larger mixed-methods study aimed at exploring the&#xD;
      process by which global recommendations can be translated into context-specific,&#xD;
      evidence-informed action for diabetes prevention in low-resource settings. Firstly, a&#xD;
      retrospective cohort study will assess the current level of implementation of comprehensive&#xD;
      diabetes care over a 24-month period (2019-2020), by describing healthcare received and&#xD;
      health outcomes of a representative sample of diabetes patients currently accessing care in&#xD;
      the study region. Focus groups prompted by the findings of the retrospective study will be&#xD;
      used to inspire local innovations which will be evaluated through a prospective follow-up of&#xD;
      the cohort.&#xD;

      Objective: To evaluate the implementation of comprehensive diabetes care in two low-resource&#xD;
      settings in Ecuador.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess patient outcomes including biochemical diabetes control and health-related&#xD;
           quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate diabetes-related health care access.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess complications related to diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The sample size is proposed conservatively to ensure a precision to estimate&#xD;
      outcomes of 50% with an absolute precision of ±5%, assuming a design effect of 1.2 and&#xD;
      potential loss of 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample design: A representative sample for each district will be obtained by stratified&#xD;
      single-stage cluster sampling. The clusters are health facilities for which a sample of&#xD;
      patients will randomly selected. The sample will be stratified by facility type (Ministry of&#xD;
      Public Health (MSP) facilities, or Social Security facilities for affiliated workers) in&#xD;
      Quito and by Rural/Urban setting in Esmeraldas. Patient sampling will use the electronic&#xD;
      consultation registry of each selected facility where possible. Data unavailable in the&#xD;
      electronic registers will be extracted from any available paper files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection procedure: Research assistants will obtain the data mainly from health&#xD;
      services records, which will be supplemented by patient interviews including&#xD;
      socio-demographic and clinical data, perceived social support (the Multidimensional Scale of&#xD;
      Perceived Social Support, MSPSS) and health-related quality of life (the Diabetes Health&#xD;
      Profile-18, DHP-18) profile. They will collect data regarding whether the patient received&#xD;
      regular review by a clinician, and underwent screening for diabetes complications as&#xD;
      recommended in the 2017 Clinical Practice Guideline for Type 2 Diabetes in Ecuador. He/she&#xD;
      will record the date and details of any complications and experiences over the course of the&#xD;
      evaluation and other clinical data such as comorbidities, treatments or patient management by&#xD;
      a multidisciplinary health care team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first data collection will be retrospective and will include diabetes-related health care&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes during 2019 and 2020. Clinical files will be reviewed every 12 months&#xD;
      for the duration of follow-up (2 years). Supplementary interview data will be assessed on a&#xD;
      baseline and in the last 6 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: The researchers will calculate the proportion of patients that received care as per&#xD;
      the clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations and/or the proportion receiving an&#xD;
      intermediate level of care (as required). Proportions will be described with 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals. Variation in healthcare received and diabetes-related health will be described&#xD;
      using sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the patients to highlight potential&#xD;
      inequities. A multivariate logistic regression model may be used to explore the relationship&#xD;
      between the primary outcomes and socioeconomic explanatory variable and/or type of health&#xD;
      facility. If necessary, the researchers will adjust for potential confounders such as&#xD;
      patients' factors (e.g. sex, age, comorbidity, perceived social support) and/or environmental&#xD;
      factors (e.g. proximity to the health centre, availability of different medical specialties&#xD;
      or methods as laboratory test). Statistical analysis will be performed using Stata/SE&#xD;
      (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) Version 15.&#xD;
