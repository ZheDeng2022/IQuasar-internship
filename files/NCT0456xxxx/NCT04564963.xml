      &quot;Cryotherapy&quot;, or cold therapy, can include the use of gel packs, ice bags, ice baths, whole&#xD;
      body chambers, and cold aerosol sprays. It is a popular non-drug treatment that can be used&#xD;
      after a surgical operation, along with medication such as narcotics and anti-inflammatories&#xD;
      for pain management. The application of ice packs on areas of injury has been used for many&#xD;
      decades, as they can decrease both inflammation and pain. Other possible benefits include&#xD;
      reduced blood flow, swelling, and tissue damage as well as muscle spasms. While there is some&#xD;
      evidence to suggest that the use of ice packs is beneficial, this has not yet been&#xD;
      implemented into practice, nor do any guidelines recommend the use of ice packs for pain&#xD;
      management in surgical patients. In this trial, adult patients undergoing scheduled&#xD;
      thoracoabdominal or groin surgery will be randomly assigned to apply ice packs over the&#xD;
      largest closed surgical incision every 4 hours, at minimum, for 72 hours (while the patient&#xD;
      is awake), along with standard of care, or to receive standard of care only. This trial will&#xD;
      be conducted under the IMPACTS (Innovative, Multicentre, Patient-centred Approach to Clinical&#xD;
      Trials in Surgery) program umbrella and will follow IMPACTS methodology. For the Vanguard&#xD;
      trial, the aim is to determine the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial. Future&#xD;
      outcomes of interest are quality of patient recovery, pain, length of hospital stay and&#xD;
      medication use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background/rationale: To date, there is some evidence to suggest a benefit of cryotherapy&#xD;
      application over closed post-operative incisions, however, this has not yet been implemented&#xD;
      into practice. Furthermore, there are no clinical practice guidelines that recommend the&#xD;
      application of cryotherapy for adjuvant pain management. Relevant randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials (RCTs) in abdominal surgery demonstrate a possible advantage of cryotherapy&#xD;
      application, when compared to no cryotherapy application. However, those RCTs were small and&#xD;
      were restricted to gynecology procedures or emergent procedures. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      aim to address this knowledge gap by assessing the benefit of applying cryotherapy&#xD;
      post-operatively (along with standard of care approaches), compared to no cryotherapy, (i.e.,&#xD;
      standard of care, only) over closed incisions, across broad surgical specialties and&#xD;
      procedures, to improve the quality of patient recovery in adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Before embarking on a definitive RCT, this pilot trial has five specific&#xD;
      feasibility objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the investigators' ability to accrue patients using the IMPACTS Program design&#xD;
           platform at multiple institutions, over the course of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the investigators' ability to adaptively randomize patients and deliver the&#xD;
           randomized assignment using the IMPACTS Program design platform, over the course of one&#xD;
           year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the investigators' ability to collect complete data directly from participants&#xD;
           (patients and clinicians) on: narcotics use and surgical site infections over the course&#xD;
           of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To examine the investigators' ability to carry out data linkages using the IMPACTS&#xD;
           Program design platform over the course of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To estimate the change in quality of recovery to inform the sample size calculation for&#xD;
           the definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a multicentre, pragmatic, open label, two-arm parallel-group Vanguard&#xD;
      feasibility randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomized to cryotherapy&#xD;
      application or no cryotherapy application. If feasibility is demonstrated during the pilot&#xD;
      trial, the investigators will plan to conduct a definitive trial. If there are only minimal&#xD;
      changes to the protocol, the investigators will include data from the pilot phase into the&#xD;
      definitive trial analysis (i.e. a Vanguard design).&#xD;
