      Objective: To compare the effectiveness and complications of intraligamentary anesthesia&#xD;
      (ILA) with conventional inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) during injection and dental&#xD;
      treatment of mandibular posterior teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: In this randomized, prospective clinical trial, 72 patients (39 males,&#xD;
      33 females) patients scheduled for dental treatment of mandibular posterior teeth, were&#xD;
      randomly allocated to ILA group (n=35) received ILA injection or IANB group (n=37) received&#xD;
      the conventional IANB. Our primary outcome was to assess pain during the injection as well as&#xD;
      pain and stress (discomfort) during dental treatment, using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)&#xD;
      from 0 to 10 (0 = no pain, 10= the worst pain imaginable). Whereas; recording 24 hours&#xD;
      postoperative complications were our Secondary outcomes.&#xD;

      MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective randomized comparative clinical trial was conducted in&#xD;
      the integrated clinical course in the dental school of the University of Greifswald, Germany&#xD;
      after the approval of the local ethics committee of the medical faculty in Greifswald (No. BB&#xD;
      174/18) in a period from December 2018 to June 2019. The sample size calculation using&#xD;
      &quot;G*power version 3.1&quot; (Heinrich-Heine-University / Germany) was based on the following&#xD;
      estimates: T-test for means (difference between two independent means), effect size 0.7, α&#xD;
      error 0.05 and power (1-ß error) 0.9. It resulted in a samples size of 36 patients in each of&#xD;
      the two groups (IANB &amp; ILA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria The patients requiring regular dental in permanent&#xD;
      mandibular posterior teeth under local anesthesia were recruited with an age range of 18 to&#xD;
      50 years. Patients were not included if they had a clinical or radiographic sign of acute&#xD;
      abscess, pus or peri-radicular pathology. Also patients with a systemic disease requiring&#xD;
      special considerations during their dental treatment or patients with contra-indications for&#xD;
      any of the components of the anesthetic solution (allergy to articaine, epinephrine, and&#xD;
      sulfite) were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Treatment and Outcome Computer-generated randomization technique was applied to&#xD;
      allocate the participants to one of the both study groups (ILA vs. IANB). The intensity of&#xD;
      pain as well as stress during the injection of the local anesthesia and during the dental&#xD;
      procedure was assessed by using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS 0-10). The anesthesia was&#xD;
      performed by the clinical instructors of the course being dental practitioners (GDPs) or by&#xD;
      dental students in the 4th and 5th academic year in the integrated clinical course in the&#xD;
      dental school of the University of Greifswald and recorded as dentist or student. The&#xD;
      distributions of different experience level of clinical instructors, dental students in 4th&#xD;
      and 5th year were considered. For the inferior alveolar nerve block, the patient was placed&#xD;
      comfortably in a supine position on the dental chair. The start of the anesthetic procedure&#xD;
      was done without using topical anesthesia. The IANB injection was administered with cannulas&#xD;
      of 38 mm in length and a gauge of 0.4 mm (Sopira Carpule, Heraeus Kulzer GmbH Hanau,&#xD;
      Germany). The patients were anesthetized with Ultracain DS Forte 1:100.00 (Sanofi Aventis,&#xD;
      Germany), the active ingredient being articaine in 1.7 ml ampules (1 ml equal to 40 mg&#xD;
      articaine hydrochloride and 0.012 mg epinephrine hydrochloride, which is included as a&#xD;
      vasoconstrictor). Once the bone was contacted, 1.5 ml of anesthetic solution was injected&#xD;
      slowly. Subsequently the needle was detached for approximately 1 cm and an addition of&#xD;
      0.3-0.5 ml of local anesthetic solution was injected to anesthetize the lingual nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the intraligamentary anesthesia, three different syringe systems were used with&#xD;
      randomized selection: Softjet syringe (Henke-Sass Wolf, Tuttlingen, Germany), Citojet syringe&#xD;
      (Sopira, Heraeus Kulzer GmbH Hanau, Germany), Ultrajet syringe (Sanofi-Aventis, Frankfurt am&#xD;
      Main, Germany). The patients were also placed in a supine position and the dentist&#xD;
      administered the ILA injection without using topical anesthesia with cannulas of 12 mm in&#xD;
      length and a gauge of 0.30 mm (Sopira Carpule, Heraeus Kulzer GmbH Hanau, Germany). Also,&#xD;
      Ultracain DS Forte 1:100.000 (Sanofi Aventis, Germany) was used from 1.7 ml ampules. The&#xD;
      needle was navigated through the gingival sulcus with the bevel towards the alveolar bone and&#xD;
      away from the root surface, at an angle of 30°-40° to the long axis of the tooth and 2- 3 mm&#xD;
      into the periodontal ligament space between root and alveolar bone. For each root, 0.2 ml of&#xD;
      local anesthetic was injected over at least 20 seconds according to Endo et al. (2008) as&#xD;
      well as Bender and Taubenheim (2014).&#xD;
