  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a supervised,&#xD;
      online-delivered, individualized, physical activity program in a sample of post-active&#xD;
      treatment breast cancer survivors. The proposed intervention will use a 2-arm randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial study design to compare a 12-week resistance-based physical activity program&#xD;
      to an attention control (i.e., printed individualized physical activity program) group on&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability and changes in strength as measured by 10 repetition maximum&#xD;
      (10RM). Both groups will wear accelerometers. The main hypothesis is that participants&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention arm will rate the online-delivered physical activity program&#xD;
      as feasible and acceptable compared to attention control participants. The overall rationale&#xD;
      is that delivering a physical activity intervention online may increase uptake of the&#xD;
      intervention, which may lead to maintained physical activity behavior and associated health&#xD;
      benefits. The primary outcomes are feasibility as measured by participant retention and&#xD;
      acceptability as measured by adherence to physical activity program (recorded by physical&#xD;
      activity log). Secondary outcomes include changes in strength as measured by 10RM,&#xD;
      objectively measured physical activity levels as measured by the accelerometer, satisfaction,&#xD;
      physical functioning and health-related quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The project will use a 2-arm randomized controlled trial study. The intervention will include&#xD;
      a 12, weekly, supervised, online-delivered, individualized resistance-based exercise program.&#xD;
      The attention control arm will include a printed, individualized resistance-based physical&#xD;
      activity program. A total of 50 breast cancer survivors will be recruited from Rutgers Cancer&#xD;
      Institute of New Jersey (CINJ) and randomized to one of two study arms. The intervention arm&#xD;
      will test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention compared to the control arm,&#xD;
      which will receive a printed or digital copy of an individualized physical activity program.&#xD;
      Participants from both arms will receive an accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X+), resistance bands&#xD;
      (TheraBandÂ®), and additional free weights (if required). Outcome measures will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline (pre-intervention) and Week 12 (post-intervention). Data collection will occur both&#xD;
      in-person and online. Data will be both objective (10RM, functional strength, physical&#xD;
      activity measured by accelerometers, physical function assessments, and attendance) and&#xD;
      subjective (self-reported physical activity program adherence, satisfaction, physical&#xD;
      activity levels, health-related quality of life, and exercise and barrier self-efficacy).&#xD;

    <description>Participants will engage in 12, weekly, supervised, exercise sessions using Zoom with the exercise trainer. Once a week, the exercise trainer and participant will each onto Zoom from their locations to begin the supervised exercise session. The exercise trainer will record all sessions. Sessions will be 30-45-minutes long and be structured as follows: review of previous session and an opportunity to ask questions; 5-minute warm-up; 20-25-minute workout; 5-10-minute cool down and reminder of next session and/or data collection time period. Supervised sessions will be scheduled once a week over the 12-week intervention. Participants will be expected to complete their resistance-based physical activity program for an additional 1-2 days a week as per the intervention schedule to meet as physical activity guidelines. The exercise trainer will track participant attendance. During the session, participants must have another person in the same location incase of an emergency.</description>
