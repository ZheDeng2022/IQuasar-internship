      The main objective of our study is to determine whether asymptomatic influenza virus carriage&#xD;
      is associated with an increased risk of post-operative Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome&#xD;
      (ARDS) after cardiac surgery. Cardiac surgery patients are particularly at risk of developing&#xD;
      ARDS with an estimated incidence of 5-10% based on the most recent data.&#xD;

      The primary objective of our study is to determine whether asymptomatic influenza virus&#xD;
      carriage is associated with an increased risk of post-operative Acute Respiratory Distress&#xD;
      Syndrome (ARDS) after cardiac surgery. Cardiac surgery patients are particularly at risk of&#xD;
      developing ARDS, with an estimated incidence of 5-10% based on the most recent data. Acute&#xD;
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is an acute pulmonary attack of inflammatory origin.&#xD;
      ARDS is the main cause of hypoxemic postoperative respiratory distress. Hospital mortality&#xD;
      associated with ARDS is estimated at 35-46% depending on the degree of severity, and&#xD;
      survivors are at increased risk of cognitive decline, depression, post-traumatic stress, or&#xD;
      musculoskeletal weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, asymptomatic carriage of respiratory viruses, including the influenza virus, has&#xD;
      been identified as a potential risk factor for respiratory complications, including ARDS,&#xD;
      after cardiac surgery. In a monocentric observational cohort, Groeneveld et al. recently&#xD;
      reported that performing scheduled cardiac surgery during the influenza season was associated&#xD;
      with a significantly longer duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation and a higher&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative ARDS compared to surgery performed outside the influenza season&#xD;
      (OR 1.85 95%CI 1.06-3.23 p=0.03). While it is estimated that up to 77% of patients with&#xD;
      positive influenza tests are asymptomatic in the general population, the authors hypothesized&#xD;
      that asymptomatic viral lung carriage would act as pulmonary priming, which, in combination&#xD;
      with other types of pulmonary attacks encountered during surgery, would predispose to the&#xD;
      genesis of ARDS. However, Groeneveld et al. had not tested any respiratory viruses in their&#xD;
      cohort. In addition, the relatively higher influenza vaccination rate in the Netherlands in&#xD;
      this at-risk population (77%) suggests that other types of respiratory viruses may have&#xD;
      contributed to the observed effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data are of major interest. Indeed, in France, during the 2017-2018 epidemic season,&#xD;
      the vaccination rate of individuals at risk was only 46%, with an estimated vaccine efficacy&#xD;
      of only 54% in elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine if there is an association between asymptomatic&#xD;
      carriage of respiratory virus, especially influenza virus, and the occurrence of&#xD;
      post-operative complications, morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an association between asymptomatic carriage of influenza virus, or other respiratory&#xD;
      viruses, and the occurrence of post-operative respiratory complications, including ARDS, is&#xD;
      confirmed, a policy of routine immunization prior to cardiac surgery or postponement of&#xD;
      scheduled surgery in the event of a positive viral test could be a simple and inexpensive&#xD;
      strategy to reduce these complications after cardiac surgery. Pre-emptive antiviral therapy&#xD;
      could be discussed when neither of these strategies is possible (e.g., emergency surgery).&#xD;
