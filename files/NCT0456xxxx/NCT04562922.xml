  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LEO trial was designed to assess the benefit of administering LifeMel to prevent&#xD;
      myelotoxicity in patients affected by solid neoplasm undergoing antiblastic chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment at low to moderate risk of febrile neutropenia. Secondary endpoints of LEO trial&#xD;
      were assessing impact of LifeMel in preventing anaemia and thrombocytopenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LEO trial was designed to assess the benefit of administering LifeMel, a honey from bees&#xD;
      obtained using Zuf Globus Ltd technology, produced in Israel and listed by the Ministry of&#xD;
      Health in Italy as a food supplement. This study aims to highlight a possible role of Lifemel&#xD;
      in preventing neutropenic events, as well as reducing anaemia and thrombocytopenia following&#xD;
      the administration of chemotherapy in patients with a histological or clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      solid neoplasia undergoing first-line chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>Neutrophil count has been measured the same day or the day before starting every chemotherapy cycle and at expected nadir (between the 7th and 12th day after chemotherapy) in the first 3 months.&#xD;
A patient was considered 'responder' if no episodes of neutropenia was observed during first 3 months of chemotherapy.</description>
