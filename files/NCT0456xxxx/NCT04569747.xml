  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of HER2-directed therapies (trastuzumab and&#xD;
      pertuzumab) and hormonal therapy as a treatment after surgery for hormone receptor positive&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab given as an injection under the skin&#xD;
           (PHESGO)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hormonal (endocrine) Treatment&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      laboratory evaluations, physical exams, questionnaires, and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive HER2-directed treatment for 1 year and hormonal therapy for&#xD;
           approximately 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that about 375 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug combination to learn whether the drug works in&#xD;
      treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug combination is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs trastuzumab and pertuzumab are both monoclonal antibodies, which are&#xD;
      disease-fighting proteins made by cloned immune cells. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) has approved trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab + pertuzumab subcutaneous fixed&#xD;
      dose combination (PHESGO) as treatment for HER2 positive breast cancer. The FDA has also&#xD;
      approved hormonal therapies as treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HER2-positive T1 histologically confirmed invasive carcinoma of the breast. Patients&#xD;
             must have node-negative (N0) or micrometastases (N1mi) breast cancer according to the&#xD;
             AJCC 8th edition anatomic staging table.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the patient has had a negative sentinel node biopsy, then no further axillary&#xD;
                  dissection is required, and the patient is determined to be node-negative.&#xD;
                  Axillary nodes with single cells or tumor clusters ≤ 0.2 mm by either H&amp;E or&#xD;
                  immunohistochemistry (IHC) will be considered node-negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any axillary lymph node with tumor clusters between 0.02 and 0.2cm is considered&#xD;
                  a micrometastasis. Patients with a micrometastasis are eligible. An axillary&#xD;
                  dissection is not required to be performed in patients with a micrometastasis&#xD;
                  found by sentinel node evaluation. In cases where the specific pathologic size of&#xD;
                  lymph node involvement is subject to interpretation, the overall principal&#xD;
                  investigator will make the final determination as to eligibility. The&#xD;
                  investigator must document approval in the patient medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have an area of T1aN0, ER+ (defined as ≥ 10%), HER2-negative cancer&#xD;
                  in either breast, in addition to their primary HER2 positive tumor, are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For unifocal disease, all invasive disease must have been tested for ER and PR (for&#xD;
             multifocal disease, see below). Either ER or PR must be positive, defined as ER ≥10%&#xD;
             or PR ≥10%. ER- and PR-assays should be performed by immunohistochemical methods&#xD;
             according to the local institution standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HER2-positive by ASCO CAP 2018 guidelines, confirmed by central testing. See Appendix&#xD;
             I for ASCO CAP 2018 HER2 testing guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: DCIS components will not be counted in the determination of HER2 status&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: HER-2 status must be confirmed to be positive by central review prior to&#xD;
                  patient starting protocol therapy. Patients previously having had HER2 testing by&#xD;
                  NeoGenomics do not need to undergo retesting for central confirmation of HER2&#xD;
                  status. A pathology report documenting testing by NeoGenomics should be provided&#xD;
                  at time of patient registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilateral breast cancers that individually meet eligibility criteria are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with multifocal or multicentric disease are eligible as long as each tumor&#xD;
             individually meets eligibility criteria, with the following exceptions: (1) central&#xD;
             confirmation of HER2 status is needed only for any site of disease that is tested to&#xD;
             be HER2-positive by local testing (unless original testing was done by NeoGenomics);&#xD;
             (2) all areas that were locally tested for ER and PR status must be ER/PR positive (as&#xD;
             defined above).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of ipsilateral DCIS are eligible as long as the patient has&#xD;
             not received prior hormonal therapy. Patients with a history of contralateral DCIS are&#xD;
             not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≤ 90 days between the date of protocol registration and the patient's most recent&#xD;
             breast surgery for this breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have undergone definitive breast surgery for the current malignancy. All&#xD;
             tumor should be removed by either a modified radical mastectomy or a segmental&#xD;
             mastectomy (lumpectomy), with either a sentinel node biopsy or axillary dissection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -- All margins should be clear of invasive cancer or DCIS (i.e. no tumor on ink). The&#xD;
             local pathologist must document negative margins of resection in the pathology report.&#xD;
             If all other margins are clear, a positive posterior (deep) margin is permitted,&#xD;
             provided the surgeon documents that the excision was performed down to the pectoral&#xD;
             fascia and all tumor has been removed. Likewise, if all other margins are clear, a&#xD;
             positive anterior (superficial; abutting skin) margin is permitted provided the&#xD;
             surgeon documents that all tumor has been removed. Radiation therapy to the conserved&#xD;
             breast is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May have received up to 8 weeks of hormonal therapy as adjuvant treatment for this&#xD;
             cancer. Patients should otherwise not have received prior hormonal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior oophorectomy (including for cancer therapy) is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing breast conservation therapy (i.e. lumpectomy) must not have any&#xD;
             contraindications to radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have participated in a window study (treatment with an investigational&#xD;
             agent prior to surgery for ≤2 weeks) are eligible. Patients must have discontinued the&#xD;
             investigational agent at least 14 days before participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women with any menopausal status ≥18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1&#xD;
