    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized control trial design to evaluate the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      hospital based violence intervention program. Participants will be randomized into a&#xD;
      &quot;treatment as usual&quot; group who will receive written referrals for services and an &quot;enhanced&#xD;
      services&quot; group who will receive intensive case management over a one year period. Primary&#xD;
      outcome will be rate of violent reinjury after enrollment. Follow-up will be for one year.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential study participants are all adult, male survivors of community violence treated at&#xD;
      the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a potential study participant is screened and deemed eligible for participation in the&#xD;
      study consent will be obtained to participate in the study. At stage one a participant can&#xD;
      either accept or refuse services and at stage two can consent or refuse to consent in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient consents to both receive services and participate in the study, the participant&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to either the &quot;Treatment as Usual&quot; (TAU) intervention, which&#xD;
      receives the referral card for services, or the &quot;Enhanced Treatment&quot; (ET) intervention prior&#xD;
      to assessment so that the results of the assessment do not influence program staff which&#xD;
      group the potential study participant is assigned. At the beginning of the study, 400&#xD;
      identical envelopes will be created, 200 with a slip of paper labeled &quot;Treatment as Usual&quot;&#xD;
      and 200 with a slip of paper labeled &quot;Enhanced Treatment.&quot; These will be shuffled and will be&#xD;
      used to assign the random group of those patients that consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who refuse services and refuse the study will not be included in the study. Finally,&#xD;
      those who accept services but refuse to be in the study will not be in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will take place in five stages. At stage one, after consenting to&#xD;
      the study and being randomly assigned to TAU or ET care groups, the patient will undergo an&#xD;
      interview. The interview will take place at bedside granted that privacy can be guaranteed or&#xD;
      in an office if the patient is mobile. In some cases it may be appropriate to set up an&#xD;
      appointment after discharge to conduct the interview. Patients that agree to participate in&#xD;
      the study will be entered into a secure Excel Database on a MedStar password protected&#xD;
      server. Only study personnel will have access to this database, which will contain a key with&#xD;
      patient name and a unique identifier. This database will also be used to assess study quality&#xD;
      measures of approaches to eligible participants and percent uptake. This database and the&#xD;
      signed consents will have identifiable patient information. An additional SpreadSheet Web&#xD;
      tool, provided by the DC Department of Health Office of Victims Services and Justice Grants&#xD;
      will be used to track outcomes and follow-up of participants. This will include only&#xD;
      de-identified information. The internal secure Excel database will have a link between&#xD;
      patient name and unique identifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At stage two, the participant engages the project depending on which group they are in. Those&#xD;
      in the ET group will receive a case manager whereas those in the TAU group will receive a&#xD;
      referral card. Those in the ET will receive case management services and receive information&#xD;
      and other counseling services whereas those who receive the referral card will be expected to&#xD;
      engage the services on the referral cards provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At stage three, the study participants will be asked to conduct a smaller interview at month&#xD;
      6 after entry into the program to determine subsequent injury. The results of this interview&#xD;
      will be recorded in the DC DOH-OVSJG SpreadSheet Web tool. In addition, partnership with&#xD;
      CRISP (Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients) will be used to actively&#xD;
      query whether or not participants have been seen in regional hospitals, EDs, or outpatient&#xD;
      settings for repeat violent injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRISP is a regional health information system and is entirely HIPAA compliant and has health&#xD;
      information level security. It has been designated as Maryland's statewide health information&#xD;
      exchange. Under a contract with CRISP, each site will be able to securely submit the names of&#xD;
      patients that have agreed to participate in research. CRISP will then send notifications of&#xD;
      patient care and each site will be able to have accurate follow-up of the main outcome&#xD;
      (recidivism). This will allow validation of answers from telephone interviews at 6 and 12&#xD;
      months as well as gain accurate information on those participants that may be lost to&#xD;
      follow-up. Patient information is relayed securely using specially designed HIPAA and&#xD;
      confidentiality compliant email addresses, created for this purpose. All participants will&#xD;
      specifically be asked for their permission to access CRISP for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At stage four, approximately twelve months after entry into the study, the study participants&#xD;
      will be engaged in the post-interview. Answers to this post-interview will be recorded and&#xD;
      tracked in the DC DOH OVSJG SpreadSheet Web de-identified database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage five will entail an invitation to a focus group. Four focus groups will be conducted&#xD;
      after the quantitative data collection. Two of the focus groups will focus on those who have&#xD;
      not successfully completed the program and two more will randomly sample among those who have&#xD;
      successfully completed the program. The four focus groups will have no more than seven&#xD;
      individuals. Focus groups will be conducted in a private, unlabeled conference room at the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;

    <description>In enhanced services, the provision of services go beyond just referring a patient and leaving them to follow-through on their own accord. ES varies based on resources, model of service delivery, philosophy, and role and responsibilities of team members. Enhanced services usually includes longer-term case management which can then facilitate the connection to clinical counseling, victim assistance, familial assistance, legal assistance, emergency financial funding, transportation for subsequent appointments related to a patient's medical condition, employment assistance, and assistance in educational program enrollment.</description>
