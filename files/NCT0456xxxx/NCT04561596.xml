  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to compare patients anxiety and pain during percutaneous vascular&#xD;
      interventions with and without virtual reality autohypnosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants in the control group will be treated under local anesthesia, following the&#xD;
      usual care protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the experimental group will be treated under the same conditions, except&#xD;
      that they will experience virtual reality autohypnosis during the intervention.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Per procedural anxiety.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Immediately after the peripheral vascular intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Per procedural anxiety, measured by the Spielberger Anxiety State Inventory in French (Gauthier and Bouchard, 1993).&#xD;
The Spielberger Anxiety State Inventory is a self questionnaire of 20 items, each item scores from 1 to 4. The result of the test is the sum of the 20 items, therefore the result ranges from 20 to 80. A high score is related to a high level of anxiety at the moment of the test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Per procedural pain.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Immediately after the peripheral vascular intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Per procedural pain, measured by the visual analog pain scale. The visual analog pain scale rates pain from 0 to 10, 0 being the least pain imaginable and 10 the maximal pain imaginable.</description>

    <description>Participant arrive in our day care clinic and is prepared as any other patient in interventional radiology. The investigator will collect the signed informed consent form and proceed to randomization.&#xD;
The participant will then fill the pre and post-operative anxiety and pain questionnaire.&#xD;
The percutaneous vascular procedure will be performed as usual except for the virtual reality mask and autohypnosis software that will run during the whole intervention.&#xD;
Pain and anxiolytic medication are provided if needed during the intervention. Immediately after the intervention, the participant will fill the post-operative anxiety and pain questionnaire. The participant will be instructed to report anxiety and pain felt during the intervention.&#xD;
A clinical visit at 3 month is conducted as part of the standard clinical protocol. The participant will fill a 3rd questionnaire about the remembered anxiety and pain during the intervention.</description>
