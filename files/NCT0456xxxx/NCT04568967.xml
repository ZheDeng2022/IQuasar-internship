  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to assess the potential of an expanded TB testing strategy&#xD;
      to increase the number of HIV-positive patients with microbiologically diagnosed TB who are&#xD;
      started on treatment in adult wards of sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of an expanded TB screening strategy among HIV-positive patients&#xD;
      admitted to hospital (including sputum Ultra, urine FujiLAM and urine Ultra assay) on the&#xD;
      proportion of microbiologically-confirmed TB cases starting treatment within 72 hours of&#xD;
      enrolment compared to Ultra (on sputum/any tissue) on symptomatic patients only and AlereLAM&#xD;
      (on urine) in those fulfilling WHO testing recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      to assess the impact of this screening strategy on 2-month all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • to assess the feasibility of multiple specimens' collection for TB diagnosis within 72&#xD;
      hours of enrolment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>72 hours after enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of participants diagnosed with microbiologically confirmed TB and started on TB treatment within 72 hours of enrolment, separately for intervention and control arm. The numerator is the number of HIV-positive patients per study arm who are diagnosed with microbiologically confirmed TB and start on treatment within 72 hours of enrolment. The denominator is the number of participants enrolled per study arm. We will compare this indicator between both study arms.</description>

    <description>Eight-week all-cause mortality (main secondary endpoint) among all participants enrolled. The numerator will be number of deaths during eight weeks after enrolment, the denominator is the number of participants enrolled. We will compare this indicator between both study arms.</description>

    <description>The proportion of participants who are diagnosed with TB (irrespective of bacteriological confirmation) and started TB treatment within 72 hours of enrolment. The numerator is the number of participants diagnosed with TB (with or without bacteriological confirmation) who started treatment within 72 hours of enrolment; the denominator is the number of participants enrolled.</description>

    <description>The intervention arm for this trial consists of testing expectorated sputum and concentrated urine with Ultra and urine with FujiLAM, regardless of presence of TB compatible symptoms.&#xD;
To fulfil exploratory objectives we will also collect tongue and stool/rectal swabs in this arm for Xpert Ultra testing.</description>

    <description>The control arm for this trial will consist of:&#xD;
Sputum Ultra whenever the patient has cough, fever, weight loss or night sweats and/or Ultra on any tissue (including lymph nodes) from patients with suspected extrapulmonary TB.&#xD;
&amp; Urine Alere TB-LAM, if patients have signs and symptoms of TB (pulmonary and/or extrapulmonary), or with advanced HIV disease,or who are seriously ill, or else irrespective of signs and symptoms of 3 TB and with a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm .&#xD;
These testing guidelines are the current WHO recommended TB testing practices for HIV positive inpatients (as of Q1 2020).</description>
