      Colorectal cancer is the second deadliest malignant tumor worldwide, and liver is the most&#xD;
      common site of hematogenic metastasis of Colorectal cancer. Surgery is an effective treatment&#xD;
      for colorectal cancer with liver metastasis, however, only 10%-20% of patients with liver&#xD;
      metastasis are feasible for radical surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the early 1990s, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was first applied in the treatment of liver&#xD;
      metastases. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, microwave ablation (MWA), irreversible&#xD;
      electroporation (IRE) and other technologies emerged. Today, with the continuous improvement&#xD;
      of ablation techniques, many single-center retrospective studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      thermal ablation for liver metastases is comparable to surgery. Currently, institutions have&#xD;
      conducted multi-center randomized controlled trials to compare the outcomes of the two&#xD;
      treatment approaches. The expert consensus of tumor ablation therapy has confirmed that the&#xD;
      ablation technique has the advantages of minimally invasive, well tolerated and low&#xD;
      complications, and has been widely used in the treatment of solid tumors. In the treatment of&#xD;
      liver metastases, it also has the advantage of not being limited by residual liver volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative tumor recurrence occurred in about 2/3 of the patients with liver stump, mainly&#xD;
      due to the residual microscopic cancer foci. Chemotherapy can kill the microscopic cancer&#xD;
      foci of the liver. EORTC (40983) confirmed that: compared with surgery alone, perioperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy for resectable liver metastases (&lt;4) could benefit patients with PFS and reduce&#xD;
      the incidence of tumor progression-related events. EORTC (40004) proved that in the treatment&#xD;
      of non-resectable liver metastases (1 ~ 10, with a maximum diameter &lt;4cm), ablation combined&#xD;
      with postoperative chemotherapy was superior to chemotherapy alone. E. Tanis et al compared&#xD;
      two randomized controlled trials of EORTC for colorectal cancer liver metastasis, namely&#xD;
      40983 (EPOC) and 40004 (CLOCC), and confirmed the treatment of liver metastasis (&lt;3cm) after&#xD;
      integration. There was no significant difference in local recurrence rate between the RFA+&#xD;
      postoperative chemotherapy group and the surgery + perioperative chemotherapy group. At the&#xD;
      beginning, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was designed to provide surgical resection opportunities&#xD;
      for patients who could not be resected with metastatic tumor. Later, it was gradually applied&#xD;
      to resectable liver metastasis. Studies on surgical combination with chemotherapy proved that&#xD;
      preoperative chemotherapy was no less effective than postoperative chemotherapy for&#xD;
      resectable liver metastasis. However, for isolated small metastatic tumors (&lt;3cm), complete&#xD;
      tumor response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be avoided, leading to the dilemma of&#xD;
      inoperable. Studies have reported that ablation combined with preoperative chemotherapy can&#xD;
      cause hepatic steatosis and tumor shrinkage, which makes tumor visualization difficult to a&#xD;
      certain extent. If the tumor disappeared on imaging, the pathological specimen confirmed that&#xD;
      there were still residues, and the tumor could &quot;reappear&quot; during follow-up. Therefore, the&#xD;
      timing of ablation-related chemotherapeutic administration still needs to be explained, and&#xD;
      there is still a lack of high-quality evidence-based medical evidence at home and abroad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of thermal ablation or&#xD;
      combined with perioperative chemotherapy and postoperative chemotherapy in the treatment of&#xD;
      colon cancer with liver metastasis.&#xD;
