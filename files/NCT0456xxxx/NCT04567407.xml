      To evaluate the efficacy of bilateral continuous erector spinae blocks (BESB) for&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia in children and adolescents undergoing cardiac surgical procedures&#xD;
      via sternotomy in the Early Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) program in a single arm, open&#xD;
      label, interventional study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Regional anesthesia-and pediatric regional anesthesia in particular-is a rapidly evolving&#xD;
      subfield of anesthesia practice driven with considerable urgency by the growing recognition&#xD;
      that even appropriate perioperative opioid administration can have significant deleterious&#xD;
      long-term effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthetics can provide targeted, continuous analgesia to select dermatomes with&#xD;
      minimal additional patient risk and as such, have become routine components of opioid-sparing&#xD;
      intraoperative and postoperative pain management plans for non-cardiac surgical patients at a&#xD;
      single institution. In addition to the postulated benefit of reducing overall opioid exposure&#xD;
      (and potentially reducing the risk for long term physiologic and behavioral dependence upon&#xD;
      opioids), regional anesthetics may allow for earlier extubation after selected surgeries,&#xD;
      shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stays, shorter inpatient admissions, earlier mobilization,&#xD;
      fewer gastrointestinal complications, and improved patient and care team satisfaction scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, regional anesthetics have been avoided in cardiac surgery as most patients are&#xD;
      pharmacologically anticoagulated during their procedures and are thus at increased risk for&#xD;
      bleeding. This is particularly worrisome in the pediatric cardiac surgical population as many&#xD;
      of these children remain intubated for an extended period of time postoperatively and&#xD;
      therefore may not have reliable neurological exams in the setting of neuraxial regional&#xD;
      anesthetics-potentially resulting in unrecognized hemorrhage-related acquired neurological&#xD;
      deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the erector spinae block (ESB) has become popular for providing analgesia after a&#xD;
      number of anterior chest and abdominal procedures. This simple interfascial plane block can&#xD;
      reliably provide unilateral chest and/or abdominal wall analgesia. It has been described in&#xD;
      numerous case reports and case series as an effective block for management of unilateral&#xD;
      thoracotomies, unilateral rib fractures, unilateral abdominal incisions and most notably, for&#xD;
      management of post-sternotomy pain when applied bilaterally. New case reports and series&#xD;
      involving the ESB are being published almost weekly with a growing number of manuscripts&#xD;
      specific to cardiac surgical applications. Indeed, numerous randomized controlled trials have&#xD;
      investigated the analgesic efficacy of bilateral erector spinae plane blocks (BESB) compared&#xD;
      with conventional treatment for pain after cardiac surgery in adult patients and have been&#xD;
      published recently (2018-2019) with promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an interfascial plane block in a compressible anatomical space, the ESB is considered safe&#xD;
      in anticoagulated (or recently anticoagulated) patients. It is fast becoming a preferred&#xD;
      anesthetic option at BCH for anticoagulated patients - as opposed to neuraxial (e.g.&#xD;
      epidural) and paraneuraxial blocks (i.e. paravertebral) nerve blocks, which are largely&#xD;
      contraindicated in this setting. Further, given its relative ease of placement, apparent&#xD;
      efficacy and safety profile, it is increasingly becoming a standard option for patients&#xD;
      undergoing a wide range of thoracic, abdominal and thoraco-abdominal procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently investigated the feasibility of performing these blocks&#xD;
      bilaterally in a pediatric cardiac surgical population undergoing sternotomy-based procedures&#xD;
      (IRB-P00031524). At the conclusion of this 10-patient pilot, the investigators found that&#xD;
      performing these blocks was technically feasible, requiring 30 minutes or less of OR time,&#xD;
      resulting in no known complications. Furthermore, the data suggested an approximate 25%&#xD;
      reduction in rescue opioid requirements in the first 48 hours amongst the erector spinae&#xD;
      group (p=0.048).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to best evaluate the efficacy of this block in the pediatric cardiac population, a&#xD;
      blinded, randomized and controlled trial would be ideal. However, given that randomization&#xD;
      could be challenging and the fact that blinding would not be feasible, the investigators&#xD;
      believe an observational prospective cohort study is most appropriate at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, the investigators propose to evaluate the comparative efficacy of BESB versus&#xD;
      matched historical controls who received standard of care pain management (systemic opioid&#xD;
      therapy) for patients undergoing cardiac surgery via sternotomy by means of a single arm,&#xD;
      open label, interventional study that will compare as the primary outcome rescue analgesic&#xD;
      requirements, rendered as opiate equivalents, at 12, 24 and 48 hours, and the 24 hour period&#xD;
      preceding both 72 and 96 hours postoperatively. 'Efficacy' will be considered as a threshold&#xD;
      of clinical significance being defined as a 15% difference). In addition to the primary&#xD;
      endpoint, we plan to evaluate the duration of intubation, length of ICU stay, median pain&#xD;
      scores, incidence of PONV (postoperative nausea and vomiting; 0-6h, 6-12h and overall), time&#xD;
      to mobilization and adverse events between these groups. Postoperative data collected from&#xD;
      standard clinical follow-up tools, such as return to baseline sleep and activity status as&#xD;
      well as pain medication requirements at home, will also be compared. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to evaluate the quality of sleep and activity with a smart watch (Fitbitâ„¢&#xD;
      ) during the perioperative period in the BESB group only.&#xD;
