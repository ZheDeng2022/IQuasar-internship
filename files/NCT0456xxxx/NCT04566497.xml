  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the lack of randomized controlled trials, the best follow-up strategy of asymptomatic&#xD;
      patients after coronary artery revascularization is controversial. A systematic screening of&#xD;
      silent myocardial ischemia may help prevent a major acute cardiac event. However, systematic&#xD;
      screening strategy is costly and there is currently no evidence that repeated&#xD;
      revascularization improve survival. Moreover, stress testing per se or additional procedures&#xD;
      which can be performed with regard of stress testing results can cause unexpected&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARCACHON is a national, multicenter, randomized, open label trial, that will evaluate the&#xD;
      non-inferiority of a clinical follow-up as compared to a systematic stress testing strategy&#xD;
      after coronary revascularization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery revascularization is commonly used for the management strategy of patients&#xD;
      with coronary artery disease (CAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the following years after revascularization, the current guidelines recommend evaluation&#xD;
      with stress tests when patients are symptomatic. Due to the lack of randomized trials, the&#xD;
      evaluation of asymptomatic patients is controversial and accordingly there is a wide&#xD;
      variation in routine follow-up strategies in these patients. A systematic screening of silent&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia may help prevent a major acute cardiac event. However, systematic&#xD;
      screening strategy is costly and there is currently no evidence that repeated&#xD;
      revascularization improve survival We hypothesized that clinical follow-up alone would be&#xD;
      non-inferior to systematic stress testing screening strategy during follow-up of asymptomatic&#xD;
      CAD patients with prior coronary revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of ARCACHON trial is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of a strategy&#xD;
      of clinical follow-up (without non-invasive stress testing) in asymptomatic patients with a&#xD;
      history of coronary revascularization compared to a strategy of systematic screening for&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia using non-invasive stress testing by the primary endpoint as the&#xD;
      composite of: all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke or any cardiovascular event&#xD;
      leading to unplanned hospitalization.&#xD;
