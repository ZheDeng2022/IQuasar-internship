  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aim is to investigate if changes in osmolarity using mannitol challenge can evoke&#xD;
      coughing healthy controls with no evidence of bronchoconstriction (PC20&gt;16mg/ml or mannitol&#xD;
      PD15 &gt; 635 mg, or &lt; 10% incremental fall in FEV1 between consecutive mannitol doses) and if&#xD;
      salbutamol can affect this. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled analysis in healthy&#xD;
      controls assessing the effects of salbutamol on mannitol induced cough.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will have a maximum of 4 visits separated by at least 24 hours. The first 2 visits&#xD;
      will determine eligibility. All eligible subjects will be invited back for a third and a&#xD;
      fourth visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Period (Visits 1 and 2) - For All Subjects Eligible subjects will be identified&#xD;
      during the initial screening procedures with measures of spirometry, hyperresponsiveness to&#xD;
      methacholine, complete history, physical examination, allergen skin test, and mannitol cough&#xD;
      challenge. The screening procedures will be conducted over 2 separate visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects of Salbutamol (Visit 3 and 4) - For Healthy Control Subjects, Twenty subjects with no&#xD;
      evidence of asthma will return for visit 3 and 4. These visits must be at least 24h apart and&#xD;
      no longer than 7 days. Health controls will first receive salbutamol 2.5mg or saline placebo&#xD;
      via a nebuliser and 15 mins later the forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) measured.&#xD;
      Subjects will then undergo a mannitol cough challenge exactly like the previous mannitol&#xD;
      cough challenges. These data will be used for determining the effects of salbutamol on&#xD;
      mannitol-induced cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit Windows Each visit must be separated by a minimum of 24 hours, and a maximum of 7 days.&#xD;
      Study visits can be performed in the morning or afternoon, however for each subject the&#xD;
      timing should be consistent with Visits 2 at the same time of day ± 2 hours&#xD;
