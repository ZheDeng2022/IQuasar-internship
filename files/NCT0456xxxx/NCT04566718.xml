  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metformin has multiple health promoting effects and it may serve as a preventive measure for&#xD;
      individuals who are at high risk for metabolic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the latest international guidelines it should be considered as an adjunct&#xD;
      therapy to lifestyle intervention in all overweight/obese women with PCOS, independently of&#xD;
      their glucose homeostasis and menstrual regularity. However, there is no clear answer for how&#xD;
      long metformin should be prescribed in this subset of women with PCOS and for how long the&#xD;
      beneficial impact would sustain after treatment cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators compared the consequences of metformin withdrawal after long-term therapy&#xD;
      as opposed to the consequences of metformin suspension after short term therapy in&#xD;
      overweight/obese women with PCOS that had previously responded to metformin by means of&#xD;
      moderate weight loss, improved menstrual frequency and sustained normal glucose homeostasis.&#xD;

    <measure>The main outcome was change in insulin resistance measured with homeostasis model assessment (HOMA IR).</measure>
    <time_frame>HOMA IR was calculated at the base point and at the endpoint of 6 months of clinical trial.</time_frame>
    <description>HOMA IR was calculated as the product of the fasting glucose and insulin concentration divided by 22.5.</description>

    <measure>The main outcome was change in expression of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4) in adipose tissue.</measure>
    <time_frame>We did adipose tissue needle biopsy at the base point and at the endpoint of 6 months of clinical trial. All samples were frozen and then analysed together after end point of the study.</time_frame>
    <description>We obtained adipose tissue using needle biopsy, from which we isolated ribonucleic acid and after reverse transcription, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction determined messenger ribonucleic acid expression for GLUT-4.</description>
