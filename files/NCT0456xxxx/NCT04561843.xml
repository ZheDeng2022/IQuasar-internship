    <textblock>
      The present study aimed to evaluate the levator ani muscle in both morphology (rest), and&#xD;
      function (contraction and valsalva) in symptomatic women using 2D, 3D trans-perineum&#xD;
      ultrasound (TPUS), to compare these features to clinical digital palpation and symptoms, and&#xD;
      helping in diagnosis of muscle dysfunction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Pelvic floor dysfunction is high, affecting millions of women worldwide in&#xD;
      different conditions (social, sexual, physical, psychological, domestic relationships,&#xD;
      financial, etc.), many people still have no, limited knowledge, or awareness of pelvic floor&#xD;
      health and so do not have, or seek how to prevent or correct these disorders . This&#xD;
      dysfunction may be presented as pelvic organ prolapse, stress urinary incontinence, fecal&#xD;
      incontinence , chronic pelvic pain, sexual problems, and/or chronic constipation . Assessment&#xD;
      of pelvic floor muscle activity plays a major role in Urogynecology and physiotherapy as a&#xD;
      part of the conservative treatment of pelvic floor disorders (PFD) . Presence of Levator&#xD;
      avulsion is a major risk factor for female pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and recurrence after&#xD;
      surgical correction . This dysfunction can be diagnosed clinically using vaginal palpation .&#xD;
      Palpation is subjective, less reproducible, and difficult to teach than imaging methods [6].&#xD;
      Studies that used ultrasound for assessment of pelvic floor muscle activity and strength are&#xD;
      still few . The present study aimed to evaluate the levator ani muscle in both morphology&#xD;
      (rest), and function (contraction and valsalva) in symptomatic women using 2D, 3D&#xD;
      trans-perineum ultrasound (TPUS), to compare these features to clinical digital palpation and&#xD;
      symptoms, and helping in diagnosis of muscle dysfunction.&#xD;

    <description>The hiatal antro-posterior distance (LHap) between the inferior margin of the pubic symphysis and the pubo-rectalis sling was measured at rest, on maximum contraction, and at valsalva. The percentage difference decrease [valuerest valuecontraction/ valuerest] for contraction is calculated as a measurement of pelvic floor muscle function.</description>

    <description>2D and 3D trans-perineum ultrasound examinations will be performed by single examiner who was blind to clinical data, using a GE Voluson 730 machine (GE Medical System Kretz Technik, Zipf, Austria) with a RAB 4-8 MHz curved array volume transducer. In the supine position, with flexed and slightly abducted hips after urine voiding. The transducer was placed on the perineum, in the mid sagittal plane with minimal pressure being applied after covering it with an un-powdered glove or thin plastic wrap for hygienic reasons</description>
