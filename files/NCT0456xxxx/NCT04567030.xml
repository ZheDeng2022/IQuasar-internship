  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of an AI dental monitoring&#xD;
      intervention on patients' periodontal disease, preventive behaviors and motivation. This&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial included experimental group: AI group (EG-A), AI-humanized group&#xD;
      (EG-B) and control group(CG), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EG-A and EG-B received AI dental monitoring intervention by taking mouth image at home&#xD;
      once a week for six month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and follow-up surveys were used to collect the data in periodontal index,&#xD;
      periodontal preventive behavior and motivation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A randomized experimental design was used. Patients with periodontal disease whose aged 35-65&#xD;
      years were recruited through department of Periodontics in Kaohsiung Medical University&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group was expected for 100 per group, patients will be randomized into each group.&#xD;
      G*Power (version 3.1.9.4) was used for power analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will underwent periodontal examination at baseline and at 1-month, 3-month,&#xD;
      6-month follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patients will be diagnosed periodontal disease by dentist and have more than 16&#xD;
      functional teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patients will completed the questionnaire at baseline and at 1-month, 3-month and&#xD;
      6-month follow-up.&#xD;
