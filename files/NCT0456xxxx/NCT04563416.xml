      Previous prospective randomized controlled study demonstrated higher accuracy rate of&#xD;
      diagnosing early gastric cancers by Magnifying image-enhanced endoscopy than conventional&#xD;
      white-light endoscopy. Nevertheless, it is difficult to differentiate early gastric cancer&#xD;
      from noncancerous lesions for beginner. we developed a new computer-aided system to assist&#xD;
      endoscopists in identifying early gastric cancers in magnifying optical enhancement images.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is the third most common cause of cancer-associated deaths worldwide&#xD;
      especially in Asia.Early detection and treatment would cure the disease with 5-year survival&#xD;
      rate greater than 90%.However, the sensitivity of conventional endoscopy with white-light&#xD;
      imaging (C-WLI) in diagnosis of early gastric cancers (EGCs) is merely 40%. Magnifying&#xD;
      image-enhanced endoscopy (IEE) techniques such as magnifying narrow band imaging (M-NBI) have&#xD;
      been developed and 2 RCT report that white-light imaging combine with M-NBI can increase the&#xD;
      sensitivity to 95%. The strategy that using white-light imaging to detect the suspicious&#xD;
      lesion and using M-IEE techniques to make a diagnosis of early gastric cancer is recommend in&#xD;
      screening endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical enhancement (OE) which is one of the M-IEE techniques was developed by HOYA Co.&#xD;
      (Tokyo, Japan) . This technology combines digital signal processing and optical filterers to&#xD;
      clear display of mucosal microsurface (MS) and microvessel (MV). The advantage of OE is to&#xD;
      overcome the darkness of NBI which leads to less usefulness for detect-ability in the full&#xD;
      extended gastrointestinal lumen.Nevertheless, it is difficult to differentiate early gastric&#xD;
      cancer from noncancerous lesions for beginner, and expertise with sub-optimal inter-observer&#xD;
      agreement is essential for the use of M-IEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, Artificial intelligence (AI) using deep machine learning has made a major&#xD;
      breakthrough in gastroenterology, which using gradient descent method and backpropagation to&#xD;
      automatically extract specific images features. The diagnostic accuracy in identifying upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancer was 0.955 in C-WLI . Polyps can be identified in real time with 96%&#xD;
      accuracy in screening colonoscopy. AI show an outstanding application in detection and&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to develop a M-OE assistance model in the diagnosis of EGCs by distinguishing&#xD;
      cancer or not.&#xD;
