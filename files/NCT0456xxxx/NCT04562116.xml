      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of nemolizumab (CD14152) on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of a drug &quot;cocktail&quot; representative of CYP450 (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19,&#xD;
      CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 sensitive index substrates) in adult participants with moderateto- severe&#xD;

    <measure>Change of Area Under the Concentration-time Curve from Time Zero to Infinity (AUC[0-infinity]) of Each of the 5 Probe Drugs Before and After 9-week Nemolizumab Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 10: Pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 72 and 120 hours post-dose'</time_frame>
    <description>Change of AUC (0-infinity) of each of the 5 probe drugs before and after 9-week nemolizumab treatment will be assessed. AUC (0-infinity) is defined as AUC from time 0 to infinity, calculated as the sum of AUC (0-last) and C(last)/lambda(z); where C(last) is the last observed measurable (non-BQL) concentration; and lambda(z) is apparent terminal elimination rate constant.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Area Under the Concentration-time Curve from Time Zero to the Time of the Last Measurable Concentration (AUC [0-last]) of Each of the 5 Probe Drugs Before and After 9-week Nemolizumab Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 10: Pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 72 and 120 hours post-dose'</time_frame>
    <description>Change of AUC (0-last) of each of the 5 probe drugs before and after 9-week nemolizumab treatment will be assessed. AUC (0-last) is defined as AUC from time 0 to the time of the last measurable (non-below quantification limit [non-BQL]) concentration, calculated by linear-linear trapezoidal summation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Each of the 5 Probe Drugs Before and After 9-week Nemolizumab Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 10: Pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 72 and 120 hours post-dose'</time_frame>
    <description>Change of Cmax of each of the 5 probe drugs before and after 9-week nemolizumab treatment will be assessed. Cmax is defined as the maximum observed plasma concentration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of AEs including treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs), AEs of special interest (AESIs), and serious AEs (SAEs) will be reported. An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered a medicinal product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose may results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product. A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurs on or after the first date of study drug(s) administration until the date of last study visit. An AESI is a noteworthy treatment-emergent event for the study drug that should be monitored closely and reported promptly.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of AEs including TEAEs, AESIs, and SAEs will be assessed as mild, moderate or severe.</description>
