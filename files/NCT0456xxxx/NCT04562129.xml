    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the administration of Interleukin-2 concurrently&#xD;
      with ipilimumab followed by Nivolumab will result in improved anti-cancer activity and if it&#xD;
      is effective for advanced melanoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study of high dose bolus interleukin-2 (HD IL2) in combination with low&#xD;
      dose ipilimumab followed sequentially by nivolumab in patients with advanced inoperable stage&#xD;
      III or stage IV melanoma who have failed prior anti-PD1 immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned treatment consists of up to 3 courses (One cycle is 21 days and one course is 4&#xD;
      cycles). HD IL2 will be given during week 1 of the 2 initial cycles or each course.&#xD;
      Ipilimumab will be given concurrently at the low dose of 1 mg/kg on Day 1 of the 2 initial&#xD;
      cycles of each course for up to 2 doses, total. Nivolumab will be given on Day 1 of the 3rd&#xD;
      cycle of each course. No systemic treatment will be administered during the 4th cycle.&#xD;
      Response assessment will occur at the end of the 4th cycle. Patients without evidence of&#xD;
      disease progression (RECIST v.1.1) or limiting toxicities will be offered additional courses&#xD;
      of treatment for up to a maximum of 3 courses, total&#xD;
