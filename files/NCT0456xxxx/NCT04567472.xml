      Study aim(s): to conduct feasibility testing of online HEADS: UP, a tailored adaptation of an&#xD;
      existing psychological intervention (MBSR) to help people affected by stroke self-manage&#xD;
      symptoms of anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: 1) Assess feasibility and acceptability of delivering the HEADS: UP intervention&#xD;
      online and identify any additional adaptations to the HEADS: UP manual and supporting&#xD;
      materials. 2) Assess feasibility and acceptability of online research processes, including&#xD;
      recruitment, screening, and obtaining informed consent, and data collection processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question: What elements of intervention design, delivery, and study processes&#xD;
      require to be optimised ahead of a 3-arm RCT?&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II): change is being assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 9</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory 11 (BDI-II) is a 21 items self-report scale to assess the intensity of depression. Each item is a list of four statements arranged in increasing severity about a symptom of depression. Score range between 0-63 with higher score indicating greater severity. Normally completed in 5-10 minutes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI): change is being assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) is a self-report 21-item scale for measuring anxiety. The questions ask about symptoms of anxiety the subject has had during the past week. Each question is scored between 0 (mild) and 3 (severe) and a total score will vary between 0-63. Higher scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>. Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS): change is being assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 9</time_frame>
    <description>The DASS is a set of three self-report scales designed to measure depression, anxiety and stress. Each of the three DASS scales contains 14 items, divided into subscales of 2-5 items with similar content. The Depression scale assesses dysphoria, hopelessness, devaluation of life, self-deprecation, lack of interest/involvement, anhedonia, and inertia. The Anxiety scale assesses autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle effects, situational anxiety, and subjective experience of anxious affect. The Stress scale is sensitive to levels of chronic non-specific arousal. It assesses difficulty relaxing, nervous arousal, and being easily upset/agitated, irritable/over-reactive and impatient. Subjects are asked to use 4-point severity/frequency scales to rate the extent to which they have experienced each state over the past week. Scores for Depression, Anxiety and Stress are calculated by summing the scores for the relevant items.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D 5L: change is being assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 9</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L) comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale (SIS): change is being assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 9</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is a self-report, health status measure for people affected by stroke. It was designed to assess strength, hand function, activities of daily living, mobility, communication, emotion, memory and thinking, and participation. The SIS can be used both in clinical and research settings. It contains 59 items and assesses 8 domains. Each item is rated using a 5-point Likert scale. A final single-item question assesses the individual's perception of recovery from stroke, measured using a visual analogue scale, where 0 = no recovery &amp; 100 = full recovery. The scale is normally completed in 15-20 minutes.</description>
