    <textblock>
      The study used a randomized, dose-escalation, blinded, placebo-controlled trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, 160 subjects were enrolled. The test vaccines are divided into four dose&#xD;
      groups: dose group 1 (0.025mg / 0.1ml / person), dose group 2 (0.05mg / 0.1ml / person), dose&#xD;
      group 3 (0.075mg / 0.1ml / person), dose group 4 (0.1mg / 0.1ml / person), each Each dose&#xD;
      group was enrolled according to 18-45、 46-65 、6-10、11-17years old .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 4 doses are in descending order in the order of 18-45, 46-65, 11-17, and 6-10 years old.&#xD;
      Each age group in the same dose group was enrolled in 8 experimental BCG subjects and 2&#xD;
      placebo subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among subjects aged 6-65 years, the dose group 2 study will be carried out after the safety&#xD;
      assessment 14 days after the dose group 1 vaccination, and the dose group 3 study will be&#xD;
      carried out after completing the safety assessment 14 days after the dose group 2&#xD;
      vaccination. Dose group 3 studies were carried out after safety assessment 14 days after&#xD;
      vaccination. Within the same dose group, after completing the safety assessment 14 days after&#xD;
      vaccination for the previous age group, vaccination for the next age group is carried out.&#xD;

      vaccination. Within the same dose group, after completing the safety assessment 14 days after&#xD;
      vaccination for the previous age group, vaccination for the next age group is carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BCG-PPD and EC skin test were performed during the screening period, and the skin test&#xD;
      results were followed up at 48 hours; blood routine, urine routine, blood biochemistry, HIV&#xD;
      antibody test, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray examination, physical examination, vital signs&#xD;
      (heart rate, blood pressure) And body temperature), female subjects of childbearing age&#xD;
      undergo a blood pregnancy test. Those eligible for entry will receive a dose of the trial&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo on the same day (day 0); Observe vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure&#xD;
      and body temperature), reactions at the inoculation site, and reactions at the&#xD;
      non-inoculation site at 30 minutes, 7 days, and 14 days after vaccination; Blood routine,&#xD;
      urine routine, blood biochemistry, electrocardiogram examination on the 14th day after&#xD;
      vaccination; BCG-PPD and EC skin tests were performed on the 84th and 180th days after&#xD;
      inoculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the blood routine, urine routine, blood biochemistry, electrocardiogram examinations after&#xD;
      vaccination are abnormal and have clinically meaningful results, a re-test is required. Under&#xD;
      special circumstances, the number of re-tests can be appropriately increased until the&#xD;
      follow-up outcome.&#xD;
