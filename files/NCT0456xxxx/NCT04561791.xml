  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a large study in the primary care clinic to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of using tethered capsule endomicroscopy as a screening method for Barrett's&#xD;
      esophagus (BE) in the primary care practice environment. The investigators are also&#xD;
      determining the prevalence of Barrett's esophagus in a primary care practice cohort at MGH.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a tethered capsule OCT device intended as an inexpensive&#xD;
      screening tool for BE. The capsule, which is attached to a thin, flexible tether, is reusable&#xD;
      after being processed by a standard disinfection technique. Used without sedation, the&#xD;
      capsule is swallowed by the participant and travels in the esophagus to the gastroesophageal&#xD;
      junction (GEJ) via peristalsis. Cross-sectional microscopic OCT images of the entire&#xD;
      esophagus are collected during transit. The total time needed for swallowing, imaging and&#xD;
      retrieval does not exceed 10 minutes, with a total of 30 minutes for the procedure. The&#xD;
      investigators have tested the feasibility and the tolerability of this new OCT screening&#xD;
      technology in 250 procedures in healthy volunteers and patients with various esophageal&#xD;
      diseases including BE. The procedure has been safe and well tolerated. High quality&#xD;
      microscopic images of the esophagus have been obtained in 90% of the enrolled subjects.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be asked to swallow the TCE. They may use mild numbing spray, and lubrication spray to help swallowing. Imaging will be conducted once the TCE is past the pharynx. We will advance the TCE until the stomach and then slowly pull the TCE back up the esophagus. This may be repeated twice.</description>
