    <textblock>
      Study type: Randomized, double blinded, interventional, single-site study. Two groups: Active&#xD;
      receiving RIC therapy from the LifeCuff device and standard of care treatment without RIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adults (18 to 90) with diabetes myelitis presenting with diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and sample size: Subjects will be allocated on a 1:1 ratio, yielding a minimum&#xD;
      per protocol population (PP Population) of 15 patients in the Active group and 15 in the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study timeline: Total amount of time from the Screening Visit to the Final Visit is&#xD;
      approximately 16 weeks. For patients who meet inclusion criteria, they are randomized into&#xD;
      Active or Control treatment groups. In addition they are stratified into groups based on&#xD;
      wound etiology: neuropathic (defined as insensate at 2 or more of 5 sites verified by&#xD;
      insensitivity to the 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein 10 g monofilament), ischemic (defined as ABI of&#xD;
      0.7 neuro-ischemic (meeting both of above criteria) Subjects will present at DMU Foot and&#xD;
      Ankle Clinic on weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 for the following measurements: 40mL venous blood&#xD;
      draw (VEGF, SDF1a) 2mm punch biopsy (CD34+) Local wound perfusion (Laser Speckle[FK2] ) Ulcer&#xD;
      size measured by digital planimetry (TissueAnalytics)&#xD;

    <description>Intervention Group: Patients will self-administer RIC treatment with the LifeCuff device 3 times a week. Treatment will be delivered at the patient's home and compliance will be monitored by the LifeCuff device. Control Group: Patients undergo typical standard of care treatment. Assessment of Ulcer Closure: Ulcers will be assessed as completely closed by the Principal Investigator through clinical judgement and photographic support. Patients that completely heal their ulcer during the healing period will complete the study and no further blood or tissue measurements will be taken</description>

             medications during the screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an amputation on the affected foot, if it impedes proper offloading of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with active Charcot foot, or inactive Charcot foot, if it impedes proper&#xD;

          -  Women who are pregnant or considering becoming pregnant within the next 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with concurrent severe psychiatric disease that in the opinion of the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any other medical or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
