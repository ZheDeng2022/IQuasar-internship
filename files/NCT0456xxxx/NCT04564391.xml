  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-protein diets have been recently demonstrated to effectively reduce insulin resistance,&#xD;
      derangements of the lipid profile and liver fat content in subjects with moderately and&#xD;
      severely impaired glucose metabolism and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (LeguAN, LEMBAS,&#xD;
      DiNA-P, DiNA-D). The effects can be attributed to prolonged insulin secretion and improved&#xD;
      second meal effect, higher energy expenditure by urea synthesis, suppression of glucagon or&#xD;
      other mechanisms. Up to now, it is unclear, if proteins with slower or faster digestibility&#xD;
      lead to differential results in these study designs. The proposed study will elucidate this&#xD;
      question. The Investigators hypothesize, that slowly-digestible proteins induce a prolonged&#xD;
      insulin plateau supporting the second-meal effect. The investigators also assume, that these&#xD;
      dietary proteins lead to a markedly stronger short-term secretion of glucagon followed by&#xD;
      desensitisation of this hormone release. Fast-digestible proteins, on the other hand, will&#xD;
      presumably induce a smaller second-meal effect and do not inhibit a second rise of glucagon&#xD;
      in a consecutive meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to study the effects of a 3-weeks high-protein diet in subjects with&#xD;
      NAFLD (40 subjects without T2DM, 40 subjects with T2DM) on insulin resistance (mixed-meal&#xD;
      tolerance tests; MMTT), second meal effect (second, consecutive MMTT on the same day) and&#xD;
      liver fat content (MR spectroscopy) as well body-fat distribution (MR tomography). The&#xD;
      investigators expect different results for slow protein (casein) and fast protein (whey),&#xD;
      thus comparing both protein species. The two major clinical visits before and after the&#xD;
      intervention period will also include fasting blood sampling for later analysis, full&#xD;
      anthropometric assessment and a set of behavioral tests, investigating postprandial decision&#xD;
      making processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical assessments will be conducted in Charité (Lead: A.F.H. Pfeiffer).&#xD;
      Psychobehavioral tests (Prof. Park), assessment of body fat distribution including liver fat&#xD;
      (Dr. Machann) and measurements of amino acid levels throughout the meal tests (Prof. Rohn)&#xD;
      are secondary work packages.&#xD;

      High-protein diets have been recently demonstrated to effectively reduce insulin resistance,&#xD;
      derangements of the lipid profile and liver fat content in subjects with moderately and&#xD;
      severely impaired glucose metabolism and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (LeguAN, LEMBAS,&#xD;
      DiNA-P, DiNA-D). The effects can be attributed to prolonged insulin secretion and improved&#xD;
      second meal effect, higher energy expenditure by urea synthesis, suppression of glucagon or&#xD;
      other mechanisms. Up to now, it is unclear, if proteins with slower or faster digestibility&#xD;
      lead to differential results in these study designs. The proposed study will elucidate this&#xD;
      question. The investigators hypothesize, that slowly-digestible proteins induce a prolonged&#xD;
      insulin plateau supporting the second-meal effect. They also assume, that these dietary&#xD;
      proteins lead to a markedly stronger short-term secretion of glucagon followed by&#xD;
      desensitisation of this hormone release. Fast-digestible proteins, on the other hand, will&#xD;
      presumably induce a smaller second-meal effect and do not inhibit a second rise of glucagon&#xD;
      in a consecutive meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to examine the effects of a 3-weeks high-protein diet in subjects&#xD;
      with NAFLD (40 subjects without T2DM, 40 subjects with T2DM) on insulin resistance&#xD;
      (mixed-meal tolerance tests; MMTT), second meal effect (second, consecutive MMTT on the same&#xD;
      day) and liver fat content (MR spectroscopy) as well body-fat distribution (MR tomography).&#xD;
      The investigators expect different results for slow protein (casein) and fast protein (whey),&#xD;
      thus comparing both protein species. The two major clinical visits before and after the&#xD;
      intervention period will also include fasting blood sampling for later analysis, full&#xD;
      anthropometric assessment and a set of behavioral tests, investigating postprandial decision&#xD;
      making processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to identify the suitable dosage for protein loads in the 3-weeks intervention trial,&#xD;
      the study follows a dose-finding assessment in 40 subjects (20 subjects with Metabolic&#xD;
      Syndrome and T2DM; 20 subjects with Metabolic Syndrome without T2DM), which undergo six&#xD;
      separate investigation days. On each day of the dose-finding assessment pre-trial one of the&#xD;
      following dosages is used in a single oral protein tolerance test (5 g, 20 g and 30 g of whey&#xD;
      or casein each). Subjects with NAFLD from this pre-study are eligible for the main trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional test will assess whether mixes of whey and casein in variable proportions induce&#xD;
      different hormonal profiles of glucagon and insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical assessments will be conducted in the Dept. Endocrinology, Diabetes and&#xD;
      Nutrition, Charité, Campus Benjamin Franklin (Lead: DIfE, A.F.H. Pfeiffer). Psychobehavioral&#xD;
      tests (Prof. Park), assessment of body fat distribution including liver fat (Dr. Machann) and&#xD;
      measurements of amino acid levels throughout the meal tests (Prof. Rohn) are secondary work&#xD;
      packages.&#xD;
