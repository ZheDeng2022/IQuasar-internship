      This study seeks to explore ways to strengthening the interdisciplinary and inter sectoral&#xD;
      collaboration in stroke rehabilitation through the application of Functional Independence&#xD;
      Measure速 (FIM) and common interdisciplinary patient related tasks. The study will be&#xD;
      evaluated through interviews with staff, participant observation and quantitative patient&#xD;
      data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bispebjerg Hospital is considering implementing the FIM instrument in the Neurological&#xD;
      Department. Before decisions making a more thorough examination is needed to see if the extra&#xD;
      resources used to apply the FIM measurement is offset by improvement in the clinic. At&#xD;
      Neurorehabilitering Copenhagen FIM measurement has recently been implemented in a trial&#xD;
      period of 2 years hence an exploration of the application of FIM is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study seeks to explore experiences with application of the FIM instrument combined with&#xD;
      structured interdisciplinary tasks related to the patient's everyday routines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore behavior, reaction and experiences in multidisciplinary staff members when&#xD;
           applying the FIM instrument combined with interdisciplinary collaboration related to&#xD;
           common patient tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the exploration of practical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the staffs experiences both pros and cons with the application of the FIM&#xD;
                instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the staffs experiences of the interdisciplinary and inter sectoral collaboration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To nuance the findings in the qualitative part of the study with quantitative data from&#xD;
           the FIM including data on change in FIM score on the short term (2-3 weeks) and long&#xD;
           term (approx. 4 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate on practicalities when applying the FIM instrument including the feasibility&#xD;
           of scoring within 72 hours within admittance to and before discharge from the&#xD;
           departments and the change in score between the 2 sectors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare FIM to baseline characteristics such as National Institutes of Health Stroke&#xD;
           Scale (NIHSS), Functional oral intake Scale (FOIS), and Pre-Stroke Modified Rankin&#xD;
           Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. It is expected that the application of the FIM instrument combined with&#xD;
           interdisciplinary tasks will contribute to a development of a common language between&#xD;
           the interdisciplinary staff members and to stimulate a more holistic goalsetting when&#xD;
           engaging with the patient. Hereby it is expected to contribute to the interdisciplinary&#xD;
           collaboration. A more multidisciplinary approach is expected to be experienced by the&#xD;
           application of FIM hereby probably giving less attention to their professional&#xD;
           background and more focus on the patient. It is expected that the staff will experience&#xD;
           that FIM contributes to a more united use of language between the sectors and hereby&#xD;
           linking the whole process of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. It is expected that the patients will have a moderate to severe disability measured by&#xD;
           FIM and a change in score is expected in both sectors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Approx. half of the scores are expected to be within the 72 hours of planned timing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A moderate correlation is expected between the FIM score and baseline measurements as&#xD;
           National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Functional oral intake Scale (FOIS)&#xD;
           and weak to moderate with Pre-Stroke Modified Rankin Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Mixed Methods Multicenter Study consists of 5 elements divided into a quantitative and a&#xD;
      qualitative part. The quantitative part is an observational cohort study with 15-20 stroke&#xD;
      patients consecutively recruited. The qualitative part includes 8 participant observations, 4&#xD;
      focus group interviews, approx. 10 individual interviews and data on goalsetting from&#xD;
      hospital charts from the 15-20 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The setting is at the Neurological Ward at Bispebjerg Hospital in the Capital Region of&#xD;
      Denmark and at Neurorehabilitering Copenhagen, a center which specializes in neurological&#xD;
      rehabilitation in the Municipality of Copenhagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the qualitative study, staff in a project group experimenting with the use of the FIM&#xD;
      instrument combined with interdisciplinary tasks will participate in focus group interviews&#xD;
      and some of them will participate in individual interviews using strategic sampling with&#xD;
      maximal variation on profession, years of experience and sector. Participant observation of&#xD;
      the FIM scorings will be performed as videorecordings beeing analysed. All qualitative data&#xD;
      will be analysed with both investigator and data triangulation.&#xD;
