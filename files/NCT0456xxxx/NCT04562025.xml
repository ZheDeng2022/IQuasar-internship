  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most serious complications of diabetes and the&#xD;
      leading cause of end-stage chronic kidney disease. DN is a refractory disease with low&#xD;
      awareness, high incidence, and high disability. The incidence of DN can reach 30 to 40% after&#xD;
      20 years of diabetes, of which 5~10% of patients will progress to end-stage renal disease,&#xD;
      and epidemiological surveys predict that by 2030, DN will become the seventh leading cause of&#xD;
      death in the world. Currently, there are no effective drugs for treating DN. This clinical&#xD;
      trial is to inspect the safety and efficiency of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
      (UC-MSCs) therapy for patients with DN.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most important microvascular complications of&#xD;
      diabetes. It is a persistent and refractory disease. There is currently a lack of effective&#xD;
      clinical treatments for DN. The basic pathological processes of DN are renal tissue cell&#xD;
      damage, apoptosis and continuous increase of inflammatory cytokines induced by early high&#xD;
      glucose, which gradually leads to glomerular sclerosis and renal fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs), as the &quot;youngest&quot; adult stem cells,&#xD;
      have powerful anti-inflammatory functions, stronger differentiation potential, and good&#xD;
      safety. They are ideal seed cells for the treatment of DN. At present, studies on a variety&#xD;
      of animal models of DN have shown that mesenchymal stem cell transplantation can delay the&#xD;
      progression of DN and have a certain repair effect on damaged kidney tissue and renal&#xD;
      function. Our previous preclinical study showed that UC-MSCs effectively improved the renal&#xD;
      function, inhibited inflammation and fibrosis, and prevented its progression in a rat model&#xD;
      of diabetes-induced chronic renal injury. Some autologous or allogeneic mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cells have been carried out abroad treatment of chronic kidney disease caused by various&#xD;
      reasons, including clinical trials of DN, phase I/II test results did not show obvious&#xD;
      adverse reactions related to stem cell therapy, and can improve the patient's renal function&#xD;
      and quality of life to a certain extent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate efficiency and safety of UC-MSCs in treating DN&#xD;
      patients. This trial will recruit 38 patients. 19 patients received the treatment of&#xD;
      conventional treatment + equal volume normal saline containing 1% human albumin (placebo&#xD;
      group) were used as control group; conventional treatment + 1*10E6 UC-MSCs/kg body weight&#xD;
      (experimental group) for intravenous infusion (once a week, 3 times in total) to treat 19&#xD;
      patients with DN (by unified standard inclusion), and subjects will be followed a total of 48&#xD;
      weeks from time of initial cell treatment.&#xD;
