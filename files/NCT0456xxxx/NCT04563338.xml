  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to look at how effective the drug, atezolizumab, with or without the&#xD;
      drug bevacizumab, is for people with inoperable liver cancer or non-small lung cancer that&#xD;
      has spread to the liver. This will be done by looking at the duration of time from starting&#xD;
      the study drug(s) until the cancer worsens in study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will collect blood and tumor tissue samples from participants to look at changes&#xD;
      to their tumor(s) before and after receiving atezolizumab and/or bevacizumab.&#xD;

      Participants with liver cancer will be assigned to Arm A and receive atezolizumab and&#xD;
      bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with non-small cell lung cancer will be randomized into one of the following&#xD;
      arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: Atezolizumab and bevacizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm C: Atezolizumab alone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to Arm C whose disease worsens may be able to cross over to Arm B and&#xD;
      receive atezolizumab and bevacizumab together.&#xD;

    <description>Atezolizumab is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies are proteins that are naturally found in the blood stream that fight infections. Monoclonal antibodies are a special kind of antibody that is created in a laboratory. These drugs bind (attaches) to specific proteins in the body that may be involved in cancers. Atezolizumab binds to PD-L1 which is a protein involved preventing the body's immune system (defense system against infection and disease) from fighting cancer cells. Blocking PD-L1 is expected to help the immune cells to destroy the cancer cells.</description>

    <description>Bevacizumab is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies are proteins that are naturally found in the blood stream that fight infections. Monoclonal antibodies are a special kind of antibody that is created in a laboratory. These drugs bind (attaches) to specific proteins in the body that may be involved in cancers. Bevacizumab binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which is a protein involved with the growth of new blood vessels. Blocking VEGF will prevent blood vessels from forming and therefore stopping oxygen and nutrients to be supplied to cancer cells. Without oxygen and nutrients, the cancer cells will die.</description>
