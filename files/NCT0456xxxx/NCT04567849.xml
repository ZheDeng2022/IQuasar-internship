  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, patients will be sent a message shortly after completing a medical&#xD;
      procedure that informs or reminds them that they can reach out to Geisinger, and how to do&#xD;
      it, if they have any medical issues or concerns. Researchers will assess if such messages&#xD;
      make patients more likely to contact Geisinger with post-procedure medical concerns and&#xD;
      decrease emergency department utilization.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decreasing emergency department (ED) over-utilization is a priority for healthcare systems&#xD;
      across the country. Patients uncertain about a medical issue routinely end up in the ED when&#xD;
      less costly and time-consuming alternatives could have addressed their concern. If patients&#xD;
      reach out to healthcare facilities rather than heading directly to the ED, they can often be&#xD;
      directed toward resources better suited to their concerns than the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geisinger is thus working to encourage patients to contact healthcare providers if any&#xD;
      concerns arise and patients are uncertain about where to go for care. Patients who have&#xD;
      recently had a medical procedure may be particularly valuable to encourage, as they routinely&#xD;
      have concerns related to the procedure and discharge can serve as a useful touch-point to&#xD;
      remind the patient where they can go for questions or concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, patients will be sent a patient portal message shortly after completing&#xD;
      any Women's Health medical procedure. The message will inform or remind patients how they can&#xD;
      reach Geisinger if they have any medical issues or concerns. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      assess if such messages make patients more likely to contact Geisinger with medical concerns&#xD;
      and, in turn, decrease unnecessary ED utilization. This study will A/B test 2 messages,&#xD;
      encouraging patients to either call their recent provider directly or to call a tele-nurse&#xD;
      hotline, and will assess if these messages perform better than a control group that will not&#xD;
      be sent any such message.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generalized linear models will examine the primary study outcomes as a function of the study&#xD;
      arms (between-subjects).&#xD;
