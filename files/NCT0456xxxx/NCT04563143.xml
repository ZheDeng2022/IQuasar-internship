  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will enroll patients who are already selected to undergo deep brain stimulation&#xD;
      surgery based on standard of care. The surgical implantation of the leads will be based on&#xD;
      standard of care and will be completed with FDA-approved leads that are routinely used at&#xD;
      Cleveland Clinic. The pulse generators (i.e. the battery) will also be standard. The research&#xD;
      will characterize spontaneous and task-related changes in brain activity recorded from these&#xD;
      regions alone and in relation to novel paradigms / settings of stimulation to learn how such&#xD;
      paradigms impact both the symptoms of patients with Parkinson's disease and the underlying&#xD;
      neural activity of the target brain region. Of particular interest is to learn if the novel&#xD;
      paradigms of stimulation will have a lower impact on cognitive function than current settings&#xD;
      of stimulation.To date, current DBS settings are continuous. That is, stimulation runs at&#xD;
      approximately 200 pulses per second, all day long, day and night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel settings that investigators will study are part of a translational pipeline at&#xD;
      Cleveland Clinic. Dr. Ken Baker and Dr. Machado are partners in the lab and in clinical&#xD;
      research. Dr. Baker has completed preclinical research that has shown that it is possible to&#xD;
      achieve excellent relief of parkinsonian symptoms with intermittent types of stimulation&#xD;
      known as coordinated reset. In other words, Dr Baker found that using a lower dose of&#xD;
      stimulation in an intermittent fashion can maintain the same level of symptom control.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a lower dose of stimulation could have less effects on cognitive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test these novel paradigms of stimulation, investigators will study patients&#xD;
      immediately after DBS and over time. The immediate research will be done starting on the&#xD;
      third day after implantation of the DBS lead(s), having the systems externalized for nine&#xD;
      days. The long-term research will be conducted with patients already fully implanted and&#xD;
      healed from surgery. In addition to evaluating for motor and cognitive tasks using computer&#xD;
      based assessments, investigators will utilize non-invasive electrophysiological measures&#xD;
      including EEG, EMG, MEG, and wearable accelerometer/gyroscopes to better characterize the&#xD;
      effects of stimulation settings.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experimental design will include procedures to address each specific aim, with most&#xD;
      involving a within-subjects approach that examines the effect of different levels of&#xD;
      treatment (e.g., no therapy, traditional DBS, novel DBS) on neurological function, including&#xD;
      dependent variables derived from tests of motor and cognitive function. This approach will&#xD;
      extend to the electrophysiological data as well; where the relative effect of each level of&#xD;
      treatment on spontaneous- (e.g., resting beta and gamma band power) and task-related (i.e.,&#xD;
      evoked or event-related potential latency and amplitude characteristics) cerebral rhythms&#xD;
      will be quantified for each subject and further aggregated to characterize group-level&#xD;
      effects (see data analysis below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to surgery, participants will undergo additional brain imaging procedures in order to&#xD;
      characterize the anatomical and functional connectivity of the brain region to be targeted&#xD;
      during surgical lead placement and the cerebral cortex. The additional imaging sets will&#xD;
      include DTI and resting state functional MRI scans that will add an additional 30-45 minutes&#xD;
      to the standard of care pre-operative clinical MR procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following standard of care placement of the DBS lead(s) within the targeted brain region,&#xD;
      access to the lead for study-related activities will be achieved by attaching a disposable&#xD;
      extension to the end of the lead that is lodged subcutaneously, extracranially. The&#xD;
      disposable extension will then be tunneled to a site remote to that of the surgery in order&#xD;
      to minimize risk of contamination of the permanently implanted hardware. The recording&#xD;
      equipment will then be connected to the externalized extension, thus enabling study-related&#xD;
      DBS delivery and the recording of local field potentials (LFP) from the targeted brain&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study-related activities will start the third morning after DBS surgery to allow the patient&#xD;
      time to recover from the implant procedure (start may be delayed if additional recovery is&#xD;
      deemed warranted through consultation with clinical care team). It is expected that the study&#xD;
      testing will continue through post-implant day 9, with the second standard of care DBS&#xD;
      implant surgery performed on post-implant day 10. During the externalization period, subjects&#xD;
      will participate in daily data collection tasks for up to 8 hours per day, with study-related&#xD;
      activities performed in short segments, broken up across morning and afternoon sessions. Once&#xD;
      testing is completed in the operationally-defined medication OFF state, patients will be&#xD;
      permitted to take their usual dose of medication and testing will continue. Frequent rest&#xD;
      periods will be included within each testing block to minimize fatigue effects and improve&#xD;
      data quality. Electrophysiological recordings may also be performed when the patient is not&#xD;
      in the laboratory, including overnight during sleep, using portable recording equipment and&#xD;
      activity monitors that resemble a holster device. Recordings will be made using either a&#xD;
      commercially-available cap electrode system that is placed temporarily during each&#xD;
      experimental session or using standard cup electrodes affixed to the scalp using either&#xD;
      standard methods (i.e., collodion or electrode paste). If collodion electrodes are used,&#xD;
      collodion electrodes will remain on the patient for several days in a row up to the duration&#xD;
      of the externalization period. Daily checks will be performed to ensure the integrity of the&#xD;
      electrode interface and electrodes will be re-gelled or re-applied as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily study-related activities within the laboratory will include 1) spontaneous recordings&#xD;
      made with the patient at rest, 2) motor and cognitive task-synchronized recordings, and 3)&#xD;
      somatosensory evoked potentials, and 4) evoked potentials elicited by direct stimulation of&#xD;
      the deep brain target region. On the first day of testing, a monopolar threshold review,&#xD;
      similar to what is performed as part of standard of care clinical DBS programming may be&#xD;
      performed. This involves careful titration of the settings of electrical stimulation&#xD;
      delivered via the DBS lead in order to determine thresholds for sensorimotor and other&#xD;
      side-effects and will help to set the upper limits of stimulation delivered as part of the&#xD;
      experimental procedures. Moreover, this process will be used to characterize the therapeutic&#xD;
      benefits derived from DBS. In all cases, stimulation will be limited to less than the&#xD;
      approved charge density safety limit of 30 microcoulombs/cm2 per phase. On certain days,&#xD;
      patients may be asked to arrive to the test location after an overnight fast from their&#xD;
      anti-PD medications in order to characterize the effect of dopaminergic medications on&#xD;
      experimental responses. Finally, daily schedules may be altered based upon patient fatigue as&#xD;
      well as potential scheduling conflicts (e.g., MRI or MEG availability) and the total number&#xD;
      of days the patient is externalized may be shortened at the discretion of the surgical team,&#xD;
      including the need to accommodate operating room scheduling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of six months after surgery, participants will be asked to return for a follow-up,&#xD;
      approximately 4-hour research visit to evaluate therapeutic outcomes. Specifically, patients&#xD;
      will be asked to return to the main campus laboratory after an overnight fast from their&#xD;
      anti-parkinsonian medications. During that visit, the efficacy of the patient's&#xD;
      standard-of-care DBS programming settings (i.e., the settings set by their treating physician&#xD;
      as part of their routine, post-op clinical care) will be evaluated through blinded scoring&#xD;
      using subscales of the MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS).&#xD;
