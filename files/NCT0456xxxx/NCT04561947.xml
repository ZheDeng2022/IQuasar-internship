  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled clinical study aimed to evaluate the success of the combination of&#xD;
      tunnel technique and concentrated growth factor membrane for root coverage in treating&#xD;
      multiple gingival recessions and compare with the gold standard connective tissue graft.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study included 108 defects in 40 patients with Miller Class I and II gingival recession.&#xD;
      Gingival recession defects were randomly divided into two groups. Tunnel technique +&#xD;
      connective tissue graft was applied to 20 patients in the control group (51 defects) and&#xD;
      tunnel technique + concentrated growth factor membrane was applied to 20 patients in the test&#xD;
      group (57 defects). The results at baseline and 6 months were evaluated for the following&#xD;
      clinical parameters: Mean root coverage, complete root coverage, probing depth, clinical&#xD;
      attachment level, gingival recession depth, gingival recession width, keratinized tissue&#xD;
      width and gingival thickness.&#xD;

    <description>After local anesthesia, the exposed root surfaces were mechanically treated with curettes. A tunnelling knives were used to prepare a split-thickness flap and create a continuous tunnel in the buccal soft tissues, following the intrasulcular incision with a #69 microblade. Split-thickness flap preparation was performed to beyond the mucogingival junction with supraperiosteal dissection by placing the tunneling knives to the soft tissue. This process was repeated by entering through the sulcus of each tooth. After the elevation of the flap, a papilla elevator placed under the flap was entered through the sulcus to mobilize the papilla, the periosteum at the base of the papilla was cut, and the full-thickness flap was elevated.</description>

    <description>CTG was harvested using the de-epithelialized connective tissue graft technique. The epithelial tissue on the outer surface of the graft was removed with a 15 blade and a 1-mm-thick graft was obtained.</description>

    <description>Intravenous blood samples were collected in without anticoagulant 10-mL tubes and immediately centrifuged in a CGF centrifuge machine using a program with the following features: 30 ̋ acceleration, 2 min at 2700 rpm, 4 min at 2400 rpm, 4 min at 2700 rpm, 3 min at 3000 rpm, and 36 ̋ deceleration and stop. After centrifugation, four layers were formed in the tube: the serum layer at the top, the second buffy coat layer, the third CGF layer containing GF and unipotent stem cells, and the red blood cell layer at the bottom. The resulting CGF was removed from the tube and separated from the red blood cell layer using microsurgical scissors.</description>
