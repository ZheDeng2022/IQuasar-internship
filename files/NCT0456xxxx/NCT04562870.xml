    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, two-arm, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of selinexor versus treatment per physician's choice (PC) in participants with myelofibrosis&#xD;
      (MF) who had at least 6 months of treatment with a Janus kinase (JAK)1/2 inhibitor. Study&#xD;
      participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive selinexor or physicians'&#xD;
      choice of treatment.&#xD;
