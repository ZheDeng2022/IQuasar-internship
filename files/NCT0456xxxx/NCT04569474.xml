      Pragmatic, randomized, single-blinded, controlled clinical trial of the effect of dressing&#xD;
      and stabilization of peripheral intravenous catheters on the occurrence of phlebitis in adult&#xD;
      patients attended at a hospital from the Western Brazilian Amazon.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral venous catheterization is the most commonly performed invasive procedure in&#xD;
      healthcare. Care practices and the use of technologies may influence the results of the use&#xD;
      peripheral intravenous catheters (PIC), contributing to the reduction of complications and&#xD;
      adverse events. Phlebitis is characterized as one of the most serious complication related to&#xD;
      the use of PIC and this study has as hypothesis to analyze if the occurrence of phlebitis&#xD;
      associated with PIC is influenced by the use of sterile dressing. Objectives: To verify the&#xD;
      effect of using sterile dressing and sterile adhesive tape compared to non-sterile adhesive&#xD;
      tape in PIC on the occurrence of phlebitis in adult patients attended at a hospital from the&#xD;
      Western Brazilian Amazon. Methods: Pragmatic, randomized, controlled and single-blinded&#xD;
      clinical study conducted in Rio Branco, Acre. The sample was calculated in 330 patients, aged&#xD;
      18 years or older and who met the inclusion criteria. Data collection took place between June&#xD;
      2018 and September 2019, after approval of ethical merit. To identify the type of sterile&#xD;
      transparent dressing to be studied, was carried out an implementation study with a final&#xD;
      sample of 71 patients, focusing analysis from the perspective of the patient, professional&#xD;
      and clinics. The patients of the clinical study were randomly allocated to one of the study&#xD;
      groups: Experimental group (sterile transparent dressing) or Standard Group (non-sterile&#xD;
      adhesive tape). Phlebitis was diagnosed by the bedside nurse, according to presence and&#xD;
      severity. If present, the nurse removed the CIP and an external evaluator was called to&#xD;
      perform a diagnose of phlebitis with blindness regarding the intervention. Variables related&#xD;
      to patient characterization, intravenous therapy, peripheral venipuncture, reasons for&#xD;
      withdrawal and length of PIC stay, reasons for removal and length of coverage, and associated&#xD;
      complications were investigated. For the statistical analysis, Chi-square, Fisher's Exact,&#xD;
      student t test, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used. The multiple analysis was performed using&#xD;
      the logistic regression model to estimate the Relative Risk (RR) and the Kaplan-Meier model,&#xD;
      Cox regression, for survival analysis. RR calculation for 95% Confidence Interval (IC) was&#xD;
      applied to estimate the degree of association between variables. In all tests, the&#xD;
      significance level of 5% was considered.&#xD;
