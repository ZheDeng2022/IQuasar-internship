      Objectives: One-step self-etch adhesives are the latest adhesives introduced into the market.&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial was to test the hypothesis that a&#xD;
      one-step self-etch adhesive performs equally well as a two-step etch-and-rinse adhesive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: Thirty two patients with 96 non-carious cervical lesions received&#xD;
      composite-resin restorations (Tetric Evo Ceram - Ivoclar/Vivadent), which were bonded either&#xD;
      with a one-step self-etch adhesive (AdheSE One - Ivoclar/Vivadent) with or without enamel&#xD;
      etching, or with a two-step etch-and-rinse adhesive (ExiTE - Ivoclar/Vivadent). All&#xD;
      restorations were evaluated by two examiners at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months regarding&#xD;
      retention, caries recurrence, marginal integrity and discoloration. Retention loss, severe&#xD;
      marginal defects and/or discoloration that needed intervention (repair or replacement) and&#xD;
      occurrence of caries, were considered as clinical failures. A logistic regression analysis&#xD;
      with generalized estimating equations was used to account for the clustered data (three&#xD;
      restorations per patient).&#xD;

      Sample selection Patients, receiving dental treatment in the Clinic of Restorative Dentistry,&#xD;
      constituted the selection pool. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants&#xD;
      before starting treatment. A total of 32 participants were examined to check if they met the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria by two precalibrated operative dentistry residents. The&#xD;
      qualified patients were recruited in the order in which they reported for the screening&#xD;
      session, thus forming a convenience sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, irrespective of age and gender, should have at least three non-carious cervical&#xD;
      lesions on incisors, canines and premolars of the upper or lower jaw. Each lesion should be&#xD;
      located at the cervical third of the buccal side of the tooth, be either at the same level or&#xD;
      above the gums, have its cervical wall on dentin, not extend on adjacent surfaces and not&#xD;
      exceed 5mm in length, 3mm in height and 1.5mm in depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving periodontal therapy, presenting high caries activity or TMJ problems&#xD;
      needing treatment with mouthguards, were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of thirty two patients with ninety six lesions, were eventually included in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restoration process&#xD;
&#xD;
      All restorations were performed by only one experienced dentist. All three lesions per&#xD;
      patient were restored with Tetric EvoCeram (Ivoclar/Vivadent, AG, Shaan, Lichtenstein) (Table&#xD;
      X) following one of next adhesive procedures for each tooth, in a statistical random order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. st method 1. Mechanical removal of sclerotic dentin with a round bur 2. Enamel beveling&#xD;
           3. Enamel (30sec) and dentin (15sec) etching with phosphoric acid 4. Application of&#xD;
           ExciTE (Ivoclar/Vivadent, AG, Shaan, Lichtenstein) (Table X) and curing for 10sec with&#xD;
           800mW/cm2 light intensity (Cure TC-01, Spring Health Products, Inc, Norristown, PA, USA)&#xD;
           5. Composite-resin application using a transparent cervical matrix (Kerr-Hawe, Orange,&#xD;
           CA, USA) and curing for 40sec 6. Finishing and polishing&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd method 1. Mechanical removal of sclerotic dentin with a round bur 2. Enamel beveling&#xD;
           3. Application of AdheSE One (Ivoclar/Vivadent, AG, Shaan, Lichtenstein) (Table X) and&#xD;
           curing for 10sec 4. Composite-resin application using a transparent cervical matrix and&#xD;
           curing for 40sec 5. Finishing and polishing&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. rd method 1. Mechanical removal of sclerotic dentin with a round bur 2. Enamel beveling&#xD;
           3. Enamel (30sec) etching with phosphoric acid 4. Application of AdheSE One and curing&#xD;
           for 10sec 5. Composite-resin application using a transparent cervical matrix and curing&#xD;
           for 40sec 6. Finishing and polishing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methods were applied in random order (using randomization tables), by which the first&#xD;
      randomly selected method was used to restore the tooth with the lowest tooth number&#xD;
      (according to the FDI system), the second method was used for the tooth with the second&#xD;
      lowest tooth number and the third one for the lowest. In case of more than three lesions, an&#xD;
      equal number of restorations with each method was ensured. In instances of an uneven number&#xD;
      of restorations placed in one patient, the inequality of number of teeth restored with each&#xD;
      method was adjusted for by restoring the lesions with the respective methods in the next&#xD;
      patient (again according to the respective randomization tables).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restoration evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two experienced and calibrated dentists, not involved with the placement of the restorations&#xD;
      and therefore blinded to the group assignment, performed the evaluation. For training&#xD;
      purposes, the examiners observed 10 photographs that were representative of each score for&#xD;
      each criterion. They evaluated 10 to 15 subjects each on 2 consecutive days. These subjects&#xD;
      had cervical restorations and they did not participate in this project. An intraexaminer and&#xD;
      interexaminer agreement of at least 85% was necessary before the beginning of the evaluation.&#xD;
      All restorations were evaluated at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months according to …..&#xD;
      criteria. The parameters evaluated were retention of the restoration, marginal integrity,&#xD;
      marginal discoloration and recurrent caries (Table X).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameters were evaluated using the criteria introduced by Hickel et al. 2007, 2010. The&#xD;
      overall clinical effectiveness of the tested adhesives was recorded in terms of retention,&#xD;
      marginal integrity, marginal discoloration, caries recurrence. Retention loss, occurrence of&#xD;
      caries along the restoration margins, severe marginal defects and/or discoloration that&#xD;
      needed clinical intervention (repair or replacement) were considered as clinical failure. The&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness of the three methods was compared for the abovementioned parameters.&#xD;
