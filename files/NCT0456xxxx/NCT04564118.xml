      The Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) based on real clinical data and its own&#xD;
      algorithms can help to make the right choice. This trial is designed to assess the difference&#xD;
      between retrospective electronic medical cards (EMC) therapy prescriptions and MedicBK&#xD;
      prescriptions based on key patient characteristics.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a lot of data from registries about poor adherence to guidelines. It is connected&#xD;
      with a problem that patients usually have a lot of comorbidities and physicians need to know&#xD;
      —Åonsequently the huge number of medications and combinations. It is very difficult to decide&#xD;
      quickly according to available data from libraries like PubMed. The Clinical Decision Support&#xD;
      Systems (CDSS) based on real clinical data and its own Artificial Intelligence algorithms can&#xD;
      help to make the right choice. This trial is designed to assess the difference between&#xD;
      retrospective electronic medical cards (EMC) therapy prescriptions and MedicBK prescriptions&#xD;
      based on key patient characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of experts (cardiologists with clinical practice for more than 5 years) will be&#xD;
      participating in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using main characteristics from EMC the first group of experts will put this data into&#xD;
      MedicBK platform and assess retrospective treatment. The next blinded group of experts will&#xD;
      perform prescriptions using MedicBK algorithms based on current guidelines and data from&#xD;
      available clinical trials. The main hypothesis is the use Clinical Decision Support Systems&#xD;
      (CDSS) better than current clinical practice. This option can help to make the right choice&#xD;
      of medical combination based on main patient's clinical characteristics&#xD;
