  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All episodes of patients with acute UC admitted to Tampere University Hospital and treated&#xD;
      with intravenous corticosteroids between January 2007 and January 2016 were identified from&#xD;
      patient records and reviewed. The risks for colectomy and for continuous use of&#xD;
      corticosteroids were evaluated. Predictive factors were analysed.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data collected included epidemiological (gender, age at index flare, smoking status),&#xD;
      clinical (UC duration, extent of the disease, prior Cs usage, disease severity, laboratory&#xD;
      results at index flare) and treatment data (occurrence of new flares, need for further Cs&#xD;
      therapy; CyA, thiopurines, biologics or colectomy during follow-up). The diagnosis of UC was&#xD;
      made on basis of clinical history, symptoms, endoscopic and histological features. Disease&#xD;
      extent was categorized by the Montreal classification and the severity of the flare was&#xD;
      assessed by Mayo scoring system based on clinical and endoscopic characteristics. ASUC was&#xD;
      characterized by more than six bloody stools/day along with any of the following:&#xD;
      tachycardia, elevated temperature, anemia and/or ESR &gt;30 mm/h (Truelove and WittÂ´s&#xD;
      criteria)5. Alleviation of UC was defined as clinical response to intravenous corticosteroids&#xD;
      with no need for colectomy or rescue therapy at the same hospitalization as the index flare.&#xD;
      Relapse was defined as requiring further corticosteroid treatment, rehospitalization,&#xD;
      rescue-therapy, or colectomy later in follow-up.&#xD;
