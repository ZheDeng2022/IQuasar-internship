  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to determine the effect of islatravir (ISL) [MK-8591] on&#xD;
      methadone pharmacokinetics (PK). The primary objective is to assess whether ISL impacts the&#xD;
      area under the plasma concentration time curve from dosing to 24 hours postdose (AUC0-24) of&#xD;
      S-methadone and R-methadone in participants on oral methadone therapy. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that the plasma AUC0-24hr for S- and R-methadone will be similar after single-dose&#xD;
      co-administration of methadone + ISL.&#xD;
