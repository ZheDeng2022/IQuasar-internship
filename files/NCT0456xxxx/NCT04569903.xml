  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of an algorithm&#xD;
      in identifying patients with ATTR amyloidosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A screening strategy to identify ATTR in the large background population of patients with one&#xD;
      or more common ATTR manifestations, would be of significant clinical value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, novel ATTR therapies have been recently made available or are currently in&#xD;
      development in late-stage clinical trials. As early diagnosis and treatment is expected to&#xD;
      achieve better outcomes, this makes the development and validation of an easily implemented,&#xD;
      rapid and electronically-enabled diagnostic algorithm especially important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A medical and pharmacy claims-based algorithm was developed to potentially identify patients&#xD;
      at risk of having ATTR. The goal of this study is to evaluate the ability of the algorithm to&#xD;
      identify patients with ATTR by performing diagnostic clinical work up in patients that the&#xD;
      algorithm identifies in a large dataset of patients at Yale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the&#xD;
      algorithm in identifying patients with ATTR amyloidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to estimate the clinical benefit of the algorithm,&#xD;
      as measured by the added diagnostic value, i.e. the proportion or rate of patients who were&#xD;
      previously undiagnosed. The total obtained prevalence will be assessed and informally&#xD;
      compared to the referral-based prevalence of ATTR amyloidosis patients at Yale.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Identified by the ATTR diagnostic algorithm and matched by Yale's list of potential&#xD;
             subjects defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. subjects within the claims dataset that are predicted to be at risk of having&#xD;
                  ATTR who are also being managed within YNHHS&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. patients who need to be contacted and offered additional clinical evaluation to&#xD;
                  determine whether they have a diagnosis of ATTR (non-hereditary or Hereditary&#xD;
                  ATTR amyloidosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have opted out of research in the Epic system will be excluded entirely&#xD;
             from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or who may become pregnant&#xD;
