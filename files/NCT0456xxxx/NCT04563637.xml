      This study is being done to test whether a HealthReel computer vision-based software&#xD;
      application can estimate body fat percentage with equivalent accuracy to a whole body dual&#xD;

      This study is being done to test whether a computer vision-based software application can&#xD;
      estimate body fat percentage with equivalent accuracy to a whole body dual energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry scan. The dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scan involves lying on a machine&#xD;
      for about 6-10 minutes. It is an open design. The study will also examine whether waist&#xD;
      circumference measurement improves the accuracy of the body fat percentage estimate by the&#xD;
      computer vision-based application.A total of approximately 492 subjects are planned to take&#xD;
      part in this study at one study center.&#xD;

    <description>Analysis will be undertaken to see if the variance between application and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry is reduced when the abdominal circumference is included in the application or whether inclusion of abdominal circumference does not reduce the variance.</description>

    <description>A 15 second long video will be obtained at the research site using a smart phone or tablet. Then subjects will undergo a whole body dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scan . Then the subject will go home and take a second 15 second long video. The videos will then be analyzed by computer based vision application and the body fat percentage measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scan will be compared.</description>
