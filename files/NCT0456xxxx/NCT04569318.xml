  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single arm, single site proof-of-concept trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      LEDINBIO PoC Device, with 8 x 15-minute twice-weekly treatments and 3 month safety follow-up,&#xD;
      in the treatment of cataract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one of the subject's eyes will be treated during the study. In addition, spectral data&#xD;
      (fluorescent emission) will be collected using the device to monitor the progress of the&#xD;
      treatment, and to determine the suitability of these measurements for future clinical&#xD;
      diagnoses&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject diagnosed with nuclear sclerotic (NS) lens opacities cataract, LOCS III grade&#xD;

             completed another investigational study within the last 30 days&#xD;
