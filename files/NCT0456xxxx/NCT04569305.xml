      Effect of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy for Soft Tissue Iinjuries of Foot and Ankle in&#xD;
      Patients at a Tertiary care Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of negative pressure wound therapy for soft tissue injuries of foot&#xD;
      and ankle.This will be assessed through measuring the wound surface area covered with healthy&#xD;
      granulation tissue measured in centimetre square on follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients aged 18 years or above with foot and ankle trauma resulting in soft tissue&#xD;
      injury with or without bones and tendon exposed were included in the study. 35 patients were&#xD;
      randomized into Negative Pressure Wound Therapy group and 35 in conventional treatment&#xD;
      group.In NPWT group ,NPWT was applied to injured area of foot and ankle after debridement and&#xD;
      cleaning of the necrosed/dead tissue. The effect of technique was assessed through measuring&#xD;
      wound surface area covered with healthy granulation tissue measured in centimetre square on&#xD;
      follow-up at 10 days ,20 days and 27 days respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Conventional treatment group patients were kept on simple moist gauze dressings and the&#xD;
      wound was assessed through measuring wound surface area covered with healthy granulation&#xD;
      tissue measured in centimeter square on followup at 10 days , 20 days and 27 days&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
