  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnostic announcement of a chronic disorder is an essential step in the patient's care.&#xD;
      Recommendations specify the importance of including caregivers at the time of the&#xD;
      announcement. In practice, caregivers are not systematically associated with the announcement&#xD;
      of the diagnosis of schizophrenia, while the daily support of patients is provided in 75% of&#xD;
      cases by the family. This support can lead to the exhaustion of caregivers and have&#xD;
      repercussions on their sick loved one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will qualitatively describe and explore the experience of the diagnostic&#xD;
      announcement in relatives of patients with schizophrenia. Specifically, the investigators&#xD;
      will explore the history before the diagnosis is announced, the conditions of the&#xD;
      announcement and the experiences of relatives as well as the impact at the personal and&#xD;
      family-levels. This study will also explore the expectations of caregivers and avenues for&#xD;
      reflection for announcement of schizophrenia diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of subjects to be included in this study is therefore set at 30. A preselection of&#xD;
      each potential participant will be carried out by phone or in person to ensure the presence&#xD;
      of inclusion criteria and the absence of non-inclusion criteria. The patients will also be&#xD;
      provided with oral information about the study to allow sufficient time to reflect before&#xD;
      inclusion. Then, the selection-inclusion-interview visit will take place visually in an&#xD;
      intra-hospital or extra-hospital consultation structure of the Center Hospitalier&#xD;
      Alpes-Isère. This visit will be unique and will consist of the entire protocol. It will be&#xD;
      both a selection, inclusion and interview visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the results have been analyzed, this study will provide a better understanding of the&#xD;
      experiences of relatives of patients when the diagnosis of schizophrenia is announced, the&#xD;
      impact of this announcement on caregivers and family relationships and the expectations of&#xD;
      caregivers regarding this announcement. In the long term, the data collected will be add&#xD;
      value in developing medical recommendations on consultation to announce the diagnosis of&#xD;
      schizophrenia to relatives of patients, in order to best meet the expectations of relatives&#xD;
      and to minimize as much as possible the harmful impact that can have such announcement.&#xD;

      Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects 1% of the population worldwide. The&#xD;
      diagnostic announcement of this chronic disorder is an essential step in the patient's care.&#xD;
      Recommendations specify the importance of including caregivers at the time of the&#xD;
      announcement. In practice, caregivers are not systematically associated with the announcement&#xD;
      of the diagnosis of schizophrenia, while the daily support of patients is provided in 75% of&#xD;
      cases by the family. This support can lead to the exhaustion of caregivers and have&#xD;
      repercussions on their sick loved one.&#xD;

      This study will qualitatively describe and explore the experience of the diagnostic&#xD;
      announcement in relatives of patients with schizophrenia. Specifically, the investigators&#xD;

    <description>The semi-structured qualitative interview will be carried out in a focus group or individually for a period of 1 hour. Focus groups are a group interview technique, moderated by a neutral facilitator in the presence of an observer, which aims to collect information on a limited number of pre-defined questions. In this study we foresee groups of 4 to 5 subjects. Focus groups will be privileged because they allow a better elaboration of the participants and therefore a better collection of data. If the focus group is not possible, the visit will be done individually. This interview will be framework-guided and recorded in their entirety and anonymously using a dictaphone and then transcribed the objective verbatim on a computer using word processing software. These transcriptions will be called the &quot;verbatims&quot;. The source data recorded using a dictaphone will be stored in secure, locked cabinets located within the investigation center.</description>
