  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cook Medical has reported thrombus formation with or without occlusion of the Zenith Alpha&#xD;
      Spiral-Z®. The purpose of this study is to measure the extent of thrombus formation and&#xD;
      occlusion of these stent graft limbs in patients with aortic aneurysms treated at St. Olavs&#xD;
      Hospital in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Information is collected from the Norwegian registry for&#xD;
      vascular surgery (NORKAR), electronic patient journal and the picture archiving and&#xD;
      communication system (PACS). The total number of included patients is estimated to be&#xD;
      approximately 100.&#xD;
