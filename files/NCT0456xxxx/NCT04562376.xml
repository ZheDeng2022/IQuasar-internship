  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is one of the most frequently reported and disabling impairments in multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS) and is associated with activity limitations, participation restrictions and&#xD;
      reduced health-related quality of life (HRQL).MS fatigue is thought to be related to the&#xD;
      disease itself, where increased levels of inflammatory biological markers (cytokines) are&#xD;
      contributing. Resistance training may have an anti-inflammatory effect where a higher&#xD;
      intensity is thought to have a more profound effect. Moderate-intensity resistance training&#xD;
      is well tolerated in people with MS (PwMS) and can reduce self-reported fatigue. There is,&#xD;
      however, a lack of high-quality studies including only fatigued PwMS when evaluating exercise&#xD;
      regimes. Furthermore, the optimal dose (i.e. the combination of duration, frequency and&#xD;
      intensity) is not known. Our hypothesis is that high-intensity resistance training will have&#xD;
      positive effects in fatigued PwMS on functioning (fatigue, mood, activities and&#xD;
      participation) and wellbeing/HRQL; and a positive immunomodulatory effect measured by&#xD;
      inflammatory biological markers in blood. Further, that high-intensity resistance training&#xD;
      twice a week will be superior to once a week&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is chronic inflammatory neurodegenerative disease. About two-thirds&#xD;
      of persons with MS (PwMS) report MS-related fatigue. It is a most disabling impairment and is&#xD;
      associated with activity limitations, participation restrictions and reduced health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (HRQL). MS fatigue may be related directly to the disease, e.g. inflammation.&#xD;
      Resistance training can have direct effects on the MS disease by modulating cytokine levels,&#xD;
      where a higher intensity is thought to have a more profound effect. Thus, there are reasons&#xD;
      to hypothesise that high-intensity resistance training might reduce fatigue in PwMS. There&#xD;
      are, however, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on resistance training in PwMS with&#xD;
      fatigue. Although the recommendation of resistance training for adults with chronic diseases&#xD;
      is twice a week, most primary health-care providers in Sweden only offer supervised training&#xD;
      once a week for a limited period, e.g. 8-12 weeks. Thus, our aims are to evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of 12 weeks high-intensity resistance training on functioning (fatigue, mood, activities and&#xD;
      participation), wellbeing/HRQL and on inflammatory biological markers (e.g. cytokines) in&#xD;
      blood. In this two-armed single-blinded RCT, 90 PwMS with fatigue will be recruited and&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive high-intensity resistance training under the supervision from a&#xD;
      physiotherapist twice a week (group A) or once a week (group B). Primary outcome is fatigue&#xD;
      measured with a patient reported outcome, i.e. the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive&#xD;
      Functions (FSMC), and a change-score of ten points is considered clinically meaningful.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include measures of mood, participation, self-perceived impact of MS,&#xD;
      wellbeing/HRQL and inflammatory biological markers in blood. Data will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline and within a week after the last training session of the 12-week intervention. All&#xD;
      participants will after the end of intervention be offered a prescription of physical&#xD;
      activity (FaR), and have the opportunity for follow-up telephone calls at 3-, 6- and 12&#xD;
      months after the end of the intervention. Assessment of fatigue will also be performed at&#xD;
      these follow-up telephone sessions. Fatigue assessments from a natural history cohort (Combat&#xD;
      study) will be available for comparisons of natural fluctuations of fatigue.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a two-armed single-blinded randomized controlled trial of high-intensity resistance training in PwMS with fatigue where one group receive training twice a week (group A) and the other group once a week (group B). The randomization procedure will be performed after baseline assessments and will be concealed and based on computer-generated block randomization with block sizes of ten. No stratification will be used. Implementation of the random allocation will be done by means of sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelops.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>A person with no further involvement in the study will manage the randomization. A research assistant will assign participants with an identification number which will be used during baseline and follow-up assessments to ensure blinding of the assessors. Thus, outcome assessors are blinded for group allocation. Data entry will be executed by a person blinded for group allocation.</masking_description>
