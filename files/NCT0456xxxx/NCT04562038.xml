  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Family-centered care is a best practice approach to delivering high quality early&#xD;
      intervention (EI) services for children 0-3 years old with developmental needs. Yet, family&#xD;
      engagement in designing and monitoring their child's EI service plan is suboptimal. Families&#xD;
      need a valid, reliable, and useful tool to share in decisions about the scope of their&#xD;
      child's EI service plan. The investigators will achieve a major advance in contributing&#xD;
      occupational therapy expertise to improve family engagement when designing and monitoring&#xD;
      their child's EI services. The investigators will test the use of an evidence-based&#xD;
      electronic tool with families at one EI program, when the child is due for an annual review&#xD;
      of progress in the program. The investigators will also gather input from families,&#xD;
      practitioners, and program leadership to identify facilitators and barriers to its use in&#xD;
      multiple EI programs. This project tries to test an innovation in how the investigators&#xD;
      deliver family-centered and participation-focused care. Study results will yield evidence for&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the electronic intervention on parent activation, EI service plan focus,&#xD;
      EI service use quantity, parent perceptions of EI service quality, and child functioning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor quality of care in early intervention (EI) is pervasive, particularly for vulnerable&#xD;
      populations. Sub-optimal outcomes are perpetuated within this federally-funded, state&#xD;
      administrated program due to significant cuts in federal per child appropriations. Optimizing&#xD;
      EI outcomes will require ensuring the delivery of high value EI (i.e., providing services&#xD;
      with the greatest reach, optimal outcomes, at the lowest cost). A lever to improve&#xD;
      value-based EI is family-centered care, an evidence-based EI approach, which is grounded in&#xD;
      family engagement and shared decision-making. Regrettably, the systematic implementation of&#xD;
      strategies to empower families in this role are suboptimal, perpetuating poor outcomes and&#xD;
      the failure of family-centered care. More than half of all EI enrolled families lack&#xD;
      sufficient tools to engage in shared decision-making with EI practitioners when designing and&#xD;
      monitoring the EI service plan. Therefore, if EI service quality and outcomes are going to be&#xD;
      optimized, there is urgent need to equip families with a tool that will foster shared&#xD;
      decision-making between the provider and family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As EI programs transition to electronic data capture systems for accountability and quality&#xD;
      improvement, the implementation of evidence-based electronic assessments is a scalable&#xD;
      strategy to strengthen family engagement in shared decision-making to design and monitor EI&#xD;
      services. One evidence-based option is the Young Children's Participation in Environment&#xD;
      Measure (YC-PEM) electronic patient-reported outcome (e-PRO). The YC-PEM e-PRO has not been&#xD;
      implemented into routine practice for families to communicate areas of participation&#xD;
      difficulty for shared decision-making about intervention priorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim is to conduct a community-based pragmatic trial of the Young Children's&#xD;
      Participation and Environment Measure (YC-PEM), a valid electronic patient-reported outcome&#xD;
      (e-PRO), at a single large, urban EI program to examine how this intervention is associated&#xD;
      with: 1) EI service use breadth, intensity, and focus, 2) parent activation for shared&#xD;
      decision making and engagement in EI services, 3) parent-reported EI service quality, and 3)&#xD;
      gains in children's functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EI service coordinators will be randomized to intervention and control groups arms, and then&#xD;
      eligible and interested parents on their assigned caseloads will be assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups as part of their child's annual evaluation of progress.&#xD;
      Intervention group subjects will complete the YC-PEM e-PRO before the child's annual&#xD;
      intervention planning meeting. EI service plan focus (participation-focused goals in the&#xD;
      plan), EI service amount (breadth and intensity), EI service quality (parent-reported&#xD;
      activation for shared decision-making to design EI services and parent satisfaction with&#xD;
      family-centeredness of EI service delivery), and child functioning will be evaluated via&#xD;
      electronic records and patient-reported outcomes data collected at baseline, and 4 weeks, 6&#xD;
      months, and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1. Examine the effects of the YC-PEM e-PRO intervention on EI stakeholder outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Aim 1a). Examine the effects of the YC-PEM e-PRO on EI parent activation, parent engagement&#xD;
      in EI services, service plan focus, and service use breadth and intensity. The investigators&#xD;
      will test two hypotheses in this first sub-aim. As compared to children receiving usual EI&#xD;
      care, intervention group subjects will: H1: report higher activation for shared&#xD;
      decision-making and parent engagement when planning and monitoring the child's EI care within&#xD;
      12 months; H2: receive a greater breadth and intensity of participation-focused EI services&#xD;
      within 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Aim 1b). Examine the effects of the YC-PEM e-PRO on parent report of EI service quality. As&#xD;
      compared to usual care subjects, the investigators expect that parents in the intervention&#xD;
      group will report greater satisfaction with: H1: enabling and partnership; H2: general and&#xD;
      specific information exchange for shared decision-making; H3: coordinated and comprehensive&#xD;
      EI care; and H4: respectful and supportive EI care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Aim 1c). Examine the effects of the YC-PEM e-PRO on child functioning. As compared to usual&#xD;
      EI care, intervention group children will: H1: demonstrate greater developmental gains, as&#xD;
      measured by state-mandated and norm-referenced developmental tests done at EI entry and 12&#xD;
      months. H2: demonstrate greater gains in functional skills, as measured by state-mandated&#xD;
      outcomes data at EI entry and 12 months.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Young Children's Participation and Environment Measure (YC-PEM) electronic patient-reported outcome (e-PRO)</intervention_name>
    <description>The Young Children's Participation in Environment Measure (YC-PEM) is an evidence-based option for comprehensive proxy assessment of a young child's current and desired participation in occupations across home, daycare, and community settings. The YC-PEM is an electronic patient-reported outcome (e-PRO) that provides individual caregivers a valid, reliable, and feasible way to communicate information about their child's current participation in home and community activities and areas of participation need. The gained information is then summarized and shared with the child's EI provide team to identify intervention priorities and goal attainment strategies in partnership with families. For quality improvement, EI programs can aggregate the YC-PEM e-PRO data to examine trends in participation as a function of EI service use. It is therefore a promising electronic health systems intervention to enhance the parent-practitioner relationship, and an NIH common data element for trials.</description>
