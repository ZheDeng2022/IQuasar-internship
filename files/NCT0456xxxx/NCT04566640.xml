    <textblock>
      This study evaluate the rate of occurrence of fecal incontinence in patients who had surgery&#xD;
      for posterior pelvic static disorder versus those with medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is also to assess the natural history of constipation symptoms and quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with posterior pelvic static disorder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data of all patients with posterior pelvic static disorder are collected prospectively and&#xD;
      consecutively in the Fondamentum database since 2005, secured and hosted by the Rennes&#xD;
      University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from initial functional assessment, carried out as part of routine care between 2005&#xD;
      and 2019, include a clinical examination of pelvic static disorders, anorectal manometry,&#xD;
      defecography, collection of symptoms by questioning and by a systematic questionnaire&#xD;
      completed by the patient during the routine care consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients identified from this database and meeting the selection criteria will receive an&#xD;
      information letter along with a questionnaire and a stamped envelope for returning the&#xD;
      questionnaire. The self-questionnaires will focus on collecting symptoms related to static&#xD;
      disorders (incontinence, constipation, quality of life). Regarding the management of pelvic&#xD;
      static disorder, we will detail whether it was operated or not, and what were the proposed&#xD;
      medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon receipt of the questionnaire, the new data will be entered into the research-specific&#xD;
      database and will complete the clinical data resulting from the extraction of the care base&#xD;
      The self-administered questionnaire sent to patients includes validated constipation (score&#xD;
      of kess) and fecal incontinence (Cleveland) questionnaires, and quality of life questions&#xD;
      from the validated SF36 questionnaire. It also includes a visual scale ranging from -5 to +5.&#xD;
