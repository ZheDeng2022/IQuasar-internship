  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is common among Veterans and results in poor&#xD;
      psychological functioning, quality of life, and physical health. This includes having&#xD;
      disproportionately high rates of obesity, in part due to PTSD symptoms interfering with&#xD;
      physical activity and healthy diet. Unfortunately, Veterans with PTSD have poorer weight loss&#xD;
      outcomes than those without PTSD in VA's existing weight management program, MOVE!. Based on&#xD;
      pilot work, it appears that a weight management program that augments standard PTSD care and&#xD;
      targets PTSD-related barriers to weight loss improves weight and PTSD symptoms. Whether it&#xD;
      improves these issues more than standard VA care is in need of study, which is the focus of&#xD;
      the proposed research. The proposed study also seeks to understand factors that would&#xD;
      interfere with and facilitate implementing the program in VA if it is effective. This&#xD;
      Veteran-centered, tailored weight loss program may efficiently benefit both physical and&#xD;
      mental health of Veterans with PTSD, addressing standard care limitations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), prevalent among Veterans, puts Veterans at&#xD;
      increased risk for obesity and related conditions. Veterans with PTSD lose less weight in&#xD;
      VA's MOVE! weight management program, due to PTSD symptoms that interfere with activity and&#xD;
      healthy diet. In addition, many Veterans who receive evidence-based PTSD treatment remain&#xD;
      symptomatic. A behavioral weight loss program that augments standard PTSD care and targets&#xD;
      PTSD-related weight loss barriers called MOVE!+UP was piloted and iteratively refined among&#xD;
      44 overweight Veterans with PTSD. The fully developed MOVE!+UP is led by a psychologist and a&#xD;
      Veteran peer support counselor, who provide complementary expertise. It includes 16 group&#xD;
      sessions with 90 minutes of general weight loss support, coupled with Cognitive Behavior&#xD;
      Therapy skills to address PTSD-specific barriers. Each session also includes a 30-minute&#xD;
      community walk to address hypervigilance-based activity barriers and enhance classroom-based&#xD;
      learning. Veterans receive two individual dietician visits, and counseling calls as needed.&#xD;
      The cohort receiving the final MOVE!+UP package reported high satisfaction and had better&#xD;
      weight loss outcomes than Veterans with PTSD in the general MOVE! program. They also reported&#xD;
      substantial PTSD symptom reduction. Treatment targets like eating behaviors, activity, and&#xD;
      insomnia also improved. MOVE!+UP effectiveness must be tested in a randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance/Impact: MOVE!+UP is timely and efficient, simultaneously addressing physical and&#xD;
      mental health of a priority Veteran group. MOVE!+UP is positioned to address HSR&amp;D priorities&#xD;
      by promoting mental health and improving PTSD symptoms, access to care, and whole health.&#xD;
      This study is aligned with HSR&amp;D and ORD methodological priorities by using a hybrid type 1&#xD;
      trial. This study's cost and utilization analyses, and systematic identification of&#xD;
      implementation barriers and facilitators, would place effectiveness findings in context and&#xD;
      facilitate rapid translation to the field if MOVE!+UP is effective. This study will also&#xD;
      provide insights about ways that general MOVE! and PTSD care can be enhanced to improve reach&#xD;
      and effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: MOVE!+UP is the first weight loss program designed to address obesity in Veterans&#xD;
      with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: This study proposes to enroll Veterans with PTSD who are classified as&#xD;
      overweight or with obesity and who are engaged in PTSD care. They will be randomized to usual&#xD;
      care enhanced with MOVE! (control) or usual care enhanced with MOVE!+UP (intervention), and&#xD;
      is guided by three aims: 1) Test whether intervention participants have greater 6-month&#xD;
      weight loss (primary outcome), and 6- and 12-month PTSD symptom reduction and 12-month weight&#xD;
      loss (secondary exploratory outcomes), relative to controls; 2) Assess whether compared to&#xD;
      control, intervention participants have greater improvements on 6-month treatment targets:&#xD;
      physical activity, eating behavior, insomnia, depression, and social support; 3) Estimate&#xD;
      intervention and control condition costs and utilization, and identify MOVE!+UP&#xD;
      implementation barriers and facilitators, to contextualize Aim 1 and inform future&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Hybrid type 1 trial with 164 Veterans with PTSD who are classified as overweight&#xD;
      or with obesity and are currently enrolled in PTSD care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation/Next Steps: This hybrid type 1 trial will provide data needed to prepare a&#xD;
      MOVE!+UP implementation package for broader VA implementation if MOVE!+UP is effective. If it&#xD;
      is not effective, Aims 2 and 3 will help understand how overweight Veterans with PTSD could&#xD;
      be better supported in the future. Implementation activities would be coordinated with&#xD;
      existing local, VISN, and national operational partners.&#xD;
