      The aim is to evaluate exercise capacity, respiratory functions, respiratory and peripheral&#xD;
      muscle strength, inspiratory muscle endurance, physical activity level, quality of life,&#xD;
      fatigue, dyspnea, anxiety, depression and investigate the impact of 24-session pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation training on these parameters in patients with chronic fibrotic&#xD;
      hypersensitivity pneumonitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is a syndrome that results in the excessive immune response to&#xD;
      inhalation of various antigenic particles in the environment. Patients often experience&#xD;
      irreversible physiological disorders and severe dyspnea in the future. Common disorders in&#xD;
      these patients are lung function abnormalities, decreased exercise capacity, muscle weakness,&#xD;
      oxygen diffusion limitation, impaired quality of life, physical inactivity and fatigue. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation training on exercise&#xD;
      capacity, dyspnea, respiratory functions, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength,&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle endurance, physical activity level, quality of life, fatigue, dyspnea,&#xD;
      anxiety, depression in patients with chronic fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The study&#xD;
      was planned as a prospective, double-blind, case-control study. At least 30 patients with&#xD;
      hypersensitivity pneumonitis will be included in the study. The cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation program will be included inspiratory muscle training, upper extremity aerobic&#xD;
      exercise and progressive resistance training will be performed in the exercise training group&#xD;
      during 24 sessions. Alternative upper extremity exercises combined with breathing exercises&#xD;
      will be performed in the control group. Functional exercise capacity, respiratory functions,&#xD;
      respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, inspiratory muscle endurance, physical activity&#xD;
      levels, quality of life, fatigue, dyspnea, anxiety and depressions will be evaluated before&#xD;
      and after treatment.&#xD;
