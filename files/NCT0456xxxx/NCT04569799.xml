  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if a different type of imaging study called&#xD;
      contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is as good as, or better than CT or MRI in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after receiving TACE treatment&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective trial to determine if contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is&#xD;
      non-inferior to CT or MRI in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following&#xD;
      transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE) treatments. All patients will receive standard&#xD;
      of care CT/MRI and will also get a contrast ultrasound to directly compare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timepoint 0- Our proposed study population includes subjects with diagnosed HCC, who are&#xD;
      treated with TACE. Patients will be identified and enrolled at the time of initial TACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timepoint 1- Following initial TACE, patients will receive a CT or MRI, as routinely ordered&#xD;
      in the post-TACE setting, to assess for residual or new HCC. At this same imaging follow-up&#xD;
      visit, patients will also receive a one-time additional contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS).&#xD;
      Timepoint 2- Per standard clinical care, patients typically return for repeat imaging&#xD;
      (CT/MRI) within 2-4 months following the first imaging visit.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of our study is to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the two studies (Research Timepoint 1) to evaluate for non-inferiority between CEUS and the clinical gold standard of CT/MRI using the Liver Reporting &amp; Data System (LIRAD). We will be assessing the presence of treated or residual tumor, new sites of disease, and portal vein thrombus.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the CEUS with CT or MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 4 and 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The second objective of the project will compare the CEUS with a second, standard of care, follow-up CT or MRI (performed 2-4 months later [Research Timepoint 2]). CT can have false negatives due to ethiodol obscuring subtle, early disease and it is possible that CEUS could identify residual disease earlier compared to the gold standards, but would be characterized as a false positive if compared only to the initial imaging (Timepoint 1). This follow-up will evaluate for false positives or negatives on any of the modalities.</description>

    <measure>Subjective data Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>2-4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The third objective of the project will evaluate patient subjective data in regards to imaging modality preference and possible effects on compliance. The survey will be administered at the conclusion of Timepoint 1 and will include questions about about your preferences and experience with CEUS and modality preference, graded on a Likert scale1 - 7 (1 = not at all, 7 = max )</description>

    <description>Following treatment, patients will receive their standard CT or MRI, as routinely ordered in the post-TACE setting. This imaging will be per standard protocol, as directed by hepatology or oncology services, often 2 to 4 months after the treatment. At the same visit, patients will also receive a one-time additional contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS),</description>
