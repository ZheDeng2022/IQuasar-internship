  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substance use and drug related disorders are important public health problems. Alcohol and&#xD;
      illicit drug use account for 5.4% of the total burden of disease and the peak has been found&#xD;
      in early adulthood (between ages 20 and 30 years). Substance use is one of the leading&#xD;
      problems among Chilean adolescents. One out of four 8 th to 12 th graders have smoked&#xD;
      cigarettes in the last month. A 35.6% of students (37%, girls; 34.2%, boys) between Year 8&#xD;
      and Year 12 have reported any alcohol use during the last month. It is worrying that a third&#xD;
      of 14 years old students report using alcohol in the last month in Chile. Furthermore, two&#xD;
      out of three who are using alcohol, report regularly using 5 or more drinks in a row during&#xD;
      the last month. Cannabis use among young Chileans has increased in recent years. Today, one&#xD;
      out of five students between Year 8 and Year 12 referred cannabis use during the last 30&#xD;
      days. Almost a 20% of students in Year 8 have used cannabis in the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, is urgent to provide evidence-based drug preventive interventions to the Chilean&#xD;
      population, specifically to school students, to tackle this problem and reduce the risk for a&#xD;
      more dramatic future health scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the cultural&#xD;
      adaptation of &quot;Yo Sé Lo Que Quiero&quot; program. This is a pilot randomized controlled trial. The&#xD;
      participants of this pilot were students attending six low-income primary schools in&#xD;
      Santiago, Chile.&#xD;

    <description>A questionnaire exploring the acceptability of the program was answered by the students who participated in the intervention. This questionnaire asked about the students´opinions about the content of the intervention, strategies used, materials, and performance of the facilitators. The questionnaire also asked about satisfaction and the helpfulness of the program to improve emotions management, school climate, relationships with other people, and learning about drugs´ risks. Finally, the questionnaire asked about sense of self-efficacy to avoid drugs today and in the future.</description>

    <description>The European Drug Addiction Prevention Trial Questionnaire (EU-Dap) was the instrument used to evaluate the Unplugged drug prevention program among adolescents in The European Drug Addiction Prevention (EU-Dap) trial project which took place between 2003-2005. EU-Dap was granted by the European Commission within the 2002 and 2005 Public Health Programme for drug prevention (Grant #SPC 2002376 and Grant #SPC 2005312).&#xD;
This questionnaire collects information, knowledge and opinions on substance use, with emphasis on alcohol, tobacco and drugs use. It also gather information about tobacco, alcohol, marijuana and other drugs use; and assess risk and protective factors. It consists of 45 questions. In the Chilean validation, all subscales had an acceptable internal reliability (omega &gt; 0.65).</description>

    <description>The Substance Use Risk Profile Scale, is a self-reported questionnaire that gather information about anxiety sensitivity, hopelessness, sensation seeking, and impulsivity. These four sub scales have been associated as risk factors for drug use among adolescents. the internal reliability for each subscale is: anxiety sensitivity (alpha=0.65), hopelessness (alpha=0.76), sensation seeking (alpha=0.62), and impulsivity (alpha=0.61).</description>
