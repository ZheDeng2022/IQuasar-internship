  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common orthopedic procedure associated with severe&#xD;
      postoperative pain which may limit patient rehabilitation and hospital discharge. Although&#xD;
      various analgesic techniques have been proposed, there is currently no consensus on the&#xD;
      optimal protocol to improve functional outcomes following TKA. The ideal analgesic regimen&#xD;
      post TKA should enable adequate pain control, early mobilization and physical therapy,&#xD;
      shorten hospital stay, reduce the risk of postoperative complications and improve patient&#xD;
      satisfaction. Our hypothesis is iPACK (Interspace between the Popliteal Artery and the&#xD;
      Capsule of the posterior Knee) peripheral nerves anesthetic block is superior to&#xD;
      Periarticular local Infiltration Analgesia (LIA)which is commonly given by the surgeons&#xD;
      during the TKA in terms of pain relief and early mobilization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most frequent procedures performed by&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeons. Research has found that orthopedic surgeries are the most painful&#xD;
      procedures.(1) Unrelieved pain post orthopedic surgery is a stressor that can cause altered&#xD;
      physiologic changes and negative effects on every organ system of the body. Untreated pain&#xD;
      can result in complex pathophysiology than the pain caused by the original injury or disease.&#xD;
      This can have both detrimental physical and psychological consequences for patients, as well&#xD;
      as a substantial economic impact due to increased costs of health care and lost productivity.&#xD;
      (2) The anatomy of sensory supply to the knee joint is complex with contributions from both&#xD;
      the lumbar and sacral plexuses. The anterior-medial compartmental innervation consists of&#xD;
      branches from the femoral nerve, including the saphenous nerve, the medial femoral cutaneous&#xD;
      nerve and the nerve to vastus medialis. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, the common&#xD;
      peroneal nerve, and the nerves to vastus intermedius and lateralis innervate the knee&#xD;
      anterolaterally. The posterior group consists of the popliteal nerve plexus that ramifies&#xD;
      around the genicular vasculature in the popliteal fossa. The popliteal nerve plexus is&#xD;
      derived from the tibial nerve and the posterior branch of the obturator nerve. The posterior&#xD;
      group supplies intra-articular innervation to the menisci, the peri-meniscular joint capsule,&#xD;
      the cruciate ligaments, the infra-patellar fat pad, and the posterior part of the fibrous&#xD;
      knee capsule.(3) The medial para-patellar arthrotomy performed for total knee arthroplasty,&#xD;
      through the anteromedial integument of the knee and the extra-articular medial retinacular&#xD;
      complex, evokes pain mediated by the infra-patellar branch of the saphenous nerve, the medial&#xD;
      retinacular nerve (the terminal branch of the nerve to vastus medialis), and the anterior&#xD;
      branch of the medial femoral cutaneous nerve. This procedure will not affect the&#xD;
      extra-articular nerve branches to the anterolateral portion of the knee from the common&#xD;
      peroneal nerve, the nerves to vastus intermedius and lateralis, and the lateral femoral&#xD;
      cutaneous nerve. The intra-articular excision evokes pain from structures innervated by the&#xD;
      posterior group. (4) Ultrasound-guided Femoral Nerve Block (FNB) is one of the most commonly&#xD;
      used techniques that has been shown to significantly improve analgesia and reduce&#xD;
      postoperative opioid consumption after TKA. However, FNB may lead to quadriceps muscle&#xD;
      weakness, limiting ambulation and increasing the risk of falls, making physical&#xD;
      rehabilitation results unsatisfactory.(5) Recently, there has been increased interest in the&#xD;
      Adductor Canal Block (ACB) for pain relief after total knee arthroplasty. (6) The adductor&#xD;
      canal is a pyramidal, musculoaponeurotic tunnel from the apex of the femoral triangle to the&#xD;
      adductor hiatus, running between the vastus medialis muscle anterolaterally and the adductor&#xD;
      longus and adductor Magnus muscles posteromedially. It is covered in its entire length by the&#xD;
      vastoadductor membrane. The contents of the adductor canal include the superficial artery and&#xD;
      vein, saphenous nerve, the nerve to vastus medialis, the posterior branch of the obturator&#xD;
      nerve, and in some cases, the medial cutaneous nerve and the anterior branch of the obturator&#xD;
      nerve. The advantage of this technique rests in the fact that it provides localized&#xD;
      motor-sparing analgesia, with similar opioid consumption and side effects when compared with&#xD;
      FNB.(7) However, ACB does not provide analgesia to the posterior aspect of the knee, which&#xD;
      can be moderate to severe after surgery. This pain may be ameliorated by the addition of the&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided local anesthetic infiltration of the Interspace between the Popliteal&#xD;
      Artery and the Capsule of the posterior Knee (iPACK). (8) Although this technique seems to&#xD;
      provide many advantages, it may present some limitations and risks like intravascular&#xD;
      injection and injury due to the presence of the popliteal vessels near the target. Although&#xD;
      the use of ultrasound guidance decreases this risk, significant bleeding and serious&#xD;
      complications can still occur due to the inability to recognize and compress the source of&#xD;
      bleeding. (4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this study we are going to recruit 169 participants to compare them in two&#xD;
      groups. group-1 iPACK (n=85) will receive Adductor Canal Block (ACB) + iPACK and group 2 LIA&#xD;
      (n=84) ACB+ periarticular Local Infiltration Analgesia (LIA). All participants, care provider&#xD;
      (nurses &amp; assistant anesthetists) and outcome assessors (physiotherapist) will be blinded to&#xD;
      the group allocation. Only the anesthesiologist responsible for perioperative care performing&#xD;
      the ACB and iPACK blocks will be aware of the randomization. All peripheral nerve blocks will&#xD;
      be performed with complete aseptic technique and under ultrasound guidance. Periarticular LIA&#xD;
      will be performed by the surgeon with the landmark technique base. This study will be&#xD;
      conducted in six months' duration. All patients will consent for spinal anesthesia, ACB, and&#xD;
      iPACK and they will be instructed how to report pain on a 10 cm long Numerical Rating Scale&#xD;
      (NRS) postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome, severity of pain (NRS) will be evaluated in Post Anesthesia Care Unit&#xD;
      (PACU). The secondary outcome, time to mobilization along with pain score will be recorded in&#xD;
      the ward after 2 hours of surgery then every 12 hours until the patient discharged home.&#xD;
      Quadriceps muscle strength will be evaluated with the knee range of motion (ROM). A&#xD;
      completely straight knee joint (extension) will measure 0° and a fully bent knee will have a&#xD;
      flexion of at 130° degrees. The Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) tests to evaluate functional recovery&#xD;
      after TKA. The TUG test measures the time it takes a patient to get up from a chair, walk 3&#xD;
      m, and return to the sitting position in the chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival to operation room (OR), all eligible participants will have intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      cannula in situ and monitors according to the Association of Anesthetists of Great Britain&#xD;
      and Ireland (AAGBI). Under complete aseptic technique, spinal anesthesia will be performed&#xD;
      with pencil point 25 Gauge (Whitacre) needle with heavy Bupivacaine 0.5% and Fentanyl 15&#xD;
      micrograms (mics) total 3 milliliters (ml). After spinal anesthesia, each participant will&#xD;
      receive either ultrasound-guided ACB+iPACK or ACB+ periarticular LIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of peripheral nerve blocks technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adductor Canal Block (ACB): The skin is disinfected and the transducer (SonoSite 8-14 MHz) is&#xD;
      placed anteromedially, approximately at the junction between the middle and distal third of&#xD;
      the thigh. The saphenous nerve is usually identified as anterior and lateral to the femoral&#xD;
      artery. The needle (Pajunk Germany100 mm) will be inserted in-plane from lateral-to-medial&#xD;
      orientation and advanced toward the femoral artery deep to the sartorius muscle. Once the&#xD;
      needle tip is visualized anterior to the artery and after careful aspiration, 1-2 mL of local&#xD;
      anesthetic will be injected to confirm the proper injection site. If injection of local&#xD;
      anesthetic does not appear to result in its spread around the femoral artery, additional&#xD;
      needle repositions and injections may be necessary. A total of 20 millilitres (ml) of&#xD;
      Bupivacaine 0.25% will be injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interspace between the popliteal artery and the capsule of the posterior knee (iPACK):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be placed in a supine position with the lower extremity flexed at the knee&#xD;
      and abducted at the hip. To begin scanning, the transducer will be placed on the lower third&#xD;
      of the medial thigh to visualize the femur and the femoral vessels in cross-section. The&#xD;
      transducer then will be slide caudally to observe the femoral artery as it dives into the&#xD;
      popliteal fossa through the adductor hiatus to become the popliteal artery. At this point,&#xD;
      the transducer will be moved posteriorly and inferiorly to visualize the space between the&#xD;
      popliteal artery and the shaft of the femur just superior to the femoral condyles. The needle&#xD;
      will be inserted, in a plane, from the anterior end of the transducer in a medial to the&#xD;
      lateral trajectory, keeping the needle parallel to the acoustic shadow of the femur. With the&#xD;
      needle tip resting 2 cm beyond the lateral border of the artery, 20 mL of Bupivacaine 0.25%&#xD;
      will be injected, after negative aspiration of blood, to infiltrate the tissue space in&#xD;
      divided doses as the needle is withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periarticular Local Infiltration Analgesia (LIA):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixture of Bupivacaine 0.25% 20 ml + epinephrine 100 mics ± lornoxicam 8 mg ± morphine 10&#xD;
      mg ± tranexamic acid 1 gm in 40 ml normal saline (NS) will be injected into the posterior&#xD;
      capsule and the medial and lateral ligaments just before implantation: after insertion of the&#xD;
      implants and into the capsule and retinacular tissues. The remaining solution (approximately&#xD;
      20 mL) will be used to infiltrate the muscle and subcutaneous tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively all participants will be prescribed 1 gm Paracetamol oral every 6 hours +&#xD;
      buprenorphine transdermal patch 5 mics ± celecoxib 200 mg every 12 hours ± oxycodone 10 mg&#xD;
      every 12 hours ± pregabalin 75 mg every 12 hours for breakthrough pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In King Khalid University Hospital, we are approximately doing annually 300 TKA cases.&#xD;
      Assuming that and confidence level of 95%, margin of error 5% Raosoft® recommended sample&#xD;
      size is 169.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected by the outcome assessors who will be unaware of group allocation&#xD;
      and will record their findings in patient's file and on predesigned form. Patients&#xD;
      demographic data, duration of surgery, tourniquet time, PACU stay, postoperative heart rate,&#xD;
      mean arterial pressure, pain score, knee range of motion (ROM), time-up-go (TUG), time to&#xD;
      hospital discharge, patient and surgeon satisfaction and any complication will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)&#xD;
      version 24.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
