  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DNA methylation biomarker for diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma in patients with bile duct&#xD;
      stricture has high sensitivity and specificity compared with cytology from the brush&#xD;
      specimens&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The methylation of HOXA1, NEUROG1 were used to determine cholangiocarcinoma from brushed&#xD;
      biliary samples. However, the sensitivity and specificity of this test for cholangiocarcinoma&#xD;
      is still required.&#xD;
