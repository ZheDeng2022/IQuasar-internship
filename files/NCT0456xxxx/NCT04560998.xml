  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is done to see if semaglutide has an effect on walking ability compared with&#xD;
      placebo (dummy medicine) in people with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. Participants will either get semaglutide or placebo (&quot;dummy&quot;) medicine - which&#xD;
      treatment participants get is decided by chance. Semaglutide is a medicine for type 2&#xD;
      diabetes that can be prescribed by doctors in some countries. Participants will get the study&#xD;
      medicine (semaglutide or placebo) in a pre-filled pen for injection. Participants must inject&#xD;
      it once a week into the stomach area, thigh, or upper arm, at any time of the day. The study&#xD;
      will last for about 59 weeks. Participants will have 8 clinic visits and 1 phone call with&#xD;
      the study doctor. At some clinic visits, participants will have blood tests. At some visits&#xD;
      participants will also do a treadmill test to measure how far they can walk. Women cannot&#xD;
      take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to become pregnant during the study period.&#xD;

    <description>Score on a scale. Vascular Quality of Life 6 (VascuQoL): A shorter version of the standardized, validated questionnaire, VascuQoL-25 which is used to evaluate vascular disease-specific health outcomes. VascuQol total score includes scores of Activity Domain, Symptom Domain, Pain Domain, Emotional Domain and Social Domain. Each item is rated as a 4 point response scale, with a score of 1 being the worst and a score of 4 the best possible. The total score is the sum of all 6 items scores. Each question relates to a separate domain, with a highest score of 4 which indicates best health outcome. The VascuQoL-6 is aimed specifically at PAD patients</description>

    <description>Score on a scale. Short form (SF)-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ (acute version) questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health, of which will be summarised into a physical health. The physical score ranges from 24-101(where higher scores indicate a better physical capability). The domain scores will then be transformed into norm-based scores. At least seven domains must have valid data in order to calculate the physical health. To calculate physical health, the physical domain must be one of these seven domains. These scores will be summarised by domains and component summary scores by treatment and visit. A positive change in score indicates an improvement since baseline</description>
