  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After partial spinal cord injury, gait deficits may be present and often remain even after&#xD;
      intensive rehabilitation. New robotic technologies have recently emerged to help augment the&#xD;
      extent of rehabilitation. However, these are complex tools to integrate into clinical&#xD;
      practice and little is known about the potential factors that may influence the uptake of a&#xD;
      locomotor program using this technology by clinicians. The goal of this project is to bring&#xD;
      together researchers, administrators, clinicians and patients to define and implement an&#xD;
      overground robotized gait training program in clinic. We will also investigate the added&#xD;
      value of leg and trunk muscle stimulation combined with robotic walking training, to see if&#xD;
      it could enhance recovery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Powered exoskeleton technology represents a promising rehabilitation intervention for persons&#xD;
      with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). The overall aim of the present study is to&#xD;
      investigate the implementability of an overground locomotor training program using a powered&#xD;
      exoskeleton in persons with a subacute iSCI at the Institut de réadaptation en déficience&#xD;
      physique de Québec, with and without functional electrical stimulation (FES). Over the 2-year&#xD;
      period of the project, a logic model will be co-developed with stakeholders to support&#xD;
      clinicians and administrators in the management of the locomotor training program. Using&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative research methods, we will evaluate the feasibility and perceived&#xD;
      barriers/facilitators to the implementation in clinical practice of the training program.&#xD;
      Finally, a crossover design with individuals receiving the intervention either combined with&#xD;
      FES or not, will allow quantifying of the benefits of combining FES in addition to robotic&#xD;
      gait training on functional walking capacity in persons with a subacute iSCI.&#xD;

    <description>This scale specifically targets secondary conditions associated with SCI that directly and indirectly impact health and physical functioning.

Higher scores indicate greater overall problems with secondary conditions</description>

Specific level of assistance for each hip and knee, and gait parameters will be set and adjusted during a familiarization period with the PE. Level of PE assistance will then be adjusted weekly to ensure training progression. For each participant, FES intensity will be set for each muscle in order to elicit a palpable muscle contraction. For the sham FES, all parameters will be the same except that a subthreshold current intensity (i.e. not producing palpable muscle contraction) will be delivered. FES timing and duration is already built into the device.</description>
