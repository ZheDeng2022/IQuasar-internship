  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study of outcomes of individuals who entered jail during a&#xD;
      period during which one of three serial HIV testing strategies is implemented. This study&#xD;
      involves two sub-studies. One sub-study will examine referrals to HIV prevention programs for&#xD;
      persons testing negative for HIV while in jail. The second sub-study will monitor antiviral&#xD;
      use among those testing positive for HIV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Incarcerated Americans on any given day represent one in 40 (2.5%) Persons Living with HIV&#xD;
      (PLWH) in this country, but those ever incarcerated over the course of a year represent 17%&#xD;
      of the US epidemic. PLWH are a diverse group in terms of awareness and management of their&#xD;
      disease. A portion may be aware of their HIV status and on treatment. This subgroup is at&#xD;
      risk of disruption in care if incarcerated. Others may be aware of their status, but&#xD;
      untreated, while still others may be unaware of their HIV status. The latter group is of&#xD;
      particular importance in terms of the HIV epidemic in criminal justice settings, as a recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis indicated that up to 15% of individuals entering jail have undiagnosed&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Good management of PLWH during a period of incarceration is critical. Ensuring that care&#xD;
      relationships are maintained or newly established will improve health outcomes among PLWH and&#xD;
      reduce the risk of transmission once they are discharged. As the median length of stay in&#xD;
      jail is short (median &lt; 7 days), rapid HIV testing is critical. Maximizing the yield and&#xD;
      speed of HIV testing in a jail environment has the potential to promote rapid entry into&#xD;
      care, or rapid re-engagement if persons have fallen out of care. For those testing negative,&#xD;
      it can hasten the referral to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How correctional facilities offer HIV testing and begin treatment affects long-term outcomes.&#xD;
      Because of the rapid churn of jail, point-of-care (POC) rapid testing may lead to a higher&#xD;
      percentage of patients receiving test results before leaving jail, compared to conventional&#xD;
      assays. Fourth generation laboratory-based antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) testing can diagnosis&#xD;
      more persons with acute HIV infection, who may be in the window period before the POC test&#xD;
      turns positive, but has a several hour test turn-around time, and those tested may leave jail&#xD;
      before receiving their result. Using both tests for every entrant would permit the jail to&#xD;
      experience the benefit of both methods but at greater expense. Collaborating with Washington,&#xD;
      DC's city jail, known as DC Department of Corrections (DC DOC), and Unity Healthcare, the&#xD;
      network of Federally Qualified Health Centers in Washington DC, which also provides care&#xD;
      within the DC DOC, this study has a unique opportunity to measure rapidity of testing,&#xD;
      linkage to and commencement of care, and achievement of viral suppression, along with costs&#xD;
      of HIV identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study uses a unique, time-sensitive opportunity to compare three separate strategies of&#xD;
      universal HIV screening and treating. The strategies of POC testing, 4th generation&#xD;
      laboratory-based Ag/Ab testing, and a combination of the two tests will be compared in the DC&#xD;
      jail. A rigorous assessment of the three strategies in terms of their feasibility, process&#xD;
      measures, and cost-effectiveness on an institutional level will help to guide implementation&#xD;
      decisions in jails across the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One sub-study will assess the number of persons testing negative who are referred to&#xD;
      prevention programs after leaving the jail. A second sub-study will examine antiviral use&#xD;
      after jail release, among PLWH.&#xD;
