  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peri-implantitis is a pathological condition occurring in tissues around dental implants,&#xD;
      characterized by inflammation in the peri-implant connective tissue and progressive loss of&#xD;
      supporting bone. The goals of peri-implantitis treatment is the resolution of peri-implant&#xD;
      soft tissue inflammation and stabilization of the bony attachment (e.g., the level of&#xD;
      osseointegration). For this decontamination of the implant surface is mandatory. In order to&#xD;
      increase implant surface decontamination, several adjunctive tools have been proposed and&#xD;
      investigated both in pre-clinical and clinical studies such as the use of photodynamic&#xD;
      therapy and lasers. So far, no data are available to clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      adjunctive use of a diode laser in the non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis. Therefore,&#xD;
      the aim of the present randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate the adjunctive&#xD;
      effect of the application of a diode laser to treat peri-implantitis lesions by means of a&#xD;
      non-surgical approach. A total of 30 patients is randomly allocated to two groups. The test&#xD;
      group receives 3 x nonsurgical mechanical treatment with diode laser application whereas the&#xD;
      control group receives the same treatment with sham laser application. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      the peri-implant pocket probing depth at 12 months.&#xD;

      Peri-implantitis is a pathological condition occurring in tissues around dental implants,&#xD;
      characterized by inflammation in the peri-implant connective tissue and progressive loss of&#xD;
      supporting bone. Peri-implantitis is a disease with increasing incidence that, if left&#xD;
      untreated, leads to implant loss. The etiological factors of peri-implant infections are&#xD;
      similar to those involved in periodontal diseases. Consequently, the goals of&#xD;
      peri-implantitis treatment must be the resolution of peri-implant soft tissue inflammation&#xD;
      and stabilization of the bony attachment (e.g., the level of osseointegration). This can only&#xD;
      be achieved under the condition that the majority of bacterial biofilms and hard deposits are&#xD;
      eliminated on the implant surface to create a biologically acceptable surface conducive to&#xD;
      wound healing. Decontamination of the implant surface is mandatory to resolve the&#xD;
      inflammatory process and to establish healthy peri-implant tissues. To increase implant&#xD;
      surface decontamination, several adjunctive tools have been proposed and investigated both in&#xD;
      pre-clinical and clinical studies such as the use of photodynamic therapy and lasers. So far,&#xD;
      no data are available to clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the adjunctive use of a diode&#xD;
      laser in the non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis. Therefore, the aim of the present&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate the adjunctive effect of the application&#xD;
      of a diode laser to treat peri-implantitis lesions by means of a non-surgical approach. A&#xD;
      total of 30 patients is randomly allocated to two groups. The test group receives 3 x&#xD;
      nonsurgical mechanical treatment with diode laser application whereas the control group&#xD;
      receives the same treatment with sham laser application. The primary outcome is the mean&#xD;
      peri-implant pocket probing depth (PPD) at 12 months. The secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change at deepest PPD (mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in probing attachment level (PAL) (mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in the % of implants with BoP / SUP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean radiographic bone fill (mm) at mesial and distal sites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in width of keratinized mucosa (KM) (mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in microbial samples composition at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in patients' related outcomes measures (PROMs) by means of a Visual Analogue&#xD;
           Scale (VAS) (range: 0-10)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) composition&#xD;

    <description>After mechanical debridement, the pockets around the implant will be rinsed with sterile saline solution. Adjunctive diode laser (settings: 810 nm, 2.5 W, 50 Hz, 10 ms) will be applied 3x for 30 s (i.e., 90 s per appointment) using a 400-lm thick fiber (WhiteStar, Orcos Medical AG, KÃ¼snacht, Switzerland) in the test group. In the control group, non-activated (= placebo) adjunctive diode laser will be applied. The entire treatment procedure, including mechanical debridement, will be performed at Day 0 (= baseline), 7 and 14. The laser decontamination procedure will occur by systematically moving the laser tip along the subgingival implant surface in a vertical and horizontal scanning way. The laser tip will be checked after 4-5 s for coagulation to prevent hotspots in the soft tissues.</description>
