  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients from 60 to 75 years old diagnosed with cerebral small vessel disease with no history&#xD;
      of symptomatic stroke, brain tumor, traumatic brain injury, seizures and neurodegenerative or&#xD;
      mental disorder will undergo overnight leg actigraphy and cardiorespiratory monitoring. Those&#xD;
      of them with apnea/hypopnea index under 5 will be enrolled. Brain MRI and cognitive&#xD;
      assessment will be performed at baseline and in 1-year follow-up, sleep quality will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline with self-reported questionnaires. Progression of cerebral small vessel&#xD;
      disease markers and cognitive dysfunction will be compared between patients with high&#xD;
      periodic limb movement index (the number of periodic limb movement ≥ 15 per hour of sleep)&#xD;
      and controls (periodic limb movement index &lt; 15/h).&#xD;

    <measure>White matter hyperintensities volume change</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>All the images will be processed with online software pipeline to make an automated volumetric measurement of white matter hyperintensities. The volume of the white matter lesion will be calculated separately for the periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial and deep white matter areas as well as total volume of the lesion. Baseline volumes will be subtracted from follow-up volumes to obtain absolute white matter hyperintensities volume change.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Degree of Cognitive Decline</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The scores of cognitive tests (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), 12-word Verbal Memory Test, Benton Visual Retention Test, Frontal Assessment Battery, Trail Making Test (parts A and B), phonetic and semantic verbal fluency assessment, Symbol Digit Modalities Test) at baseline will be subtracted from the corresponding baseline scores. The obtained difference reflects the degree of cognitive decline in 1 year.</description>
