             will remain eligible. Participant must have a complete antiretroviral treatment&#xD;
             history including past and present data on resistance to antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Agree to continue their current antiretroviral regimen during the study period unless&#xD;
             change in treatment with antiretroviral regimen is medically indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have, in the Investigator's opinion, a fully active alternative antiretroviral regimen&#xD;
             that can be used if resistance develops to the current antiretroviral therapy regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. CD4 T cell count &gt;400 cells/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has adequate organ function as indicated by the following laboratory values:&#xD;

               -  Prothrombin Time or INR ≤ 1.5 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 times the ULN range. If total bilirubin is elevated, direct&#xD;
                  bilirubin must be &lt; 2 times the ULN range, except in participants with Gilbert's&#xD;
                  Syndrome who must have serum bilirubin &lt;3.0 times ULN (NOTE: If participant is on&#xD;
                  an atazanavir containing therapy then a direct bilirubin should be measured&#xD;
                  instead of the total bilirubin and must be ≤ 1.0mg/dL. Also, asymptomatic&#xD;
                  elevations due to ART medications are not exclusionary when, in the opinion of&#xD;
                  the Investigator, the abnormalities are not attributable to intrinsic hepatic&#xD;
                  disease).&#xD;

               -  The results for hepatitis B may be positive for surface antibodies against HBV&#xD;
                  but must be negative for circulating HBV surface antigen to confirm the absence&#xD;
                  of active infection and negative for HBV core antigen to excluded previous active&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  The results for hepatitis C virus (HCV) may be positive for antibodies against&#xD;
                  HCV but must be negative for HCV viral RNA in blood to confirm the absence of&#xD;
