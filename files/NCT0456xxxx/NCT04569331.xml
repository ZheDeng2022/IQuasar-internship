  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many of the patients operated with sphincter preservation will present an alteration of bowel&#xD;
      function and defecation. This dysfunction is variable in its symptoms and severity, and&#xD;
      manifests itself in the form of urgency, incontinence and fragmentation of faeces, with&#xD;
      repeated, incomplete or difficult evacuations. The set of these symptoms constitutes what is&#xD;
      known as anterior resection syndrome (ARS), which can negatively influence the quality of&#xD;
      life of the operated patients and constitutes the main objective of the study to be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From this study, the investigators want to evaluate the efficacy of stimulation of the&#xD;
      efferent loop prior to the closure of the ileostomy along with rehabilitation of the pelvic&#xD;
      floor after the closure of the ileostomy, in the quality of life of patients who underwent&#xD;
      anterior resection of the rectum. A non-pharmacological randomized clinical trial will be&#xD;
      conducted, comparing a control group (usual clinical practice), with respect to the&#xD;
      experimental group where stimulation of the efferent loop will be performed prior to the&#xD;
      closure of the ostomy along with pelvic floor rehabilitation after the closure of the latter.&#xD;
      The main dependent variable will be the quality of life evaluated according to the QLQ CR-29&#xD;
      questionnaire, and secondary dependent variables will be evaluated postoperative paralytic&#xD;
      ileus and the previous resection syndrome using the LARS scale.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 month post closure of the ileostomy</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ CR-29 questionnaire consists of 29 items (Likert scale), with a response scale for each of them from 1 to 4, with the following structure: 1 = Not at All 2 = A little; 3 = Quite a Bit; 4 = Very much. The QLQ-CR29 has five functional and 18 symptom scales. It contains four subscales (urinary frequency (UF), blood and mucus in stool (BMS), stool frequency (SF), and body image (BI)) and 19 single items (urinary incontinence, dysuria, abdominal pain, buttock pain, bloating, dry mouth, hair loss, taste, anxiety, weight, flatulence, fecal incontinence, sore skin, embarrassment, stoma care problems, sexual interest (men), impotence, sexual interest (women), and dyspareunia). Patients are asked to indicate their symptoms during the past week(s). Scores can be linearly transformed to provide a score from 0 to 100. Higher scores represent better functioning on the functional scales and a higher level of symptoms on the symptom scales.</description>

    <description>Patients undergoing anterior rectal resection with protective ileostomy will follow routine clinical practice.&#xD;
During hospital admission for ileostomy closure surgery, the stoma therapist reinforces the information on the possibility of anterior resection syndrome (ARS) and hygienic-dietary measures. At the level of the ARS, the patient is informed of the possibility of increased frequency of bowel movements, evacuation dysfunction, such as urgency to defecate or feeling of incomplete emptying. At the level of diet, an astringent diet is recommended during the first week after ileostomy closure to avoid liquid stools. It is also recommended at the level of perineal hygiene to use a cleanser with a pH similar to that of the skin, applying the least possible force on the skin, dry gently after each bowel movement and apply a skin protection product to avoid dermatitis associated with incontinence.</description>

    <description>Stimulation of efferent loop: 3 weeks before the ileostomy closure surgery, efferent loop will be stimulated with 250 ml of water and thickened.&#xD;
This procedure consists of introducing through the light efferent loop ileostomy 250 ml of water with thickener every 48-hours during the first two weeks and once daily the thrid week with a Foley catheter. Patient will be provided with all the material and the procedure sheet for all the stimulation of the efferent loop sessions. This technique will be performed at patient's home until the day before the ostomy patient closure surgery.</description>
