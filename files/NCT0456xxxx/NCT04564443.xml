  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to assess performance of the Medaxis Debritom+™&#xD;
      and to collect subject outcome data in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) vs&#xD;
      Standard sharp debridement.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The economic burden of DFUs costs the United States over $50 billion each year. The cost to&#xD;
      treat one subject with DFUs ranges from $11,700 to $16,883. Although approximately 70% of&#xD;
      DFUs are shown to heal with good SOC, at least 30% become chronic wounds. These non-healing&#xD;
      wounds are at greater risk for infection and lower extremity amputation. Consequently, good&#xD;
      standard of care therapy is important for subjects with chronic DFUs to improve subject&#xD;
      outcomes, lower treatment costs and reduce the risk of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The removal of necrotic tissue such as slough, eschar, and underlying biofilm constitutes one&#xD;
      of the most important parts of standard of care (SOC). Currently, a variety of techniques are&#xD;
      used to debride chronic wounds, such as larval therapy, autolytic and enzymatic methods,&#xD;
      monofilament polyester fiber pads or brushes, and mechanical debridement with curettes and&#xD;
      scalpels. It has also been demonstrated that more frequent debridement, on average, results&#xD;
      in faster wound healing. While regarded as the &quot;gold standard,&quot; sharp debridement requires&#xD;
      considerable experience of clinicians to ensure that contaminated and devitalized tissue is&#xD;
      entirely removed without extensively damaging surrounding healthy tissue. Moreover, a recent&#xD;
      research has demonstrated that even when surgical debridement is well-conducted so that it&#xD;
      removes the majority of biofilm, within 72 hours, biofilm often re-establishes itself. Given&#xD;
      that perhaps 60% of chronic wounds have been found to harbor biofilm, it is challenging to&#xD;
      keep such wounds free of biofilm so that the wound-healing process can be sustained.&#xD;
      Consequently, any method that could potentially remove more biofilm and/or prevent its&#xD;
      recurrence could improve the wound healing trajectory. Medaxis Debritom+™ cleans acute and&#xD;
      chronic wounds precisely in a tissue-preserving manner. Its high-pressure micro water jet&#xD;
      removes slough such as fibrin, necrosis or biofilm, as well as foreign bodies, in effect&#xD;
      providing an efficient irrigation and debridement of contaminated wounds. The purpose of this&#xD;
      clinical investigation is to assess performance of Medaxis Debritom+™ and to collect subject&#xD;
      outcome data in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) vs Standard sharp debridement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two arms in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: The Experimental Arm , that will include SOC Therapy. SOC therapy in this study is&#xD;
      offloading of the DFU (CAM boots or total contact casting [TCC] if the subject's foot is too&#xD;
      large for a CAM), use of the Medaxis Debritom+™ micro jet to clean the wound followed by a&#xD;
      wound care covering ( Fibracol dressing or equivalent) along with a moisture retention&#xD;
      dressing and a padded 3-layer dressing comprised of 4x4 gauze pads, soft roll and compression&#xD;
      wrap (DynaflexTM or equivalent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: The Standard of Care Arm. The SOC therapy in this study is offloading of the DFU (CAM&#xD;
      boots or total contact casting [TCC] if the subject's foot is too large for a CAM),&#xD;
      appropriate sharp or surgical debridement, followed by a wound care covering ( Fibracol&#xD;
      dressing or equivalent) along with a moisture retention dressing and a padded 3-layer&#xD;
      dressing comprised of 4x4 gauze pads, soft roll and compression wrap (DynaflexTM or&#xD;
      equivalent).&#xD;

             4 weeks prior to SV1 and less than 1 year, as of the date the subject consents for&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The index ulcer is a minimum of 1.0 cm2 and a maximum of 25 cm2 at SV1 and TV1.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
