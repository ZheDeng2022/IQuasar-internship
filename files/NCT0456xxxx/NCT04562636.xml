      Purpose: To evaluate reactions to and opinions of a messaging campaign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Participants will be recruited through Prime Panels and will be US-based adults&#xD;
      (18 years old and older) who consumed red meat in the past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): After completing a screening question about meat consumption,&#xD;
      participants will review a consent form. If they select to participate in the study,&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to view control messages, red meat-related environment&#xD;
      messages, or red meat-related health messages. They will be asked a series of questions about&#xD;
      these messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be asked about grocery shopping preferences and standard demographics&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excess consumption of red and processed meat is a growing problem, especially in the United&#xD;
      States where meat is consumed more than three times the global average. Epidemiological&#xD;
      evidence for the association between excess meat intake and negative health outcomes (such as&#xD;
      cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes) as well as negative environmental&#xD;
      impacts (such as pollution, overuse of resources, and carbon emissions) indicates that&#xD;
      reducing meat consumption should be particularly pertinent to researchers and other public&#xD;
      health professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential of using widespread communication campaigns, such as Meatless Monday, to reduce&#xD;
      meat consumption by educating individuals on the associated health and environmental risks&#xD;
      appears to be promising. However, the current literature is missing information regarding&#xD;
      what types of messages are most effective (e.g. negative environmental messages vs. negative&#xD;
      health messages). To address this knowledge gap, our study will collect quantitative data in&#xD;
      measurable outcomes to understand effectiveness and comprehension of environmental messages&#xD;
      and health messages to reduce meat consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: This is an online study using Qualtrics, so this research does not involve talking&#xD;
      to human participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Participants will be recruited through Prime Panels, a survey research firm&#xD;
      through which participants voluntarily sign up to participate in research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent: Participants will read a written consent document that includes information&#xD;
      about the study's purpose, expectations, and possible risks and benefits. Participants will&#xD;
      acknowledge that they have read and agreed to the terms by clicking forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) control&#xD;
      (about checking their credit score), 2) environment-focused Meatless Monday messages, or 3)&#xD;
      health-focused Meatless Monday messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment: Using an online platform (Qualtrics), participants will answer a screening&#xD;
      question about red meat consumption. If they are eligible (consumption of red meat 1 time per&#xD;
      week or more), they will proceed to the main study after reading and agreeing to the written&#xD;
      consent form. Participants will then answer two questions about their belief in climate&#xD;
      change. Participants will then view four messages in their ascribed conditions. After viewing&#xD;
      all 4 messages, participants will answer a series of questions about the messages they&#xD;
      viewed. Then, participants will answer a series of demographic questions. Participants will&#xD;
      also answer questions about grocery shopping preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed description of the trial arms: This study is a three-armed between subjects' design.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to view a set of four messages either about the environmental&#xD;
      harms of meat production (intervention), the health harms of meat consumption (intervention),&#xD;
      or about checking their credit score (control). The environmental and health harms messages&#xD;
      were obtained from existing publicly available messages from the Meatless Monday campaign.&#xD;

    <description>Perceived effectiveness of the messages will be measured during the message using 4 items adapted from Baig et al. (2018): concern, unpleasantness, and discouragement. The averaged responses on the 4 items will be used to create a PME score. All 4 items are measured using a a 1 to 5 likert scale, with higher scores representing a higher amount of the construct.&#xD;
Questions: How much do these messages...&#xD;
make you concerned about the health effects of eating red meat?&#xD;
make you concerned about the environmental effects of eating red meat?&#xD;
discourage you from wanting to eat red meat?&#xD;
make eating red meat seem unpleasant to you?&#xD;
