    <textblock>
      This study is a pragmatic, randomised, controlled, before-after interventional study&#xD;
      conducted in one region in France in primary care. The GPs in the intervention group will&#xD;
      receive a public commitment charter, a non prescription pad and a patient information leaflet&#xD;
      to be used when antibiotics are prescribed, while the control group will be not aware of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial resistance is a major public health threat and the overuse of antibiotics&#xD;
      contributes to its development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, outpatient antibiotic use remains above the European average. Ninety percent of&#xD;
      antibiotics are prescribed to outpatients and 70% of these are prescribed by general&#xD;
      practitioners.&#xD;
