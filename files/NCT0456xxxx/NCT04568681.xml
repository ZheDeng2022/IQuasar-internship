  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an effective therapy for patients with medically refractory&#xD;
      primary dystonia. However, DBS programming for dystonia is not standardized and multiple&#xD;
      clinic visits are frequently required to adequately control symptoms. We aim to&#xD;
      longitudinally record brain signals from patients using a novel neurostimulator that can&#xD;
      record brain signals. We will correlate brain signals to clinical severity scores to identify&#xD;
      pathological rhythms in the absence of DBS, and we will study the effects of DBS on these&#xD;
      signals in order to guide clinical programming. We are going to recruit patients who receive&#xD;
      the Medtronic Percept device, which allows for brain signal recordings (this feature is FDA&#xD;
      approved). The investigators will be conducting an observational study using this device to&#xD;
      collect data that the subjects receive as standard of care.&#xD;

      The development of newer technologies has allowed clinicians and researchers to better&#xD;
      understand pathophysiological underpinnings of different disorders managed with&#xD;
      neuromodulation. There is a paucity of information, however, on dystonia, likely due to its&#xD;
      rarity of cases and variability in phenomenology to allow generalization of findings.&#xD;
      Possible abnormal brain signals, such as high activity in theta band (defined as rhythms in&#xD;
      the 4-12Hz range ), have been proposed by small case series. The development of newer&#xD;
