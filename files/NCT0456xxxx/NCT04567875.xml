  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study on a cohort of patients with castration-resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer M0, treated with Apalutamide, at the Oncology Unit of the &quot;Andrea Tortora&quot;&#xD;
      Hospital of Pagani. Data will be collected on the patient's clinical history and the&#xD;
      treatments carried out until the start of therapy with Apalutamide. At that time the study&#xD;
      will be described to the patient and informed consent will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of a favorable opinion from the patient, the CRF will be filled in. Patients with&#xD;
      CRPC M0 treated with Apalutamide, belonging to the Oncology Unit of the Pagani Hospital&#xD;
      &quot;Andrea Tortora&quot; and of the other Oncology Units of the ASL of Salerno (Hospital of Vallo&#xD;
      della Lucania) will be studied with the possibility of enrollment also from other Centers&#xD;
      outside the Salerno ASL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CRPC M0 patient will be identified by PET PSMA, or CT scan and Bone Scanning at the&#xD;
      clinician's discretion based on the physical examination performed at the patient's first&#xD;
      access. The reassessment of the disease status is to be repeated by PET-PSMA, CT scan or bone&#xD;
      scan (in relation to the examination carried out at baseline) in a period of time ranging&#xD;
      from 6 to 12 months after the first access, based on the assessment of the health status of&#xD;
      the patient and tolerability to treatment after careful evaluation by the clinician. The&#xD;
      blood chemistry routine including CBC with white blood cell formula will be repeated every 30&#xD;
      days. The patient will be provided with a blood pressure monitoring diary every 30 days. The&#xD;
      measurement of cardiac markers will be performed every 60 days. The evaluation of the&#xD;
      cardiological function will be carried out by means of ECG, echocardiography with&#xD;
      determination of the LVEF, 24-hour Holter blood pressure every 6 months. Bone mineral density&#xD;
      assessment will be monitored by MOC-DEXA every 6 months. Possible drug interactions with&#xD;
      Apalutamide will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Evaluation of arterial hypertension, by periodic measurement of blood pressure every week&#xD;
      (1-3 times), creation of a weekly blood pressure diary, 24-hour blood pressure holter every&#xD;
      six months, with stratification of patients under treatment according to the degree of AI&#xD;
      found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of cardiological toxicity, through the execution of ECG, periodic&#xD;
           echocardiography for the evaluation of the ejection fraction of the left ventricle,&#xD;
           cardiac markers (troponin, CK-MB, pro-BNP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of the biochemical response, such as a 50% reduction in total PSA compared to&#xD;
           baseline in patients receiving apalutamide;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the change in blood chemistry parameters in the patient being treated with&#xD;
           Apalutamide;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relationship between changes in blood chemistry parameters and time to the onset of&#xD;
           metastases, assessed by PET PSMA or bone scan or CT scan;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relationship between changes in blood chemistry parameters and overall survival;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relationship between changes in blood chemistry parameters and occurrence of serious&#xD;
           adverse events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Association between basophil counts and appearance of skin rash;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of drug interactions with Apalutamide.&#xD;
