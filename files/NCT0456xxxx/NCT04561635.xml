  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Child undernutrition is largely attributed to inadequate nutrition including micronutrient&#xD;
      deficiency. Undernutrition is prevalent among indigenous children as compared to the general&#xD;
      population. This cluster randomized controlled trial aimed to determine the effect of&#xD;
      multiple-micronutrients supplement (MMS) on growth and iron status of Orang Asli (indigenous&#xD;
      group in Peninsular Malaysia) young children (6 to 24 months) in Selangor. MMS is a blend of&#xD;
      15 micronutrients in powder form that can be used for home fortification of foods for young&#xD;
      children. A total of 98 children recruited in this study with 49 children randomly assigned&#xD;
      for each intervention (IG) and control group (CG). At baseline, all children were normal in&#xD;
      weight-for-age (WAZ&gt;-2SD), length-for-age (LAZ&gt;-2SD), weight-for-length (WLZ&gt;-2SD) and blood&#xD;
      haemoglobin (&gt;11g/dL). IG was supplemented with three sachets of MMS each week i.e. every&#xD;
      other day for 12 months and received health and nutrition advice. CG only received health and&#xD;
      nutrition advice. Both groups were assessed for body weight, length and dietary intake at&#xD;
      baseline, month 3, 6, 9, 12 of intervention, and 3 months post intervention. Blood&#xD;
      haemoglobin was assessed at baseline, month-12 of intervention and 3 months post&#xD;
      intervention. Compliance to MMS was measured in IG. The primary outcomes were weight, length,&#xD;
      WAZ, LAZ, WLZ and haemoglobin, while the secondary outcome was dietary intake. The&#xD;
      independence sample t-test and the chi-square test were used to determine the difference in&#xD;
      the baseline variables between the groups. ANOVA using General Linear Model (GLM) for&#xD;
      repeated measures was performed to determine the difference in the growth measures z scores,&#xD;
      haemoglobin, energy, nutrients and food group within and between the groups over the period&#xD;
      of the study. Per protocol analysis was performed. This study hypothesized that there were&#xD;
      significant differences in the changes (before and after MMS intervention) related to growth&#xD;
      [(weight-for-age (WAZ), length-for-age (LAZ) and weight-for-length (WLZ)]; iron status&#xD;
      (haemoglobin concentration); and dietary intake (energy, nutrients and food group intakes)&#xD;
      between intervention and control groups.&#xD;

      1. Study Objectives This study was undertaken to determine the effect of Multiple&#xD;
           micronutrients supplement (MMS) on the nutritional status of Orang Asli (indigenous&#xD;
           people in Peninsular Malaysia) children (6 to 24 months) in Selangor. This study&#xD;
           assessed growth (weight, length, WAZ, LAZ, WLZ) and iron status (haemoglobin&#xD;
           concentration) of children as primary outcomes, while the secondary outcome included&#xD;
           dietary intake (energy, nutrients and food groups) of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Location This study was conducted in Orang Asli (OA) communities in Selangor,&#xD;
           Peninsular Malaysia. The specific communities were identified with the assistance of&#xD;
           Department of Orang Asli Development Selangor (JAKOA). The majority of residents are&#xD;
           Temuan (78%), followed by Mah Meri (15%), Semai (2%) and mixed (5%). This study included&#xD;
           only the Temuan tribe as study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Design This was a cluster randomized controlled trial. Villages as clusters were&#xD;
           randomly allocated into either intervention or control group. All households in each&#xD;
           cluster were included in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sample Size A formula for mean difference between two groups was used for sample size&#xD;
           calculation. The sample size was calculated to have 80% chance of detecting a mean&#xD;
           difference in length of 0.56 cm or more with an estimated standard deviation of 0.31. An&#xD;
           additional 50% was applied to the calculation of sample size to account for withdrawal&#xD;
           and non-compliance. Hence, the total number of respondents per group was 49.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sampling Procedure There were 74 OA clusters (villages) in Selangor. Screening of&#xD;
           clusters were conducted according to inclusion and exclusion criteria of clusters. Upon&#xD;
           screening, 17 non-Temuan clusters and 6 Temuan clusters were excluded from this study.&#xD;
           Temuan cluster is defined as having at least 80% of the households in the village are of&#xD;
           Temuan ethnicity. The remaining 51 Temuan clusters were then randomly assigned either to&#xD;
           the intervention or control group by considering the distance and geographical locality&#xD;
           of the clusters. A total of 22 clusters were randomly allocated to the intervention&#xD;
           group, while 29 clusters randomly allocated to the control group. There were 7 small&#xD;
           clusters in the control group which grouped into 2 clusters as the small clusters have a&#xD;
           small number of young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening assessment of children then were conducted in clusters (that obtained consent&#xD;
           from head of villages) based on the lists of children aged between 6 to 24 months given&#xD;
           by the head of villages. All listed children were screened according to inclusion and&#xD;
           exclusion criteria of children. Upon screening, 68 children in four clusters of&#xD;
           intervention group, and 102 children in seven clusters of control group were excluded as&#xD;
           not meeting the inclusion criteria of children. Based on the screening assessment, the&#xD;
           total number of children recruited initially was 98 children, with 49 children in each&#xD;
           of the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Selection of Clusters (Villages) and Children Approval by JAKOA was obtained prior to&#xD;
           the selection of clusters (villages). OA villages were visited by investigator and a&#xD;
           research assistant to conduct the selection of clusters based on inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
           criteria. Head of villages were interviewed to obtain information on majority of&#xD;
           households' ethnicity and availability of child/children aged between 6 to 24 months.&#xD;
           For Temuan cluster that has at least one child aged between 6 to 24 months old, the head&#xD;
           of villages were given an invitation letter, letter of study approval by JAKOA and&#xD;
           information of the study. The head of villages were briefed about the purpose, benefits&#xD;
           and potential risks of the study to the children. They were given the opportunity to ask&#xD;
           for further details if they were not clear about the given explanation. Consent from the&#xD;
           head of villages were obtained after the briefing. List of households with children aged&#xD;
           between 6 to 24 months was then given to the investigator by the head of villages for&#xD;
           the selection of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Treatments The intervention group was supplemented with three sachets of MMS in powder&#xD;
           form each week for every other day for a period of 12 months. Each sachet containing 1 g&#xD;
           consisting of ten vitamins and five minerals. The amount of each micronutrient provided&#xD;
           by MMS was mostly â‰¥ 42% of the Malaysian Recommended Nutrient Intake, (RNI). This was&#xD;
           adequate to meet the daily nutrient requirement of children in addition to nutrients&#xD;
           provided by daily complementary foods. The MMS was manufactured by DSM Singapore&#xD;
           Industrial Pte. Ltd. It was in powder form and to be sprinkled over a cooked meal or&#xD;
           dissolved in a drink for the child. The intervention group was visited weekly in first 2&#xD;
           months and two-weekly in the following months to distribute and monitor the&#xD;
           supplementation of MMS. Written instruction for using and storing the MMS in simple&#xD;
           language with visuals was given prior to the supplementation. The intervention group&#xD;
           also received health and nutrition advice delivered by investigator at 3, 6 and 9 months&#xD;
           after supplementation begins. The control group received health and nutrition advice&#xD;
           that were similar to intervention group and delivered at 3, 6 and 9 months after the&#xD;
           study began.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Measurements 8.1 Demographic and Socioeconomic Information Demographic and socioeconomic&#xD;
           information were obtained through face-to-face interview with parents/ caregivers using&#xD;
           a pre-tested questionnaire and assistance from a local translator. Age of children was&#xD;
           calculated from childbirth date that obtained from birth certificate or child health&#xD;
           record. Data were collected prior to the intervention as baseline data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.2 Anthropometry Birth weight and length of children were obtained from child health&#xD;
           record. Body weight and length of children were measured at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15&#xD;
           months after supplementation begins. Weight and length of children were measured using&#xD;
           Tanita Digital Weighing Scale HD 325 (to the nearest 0.1 kg) and Recumbent Measuring&#xD;
           Board (to the nearest 0.1cm), respectively using standard procedures. All measurements&#xD;
           were taken twice, and the average value were used as final data. Age, weight and length&#xD;
           of the children were translated into three indices of weight-for-age, length-for-age and&#xD;
           weight-for-length. WHO Anthro program version 3.2.2 was used to estimate the Z scores&#xD;
           for weight-for-age (WAZ), length-for-age (LAZ) and weight-for-length (WLZ). Z score was&#xD;
           used to distinguish between normal and underweight (WAZ &lt;-2), stunted (LAZ &lt;-2) and&#xD;
           wasted (WLZ &lt;-2) children according to WHO classifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.3 Haemoglobin Haemoglobin level was assessed using finger-prick blood method. A staff&#xD;
           nurse conducted the assessment using a portable HemoCueÂ®201+ Analyzer. Haemoglobin&#xD;
           assessment was performed at baseline, 12 and 15 months of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.4 Dietary Intake Dietary intake was assessed using a standard 24-hour diet recall&#xD;
           questionnaire at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months. This assessment involved&#xD;
           face-to-face interview with parents/ caregivers to obtain information on time, types and&#xD;
           amount of foods and beverages consumed by children during the 24 hours prior to the&#xD;
           interview. Household measurements (e.g. cups, teaspoons, plates, bowls) were used to&#xD;
           assist parents/ caregivers in estimation of portion sizes of consumed foods and&#xD;
           beverages. Dietary intake data was analysed using a computerized dietary analysis&#xD;
           program, Nutritionist Pro. The USDA Food Database was used in this software for dietary&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.5 Child Vaccination, Infection and Household Sanitation and Hygiene History of child&#xD;
           vaccination, infection and household sanitation and hygiene were assessed using a&#xD;
           standard questionnaire at 12 months of study (end of the intervention). History of child&#xD;
           vaccination was obtained from child health record. Assessments of child infection&#xD;
           history involved face-to-face interview with parents/ caregivers to obtain information&#xD;
           on common infections in children in the preceding two weeks. Interview with parents/&#xD;
           caregivers were conducted as well to obtain information on household sanitation and&#xD;
           hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.6 Compliance to MMS Every week, parents/ caregivers in intervention group were given a&#xD;
           pack which contains 3 sachets of MMS to be taken by their children in a week. After a&#xD;
           week, the parents/ caregivers were required to return the empty sachets (including&#xD;
           unused or half used) to the investigator. Compliance to MMS was measured by dividing the&#xD;
           total number of empty sachets with a total number of distributed sachets for the 3, 6, 9&#xD;
           and 12-months periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.7 Adverse effect of MMS Any adverse effect was assessed during a weekly visit. The&#xD;
           information was obtained through a weekly face-to-face interview with the parents/&#xD;
           caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Study Withdrawal Children who withdrew the study were visited several times and attempts&#xD;
           were made to persuade the parents/ caregivers to continue with the study. Withdrawals&#xD;
           were recorded in Case Report Form to determine percentage of the participants who&#xD;
           withdrew for reasons related to the intervention or those who missed at random.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Ethics Approval and Funding The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for&#xD;
           Research Involving Human Subjects (JKEUPM) of Universiti Putra Malaysia. Permission to&#xD;
           conduct the study in Orang Asli communities was obtained from the Department of Orang&#xD;
           Asli Development (JAKOA). Written informed consent was obtained from parents /caregivers&#xD;
           who agree to participate in the study. This study was funded by a research grant from&#xD;
           Universiti Putra Malaysia (GP-IPS/2016/9514200).&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Data Analysis Data were analyzed using 'Statistical Package for Social Sciences'&#xD;
           programme for Windows version 22.0. Categorical data were described using count and&#xD;
           percentage. All numerical data were tested for normality of distribution and were&#xD;
           presented as mean and standard deviation. Non-parametric tests were used whenever the&#xD;
           assumptions of normality and/ or homogeneity of variances were not met. Logarithmic&#xD;
           conversion was performed for data not normally distributed. Per protocol analysis was&#xD;
           performed, and children who withdrew from the study, noncompliant, and has missing&#xD;
           outcomes were excluded from analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The independence sample t-test was used to determine the difference in the mean of continuous&#xD;
      variables between the intervention and control groups, while for categorical variables the&#xD;
      Pearson's chi-square test was used. Paired t-test was conducted to assess changes in outcomes&#xD;
      variables within each group (intervention and control) between baseline and 12 months as well&#xD;
      as 15 months follow-up. ANCOVA using General Linear Model for repeated measures was performed&#xD;
      to determine the effects of intervention between the groups on main and specific outcomes.&#xD;
      Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of both groups such as gender of children, age&#xD;
      of children at selected time points, education of mothers and baseline measures were&#xD;
      controlled in the analysis. Differences between groups were considered statistically&#xD;
      significant at p&lt;0.05 using two-tailed tests.&#xD;
