      Chidamide has been approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma in China (Chidamide,a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor). Tirelizumab,has been&#xD;
      approved for the failure treatment of platinum-containing chemotherapy with high PD-L1&#xD;
      expression included locally advanced or metastatic Urothelial carcinoma in&#xD;
      China(Tirelizumab,BGB-A317 is an investigational humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      ).The aim of this study was to observe the efficacy and safety of Chidamide with&#xD;
      Immunotherapy in patients with progression of platinum-based chemotherapy recurrent and&#xD;
      metastatic Urothelial carcinoma.&#xD;
