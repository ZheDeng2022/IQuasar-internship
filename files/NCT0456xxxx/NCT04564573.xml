  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with bipolar disorder (BD) have a wide range of neurocognitive dysfunction, which&#xD;
      lead to impaired psychosocial function and reduced quality of life. Therefore, improving&#xD;
      neurocognitive function has become an important goal of BD treatment. Aiming at this, some&#xD;
      clinical studies have been performed but failed to illustrate significant positive efficacies&#xD;
      of pharmacological therapy or non-pharmacological therapy, which could attribute in part to&#xD;
      insufficient understanding on the risk factors that affect the neurocognitive function of BD&#xD;
      patients. Delayed diagnosis of BD is so common that a lot of patients receive long-term&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment before of diagnosis of unipolar depression. There is controversy&#xD;
      about whether antidepressant treatment in early stage would affect the neurocognitive&#xD;
      function of BD patients. In view of the high prevalence of delayed diagnosis and the use of&#xD;
      antidepressants, it is of great scientific significance and clinical value to clarify this&#xD;
      matter and other factors that may potentially affect the neurocognitive function of BD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Ten milliliters of venous blood are adopted from each participant into a free-anticoagulant&#xD;
      vacuum tube. The blood will be immediately centrifuged at 4,000 g for 10 min, and serum is&#xD;
      kept frozen at -80 ºC until analysis. NSE levels are measured with electrochemiluminescence&#xD;
      assay, using a commercial kit conforming to the manufacturer instructions and data will be&#xD;
      shown in ng/ml.&#xD;
