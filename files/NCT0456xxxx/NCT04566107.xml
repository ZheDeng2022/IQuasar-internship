  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and impact of delivering&#xD;
      mobile health self-management interventions to improve adherence to the prescribed treatment&#xD;
      in a multimorbid population returning home after hospital discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this three-group repeated-measures randomized controlled trial is to evaluate&#xD;
      the use of mobile health (mHealth) self-management technology as a model of care for&#xD;
      individuals with multimorbidity. Specifically, this 8-week self-management intervention uses&#xD;
      tailored self-management strategies (action planning, goal setting, and individually&#xD;
      identified support needs) and mHealth technology for real-time virtual visits, daily&#xD;
      messages, and self-monitoring activities. The investigators are testing the additive impact&#xD;
      of having the nurse practitioner/community health worker (NP/CHW) team with the mHealth&#xD;
      platform (mHealth Plus). The NP evaluates physiological status by evaluating symptoms and&#xD;
      tailoring the intervention specific to the individual's multimorbidity while the CHW will&#xD;
      assist in recognizing possible solutions to challenging social determinants of health by&#xD;
      identifying community resources and guidance in overcoming barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following specific aims will be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate the feasibility of implementing comparative SM interventions (mHealth and&#xD;
      mHealth plus virtual visits with a nurse practitioner and community health worker team) in&#xD;
      multimorbid individuals by assessing: a) acceptability of each intervention; b) enrollment&#xD;
      (recruitment efficiency, attrition, problems and solutions); c) intervention fidelity&#xD;
      (delivery, receipt, enactment of the intervention [benefits and barriers]); and d) data&#xD;
      collection (technological transfer of data, instrument reliability, the time required,&#xD;
      missing data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine the impact of delivering the m-Health and m-Health plus interventions&#xD;
      compared to standard care (SC) in multimorbid individuals on: a) primary outcome: adherence&#xD;
      to disease-specific lifestyle behaviors (e.g. diet and medication, and self-monitoring of&#xD;
      physiological measures as needed (e.g. weight blood pressure, blood glucose, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation); b) secondary outcomes: health related quality of life; c) patient-reported&#xD;
      health status; d) symptom status; and e) healthcare utilization.&#xD;
