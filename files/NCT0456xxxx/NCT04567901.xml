    <textblock>
      The geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) is a simple and efficient tool to assess the&#xD;
      nutritional status of patients with malignancies or after surgery. Because trauma patients&#xD;
      constitute a specific population that generally acquires accidental and acute injury, this&#xD;
      study aimed to identify the association between the GNRI at admission and mortality outcomes&#xD;
      of older trauma patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The nutritional risk index (NRI) is a screening method that was primarily developed to&#xD;
      identify older patients with malnutrition. It consists of serum albumin levels as well as&#xD;
      body weight measurements. However, even under professional care, the usual body weight is&#xD;
      often not documented for older patients. To determine the usual body weight of older&#xD;
      patients, the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) was introduced in 2005 by Bouillanne et&#xD;
      al - the formula included a combination of serum albumin levels and the ratio of body weight&#xD;
      to ideal body weight. The GNRI formula replaces the usual body weight in the NRI formula with&#xD;
      the ideal body weight, calculated using the Lorentz formula. Although the GNRI was developed&#xD;
      using the data of patients who were admitted to a geriatric rehabilitation care unit, it was&#xD;
      found to be a strong prognostic factor for certain malignancies and a simple, objective, and&#xD;
      quick method to determine the nutritional status of patients and long-term postoperative&#xD;
      outcomes and the correlation between these elements. Using this simple calculation, it is&#xD;
      possible to evaluate the nutritional status of critically ill patients with acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome in the intensive care unit (ICU). Considering that trauma patients&#xD;
      constitute a specific population, as injuries generally occur accidentally and acutely, it is&#xD;
      important to determine whether the GNRI can be used to link nutritional status and outcomes&#xD;
      in trauma patients. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the association between GNRI at&#xD;
      admission and mortality outcomes of older trauma patients in the ICU.&#xD;

        The medical records of 39,135 enrolled trauma patients registered between January 1, 2009&#xD;
        and December 31, 2019 were reviewed for this study (Figure 1). The enrolled patients&#xD;
        experienced trauma from different injuries and were hospitalized for treatment. Of the&#xD;
        7,136 patients who were admitted to the ICU, 1,926 older trauma patients were aged â‰¥ 65&#xD;
        years. After excluding patients whose albumin data were not available and those with&#xD;
        incomplete data (n = 1,226), 700 older trauma patients were finally included in the study.&#xD;
        Detailed information of the study population was extracted from the Trauma Registry System&#xD;
        of the hospital.&#xD;
