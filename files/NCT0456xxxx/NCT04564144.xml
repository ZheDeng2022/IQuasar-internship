  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to develop a new oro-dissolvable/dispersible tablet that will&#xD;
      augment the dual rapid absorption of MCZ from the buccal cavity as well as prolonging that&#xD;
      from the GIT. A dual function tablet is expected to encompass an outer coat of the drug with&#xD;
      special excipients that will rapidly disperse and the drug get dissolve and absorb in the&#xD;
      buccal cavity and an inner core that will similarly, disperse to release MCZ coated&#xD;
      nanoparticles in the saliva. The latter will be subsequently swallowed without water to be&#xD;
      absorbed in a prolonged manner from the GIT. This will be advantageous for geriatric as well&#xD;
      as pediatric patients, besides, those suffering from dysphagia. The pharmacokinetics profile&#xD;
      of the prepared dual function tablet will be assessed in human volunteers through&#xD;
      noncompartmental analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The oral route is the most advantageous one for delivering drugs due to patient compliance&#xD;
      and its convenient administration. Fast disintegrating drug delivery systems are those that&#xD;
      disintegrate immediately in the buccal cavity liberating the drug which dissolves or&#xD;
      disperses in the saliva without need of water. The European Pharmacopeia adopted&#xD;
      oro-dispersible tablets (ODT) for a tablet that disintegrate or disperse in less than 60 sec&#xD;
      in the buccal cavity before swallowing. So, the drug dissolution and absorption in addition&#xD;
      to onset of clinical influence and drug bioavailability may be considerably better than those&#xD;
      detected from conventional tablets and capsules. ODTs were initially industrialized to&#xD;
      increase the patient compliance (children, geriatric and bedridden patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nanoparticulate delivery systems have been investigated widely in the pharmaceutical industry&#xD;
      owing to protection from degradation in GIT, the ability to control release of drugs and&#xD;
      improvement of bioavailability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meclizine HCL, an antihistamine, has been widely used for prophylactic treatment of nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting and management of dizziness accompanying motion sickness. MCZ is commonly used due&#xD;
      to fewer adverse effects than other antihistaminic drugs but its onset of action is about 1 h&#xD;
      and possesses short half-life. MCZ is a poor water soluble drug and associated with slow rate&#xD;
      of absorption from oral route, therefore, there is a need to improve its dissolution and so&#xD;
      ensure the maximum therapeutic utility. However, many different formulations of MCZ have been&#xD;
      investigated to improve its overall solubility in order to enhance its bioavailability, such&#xD;
      as; complexation with cyclodextrin, preparation of solid dispersions as oro- dispersible&#xD;
      tablets and fast dissolving tablet by sublimation method. Moreover, authors will investigate&#xD;
      the ability of floating microspheres to increase the half-life of MCZ&#xD;

    <description>A study will be conducted on the three tested orodispersible tablets and the commercial one (control). 6 volunteers are asked to cease any medication 7 days prior to blood sampling at least. Each volunteer will undergo 4 study sessions with one week of washout period in between (cross-overed to receive the other formulation). All volunteers are asked to fast overnight before taking the tablet. The tablet should be kept for 10 min in the mouth before swallowing without water. Just before taking the tablet, three milliliters of venous blood samples will be drown (predose, 0 h) and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 240, 360, 480, 720 min and 24 h postdose and stored in tubes coated with sodium heparin. Separation of plasma from Blood samples will be carried out by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 10 min, then, it will be frozen at -20°C until analysis. By employing high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the plasma concentration of MCZ will be assayed</description>
