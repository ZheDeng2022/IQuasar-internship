  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a neurovascular disease whose prevalence is estimated at almost 20% of the adult&#xD;
      population. Currently, there is no treatment for migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Millimeter stimulation of the wrist subcutaneous receptors allows the release of endorphin in&#xD;
      the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MISTIC is a prospective, controlled, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study in which the&#xD;
      research team are investigating whether millimeter stimulation of subcutaneous wrist&#xD;
      receptors reduces the frequency of migraine crisis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MISTIC is a multicenter, controlled, randomized, double-blind study. Eligible patients will&#xD;
      have to report their migraine crisis in a diary during a one month pre-selection phase. Then,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized into one of two treatment groups :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  active millimeter wave emission bracelet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  or placebo bracelet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have to use the medical device twice a day for 3 months. The investigators will&#xD;
      follow them for an additional 3 months to assess the persistence of the effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the follow-up, patients will report their migraines crisis in a journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the impact of wearing a millimeter wave bracelet for 3 months, on&#xD;
      the number of days with migraine headaches.&#xD;

    <description>Headache Impact Test (named HIT-6 questionnaire) Self-Rating Scale (3 levels : mild, moderate, severe).&#xD;
The HIT-6 questionnaire contains 6 questions (3 first questions assessing the impact of the crisis and 3 last questions assessing the impact of the crisis).&#xD;
The minimum score is 36 and the maximum score is 78. It can result in a categorical use to define four grades of increasing severity: score ≤ 49: low impact; score 50-50: definite impact; score 56-59: significant impact; score ≥ 60: impact major. The higher the score, the greater the impact of headaches on quality of life.</description>

EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health-related quality of lige that can be used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The EQ5D has 6 items intended to measure general health. The top 5 rate mobility, independence, daily activities, pain / discomfort, and anxiety / depression, and are rated according to 5 values : &quot;No problem&quot;, &quot;little problem&quot;, &quot;moderate problem&quot;, &quot;high problem&quot; and &quot;Incapacity&quot;. This results in an index score. The last item deals with perceived health on the day the questionnaire is filled in and uses a visual analogue scale from 0 (wors) to 100 (best health possible) (Visual Analog Scale Score)</description>
