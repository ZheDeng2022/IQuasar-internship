      Retrospective comparative study comparing group 1 (TSH level 0.1-1.99 mIU/L) and group 2 (TSH&#xD;
      level 2.0-4 mIU/L). Each group was further subdivided into primigravidae and multipara. 1527&#xD;
      pregnant women were included.&#xD;

      This was a retrospective comparative study spanning January 2014 to December 2018. It was&#xD;
      conducted at Jordan university hospital, a teaching referral hospital affiliated to the&#xD;
      University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan. Pregnant patients, both primigravida and multipara who&#xD;
      had a spontaneous singleton pregnancy with documented TSH level in the first 16 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation were included. The investigators excluded all patients who had known thyroid&#xD;
      dysfunction whether on treatment or not, molar pregnancies, multiple pregnancies, patients&#xD;
      with hyperemesis gravidarum, all patients with anti-thyroid antibodies (Anti-TPO), patients&#xD;
      with TSH ˃ 4.0 mIU/L or ˂ 0.1 mIU/L. This range was used as TSH ˂ 0.1 mIU/L indicated an&#xD;
      undiagnosed subclinical hyperthyroidism and TSH ˃4.0 indicated undiagnosed hypothyroidism. In&#xD;
      addition, there were wide variations in the TSH reference ranges. Participants' data were&#xD;
      collected retrospectively from antenatal clinic notes, admission notes, labor ward and&#xD;
      operative notes. Data included patients ID number, age, parity, body mass index (BMI) in&#xD;
      kg/m2, TSH values in the first 16 weeks of pregnancy. The participants were divided into 2&#xD;
      groups according to their TSH values. Group one with TSH values between 0.1-1.99 mIU/L. Group&#xD;
      2 had TSH values between 2-4 mIU/L. Each group was then subdivided into 2 subgroups;&#xD;
      primigravida and multipara. Group P1: Primigravida in group 1, Group P2: Primigravida in&#xD;
      group 2, Group M1: Multiparous in group 1, Group M2: Multiparous in group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators calculated the mean, median and range of TSH in each subgroup. The&#xD;
      feto-maternal outcome was then compared between the 2 groups. The investigators studied&#xD;
      miscarriage rate, ectopic pregnancy rate, maternal blood sugar values (Fasting blood sugar&#xD;
      (FBS), glucose tolerance test (GTT), HbA1c or a combination) between 26 and 34 weeks,&#xD;
      development of high blood pressure at delivery, duration of pregnancy (gestational age at&#xD;
      delivery), preterm delivery rate, abruption placenta, mode of delivery, birth weight and&#xD;
      APGAR score at 1 and 5 minutes. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was diagnosed as an FBS&#xD;
      92-125 mg/dL or 1-hour plasma glucose levels of 180 or more following 75-gram oral glucose&#xD;
      load or 2-hour plasma glucose 153-199 mg/dL. The study obtained the approval of the&#xD;
      institutional review board (IRB) at Jordan University Hospital (JUH) number 179/2019 dated&#xD;
      17/4/2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis was performed with the Data Toolkit in Excel (Microsoft, Redmond,&#xD;
      WA, USA) using descriptive analysis. Relative risk and 95% confidence intervals were also&#xD;
      calculated to compare variables. P values were considered significant at ˂0.05. The obtained&#xD;
      data were examined using a frequency table and are presented as frequency, percentage and&#xD;
      mean&#xD;
