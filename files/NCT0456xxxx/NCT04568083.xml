  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study based on secondary data extracted from multiple register-based&#xD;
      data sources in the US and Europe (Sweden, United Kingdom, Italy, Germany). The study will&#xD;
      include patients initiating treatment with ticagrelor 60 mg after a myocardial infarction in&#xD;
      real-world clinical practice, and describe their patient characteristics and duration of&#xD;
      treatment. If the a priori threshold of 5,000 person-years on treatment with ticagrelor 60 mg&#xD;
      is met, outcome events (bleeding and cardiovascular events) will also be analysed and&#xD;
      described.&#xD;

      This observational cohort study will include patients initiating treatment with ticagrelor 60&#xD;
      mg after a myocardial infarction (MI), and describe their patient characteristics and&#xD;
      persistence to treatment. To contextualise the characteristics of the ticagrelor patients,&#xD;
      two reference cohorts will be created, including patients treated with another P2Y12&#xD;
      inhibitor than ticagrelor (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticlopidine), and patients not treated&#xD;
      with any P2Y12 inhibitor, within a comparable timepoint from an MI as for the ticagrelor 60&#xD;
      mg patients. If the a priori threshold of 5,000 person-years on treatment with ticagrelor 60&#xD;
      mg is met, to ensure sufficient precision, outcome events (bleeding and cardiovascular&#xD;
      events) will also be analysed and described. Outcome events will only be described in the&#xD;
      ticagrelor cohorts; no comparison of outcomes will be made between the ticagrelor and the&#xD;
      reference cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is bleeding requiring hospitalisation. The secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      components of the primary outcome, and cardiovascular outcomes. Persistence to treatment with&#xD;
      ticagrelor 60 mg will also be assessed The study will be performed in the US and 4 European&#xD;
      countries (Sweden, United Kingdom, Italy, Germany).&#xD;
