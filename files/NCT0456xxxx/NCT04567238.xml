  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 20 million Americans report use of cannabis in the past month, and heavy cannabis use&#xD;
      has increased by nearly 60% in the U.S. since 2007. Heavy cannabis use is associated with&#xD;
      lower educational attainment, reduced physical activity, increased rates of addiction and&#xD;
      unemployment, and neuropsychological deficits. Studies suggest that cannabis use is also&#xD;
      associated with increased mental health symptoms, drugged driving, and traffic accidents.&#xD;
      While there is evidence that sustained abstinence can lead to improvements in the functional&#xD;
      outcomes of former users, the degree to which reductions alone (i.e., not sustained&#xD;
      abstinence) in cannabis use might be associated with positive changes in functional outcomes&#xD;
      is unknown. This is a critical gap in the literature, as many interventions for cannabis and&#xD;
      other drugs are associated with decreases in frequency and quantity of use, but fail to&#xD;
      achieve an effect on overall abstinence rates. The objective of the present research is to&#xD;
      use ecological momentary assessment (EMA), a real-time, naturalistic data collection method,&#xD;
      to prospectively study the impact of reduced cannabis use on functional outcomes in heavy&#xD;
      cannabis users. Contingency management (CM) will be used to promote reductions in frequency&#xD;
      and quantity of cannabis use. CM is an intensive behavioral therapy that is highly effective&#xD;
      at producing short-term reductions in illicit drug use. We have recently developed a novel&#xD;
      approach that leverages mobile technology and recent developments in cannabis testing. We&#xD;
      have pilot-tested this approach with heavy cannabis users and found that it is an acceptable&#xD;
      and feasible method. The present research will use this technology in conjunction with EMA&#xD;
      methods to study the impact of reduced cannabis use on key functional outcomes. Our central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that reductions in frequency and quantity of cannabis use will lead to positive&#xD;
      changes in cannabis users' mental health, self-efficacy, physical activity, working memory,&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, and driving behavior. The rationale for this research is that&#xD;
      it will provide the first and only real-time data concerning the potential impact of&#xD;
      reductions in cannabis use on functional outcomes. As such, the findings from the present&#xD;
      research will directly inform ongoing efforts to include reductions in illicit drug use as a&#xD;
      valid, clinically-meaningful outcome measure in clinical trials of pharmacotherapies for the&#xD;
      treatment of substance use disorders.&#xD;
