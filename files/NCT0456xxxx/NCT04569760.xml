  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a daily oral cannabinoid oil preparation&#xD;
      in treating symptoms of DSM-5 anxiety disorders, using a two-arm, 8-week randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial in adults aged 21-65 years. The study will also evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship between inflammation, anxiety and cannabinoids using biological markers as well&#xD;
      as examine the neuro-cognitive effects of cannabinoid treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel design comparing&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of a flexibly dosed cannabinoid oil preparation versus matching&#xD;
      placebo for the treatment of adults, aged 21 to 65 years with a primary Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual 5 (DSM-5) anxiety disorder: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Social&#xD;
      Anxiety Disorder (SAD), Panic Disorder (PD), or agoraphobia. A total 50 participants&#xD;
      (n=25/cell) who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to receive 1 of 2 treatments&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio: cannabinoid oil preparation or matching placebo, with the possibility of dose&#xD;
      titration during this 8-week period. The outcomes of this research will make a significant&#xD;
      contribution to enhance our current understanding of the effects of cannabis in anxiety&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be involved in this study, the study doctor will first check that the participant is&#xD;
      qualified. This is called screening, and will involve a clinical assessment, physical exam&#xD;
      and urine tests. This visit may take up to 3 hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant successfully completes screening the participant will start treatment in&#xD;
      one of the two assigned treatment groups. Treatment is 8 weeks. Participants will come to the&#xD;
      study clinic 6 times during the treatment phase of the study. Each visit will last 1 to 2&#xD;
      hours. Each visit will involve reporting any side effects that the participant may have&#xD;
      experienced, completing questionnaires about mood and anxiety symptoms, sleep, overall&#xD;
      functioning and alcohol and drug use. Participants will also be assessed by the study doctor.&#xD;
      The first and last visits will also involve blood work and completing a number of tasks on&#xD;
      the computer, which measure focus, attention and memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be involved in the study for a maximum of 10 weeks. This includes the&#xD;
      screening visit and follow-up visit.&#xD;

Each item ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (very severe) are summed up to give a total possible score of 0 (not present) to 56 (very severe), where lower scores indicates less anxiety.</description>
