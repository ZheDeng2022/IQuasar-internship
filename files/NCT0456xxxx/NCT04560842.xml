  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome that is caused by the host imbalance immune response. At&#xD;
      1991, the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus&#xD;
      Conference developed a definition of sepsis. After more than 20 years, it was gradually&#xD;
      developed in 2016 to the third edition of the guidelines for sepsis(Sepsis-3). Sepsis is&#xD;
      defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to&#xD;
      infection. According to the National Health Insurance claims database of Taiwan, The&#xD;
      incidence rate was 772.1/100,000 persons in 2012. From 2002 to 2012, the incidence of sepsis&#xD;
      increased by 18.7%. The mortality of severe sepsis was 17.9%. However, has increased to 33%&#xD;
      when developed to septic shock. Even in foreign studies, the intensive care unit mortality&#xD;
      rate can reach 40%. Although sepsis was defined in 1991, after these years, the treatment of&#xD;
      sepsis is still a goal that must be worked hard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Sepsis-3, must first use the qSOFA (quick Sepsis Related Organ Failure&#xD;
      Assessment) to assess whether the patient's blood pressure, respiratory rate, and state of&#xD;
      consciousness meet more than two criteria, which is sepsis. If the SOFA score (Sequential&#xD;
      Organ Failure Assessment) is further evaluated, with at least two of the following symptoms,&#xD;
      including poor oxygenation in the lungs, hypotension or use of a vasopressor,&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia, conscious change (Glasgow Coma Scale), bilirubin increase and creatinine&#xD;
      rise or oligouria. If the patient must use a vasopressor to maintain a mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      (MAP) of 65 mmHg and serum lactate more than 18 mg/dL, it is Septic shock. In clinical&#xD;
      assessment, qSOFA (rapid sepsis-associated organ failure assessment) can also be used to&#xD;
      assess blood pressure, respiratory rate, and state of consciousness to confirmed sepsis.&#xD;
      According to the above assessment conditions, patients with sepsis are highly prone to&#xD;
      respiratory failure during the disease process. In recent trials, about 40% to 85% of&#xD;
      patients with sepsis must be need endotracheal intubation, showing the high intubation rate.&#xD;
      Patients after intubation may cause lung injury due to improper ventilator settings&#xD;
      (Ventilator-induced lung injury, VILI). And 10% to 25% will be combined with pneumonia caused&#xD;
      by the ventilator (ventilator-associated pneumonia, VAP). Mortality can reach 20% to 33%. So&#xD;
      if we can reduce septic patient's intubation rate then we can reduce the complication caused&#xD;
      by the ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a relatively new device for respiratory support. Patients&#xD;
      received high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy through a nasal prong. A number of&#xD;
      physiological effects have been described with HFNC: pharyngeal dead space washout, a&#xD;
      positive expiratory pressure to reduce work of breathing, improve breathing synchronization.&#xD;
      These benefits can reduce the intubation rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit of the HFNC in septic patients is not very clear. By this prospective study to&#xD;
      investigate the septic patients who have been admitted to the intensive care unit. The study&#xD;
      method is to ask the patient whether they agree to participate in the trial after the patient&#xD;
      is transferred to the intensive care unit. The patient will randomly assign the subjects to&#xD;
      the general oxygen therapy and the HFNC group after signing the subject consent form. This&#xD;
      study aimed to determine whether high-flow oxygen therapy immediately would reduce the need&#xD;
      for intubation compared with standard oxygen therapy in sepsis patients.&#xD;
