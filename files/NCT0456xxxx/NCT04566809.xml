  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      16 persons affected by Cervical-SCI were recruited for the study and randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      Control Group (CG) or to the Experimental Group (EG). Persons of the CG (n = 8) executed 20&#xD;
      sessions of FES for the rehabilitation of hand functions (grasp or pinch), participants of&#xD;
      the EG (n = 8) performed 20 sessions of FES and CBA in addition. The primary assessment was a&#xD;
      modified version of Bimanual Activity Test (10 tasks); also, SCIM-II and measurement of&#xD;
      grasping strength only in participants submitted to grasp rehabilitation were evaluated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each participant followed twenty sessions of hand rehabilitation, three times per week. Each&#xD;
      treatment, for both CG and EG, lasted about forty minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FES devices chosen for this research stimulated &quot;grasp&quot; or &quot;pinch&quot; function: the NESS&#xD;
      H200 (NESS Ltd., Ra'anana, Israel) was used if patient needed to improve the grasp functions,&#xD;
      otherwise the Microstim (Microstim, Medel, Hamburg, Germany) was used to increase pinch&#xD;
      functions. In order to provide FES, the five electrodes of NESS H200 were first humidified&#xD;
      with warm water and then inserted in the right size place of the rigid splint worn by the&#xD;
      patient, while Microstim was used with four standard electrodes, two for each muscle treated.&#xD;
      In both case the stimulation was triggered by the therapist clicking a button (Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants of CG received only FES to improve their manipulating skills without the&#xD;
      interaction with objects, but only with the muscle contraction induced by the devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants of EG executed FES and CBA treatment which means that during the stimulation&#xD;
      they manipulated different tools. In particular, for the first ten sessions the participants&#xD;
      were invited to manipulate specific objects: squares, rectangles and pyramids of different&#xD;
      sizes; touch on plastic test tubes coated with materials of different consistency; these two&#xD;
      exercises were performed both with open and closed eyes. Finally, for the last ten sessions&#xD;
      the participants were asked to execute specific tasks, depending on person's life before the&#xD;
      lesion.&#xD;
