      A prospective, multi-center, non-randomized trial to demonstrate safety and device&#xD;
      performance of the ADVA-Tec Uriprene® Degradable Temporary Ureteral Stent. The study is&#xD;
      intended to assess the safety and efficacy of the Uriprene® Stent by assessing adequate&#xD;
      intervention-free drainage during use and the time to complete degradation or the passage of&#xD;
      stent fragments/segments from the urinary system by radiological assessment.&#xD;
