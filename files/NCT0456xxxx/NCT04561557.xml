  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a severe autoimmune disorder characterized&#xD;
      by recurrent attacks of optic neuritis and myelitis. A strong humoral response with&#xD;
      autoantibodies produced by plasma cells (effector B cells) against aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water&#xD;
      channels on astrocytes has been identified as the main characteristic of NMOSD physiology.&#xD;
      B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is expressed on the surface of plasma cells, thus making it&#xD;
      an ideal target for targeted therapies. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells against BCMA&#xD;
      offers another potential therapeutic option to eliminate plasma cells in patients with&#xD;
      AQP4-IgG-seropositive NMOSD who still suffer recurrent attacks from conventional treatments.&#xD;
      In the current study, the safety and efficacy of a novel CAR-T cell therapy using CT103A&#xD;
      cells, are evaluated in patients with relapsed/refractory NMOSD.&#xD;

    <description>EDSS and its associated functional system (FS) score provide a system for quantifying disability and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. EDSS is a scale for assessing neurologic impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS). It consists of 7 FS (visual FS, brainstem FS, pyramidal FS, cerebellar FS, sensory FS, bowel and bladder FS, and cerebral FS) which are used to derive EDSS score ranging from 0 (normal neurological exam) to 10 (death from MS). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement. A participant was considered to have a worsening in overall EDSS score of at least 2 if baseline EDSS score was 0, or at least 1 point if baseline EDSS score is 1 to 5, or at least 0.5 point if baseline EDSS score is 5.5 or more.</description>
