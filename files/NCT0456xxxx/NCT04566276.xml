    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in 2 phases. Phase 1 of this study will be a single-centre, open&#xD;
      label, dose escalation first in human (FIH) study conducted in 2 groups of healthy&#xD;
      participants. Group 1 will enrol adults aged 18-55 years (inclusive); Group 2 will enroll&#xD;
      elderly adults (elderly) aged 56-75 years (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 of this study will be a single centre, the proposed design will be observer-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      ChulaCov19 vaccine in healthy adults (18-75 years of age inclusive).&#xD;

      This study will be conducted as a combined phase 1/2 study in healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and reactogenicity of&#xD;
      escalating doses (10 µg, 25 µg, and 50 µg) of the ChulaCov19 vaccine, administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly (IM) according to a repeat vaccination schedule (given 21 days apart) in&#xD;
      healthy adults aged 18-55 years and in elderly adults aged 56-75 years, up to Visit 10 (Day&#xD;
      50 ±3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and reactogenicity of&#xD;
      escalating doses of the ChulaCov19 vaccine, administered intramuscularly (IM) according to a&#xD;
      repeat vaccination schedule (given 21 days apart) in healthy adults aged 18--75 years, up to&#xD;
      Visit 10 (Day 50 ±3). The study will also evaluate the immunogenicity measured as&#xD;
      neutralising antibody titre (measured by Micro-viral neutralising test [MicroVNT]) following&#xD;
      repeat vaccination of escalating doses of the ChulaCov19 vaccine, administered IM according&#xD;
      to a repeat vaccination schedule (given 21 days apart) in healthy adults aged 18-75 years, at&#xD;
      Visit 9 (Day 29 +3).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Phase 1: Group 1 (healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years) and Group 2 (elderlies aged 56 to 75 years) will be enrolled sequentially in an ascending dose fashion (10 µg, 25 µg, 50 µg). Up to 36 eligible healthy volunteers for each of the 2 age groups will be enrolled into 1 of 3 treatment cohorts (12 participants/ cohort). For each cohort, if only 1 participant withdraws prior to the second vaccination, no replacement is deemed necessary. For each cohort, if more than 1 participant withdraws prior to the second vaccination all withdrawn participants will be replaced.&#xD;
Phase 2: The Phase 2 adult cohorts will include adults between 18 and 59 years of age (inclusive). Participants in the Phase 2 will be enrolled into at least 1 dose level cohort with a vaccination dose of 50 ug which was determined by DSMB and SRPT review and approval of the applicable Phase 1 data. Phase 2 treatment group will consist of participants randomly assigned to active treatment versus placebo in a ratio of 4:1.</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Participants who meet all the following criteria at Screening are eligible to participate&#xD;
        in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants must be able to communicate effectively with study personnel and&#xD;
             considered reliable, willing, and cooperative in terms of compliance with the protocol&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants must sign the written informed consent form prior to undertaking any&#xD;
             protocol related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants must have a body mass index (BMI) at Screening, calculated as the body&#xD;
             mass divided (in kilograms [kg]) by the square of the body height (in metres [m]) of&#xD;
             18.0-30.0 kg/m2, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants must have haematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation (for all&#xD;
             participants in Phase 1, and, only if applicable, for participants in Phase 2), and&#xD;
             urinalysis test results that are not deviating from the normal reference range by age&#xD;
             and gender to a clinically relevant extent at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Males must be surgically sterile (&gt;30 days since vasectomy with no viable sperm),&#xD;
             practice true abstinence or, if engaged in sexual relations with a female of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential, the participants and their partner must use an acceptable,&#xD;
             highly effective, double-barrier contraceptive method* from Screening and for a period&#xD;
             of at least 60 days after the last dose of investigational vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women of child-bearing potential must practice true abstinence or, if engaged in&#xD;
             sexual relations with a male, they must agree to use highly effective (failure rate of&#xD;
             &lt; 1% per year when used consistently and correctly), double-barrier contraceptive&#xD;
             measures* throughout the study and intend to continue use of contraception for at&#xD;
             least 60 days following the last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             * The PI is to assess the adequacy of methods of contraception on a case-by-case&#xD;
             basis. These criteria do not apply if the participants are in a same-sex relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test (beta human&#xD;
             chorionic gonadotropin [β-HCG]) at Screening and a negative urine-based test within 24&#xD;
             hours prior to each investigational vaccine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Women of non-child-bearing potential must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. be classified as being postmenopausal (defined as having a history of amenorrhea&#xD;
                  of at least one year), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. where history of amenorrhea is less than one year, female participants must have&#xD;
                  a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt; 40 milli-international units per&#xD;
                  milliliter (mIU/mL), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. have a documented status of being surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy, or tubal ligation/salpingectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participants must be in general good health based on medical history and physical&#xD;
             examination, as determined by the PI, at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Body temperature must be less than 37.8ºC, at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Pulse must be no greater than 100 beats per minute, at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) must be between 85 to 150 millimetres of mercury (mm&#xD;
             Hg), inclusive, at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Participants must agree to refrain from donating blood, plasma, ovules, sperm, or&#xD;
             organs during the whole study.&#xD;
