  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patients who received docetaxel chemotherapy and prophylactic use of&#xD;
      pegfilgrastim were randomly divided into two groups; experimental group: prophylactic&#xD;
      etoricoxib (60 mg) was administered orally at each course of docetaxel-containing&#xD;
      chemotherapy, which started from the day of chemotherapy and was performed once per day for 8&#xD;
      days (day 1-8); control group: no prophylactic regimen was given. Primary endpoint: overall&#xD;
      incidence of musculoskeletal pain across all cycles of chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
      incidence, severity and duration of musculoskeletal pain at each cycle; incidence of severe&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain (score, defined as greater than 5 on a scale from 0 to 10) by cycle and&#xD;
      across all cycles; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) subscale at each&#xD;
      cycle; incidence of peripheral neuropathy after all cycles of chemotherapy; adverse events.&#xD;
