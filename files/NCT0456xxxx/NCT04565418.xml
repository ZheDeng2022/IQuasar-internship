  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of exercise training on 24h rhythms in substrate&#xD;
      metabolism in overweight subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. Subjects will perform&#xD;
      exercise training for 12 weeks. Before and after the exercise period, they will be admitted&#xD;
      to research facilities for 45 hours to assess 24h rhythms in substrate metabolism. In a&#xD;
      single-arm longitudinal design, subjects will serve as their own control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence shows that pre-diabetes is characterized by marked alterations in 24h&#xD;
      substrate metabolism, indicating metabolic inflexibility with an inability to fully switch to&#xD;
      fat oxidation during the night. Whereas exercise has been shown to promote mitochondrial&#xD;
      function and insulin sensitivity, it is unknown to if exercise training is able to restore&#xD;
      24h rhythmicity in overall substrate metabolism and muscle metabolism in human subjects with&#xD;
      pre-diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this single-arm longitudinal design, subjects will serve as their own control. Subjects&#xD;
      will perform high-intensity interval training for 12 weeks (3x times per week) on a cycle&#xD;
      ergometer at the research facility. Pre and post exercise, subjects will stay in a metabolic&#xD;
      chamber and adhere to a relatively normal life-style in order to standardize the main 24h&#xD;
      measurement period. As the primary outcome, substrate metabolism will be measured with a&#xD;
      ventilated hood system and by indirect calorimetry in the chambers. Muscle biopsies from the&#xD;
      vastus lateralis and frequent blood samples will also be taken over the course of the 24h.&#xD;
      Thereby, ex-vivo skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and muscle clock gene expression will&#xD;
      serve as the main secondary outcomes.&#xD;
