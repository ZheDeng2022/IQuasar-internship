  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Steatosis in case of live liver donors is on the rise and around 20- 40 % of prospective&#xD;
      liver donors are estimated to have hepatic steatosis. Significant steatosis has been shown to&#xD;
      be associated with inferior donor outcomes after liver transplant. Dietary and lifestyle&#xD;
      modification has been shown to reduce steatosis and may help improve the donor outcomes after&#xD;
      liver transplant. Donors will be randomized between two groups; one will be put under donor&#xD;
      lifestyle optimization protocol and the other shall follow normal diet and lifestyle. Donors&#xD;
      under optimization protocol would undergo diet modification in the form of healthy, low fat,&#xD;
      high protein diet along with exercise for 2 weeks prior to the expected date of surgery.&#xD;
      Investigations including liver volumetric assessment, LFT's , lipid profile , Fibroscan shall&#xD;
      be done prior to initiation of the diet and then following completion of the 2 weeks of&#xD;
      lifestyle modification before surgery. The intraoperative parameters including intraoperative&#xD;
      blood loss shall be assessed and a liver biopsy will be taken intraoperatively to assess for&#xD;
      steatosis and liver regeneration markers including CK7 and Ki 67 will be assessed. Following&#xD;
      surgery, the liver regeneration in donor shall be assessed by doing a liver volumetry by&#xD;
      Computed Tomography (CT) at POD7. Post surgery, the donor shall undergo daily LFT's, PT-INR&#xD;
      and the time to its normalization and serum bilirubin shall be assessed. Markers of liver&#xD;
      regeneration shall also be assessed initially a day before surgery and then at POD 1, 3 and&#xD;
      7.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All prospective donors provisionally planned for donor hepatectomy excluding those undergoing&#xD;
      left lateral hepatectomy will be informed regarding the current study and informed written&#xD;
      consent will be taken from donors willing to participate in the study. After step II&#xD;
      evaluation of the donors, they will be randomized into two groups. First group will be put&#xD;
      under donor lifestyle optimization protocol and the other shall follow normal diet and&#xD;
      lifestyle. Donors under optimization protocol would undergo diet modification in the form of&#xD;
      healthy, low fat, high protein diet along with exercise for 2 weeks prior to the expected&#xD;
      date of surgery. If the expected date of surgery is delayed because of any cause, the&#xD;
      proposed lifestyle optimization shall continue till the date of surgery. Step I of the&#xD;
      evaluation including Blood group, coagulation profile, LFT, KFT, Viral serology, Liver&#xD;
      attenuation index on Non contrast CT scan of abdomen and a Fibroscan shall be done. After&#xD;
      step I investigations are found to be normal, patient would be subjected to step II&#xD;
      evaluation consisting of CECT abdomen with liver volumetry including total liver volume,&#xD;
      right lobe volume without MHV using ,expected remnant volume using software for analysis of&#xD;
      CT volumes, MRCP for biliary anatomy, TFT and lipid profile. Body composition analysis,&#xD;
      Fibroscan, lipid profile and LFT shall be done prior to initiation of the diet and then&#xD;
      following completion of the 2 weeks of lifestyle modification. The intraoperative parameters&#xD;
      including intraoperative blood loss shall be assessed. Intra operative liver biopsy will be&#xD;
      taken from segment IV after completion of hepatectomy from all the donors undergoing donor&#xD;
      hepatectomy using a core needle biopsy(B BraunÂ® 18g). Precautions will be taken to take&#xD;
      adequate tissue samples and avoid subcapsular sampling. Hemostasis of the needle tract will&#xD;
      be obtained by use of electro thermal energy source. The core liver biopsy will be sent in&#xD;
      formalin containing bottle to the histopathologist. Liver biopsy will be done independently&#xD;
      by two expert histopathologists. Any abnormal histopathological finding will be noted, degree&#xD;
      of steatosis assessed and regenerative markers from the tissue including CK7 and Ki67 will be&#xD;
      assessed. Following surgery, the liver regeneration in donor shall be assessed by doing a&#xD;
      liver volumetry at POD7 and POD 14. Following donor hepatectomy, routine parameters like LFT,&#xD;
      PT-INR will be documented and the post operative day of normalisation of PT-INR and Serum&#xD;
      Bilirubin will be noted. The volumetry of the regenerated liver will be done at day 7 and day&#xD;
      14 in all the donors. Seum level of liver regenerative markers shall(including HGF, IL6, TNF&#xD;
      alpha, TGF beta, INF alpha) will be assessed on a day before surgery and then at Post&#xD;
      operative day 1, 3 and 7. Liver function tests and PT-INR would be evaluated daily for one&#xD;
      week. . In the post operative period , any surgical complication arising will be assessed&#xD;
      till first month after surgery and the donor outcomes will be monitored. Complications shall&#xD;
      be assessed based on Clavien Dindo Classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On follow ups liver function tests will be performed weekly for 1 month and then at monthly&#xD;
      intervals till 3 months after surgery. At this time, any long term complication will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
