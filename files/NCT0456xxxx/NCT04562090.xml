  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of mirabegron for the treatment of&#xD;
      overactive blsdder (OAB) in Chinese participants. This study will also evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      mirabegron for the treatment of OAB in Chinese participants, evaluate other efficacy&#xD;
      variables of mirabegron for the treatment of OAB and explore different mirabegron starting&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study follows an open-label, randomized, 12-week, prospective, interventional&#xD;
      postauthorization design for the treatment of OAB in approximately 249 Chinese participants.&#xD;
      Each participant will take part in one 12-week treatment period. Treatments will be&#xD;
      administered once daily orally after a meal during a 12-week, open-label treatment period.&#xD;
      Study visits will take place at weeks 4, 8 and 12. For 25 mg mirabegron group, a dose&#xD;
      escalation to 50 mg is permitted on visit 3 and visit 4 at investigators' discretion.&#xD;
      Approximately 10 study sites across China are planned.&#xD;

    <measure>Frequency of Adverse Events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AEs will be coded using MedDRA. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study investigational product (IP) whether or not considered related to the study IP. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study IP. This includes events related to the comparator and events related to the (study) procedures. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete a 3-day bladder e-diary, at least 3 and not more than 7 days before each visit. A daytime incontinence episode is defined as the complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine during daytime hours. The mean number of daytime incontinence episodes per 24 hours will be calculated by taking the sum of all daytime urinary incontinence episodes documented in the participant diary, divided by the number of valid diary days.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete a 3-day bladder e-diary, at least 3 and not more than 7 days before each visit. An urge incontinence episode is defined as any episode when both urgency and incontinence occurred concurrently. The mean number of urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours will be calculated by taking the sum of all urge incontinence episodes documented in the participant diary, divided by the number of valid diary days.</description>

    <description>The OABSS questionnaire is designed to quantify OAB symptoms as a single score, and contains questions that address 4 symptoms of overactive bladder: Daytime frequency, Nighttime frequency, Urgency, and Urge incontinence. The OABSS has a maximum score of 15 with more weight assigned to urgency and urgency incontinence than on frequency. The OABSS total score will be calculated from the sum total of the score of each question. The total score ranges from 0 to 15 with higher score indicating more symptoms.</description>
