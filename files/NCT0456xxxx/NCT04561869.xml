      Aim of the work PIC in pathological myopia has not been well documented due to difficult in&#xD;
      diagnosis we conducted this retrospective study to characterize the clinical features of PIC&#xD;
      in high myopic eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To show the diagnostic criteria of PIC lesions in high myopic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Find out the prevalence of PIC related 'patchy atrophy'&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine risk factor for developed PIC in a series of highly myopic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Role of PIC in progression of high myopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculate the progression rate of PIC related lesion, by the size change during&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Search about complication of PIC in myopia. Patient and Methods This retrospective&#xD;
           observational case series study included patients with high myopia who had been examined&#xD;
           and followed-up in the High Myopia Clinic of the Tokyo Medical and Dental University.&#xD;
           Approval from Ethics Committee of Tokyo Medical and Dental University was obtained,&#xD;
           adhering to the tenets of Declaration of Helsinki. Signed informed consent documentation&#xD;
           was obtained from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants underwent a detailed ophthalmologic examination at baseline and at&#xD;
      each follow-up visit. The examinations included measurements of best-corrected visual acuity&#xD;
      (BCVA) using a Landolt C chart, refraction, slit lamp biomicroscopy, biometry for&#xD;
      determination of axial length, (IOL Master; Carl Zeiss Meditec Co, Jena, Germany), fundus&#xD;
      examination in medical mydriasis, fluorescein angiography, was performed with and colour&#xD;
      fundus photography , and assessment of fundus autofluorescence (TRC-50DX; Topcon, Tokyo,&#xD;
      Japan) a or the Heidelberg Spectralis HRA system. Swept source Optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      (OCT) used in assessment of the RPE and photoreceptors using a (DRI-OCT;Topcon, Tokyo,&#xD;
      Japan). As scanning protocols, 9 mm or 6 mm radial with 12 equal meridian scans were&#xD;
      performed. The swept-source OCT device has an A-scan repetition rate of 100 000 Hz, and its&#xD;
      light source operates in the wavelength range of 1 Î¼m.&#xD;

      Myopia The frequency of myopia and high myopia are growing on a worldwide for causes that not&#xD;
      cleared. Myopia is vision challenges due to rises the risk of pathologic ophthalmic changes&#xD;
      such as cataract, glaucoma, retinal detachment, and myopic macular degeneration, all of which&#xD;
      can cause permanent vision loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High myopia was defined as an error of refractive above 8.0 diopters (D) or an axial length&#xD;
      of 26.5 mm or more. Younger persons than 5 years, high myopia was defined by a refractive&#xD;
      error of below- 4.0 D, and in children between 5 to 8 years, high myopia was defined by error&#xD;
      of refraction below -6.0 D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term of pathologic myopia,&quot; &quot;high myopia,&quot; and &quot;axial myopia&quot; have been used as a same in&#xD;
      the literature. Pathologic myopia was defined as chorioretinal atrophy (by META-PM study&#xD;
      group classification) with/or the existence of posterior staphylomas. Pathologic myopia is an&#xD;
      significant origin of vision loss global, affecting up to 3% of the people. The effect of&#xD;
      myopic maculopathy on impairment of vision is critical because the maculopathy is often&#xD;
      affect both eye , permanent, and usually affects individuals in productive years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Punctate inner choroidopathy Definition Punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC), classically&#xD;
      bilateral and is considers one of &quot;white dot syndromes&quot; which usually presents with distinct&#xD;
      ,multiple white-yellow lesions at posterior pole in the level of inner choroid and outer&#xD;
      retina with a preference for young myopic female , without sign of old or recent anterior&#xD;
      chamber or vitreous inflammation , with an increase the incidence of macular&#xD;
      neovascularization (MNV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETIOLOGY The underlying pathophysiology are not completely understood. Multiple evanescent&#xD;
      white dot syndrome( MEWDS)-like findings have been presented after traumatic subretinal&#xD;
      bleeding, choroidal rupture, and penetrating injury or with angioid streaks, ensuring antigen&#xD;
      exposure is likely causative factor. The present of acute retinopathy in Pseudoxanthoma&#xD;
      elasticum (PXE) is marked along angioid streaks (breaks in the Bruch membrane), in which&#xD;
      contact of retinal, RPE, and the Bruch membrane antigens to the immune system which stimulate&#xD;
      an autoimmune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Most inflammatory conditions in myopia are including the choriocapillaris. It can be&#xD;
      suggested that weakness of the choriocapillaris due to anatomic changes in addition to&#xD;
      unknown immunogenetic factors potentiate myopic eyes to primary inflammatory&#xD;
      choriocapillaropathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL FINDINGS Symptom Vision was usually slightly affected until the lesions were&#xD;
      subfoveal or choroidal neovascular membranes developed.(8) According to the study by&#xD;
      Gerstenblith and colleagues, initial symptoms in PIC are mostly scotoma (91%), blurred vision&#xD;
      (86%), photopsia (73%), floaters (69%), photophobia (69%), and metamorphopsia (65%). Loss of&#xD;
      peripheral vision was reported in 26% of patients. The consequence variable from return to&#xD;
      the normal to bilateral profound loss of vision .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sign Tools used in detecting and following PIC have involved fluorescein angiography,&#xD;
      indocyanine green angiography, and OCT ,fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging and OCT&#xD;
      angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundoscopic features Small (100-300 microns), yellow-gray lesions (12-25 in number) which&#xD;
      usually limited to the posterior pole and scattered in a haphazard (or rarely, linear) form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of chorioretinal scars is frequency to occur as consequence at the sites of&#xD;
      inflammation. Then, these scars become increasingly to well-defined (&quot;punched out&quot;) and may&#xD;
      come to be pigmented. These scars may progressively enlarge in size, leading to deterioration&#xD;
      of symptoms over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT finding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I: minor irregularities change in the outer nuclear layer. Stage II: focal elevation of&#xD;
      the retinal pigment epithelium/Bruch's membrane (RPE/BrM) complex with EZ and interdigitation&#xD;
      zone disruption. Stage III: The lesion of moderate reflectivity breakdowns through the RPE&#xD;
      and then grow to the dome of OPL through the photoreceptor layer. The RPE remain and BM at&#xD;
      the break gradually disappear, exposing the choroidal part of the lesion. Stage IV: The&#xD;
      lesion descends from the peak toward the choroidal part, subsequently a herniation of the OPL&#xD;
      and inner retina (with a V-shaped change) through the defect in the RPE and BM. Stage V: The&#xD;
      photoreceptor layer around the lesion is progressively missing with the drooping of the OPL&#xD;
      and inner retina. This lead to V-shaped inward of the outer plexiform layer and inner retina&#xD;
      into the choroid this is called &quot;focal choroidal excavation .At the same time, RPE&#xD;
      proliferation occurs (with posterior shadowing) to repair the RPE break so, the OPL framework&#xD;
      reappear .&#xD;
&#xD;
      BM (Bruch's membrane); OPL (outer plexiform layer;) RPE ( retinal pigment epithelium),&#xD;
      SD-OCT( spectral-domain optical coherence tomography).&#xD;
&#xD;
      fluorescein angiography (FA)&amp; Indocyanine green angiography (ICG) FA in PIC patients show&#xD;
      early hypofluorescence with late staining of inflammatory lesions, early hyperfluorescence&#xD;
      can also happen, particularly if CNV is found. ICG shows midphase hypocyanescence at the&#xD;
      posterior pole that may go beyond the lesions visible on FA and fundus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) Active PIC lesions show hypoautofluorescent spots with a&#xD;
      hyperautofluorescent border that disappear as the lesions regress. Atrophic PIC lesions&#xD;
      display to be hypoautofluorescent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complication Serious visual loss occurs in about to 40% of patients mainly due to development&#xD;
      of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The Important associations of myopic choroidal&#xD;
      neovascularization (MCNV) in highly myopic eyes with increasing levels of vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor or inflammatory cytokines and maculopathy lesions firmly indicate&#xD;
      an association of inflammation in the cause of MCNVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management The PIC management is tricky for multiple reasons. The varying in seriousness of&#xD;
      disease between patients make that ideal l treatment range from observation to&#xD;
      immunosuppression or intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. The judgment whether a patient is&#xD;
      benefit from maintenance therapy is hard due to the need to sense of balance between the&#xD;
      varying outcome of patients with PIC and the hazards of immunosuppression. Large number of&#xD;
      patients with PIC have prolonged times without disease activity and may go into long-standing&#xD;
      remission, although in others these stable stages may be interrupted by unpredictable,&#xD;
      sight-threatening episodes. Also, the evidence base to recommend any treatment approach is&#xD;
      inadequate There is large difference between patients. So, mediation is necessary to treat&#xD;
      new or active inflammatory &quot;PIC&quot; lesions especially when threatening the fovea, and to handle&#xD;
      secondary CNV. Also, addition, the situation of the other eye requires attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment options include local and systemic corticosteroids, systemic immunomodulatory&#xD;
      drugs, intravitreal VEGF inhibitors (anti-VEGF), photodynamic therapy (PDT), argon laser, and&#xD;
      submacular surgery.&#xD;
