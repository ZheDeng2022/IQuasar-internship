      -  Assess the efficacy of the endoscope as a single tool or as an adjuvant tool to the&#xD;
           microscope in intraventricular procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the limitations of the endoscope in these procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review the outcome of endoscopic and/or endoscopic assisted microsurgical&#xD;
           intraventricular procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Achieve a verdict in the long-standing controversy about the most effective, least&#xD;
           invasive, and optimal way to resect intraventricular lesions, can the endoscope rival&#xD;
           the surgical microscope?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lesions within the ventricular system present a challenge to neurosurgeons (1). Their deep&#xD;
      location and proximity to eloquent neurovascular anatomy complicate surgical approach and&#xD;
      resection (2). Microsurgery remains the gold standard for the treatment of intraventricular&#xD;
      tumors, but microsurgical approaches are not without limitations (3). With the use of the&#xD;
      operative microscope, most lesions of the lateral and third ventricles are accessed by a&#xD;
      craniotomy and either a transcortical or interhemispheric transcallosal approach. These&#xD;
      approaches are associated with brain retraction that can result in seizures, focal neurologic&#xD;
      deficits, and cognitive impairment (1). Also with standard microsurgical techniques, complete&#xD;
      resection is sometimes not achieved either because of nonvisualization of hidden parts of the&#xD;
      tumor or requirement of significant retraction of the neurovascular structures which is&#xD;
      potentially hazardous (4). The addition of the endoscope for resection of intraventricular&#xD;
      lesions has been described and represents a minimally invasive approach that limits brain&#xD;
      retraction and provides direct lesion visualization (1,5,6). The recent development of&#xD;
      endoscopic instrumentation has greatly enhanced microsurgical access to the ventricular&#xD;
      system and would allow enhanced microsurgical access, minimize the size of the transcortical&#xD;
      corridor, and reduce brain retraction during removal of challenging intraventricular lesions&#xD;
      performed with the surgical microscope (7). The application of the endoscope can be used in&#xD;
      the treatment of intraventricular lesions as arachnoid cyst with intraventricular extensions,&#xD;
      colloid cysts, biopsies and intraventricular brain tumor removal (8). Reestablishment of CSF&#xD;
      communication pathways is also possible endoscopically when patients develop obstructive&#xD;
      hydrocephalus due to their intraventricular pathology (1). The biggest issues when it comes&#xD;
      to a pure endoscopic approach concern the size and extent of the lesion, possibility of&#xD;
      complete cure or at least long-term control of the disease, and the presence of remnants that&#xD;
      were not completely excised (8) , However, The desire for a less invasive technique and an&#xD;
      effective surgical approach to intraventricular pathology has directed the attention of many&#xD;
      in the neurosurgical community towards the introduction of the endoscope as an adjuvant to or&#xD;
      even a replacement for the microscope in intraventricular surgery (5) and consequently,&#xD;
      neuroendoscopy has grown rapidly in the last 25 years as a therapeutic modality in the&#xD;
      treatment of intraventricular pathologies (9,10).&#xD;
