  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective clinical study to investigate the safety and efficacy of anti-PD-1&#xD;
      immunotherapy (Camrelizumab) in patients with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after&#xD;
      liver transplantation. All of the enrolled patients have a background of liver&#xD;
      transplantation for HCC. Due to the tumor recurrence, patients are not suitable for curative&#xD;
      surgical resection, and targeted therapy provides poor therapeutic effect, leading to tumor&#xD;
      progression or intolerance. Before immunotherapy, the PD-L1 expression was confirmed negative&#xD;
      in the graft liver by immunohistochemistry, and patients continued targeted therapy as part&#xD;
      of a combined antitumor regimen. In addition, the immunosuppression schedule is also reduced&#xD;
      to a low level.&#xD;
