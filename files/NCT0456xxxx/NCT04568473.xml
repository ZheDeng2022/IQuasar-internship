The incorporation of CXP™ in a permeable resin matrix that does not separate, purportedly drives the sustained, time-released properties of this varnish.it has ten times more fluoride release over a 4-hour period than the leading varnish brand, in addition, it also releases bioavailable calcium and phosphate ions which are nano-coated with xylitol.</description>
