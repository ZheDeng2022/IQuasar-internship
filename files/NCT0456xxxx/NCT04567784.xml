  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose an imaging study to investigate the neurobiological effects of CBD&#xD;
      (vs placebo) in abstinent subjects with heroin use disorder (HUD). The purpose of the study&#xD;
      is to determine the neural circuits and transmitters associated with the effects of CBD on to&#xD;
      reduce craving and anxiety. The neuroimaging will be conducted in participants immediately&#xD;
      following their first administration of CBD (800mg or placebo) and one week after the last&#xD;
      administration (3 daily doses). This CBD administration protocol was shown in previous&#xD;
      studies by the investigators to reduce craving and anxiety in abstinent heroin users.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will first use multimodal imaging in abstinent subjects with HUD to determine the&#xD;
      neural circuits associated with the effects of CBD on craving and anxiety. Secondly, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct 1H MRS to characterize in-vivo neurochemical levels associated&#xD;
      with CBD administration. Altogether, the data obtained will fill critical gaps of knowledge&#xD;
      important in the development of a potential non-opioid medication for treating opioid use&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBD has been shown to be safe in association with opioid use and not to have severe side&#xD;
      effects. The oral CBD solution (Epidiolex) to be used in the current study is approved by the&#xD;
      FDA for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of childhood&#xD;
      epilepsy. This study will investigate the neurobiological effects of CBD which is critical&#xD;
      for its development as a potential treatment for heroin use disorder in the future. Study&#xD;
      participation duration will last 2 weeks and will include MRI imaging; CBD/placebo&#xD;
      administration; MRI tasks such as the resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI); and&#xD;
      questionnaires measuring craving, anxiety, depression, elements of cognitive function, and&#xD;
      psychiatric history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: Study candidates will be recruited through flyers, ads and referrals from AIMS&#xD;
      clinics. At the initial phone contact candidates will be screened for exclusion criteria and&#xD;
      provided study information and, if they remain interested and no exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      encountered, invited for in-person screening. Candidates will then undergo the informed&#xD;
      consent procedure, be fully screened for eligibility and complete baseline assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Participants will be randomly assigned to either CBD or Placebo condition.&#xD;
