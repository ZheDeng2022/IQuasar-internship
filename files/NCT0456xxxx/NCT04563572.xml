  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective single-center trial, a wearable photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensor&#xD;
      coupled with a cloud analytics service will be used to detect and quantify atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (AF) episodes in patients with known paroxysmal AF. Patients will simultaneously&#xD;
      receive the PPG sensor in form of a smartwatch or bracelet and a Holter ECG for 48 hours.&#xD;
      Correctly identified AF episodes and AF burden determined by both methods will be compared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and a major risk factor for&#xD;
      cerebrovascular insults. Paroxysmal AF is defined as an episode of AF that terminates&#xD;
      spontaneously or with intervention within 7 days. Patients with AF may present with&#xD;
      palpitations, shortness of breath or sensation of light-headedness but asymptomatic episodes&#xD;
      are also possible, especially in paroxysmal AF. The lack of continuous heart rate monitoring&#xD;
      options makes early diagnosis of paroxysmal AF challenging. In this prospective single-center&#xD;
      trial, the PPG wearable Corsano CardioWatch 287 sensor will be used to conduct continuous&#xD;
      heart rate and -rhythm monitoring in patients with known paroxysmal AF. Collected data will&#xD;
      then be analysed using a Cloud Analytics Service (Preventicus Heartbeats algorithm) and&#xD;
      compared with data from simultaneously obtained 48-hour Holter ECG. Correctly identified AF&#xD;
      episodes, their cumulative duration per 48 hours (AF burden) and the number of asymptomatic&#xD;
      episodes will be assessed. In the primary analyses, the sensitivity of the PPG analysing&#xD;
      algorithm to detect AF episodes is estimated by performing a logistic regression on detection&#xD;
      (yes/no) with only an intercept as predictor, which is then translated to a proportion (the&#xD;
      sensitivity). In the secondary analyses we are comparing the cumulative duration of AF&#xD;
      episodes over 48 hours (AF burden) obtained with the PPG-sensor and Holter-ECG. In summary,&#xD;
      the purpose of the study is to evaluate the performance and efficacy of the wearable PPG&#xD;
      sensor and the cloud analytics service in detecting and quantifying AF episodes in patients&#xD;
      with known history of paroxysmal AF.&#xD;

    <description>The Preventicus Heartbeats algorithm ist a certified tool for detection of Atrial Fibrillation. It differentiates accurately between regular rhythm, single premature beats and the absolute arrhythmia concordant with AF. The Preventicus algorithm is device-agnostic, meaning that any wearable device capable of recording PPG-signals can be used for data collection.&#xD;
CardioWatch 287 is a novel non-invasive monitoring device manufactured by the MMT company. The device monitors heart rhythm, heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) based on peripheral PPG signal.&#xD;
In this arm, we will test the quality of the algorithm integrated into the smartwatch.</description>
