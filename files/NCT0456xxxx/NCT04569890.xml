  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is important to control the disease of pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis to ensure&#xD;
      the fetal and maternal health. Frequent disease flare can increase the risk of adverse&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes, including abortion, premature delivery and low birth weight. However,&#xD;
      there is no scientific and standardized treatment strategy for RA during pregnancy. About 50%&#xD;
      of RA patients need treatment during pregnancy. Tumor necrosis inhibitor (TNFi) is an&#xD;
      effective treatment, which can significantly improve the symptoms of RA during pregnancy.&#xD;
      However, in order to avoid placental metastasis, TNFi is usually stopped in early pregnancy.&#xD;
      Certolizumab pegol (CZP) is a PEGylated, Fc-free TNFi, which does not bind FcRn and is&#xD;
      consequently not expected to undergo FcRn-mediated transfer across the placenta. Therefore,&#xD;
      it can not transfer through placenta into FcRn and is approved to treat RA during pregnancy.&#xD;
      This study focuses on patients with RA who consider pregnancy. We compared the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety and economy of CZP and glucocorticoids combined with hydroxychloroquine by a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, a randomized controlled study was conducted to compare the efficacy, safety&#xD;
      and economy of CZP and glucocorticoids combined with hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of&#xD;
      RA patients who consider pregnancy. Informed consent must be obtained for the patients to be&#xD;
      screened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random method: central random.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding method: assessor and data analyst blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: every 4 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First endpoint: 24 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second endpoint: 52 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoint: 24 weeks postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data: core data related to treatment and disease activity are not allowed to be&#xD;
      missing, and other data are supplemented by the last observation value.&#xD;

    <description>The Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (MHAQ), reduced the number of items from 20 in the original HAQ to eight, and improved the feasibility in clinical practice when screening patients. The MHAQ score is calculated as the mean of the scores for each activity. Total score is between 0.0-3.0, in 0.125 increments. Higher scores indicate worse function and greater disability. MHAQ scores &lt;0.3 are considered normal.</description>

At 24 week, non-responders (ΔDAS28&lt;0.6) will switch to the other group. Participants switched to CZP group will taper their dose of GC gradually, if they have an improvement in disease activity (two successive DAS28&lt;2.6). If participants have a disease flare (increased DAS28&gt;0.6) during a reduction in corticosteroid dose, then they will resume their previous dose. Weekly step-down GC scheme: 10mg-7.5mg-5mg-2.5mg-0mg.</description>
