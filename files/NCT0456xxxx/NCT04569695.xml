        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs,&#xD;
             Electrocardiogram (ECG), and the results of serum biochemistry, blood coagulation and&#xD;
             hematology test and a urinalysis performed at screening. If there are abnormalities,&#xD;
             investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically&#xD;
             significant. This determination must be recorded in the subject's source documents and&#xD;
             initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must sign an Informed consent Form (ICF) indicating that they understand the purpose&#xD;
             of, and procedures required for the study and is willing to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a woman, except for postmenopausal women, must have a negative highly sensitive&#xD;
             serum (beta human chorionic gonadotropin [beta hCG]) at screening and urine (beta-hCG)&#xD;
             pregnancy test on Day -1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations&#xD;
             regarding the use of contraceptive methods for subject participating in clinical&#xD;
             studies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Before randomization, a woman must be either not of childbearing potential; of&#xD;
             childbearing potential and practicing a highly effective method of contraception and&#xD;
             agrees to remain on a highly effective method throughout the study and for at least 34&#xD;
             days after the last dose of study drug; women must have no history of excessive&#xD;
             menstrual bleeding or hemorrhage following pregnancy delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a woman, pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to become pregnant during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with current hepatitis B infection (confirmed by hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antigen [HBsAg]), or hepatitis C infection (confirmed by hepatitis C virus [HCV]&#xD;
             antibody), or human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) or HIV-2 infection at study&#xD;
             screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of, or a reason to believe a subject has a history of, drug or alcohol abuse&#xD;
             within the past 1 year, which in the Investigator's opinion would compromise subject's&#xD;
             safety and/or compliance with the study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any significant drug allergy (such as anaphylaxis or hepatotoxicity) and&#xD;
             known allergy to the study drug or any of the excipients of the formulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preplanned surgery or procedures that would interfere with the conduct of the study&#xD;
