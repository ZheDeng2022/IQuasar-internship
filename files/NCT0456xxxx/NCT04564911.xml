  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many with type 2 diabetes (T2D) remain sub-optimally controlled. Structured programmes&#xD;
      requiring dietary and lifestyle intervention have been shown to improve control but are&#xD;
      time-and labour-intensive. The role for self-monitoring of blood glucose with capillary blood&#xD;
      glucose (CBG) readings is uncertain. The use of flash glucose monitoring (FGM) with education&#xD;
      may effect improvements in awareness and self-management behaviour and hence glycaemic&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to compare the effects of FGM versus CBG fingersticks in the context of&#xD;
      a structured education programme over a 6-month period in adults with type 2 diabetes. 200&#xD;
      adults (&gt;21y) with sub-optimally controlled T2D (7.5-10%) on either diet-controlled, oral&#xD;
      glucose lowering drugs or background insulin will be enrolled and randomised into the&#xD;
      intervention arm (FGM and education) or control arm (capillary glucose fingersticks and&#xD;
      education). The intervention arm will monitor glucose using FGM continuously for 6 weeks and&#xD;
      intermittently thereafter up to 24 weeks. The control group will monitor glucose using CBG&#xD;
      fingersticks up to 24 weeks. During the intervention period(0-24w), both arms will undergo&#xD;
      the same schedule of visits (-2w, 0w, 8w, 16w, 24w) and 6 education sessions. Both groups&#xD;
      will be followed up at weeks 38 and 52. Primary outcome is HbA1c change from baseline at 24&#xD;
      weeks. This study will provide novel data on the use of FGM versus CBG in Type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      its impact on glycaemic control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 200 adults will be recruited from 5 different sites in Singapore. Following screening,&#xD;
      consent and enrolment, all participants wear a blinded flash glucose monitoring system that&#xD;
      is masked to the user and asked to continue testing capillary glucose readings at least once&#xD;
      daily for 2 weeks (week -2 to week -1).Participants who are able to wear the sensor for the 2&#xD;
      weeks, and are monitoring capillary glucose levels at least 70% of the time for the 2 weeks&#xD;
      (â‰¥10 readings/2weeks), will carry on to be randomised to intervention or control group (week&#xD;
      0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon fulfilling the criteria of blinded sensor wear of 2 weeks and 70% capillary glucose&#xD;
      monitoring over 2 weeks, participants will be randomised into the control or the intervention&#xD;
      arm, using web- based retrieval of randomisation allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline (week 0), all participants in both groups will receive baseline education on&#xD;
      diabetes self-management, including blood glucose targets, role and timing of diabetes&#xD;
      medications, and individualised education on macronutrient composition of meals and the goals&#xD;
      of nutritional therapy in type 2 diabetes. Both groups will use the blinded FGM data at&#xD;
      baseline for education. In total, both groups will receive 6 education sessions over the 24&#xD;
      week period, delivered by diabetes nurse educators or nurses and dietitians. The diabetes&#xD;
      educators and physicians will be aligned towards a standardised curriculum for consistency of&#xD;
      education through a train-the-trainer workshop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomised to the control arm will receive an education package and be given&#xD;
      education on how to self-manage glucose levels using a standard capillary blood glucose&#xD;
      device. They will be encouraged to test blood glucose readings at least twice a day but&#xD;
      preferably 4 times daily. Participants randomised to the intervention arm will wear the flash&#xD;
      glucose monitoring system, and will be given education on how to use sensor glucose data for&#xD;
      self-management. Flash glucose monitoring will be used continuously for 6 weeks. From week 6&#xD;
      to week 24, the frequency of use of flash glucose monitoring will be reduced to one sensor&#xD;
      every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention period is for 24 weeks, followed by an observation period up to 52 weeks.&#xD;
      After the 24-week intervention period, participants from both arms will wear a blinded sensor&#xD;
      for the last 2 weeks of the intervention period (week 25 to week 26). During the observation&#xD;
      period (weeks 24 to 52), participants in both arms will be encouraged to continue monitoring&#xD;
      glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication titrations will be left to the discretion of the primary physician. Physician&#xD;
      consults will be at weeks 0, 8, 24, 38, 52. There will be no medication up-titration at week&#xD;
      0 although the physician may choose to optimize medications if needed: e.g. moving basal from&#xD;
      bedtime to the morning to reduce the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia or switching from a&#xD;
      sulphonylurea agent to an alternative oral medication to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. If&#xD;
      down-titration of medications is required, the reduction/cessation of sulphonylurea agents or&#xD;
      insulin therapy will be encouraged to alleviate the risk of hypoglycaemia and promote weight&#xD;
      loss. If there is no improvement in glycemic control or deterioration of glycaemic control at&#xD;
      weeks 8 and 16 (laboratory HbA1c more than of equal to 8.5% for consecutive readings, one&#xD;
      laboratory HbA1c more than or equal to 10% or a 2% point HbA1c increase from previous visit),&#xD;
      medications may be up-titrated. The use of agents which do not increase the risk of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia and promote weight loss will be encouraged. If prandial insulin or premixed&#xD;
      insulin is added to the treatment regimen from week 8 onwards, subjects will still remain&#xD;
      within the study and be included in the analysis.&#xD;
