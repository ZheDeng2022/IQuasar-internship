    <textblock>
      Pilonidal sinus is a disease that affects the young population. Wound healing is a problem&#xD;
      after surgical interventions Especially wound healing brings minimally invasive interventions&#xD;
      to the fore. In this study we will administer two types of irritating agent for pilonidal&#xD;
      sinus disesase. One of them is phenol and second one is silver nitrate solution. And not&#xD;
      routinely used for pilonidal sinus disease. The data about availeble in pubmed and google&#xD;
      scholar is limited focused on silver nitrate The goal of the study is to compare the silver&#xD;
      nitrate and phenol application&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease is a chronic subcutaneous tissue inflammation that&#xD;
      most commonly affects the male sex between the ages of 20 and 30, characterized by burning,&#xD;
      itching and discharge in the internal gluteal cleft. It affects the young working population,&#xD;
      short return to work after treatment and early return to daily normal activity is&#xD;
      socioeconomically important. Although approximately 15 different surgical techniques have&#xD;
      been described in the literature in the treatment of pilonidal sinus, a gold standard&#xD;
      approach has not been determined. Since it is seen in the young working population, it is&#xD;
      important that the ideal treatment has an easy-to-apply, low cost and fast recovery process.&#xD;
      The effectiveness of phenol administration as a minimally invasive procedure has been&#xD;
      demonstrated with acceptable complication and success rates in prospective and retrospective&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Silver nitrate is a caustic and sclerosing substance that impairs tract integrity, such as&#xD;
      phenol. It supports the closure of the sinus tract by cauterizing the granulation and&#xD;
      epithelialized tissue throughout the sinus. It also has antimicrobial properties to reduce&#xD;
      microbial load throughout the tract. Although the effective use and successful results of&#xD;
      silver nitrate in the treatment of perianal fistula have been shown, a prospective study has&#xD;
      not been conducted yet on the use of pilonidal sinus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of the study is to compare return to normal daily activity between the two&#xD;
      groups. This period will be measured in days from the intervention. Participants will not be&#xD;
      offered any restrictions after the intervention, and the period of returning to normal daily&#xD;
      activities such as starting work at work or doing the housework will be determined by filling&#xD;
      out a two-week daily questionnaire. Secondary goals; quality of life, complaints related to&#xD;
      pilonidal sinus (itching, burning, discharge), wound infection, closure of pilonidal sinus&#xD;
      mouth, recurrence rate and VAS (visual analog scale) scoring.&#xD;
