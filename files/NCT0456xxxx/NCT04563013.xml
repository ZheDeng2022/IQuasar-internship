  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, cervical&#xD;
      cancer, rectal cancer, or breast cancer who received radical&#xD;
      radiotherapy/neoadjuvant/assisted radiotherapy were recruited and the transcutaneous vagal&#xD;
      nerve stimulation (tVNS) was applied. The aim of of study is : 1) to study whether tVNS could&#xD;
      improve the patient's fatigue, quality of life under radiotherapy or chemotherapy; 2) to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of transcutaneous VNS on the levels of patients' lymphocyte subsets&#xD;
      and proinflammatory cytokines.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel controlled trial was conducted. This trail&#xD;
      is to recruit 130 patients diagnosed with above specific types of cancer undergoing radical&#xD;
      radiotherapy/neoadjuvant/adjuvant radiotherapy. Participants were randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      two groups with 65 in each group. According to treatment mode (radical radiotherapy vs&#xD;
      neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiotherapy) and staging (stage I-II vs stage III), the participants&#xD;
      were randomly divided into two groups: 1) sham tVNS with conventional radiotherapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy (control group); 2) tVNS with conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy&#xD;
      (intervention group). tVNS was conducted at every radiotherapy day for at least 4 weeks. tVNS&#xD;
      stimulation method: in the control group, the ear clip electrodes were clamped at the&#xD;
      earlobe; in the intervention group, the ear clip electrode was clamped at the tragus.&#xD;
      Stimulation duration would last for 30 minutes, and the stimulation intensity was adjusted to&#xD;
      the minimum value of pain threshold. The Chinese version of the Concise Fatigue Scale&#xD;
      (BFI-C), the European Organization for Reasearch and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire(EORTC QLQ-C30), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression Scale (HADS) assessment, lymphocyte subpopulations,level of proinflammatory&#xD;
      factors, blood routine testing and electrocardiogram testing were performed within 2 weeks&#xD;
      before treatment (baseline), 4 weeks after intervention, at the end of chemoradiation, 1&#xD;
      month and 4 month after the end of chemoradiation; weekly blood routine testing during&#xD;
      intervention under radiotherapy and chemotherapy; the incidence of side effects and sleep&#xD;
      quality score were evaluated at baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks after the intervention, at the&#xD;
      end of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and 1 month after the end of radiotherapy. The number&#xD;
      of recruited participants met the statistical requirements.&#xD;
