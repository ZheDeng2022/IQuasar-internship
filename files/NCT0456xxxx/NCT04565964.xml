    <textblock>
      This study plan to study the association between household health behavior (cleaning habits)&#xD;
      and children's asthma. In addition, reconfirm the health effects of indoor environmental&#xD;
      exposure to phthalates plasticizers, mite, fungi, and bacteria, and cockroaches on children's&#xD;
      asthma. Thus, the investigators can provide a non-pharmacological intervention to reduce the&#xD;
      disease burden of children's asthma and allergic diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to invite 80 children, aged 7-12 years-old who have&#xD;
      physician-diagnosed asthma, and another age- and gender-matched children without asthma to&#xD;
      join our study. First, obtaining clinical data of disease status, and ask participants to&#xD;
      fill out questionnaires after recruiting. Second, participants have to record body&#xD;
      temperature, peak expiratory flow, heart rate, finger O2 saturation percentage, asthma attack&#xD;
      frequency continuously by care-giver every day. Third, the investigators will perform indoor&#xD;
      environmental assessments in the subject's house, including indoor air quality, dust samples,&#xD;
      culture for fungi and bacteria, and cockroaches. The investigators will also count the dust&#xD;
      mites and measure phthalates concentration in every dust sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, health behavior intervention for one month will be provided to every participant. The&#xD;
      investigators will teach children's guardians (care-giver) how to change the health behaviors&#xD;
      to clean indoor environment, including the health behaviors in bedroom, kitchen room,&#xD;
      restroom, refrigerator, washing machine, and incense burning hall. After 1 months, the&#xD;
      investigators will investigate whether changing health behavior affects the exposure of&#xD;
      phthalates, dust mites, fungi, bacteria, and cockroaches, and evaluate the effects of health&#xD;
      behavior intervention on the clinical status of children's asthma. Children's asthma severity&#xD;
      assessment will be recorded by ACT and also by symptomatology every day. Household health&#xD;
      behaviors (cleaning habits) questionnaires also will be completed per week and continuously&#xD;
      for 4 weeks.&#xD;
