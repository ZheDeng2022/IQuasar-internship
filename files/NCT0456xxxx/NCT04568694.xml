  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm study to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of semi-elective&#xD;
      lung transplantation. We plan to evaluate 15 patients that receive lung(s) delayed for&#xD;
      transplantation under our study criteria.&#xD;

    <description>Transplants with a planned recipient anesthesia start time between 10:00 pm and 6:00 am will be allowed to move to a start time between 6:00 am and 8:00 am at the earliest. Donor lung(s) cross clamp time must occur between 5:00 pm and 4:00 am. Lungs that meet criteria will be transported in the usual fashion in a cooler of ice at 4oC. Upon arrival to NYULH, the lungs will be transferred to cold static preservation at 10oC within a specific incubator located in a NYULH OR (MYTEMP™65HC, Benchmark Scientific).</description>
