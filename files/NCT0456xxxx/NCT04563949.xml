  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, sample collection study to follow clinically suspicious lesions to&#xD;
      determine the outcome including surgical biopsy, removal, monitoring, etc. for up to 2 years&#xD;
      after lesion identification. Subjects who had, or will have a DermTech Pigmented Lesion Assay&#xD;
      completed on a lesion suspected of being melanoma are eligible for the study. Based on&#xD;
      historical data, an expected melanoma rate of approximately 5% to 10% is anticipated.&#xD;

      This is a multi-center, sample collection study to follow clinically suspicious lesions to&#xD;
      determine the outcome including surgical biopsy, removal, monitoring, etc. for up to 2 years&#xD;
      after lesion identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be consented and enter the trial to have their suspicious lesion(s), biopsied&#xD;
      via DermTech's adhesive patch biopsy and assessed with DermTech's non-invasive PLA, and&#xD;
      followed up to 2 years per standard of care. Lesions must be photographed and/or the site of&#xD;
      the lesion anatomically defined to permit follow-up of the lesion(s) and lesional site(s)&#xD;
      during future visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed per standard of care for lesion biopsy, excision, treatment and/or&#xD;
      monitoring. Other than DermTech's non-invasive PLA of the lesion(s) no other study procedures&#xD;
      will be performed and subjects will be treated according to the standard of care. The&#xD;
      subject's medical management team should use standard of care, visual assessment changes&#xD;
      (i.e., &quot;ABCDE&quot;) and physician judgment for suspicious lesion characterization and monitoring&#xD;
      when planning the subject's course of treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males and females the treating physician chose to use the PLA on;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of a lesion(s) that is suspicious for melanoma and a candidate for surgical&#xD;
             biopsy that was previously biopsied with DermTech's adhesive patch biopsy and assessed&#xD;
             via PLA;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Willing to permit subsequent PLA assays to be performed on suspicious lesions;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Willing to follow standard of care treatment for the lesion(s) as determined by the&#xD;
             treating physician;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must be able to complete study visits required by the protocol (subject is&#xD;
             not planning to relocate or travel thus prevent attendance at future study visits; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing to provide informed consent to participate in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has confirmed melanoma or a suspicious lesion that required a surgical biopsy or&#xD;
             excision prior to the intial PLA on that lesion of interest;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has an ulcerated or bleeding lesion that could cofound the PLA results;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has a suspicious lesion(s) in an area that was previously surgically biopsied;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The lesion(s) is on the palms, mucosal surface, or other area where adhesive patch&#xD;
             biopsies cannot be performed;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has an allergy to tape or latex rubber;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Receipt of any investigational drug therapy within four weeks of study enrollment, or&#xD;
             concurrent participation in another interventional clinical study deemed by the&#xD;
             treating physician to potentially influence this study; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Documented substance abuse, any other significant medical condition or laboratory&#xD;
             result that would indicate an unreasonable risk to the subject or potential&#xD;
             interference with study procedures, or would negatively affect the patient's&#xD;
             reliability and compliance with the study schedule of events. -&#xD;
