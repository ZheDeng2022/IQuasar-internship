      As a supplement to the ongoing randomized evaluation of the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) anxiety prevention intervention in Pakistan (R01-MH111859), the investigators propose&#xD;
      to explore potential biological mechanisms (related to inflammation and endocrine&#xD;
      functioning) of antenatal anxiety through additional data collection with 300 pregnant women.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will leverage the ongoing randomized evaluation of the CBT anxiety prevention&#xD;
      intervention in Pakistan (R01-MH111859) to explore potential biological mechanisms. This CBT&#xD;
      intervention targets both sub-threshold anxiety symptoms and generalized anxiety disorder&#xD;
      (GAD) in early- to mid- pregnancy, aiming to both prevent and treat Common Mental Disorders&#xD;
      (CMDs) (GAD and major depressive episodes (MDE)) as well as improve birth outcomes. The study&#xD;
      team proposes to additionally study biological correlates of antenatal anxiety (i.e., immune&#xD;
      and endocrine functioning) in 300 women: in addition to 200 drawn from our randomized trial&#xD;
      (100 intervention, 100 usual care), the study will also include 100 healthy women without&#xD;
      anxiety or depression. The aims are to 1) characterize the &quot;immune phenotype&quot; of anxious&#xD;
      women across the peripartum, specifically by measuring the relation among anxiety symptoms&#xD;
      and peripheral markers of inflammation within and across women (both anxious and healthy) and&#xD;
      between those receiving the intervention and control; 2) determine the relation between&#xD;
      levels of allopregnanolone (ALLO) in pregnancy and concurrent anxiety symptoms and future&#xD;
      symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD), 3) examine the relation between changes in immune&#xD;
      functioning and ALLO levels in anxious pregnancy across time, 4) examine whether immune&#xD;
      function and/or ALLO are mediators or moderators of the association between antenatal anxiety&#xD;
      and preterm birth and/or small-for-gestational age, and 5) examine the effects of both&#xD;
      anxiety and the intervention (including biomarkers) on infant development at six weeks&#xD;
      postpartum.&#xD;
