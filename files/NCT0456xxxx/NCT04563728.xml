  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is to build multi-sector and multi-institutional partnerships to test the&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a pilot surveillance camera intervention (N=10)&#xD;
      to reduce the frequency and severity of abuse, exploitation, and neglect in community older&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This a feasibility investigation that aims to conduct an 8-week pilot RCT (N=10 total) to&#xD;
      test the potential effectiveness of a surveillance intervention to reduce frequency and&#xD;
      severity of elder abuse among older populations. Eligible participants will be recruited from&#xD;
      community-dwelling populations in which an older adult victim has experienced elder abuse&#xD;
      (abuse, exploitation, neglect) according to New Jersey APS referrals or our screening. With&#xD;
      informed written consent, participants will be evenly randomized into one of three&#xD;
      conditions: camera, mock camera, and control (usual care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes are elder abuse cases including psychological, physical, sexual abuse,&#xD;
      financial exploitations, caregiver neglect, and self-neglect measured by 83 items. For&#xD;
      psychological and physical abuse, we use eight items and ten items from a modified Conflict&#xD;
      Tactics Scale (CTS).46-53. Sexual abuse will be assessed by a question asking about&#xD;
      experiences of being touched in private areas when unwanted. Financial exploitation will be&#xD;
      assessed by the 17-item Financial Exploitation Scale, adapted from Conrad et al in a study&#xD;
      funded by the Department of Justice.54 Caregiver neglect will be assessed by 20 items of&#xD;
      unmet needs in key activities of daily living among individuals living with at least one&#xD;
      person.35,55 Self-neglect was assessed by a widely used and validated measurement56,57.The&#xD;
      measurement was reviewed by a community advisory board of over 20 community organizations led&#xD;
      by a geriatrician and has shown good contend, convergent58, and predictive validity59.&#xD;

Financial exploitation will be assessed by the 17-item Financial Exploitation Scale, adapted from Conrad et al in a study funded by the Department of Justice. Caregiver neglect will be assessed by 20 items of unmet needs in key activities of daily living. Self-neglect will be assessed by a validated 25-item measurement.&#xD;
Items will be combined to report whether any vs no abuse/neglect/exploitation was experienced. In addition, multiple definitions of severity can be determined by combining these instruments and using various cut off points to determine severity.</description>

The camera(s) will record video and audio data to be stored in our secure data base. The cameras will be purchased from YI Technology (see more details in Section 1.7). A sign will be placed outside the home to notify individuals regarding the potential recording, reading, &quot;NOTICE Audio and/or video surveillance may be in use on these premises&quot;. Highlighted video and audio data will be reviewed daily by the study technician. If there is evidence of abuse, exploitation, and neglect on these video and audio data, a report will be made to APS and the IRB.</description>

A sign will be placed outside the home to notify individuals regarding the potential recording, reading, &quot;NOTICE Audio and/or video surveillance may be in use on these premises&quot;. Daily check-ins to assess whether elder abuse may have been experienced by the participant will occur by phone or other preferred mode of communication. In the event of reported abuse, exploitation, and neglect, despite not being mandatory reporters, we will report to NJ APS and the IRB.</description>
