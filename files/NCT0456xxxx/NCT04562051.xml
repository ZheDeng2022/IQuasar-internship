  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, observational study to compare the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      stratified prophylaxis based on donors' and recipients' risk factors vs routine prophylaxis&#xD;
      bases on clinical experience in living kidney transplantation from HBsAg+ donors to HBsAg-&#xD;
      recipients. The follow-up period was 2 years after renal transplantation. The primary outcome&#xD;
      was prevention failure of HBV transmission (any one of HBsAg - → +, HBV DNA - → +, HBeAg - →&#xD;
      +, HBeAb - → +, HBcAb - → +, active liver function damage and death in the recipient).&#xD;

    <time_frame>2020.9-2025.10</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the incidence of prevention failure of HBV transmission from HBsAg+ donors to HBsAg- recipients, which is a composite endpoint. The composite outcome includes HBsAg - → +, HBV DNA - → +, HBeAg - → +, HBeAb - → +, HBcAb - → +, active liver function damage and death in the recipients. Liver function damage is defined as postoperative abnormal liver dysfunction (ALT &gt; 60IU/L for females, and &gt;75 IU/L for males; or total bilirubin &gt; 34 umol/L); or postoperative ultrasonography reported hepatic cirrhosis in the recipient.</description>

    <description>biopsy-confirmed acute rejection was diagnosed clinically based on a significant increase in serum creatinine levels of 50% or more within 3 days, which was not explained by other reasons and confirmed by biopsy.</description>

    <description>The process of stratified prophylaxis was as follows. 1) If the recipient's HBsAb level is more than 100 IU/L and the donor is HBV DNA-, the recipient will not receive any preventive measures; 2) If the recipient's HBsAb is more than 100 IU/L and the donor is HBV DNA+, the recipient receives antiviral treatment for 1 month; 3) If the recipient's HBsAb is between 10 and 100 IU/L, the recipient is treated with single dose HBIG and antiviral treatment for 1 month regardless of the donor's HBV DNA status; 4) If the recipient's HBsAb is less than 10 IU/L, the recipient will receive single dose HBIG and antiviral treatment for 1 month regardless of the donor's HBV DNA status.</description>
