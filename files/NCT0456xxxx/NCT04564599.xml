      1. INTRODUCTION 1.1.1. Background Over the last decade, ride sharing services such as Uber&#xD;
           and Lyft have become a popular transportation option, particularly for young people.&#xD;
           These services often market themselves as less expensive and/or safer alternatives to&#xD;
           taxis or driving while intoxicated (1). Whether ride sharing has a net benefit on rates&#xD;
           of driving while intoxicated, or on alcohol and/or drug related crashes is unclear&#xD;
           (2-6). Few studies have investigated this relationship, and a literature review showed&#xD;
           no studies targeting the question outside of an isolated geographic region.&#xD;
           Additionally, Uber has recently released its Safety Report bringing to light the issue&#xD;
           of sexual assault associated with ride sharing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1.2. Aim Investigate the relationship between ride sharing services and alcohol- and&#xD;
           drug-related motor vehicle collisions within the state of Texas, and to develop&#xD;
           understanding of the relationship between ride sharing services and sexual assault.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1.3. Rationale for the study The results of this study may be useful in public health&#xD;
           initiatives to either incentivize or discourage ride sharing as a way to impact rates of&#xD;
           alcohol- and drug-related motor vehicle collisions. Further, hospitals and insurance&#xD;
           payors may be interested to note any calculated effect of ride sharing on hospital&#xD;
           costs, lengths of stay, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1.4. Hypothesis 1.1.4.1. Primary Hypothesis The introduction of ride sharing services&#xD;
           such as Uber and Lyft to the state of Texas resulted in fewer alcohol- and drug-related&#xD;
           crashes and greater cost savings for hospitals and insurance payors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. OBJECTIVES AND STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES 1.2.1. Study Objectives 1.2.1.1. Primary&#xD;
           Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determine the number and severity of alcohol- and/or drug-related motor vehicle&#xD;
                collisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determine the number of auto vs pedestrian (auto-ped) alcohol- and/or drug-related&#xD;
                collisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determine the correlation between the introduction of ride sharing services and the&#xD;
                number of alcohol- and drug-related crashers as well as with hospital and insurance&#xD;
                payor expenditures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determine the relationship between ride sharing services and sexual assault. 1.2.2.&#xD;
                Study Outcome Measures 1.2.2.1. Primary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of alcohol- and drug-related motor vehicle collisions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of auto-ped alcohol- and drug-related collisions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Results of alcohol screen and drug screens&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mechanism of injury&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Metrics indicative of ride sharing service presence, use, and public awareness&#xD;
                (i.e. self-reported usage and company reports)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Additional information collected will include patient demographics, injury&#xD;
                characteristics, injury severity score, abbreviated injury scale, emergency&#xD;
                department vitals, diagnoses, procedures, insurance coverage, treatment cost,&#xD;
                hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, blood product data, vehicle type, number of&#xD;
                sexual assaults, miles traveled, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY DESIGN This will be a retrospective study with data collected from the trauma&#xD;
           registry. We plan to complete the data collection and analysis by 12/31/2021. Data on&#xD;
           ride sharing will be obtained from the Uber and Lyft websites. Data pertaining to number&#xD;
           of alcohol- and drug-related motor vehicle (and auto-ped) collisions will be obtained&#xD;
           from the Texas Department of Transportation website, the National Highway Traffic Safety&#xD;
           Administration, the Shared-Use Mobility Center (SUMC) and the Transformation of Public&#xD;
           Transit, the Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute, Texas Department of Public Safety, and&#xD;
           the U.S. Department of Transportation website (or equivalent). Sexual assault data will&#xD;
           be obtained as available the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) database as well as&#xD;
           from Turning Point Rape Crisis Center and surrounding hospitals in the Dallas area as&#xD;
           well as the Uber report for sexual assaults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY ENROLLMENT AND WITHDRAWAL 3.1. Study Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Positive blood alcohol or drug screen&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Motor vehicle collision (MVC) or auto-ped 3.2. Study Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Younger than 16 years&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Younger than 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pregnant women 3.3. Premature Termination or suspension of study&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study may be suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable&#xD;
           cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination,&#xD;
           will be provided by the suspending or terminating party. If the study is prematurely&#xD;
           terminated or suspended, the principal investigator will promptly inform the IRB and&#xD;
           will provide the reason(s) for suspension or termination. Circumstances that may warrant&#xD;
           termination include, but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data that is not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determination of futility.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Favorable outcomes at smaller than expected sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 4.1. Sample Size Considerations This protocol is intended to&#xD;
           be an observational study dependent on occurrence data. No formal sample size&#xD;
           calculations were completed as this is limited by reported occurrences and retrospective&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2. Statistical Analysis Plan Descriptive analysis will be performed for all variables.&#xD;
           Frequencies, percentages, sensitivity, and specificity will be presented to summarize&#xD;
           the categorical variables such as patient demographics and the outcomes of the different&#xD;
           conditions associated with diaphragmatic injury. Mean and standard deviation will be&#xD;
           presented for normally distributed continuous variables and median and interquartile&#xD;
           range will be presented for non-normal continuous variables. The categorical outcome&#xD;
           variables between the samples will be compared with chi square test or Fisher's exact&#xD;
           test (if any cell value â‰¤ 5). The normally distributed continuous outcome variables will&#xD;
           be analyzed with a two-sample t-test and non-normally distributed continuous outcomes&#xD;
           will be analyzed with a nonparametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Because there might be&#xD;
           potential for confounding patient characteristic variables to influence the outcome, a&#xD;
           multiple regression and logistic model will be used to compensate for these factors.&#xD;
           Odds ratio along with the confidence interval and p-value will be reported for both the&#xD;
           adjusted and unadjusted model. A p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
           significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. ETHICS/PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 5.1. Ethical Standard The investigator will ensure&#xD;
           that this study is conducted in full conformity with the principles set forth in The&#xD;
           Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects&#xD;
           of Research, as drafted by the US National Commission for the Protection of Human&#xD;
           Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research (April 18, 1979) and codified in 45 CFR&#xD;
           Part 46 and/or the ICH E6. If the study is conducted at international sites, the&#xD;
           statement could be as above and/or could reference compliance with the Declaration of&#xD;
           Helsinki, CIOMS, International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving&#xD;
           Human Subjects (2002), or another country's ethical policy statement, whichever provides&#xD;
           the most protection to human subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2. Institutional Review Board The protocol will be submitted to the IRB for review and&#xD;
           approval. Approval of the protocol must be obtained before any participant is enrolled.&#xD;
           Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by the IRB before the&#xD;
           changes are implemented in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3. Informed Consent Waiver Acquiring informed consent is not applicable. This study&#xD;
           proposal is requesting a waiver of informed consent. This research only involves the&#xD;
           collection or study of existing data, documents, and records and the investigators are&#xD;
           recording information in such a manner that patients cannot be identified or possess any&#xD;
           identifiers which could somehow be linked back to the patient. This research could not&#xD;
           practicably be conducted without the waiver of informed consent because this is a&#xD;
           retrospective chart review and it would be extremely time consuming to attempt contact&#xD;
           for consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Waiver of the HIPAA Authorization has been requested. The following reasons apply to our&#xD;
           proposal: the use of the protected health information involves no more than the minimal&#xD;
           risk of the privacy of the individuals, the research could not practicably be conducted&#xD;
           without the waiver, and the research could not practicably be conducted without access&#xD;
           to, and use of, the protected health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.4. Participant Confidentiality All patient records and/or information will be kept&#xD;
           under double locked doors or under password protection at all times. Only authorized&#xD;
           study personnel as stated in the delegation of responsibility will have access to&#xD;
           patient records and/or information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN 6.1. Source Document Management The source data will be collected&#xD;
           with the assistance of the electronic medical/health record software, Premier, Midas or&#xD;
           other medical/hospital data sources, paper records and/or electronic data collection&#xD;
           methods. All data collected will be entered into an Excel sheet and recorded. All data&#xD;
           collection methodologies will be maintained under strict surveillance, double locked&#xD;
           doors or an encrypted, password protected Methodist Health System (MHS) approved server.&#xD;
           All data capture and storage methods will be HIPAA compliant as per MHS policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.2. Data Capture Methods The data will be collected with the assistance of the&#xD;
           electronic medical/health record software, Premier, Midas or other medical/hospital data&#xD;
           sources, paper records and/or electronic data collection methods. All data collected&#xD;
           will be entered into an Excel sheet and recorded. All data collection methodologies will&#xD;
           be maintained under strict surveillance, double locked doors, or an encrypted, password&#xD;
           protected MHS approved server. All data capture and storage methods will be HIPAA&#xD;
           compliant as per MHS policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. RECORD RETENTION/ARCHIVING All records pertaining to the study will be kept on site at&#xD;
           Methodist Dallas Medical Center for three years upon study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. PUBLICATION PLAN All studies must comply with GCP of blinding all protected health&#xD;
           information of all patients prior to presentation and/or publication. The data obtained&#xD;
           will be de-identified prior to sharing via presentation and/or publication in relevant&#xD;
           research mediums. The data will be published and/or presented at national, regional,&#xD;
           local and international sites. The research gathered will be analyzed and submitted to&#xD;
           relevant medical journals for publication to add to the body of knowledge in the science&#xD;
           community, as well as to improve on existing policies in trauma. This information may be&#xD;
           presented at major surgical and trauma conferences including AAST (American Association&#xD;
           for the Surgery of Trauma), SWSC (Southwest Surgical Congress), EAST (Eastern&#xD;
           Association for the Surgery of Trauma), WTA (Western Trauma Association), etc.&#xD;
