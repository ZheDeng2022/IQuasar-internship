  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates the effects of hypofractionated radiation therapy before&#xD;
      surgery on wound complications associated with surgery in treating patients with soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcoma of the extremity (arms, hands, legs or feet) and superficial trunk that has not&#xD;
      spread to other parts of the body (localized) and can be removed by surgery (resectable).&#xD;
      Hypofractionated is a shorter radiation therapy treatment length (fewer radiation treatment&#xD;
      days) and administers the total radiation dose as larger daily doses, compared to&#xD;
      conventionally fractionated therapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To report the major acute wound complication rate associated with hypofractionated&#xD;
      preoperative radiation therapy, 42.75 Gy in 15 fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To report the 5-year local failure rate associated with hypofractionated preoperative&#xD;
      radiation therapy, 42.75 Gy in 15 fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To report the 5-year disease-free survival rate associated with hypofractionated&#xD;
      preoperative radiation therapy, 42.75 Gy in 15 fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To report the 5-year overall survival rate associated with hypofractionated preoperative&#xD;
      radiation therapy, 42.75 Gy in 15 fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To report long-term toxicity rates associated with hypofractionated preoperative&#xD;
      radiation therapy, 42.75 Gy in 15 fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To describe patterns of relapse associated with hypofractionated preoperative radiation&#xD;
      therapy, 42.75 Gy in 15 fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To describe patient reported outcomes/quality-of-life outcomes with hypofractionated&#xD;
      preoperative radiation therapy, 42.75 Gy in 15 fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy once daily (QD) (except weekends and&#xD;
      holidays) over 3 weeks for a total of 15 fractions. Within 3-6 weeks after completion of&#xD;
      radiation therapy, patients undergo surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-8 weeks, every 3-4 months&#xD;
      for years 1-2, and every 6 months for years 3-5.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients who experience major wound complications</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 120 days of surgical resection of soft tissue sarcoma following preoperative radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Will be estimated by the number of patients who experience the major wound complications within 120 days following surgery divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Major wound complication is defined as secondary unplanned operation under general or regional anesthesia for wound repair (e.g.,debridement, operative drainage, or secondary wound closure including rotationplasty, free flaps or skin grafts); or wound management without secondary operation including invasive procedures (e.g., aspiration of seroma or readmission for wound care such as intravenous antibiotics or persistent deep packing for 120 days or longer). 95% confidence intervals using normal approximation to binomial wound complication proportion will be calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Local failure rate</measure>
    <time_frame>At 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be defined any radiographic or pathologic evidence of recurrent disease inside the clinical target volume (CTV) and/ or to within 3 cm from the edge of the CTV. Local failure rate at 5 years (LFR5) will be evaluated by the number of patients free of local failure/recurrence at 5 year divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Exact binomial 95% confidence interval for the point estimate will be provided. In the case of censoring prior to 5 years, LFR5 will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From registration date to the earliest date of documentation of either, local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant recurrence, or death due to any cause, assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of disease-free survival will be estimated using method of Kaplan-Meier.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From registration date to death due to any cause, assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of overall survival will be estimated using method of Kaplan-Meier.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of late adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 3 months and 24 months after completion of hypofractionated preoperative radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for adverse event reporting. The rate of &gt;= grade 2 late adverse events will be estimated by the number of patients with a &gt;= grade 2 late adverse event divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true rate of &gt;= grade 2 late adverse events will be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pattern of relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Pattern of relapse will be evaluated by number of patients with patterns of tumor recurrence such as local recurrence, marginal recurrence, regional recurrence, distant metastasis, and second primary tumor divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Exact binomial 95% confidence interval for the point estimate will be provided.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI CTCAE version 5.0 will be utilized for adverse event reporting. The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns. Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 24 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Results from the ten-item Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-10) questionnaire will be used to evaluate physical and mental health, separately. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be utilized to assess changes in raw PROMIS scores. Mean change, along with standard deviation will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 24 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Results from the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS) questionnaire will be used to evaluate functional outcomes. Mean change from baseline to 24 months post-surgery, along with standard deviation will be reported by version. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be utilized to assess changes in TESS scores within questionnaires.</description>
