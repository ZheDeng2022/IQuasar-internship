  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sorafenib-induced hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) is a dose-dependent side effect in patients&#xD;
      with advance hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The appropriate prophylactic dose of urea-based&#xD;
      cream and comparison of its effectiveness with other creams remain unclear. The aim of this&#xD;
      study was re-validating the prophylactic HFSR incidence density and cutaneous wetness of 10%&#xD;
      urea-based cream on sorafenib-induced HFSR in patients with advanced HCC.&#xD;

      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study population consisted of patients with (1) HCC by proof of pathology, (2) presence&#xD;
      of tumor thrombus in the main trunk of the portal vein or the first-order branches of the&#xD;
      portal vein with minimal ascetics or with no ascetics by abdominal CT scan, (3) Child-Pugh&#xD;
      liver function class A, (4) planning to receive oral sorafenib 400 mg twice per day, (5) age&#xD;
      of 20 or more years old, and (6) able to communication in Chinese, Taiwanese or Hakka.&#xD;
      Patients with (1) encephalopathy, psychosis, cognition impairment, blindness or hearing&#xD;
      impairment, (2) allergic history to urea, (3) present ulceration, blisters, infective&#xD;
      problems on the palms or soles, or (4) previous surgery, systematic chemotherapy or frequent&#xD;
      radial ablation were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized double-blind experiment study. Sample size was estimated by the G. power&#xD;
      software version 3.1, which was set with logistic regression, odds ratio: 3.8, and power:&#xD;
      0.80. The estimated sample size should be 125 at least. This study, there was recruited 129&#xD;
      patients (43 patients in each groups). All eligible patients were recruited from Taipei&#xD;
      Veterans General Hospital between January 1st and December 31th, 2014. They were randomly&#xD;
      assigned in a ratio of 1:1:1 to treat with best supportive care plus moisturizing cream (A&#xD;
      group), BSC plus 10% urea-based cream (B group) and BSC alone (group C which is comparison&#xD;
      group),by method of EXCEL random sampling. A case manager recruited the eligible patients who&#xD;
      also conducted informed consent and patient education. A research employee had&#xD;
      responsibilities to record patients' demographic data, provide non-label cream and check&#xD;
      previous container of the cream that should be exhausted. A medical oncologist or a nurse had&#xD;
      responsibilities to assess patients' severity of HFSR and cutaneous wetness. The assessment&#xD;
      was done on 3 days before starting sorafenib treatment and each 7 days after the starting,&#xD;
      total 9 times. Creams were provided after the assessment. When patients developed HFSR, they&#xD;
      will be referred to receive the most appropriate management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions for group C (comparison group) who received BSC alone were (1) informed of&#xD;
      potential presentations of HFSR, (2) asked for wearing waterproof gloves before execute&#xD;
      household or work with water, (3) provided the method of contacting with healthcare&#xD;
      specialists for confirming early diagnosis of HFSR, and (4) asked for self-report when they&#xD;
      occurred symptoms of HFSR. The A group with BCS plus moisturizing cream received the&#xD;
      interventions as the comparison group, was given the moisturizing cream (dimethicone,&#xD;
      fragrance free, Aveeno, United States) for 9 times and was instructed how to use the cream.&#xD;
      The education of usage included (1) using the cream twice a day from 3 days before starting&#xD;
      sorafenib and each week post starting sorafenib, (2) scooping out nut-sized cream with a&#xD;
      unique spoon each time, (3) gently applied the cream evenly on symmetrical palms below wrists&#xD;
      and symmetrical soles below ankles each time, (4) wore unique cotton gloves immediately after&#xD;
      the appalment of cream for 30 minutes each time. A B group with BCS plus 10% urea-based cream&#xD;
      had the similar interventions as the A group with BCS plus moisturizing cream except being&#xD;
      given the cream container with different component (10% urea; Sipharr, Taiwan). The outlook&#xD;
      of the containers with the two kinds of cream was the same. All the cream looks white and&#xD;
      grey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data of con founders and two end-points, incidence density of HFSR and cutaneous wetness,&#xD;
      were collected. The con-founders included gender, age, numbers of chronic illnesses, numbers&#xD;
      of metastatic regions as well as levels of white count, hemoglobin, bleeding time, liver&#xD;
      enzymes, albumin and electrolyte.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The grades of HFSR were assessed by NCI-CTCAE version 4, which was developed by Dueck et al.&#xD;
      This is an available psychometric patient-reported instrument. Body water with 33% or less&#xD;
      meant dry skin, 34% to 37% meant mild dry skin, 38% to 42% meant general status, 43% to 46/%&#xD;
      was mild moisty skin and 47% or more presented moisty skin. When using the scanner, examiners&#xD;
      had to confirm whether it tied to fix on the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was approved by the Institution Review Board of the Taipei Veterans General&#xD;
      Hospital (2013-13-009B). Informed consent was obtained from all patients by a case manager on&#xD;
      3 days before starting sorafenib. Patients were explained the study protocol and were&#xD;
      educated self-care skills by the case manager. All of them were well aware that their rights&#xD;
      will be protected, the risk of participation will be limited to the lowest and most suitable&#xD;
      management will be arranged when they developed sorafenib-induced HFSR.&#xD;
