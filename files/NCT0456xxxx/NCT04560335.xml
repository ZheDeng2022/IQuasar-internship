      This project addresses obesity in the population with SMI by evaluating a weight management&#xD;
      program that is not only evidence-based, it is sustainable, transportable, appealing to&#xD;
      patients, easy to use, and minimally burdensome to the healthcare system. This effort&#xD;
      addresses two HSR&amp;D priority areas: 1) Mental Health: Testing new models of care to improve&#xD;
      access, cost, and/or outcomes, and 2) Health Care Informatics: Building the evidence base for&#xD;
      ehealth/mhealth tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: CoachToFit's use of mobile technology is an important innovation in VA service&#xD;
      delivery and its user-centered design involving individuals with SMI was the first of its&#xD;
      kind. CoachToFit is enhanced by data visualization in real-time via a web-based dashboard&#xD;
      used by VA peer specialists and their supervisor. The Investigators are aware of no other&#xD;
      evidence-based mobile platforms to help people with SMI reduce their weight&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 40% to 60% of individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) are obese. Obesity and&#xD;
      physical inactivity result in increased rates of chronic diseases, increased risk of death,&#xD;
      and substantial health care costs. Treatment guidelines recommend that individuals with SMI&#xD;
      who are overweight should be offered evidence-based weight loss interventions, including&#xD;
      psychosocial interventions. The VA's weight management program, MOVE!, is attended by less&#xD;
      than 5% of the overweight population and is not adapted to the cognitive needs and patient&#xD;
      preferences for the population with SMI. Effective adapted weight management programs are not&#xD;
      offered in VA because the programs are time-intensive and require the skills of trained&#xD;
      providers who are often in short-supply. CoachToFit can address this gap in care. CoachToFit&#xD;
      is a weight management program, adapted for the population with SMI, that includes a&#xD;
      smartphone app delivering evidence-based weight management services with weekly telephonic&#xD;
      support from a VA peer specialist who acts as a wellness coach. Peer specialists are&#xD;
      individuals who draw upon lived experiences with SMI to provide services to others with SMI&#xD;
      in clinical settings. CoachToFit was shown to have high rates of acceptability and usability&#xD;
      and was efficacious for weight loss in a small sample. VA has an opportunity to address&#xD;
      obesity in the population with serious mental illness, currently a substantial gap in care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance/Impact: This project addresses obesity in the population with SMI by evaluating&#xD;
      a weight management program that is not only evidence-based, it is sustainable,&#xD;
      transportable, appealing to patients, easy to use, and minimally burdensome to the healthcare&#xD;
      system. This effort addresses two HSR&amp;D priority areas: 1) Mental Health: Testing new models&#xD;
      of care to improve access, cost, and/or outcomes, and 2) Health Care Informatics: Building&#xD;
      the evidence base for ehealth/mhealth tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: CoachToFit's use of mobile technology is an important innovation in VA service&#xD;
      delivery and its user-centered design involving individuals with SMI was the first of its&#xD;
      kind. CoachToFit is enhanced by data visualization in real-time via a web-based dashboard&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Methodology: The study design includes a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of CoachToFit and assess the hypothesized mechanisms of action. This will include enrollment of obese Veterans with SMI from the mental health clinics at one VA medical center (n=256). Individuals will be randomized to CoachToFit or usual care. Those in CoachToFit will have access to the app and coaching for 6 months. Outcomes are assessed at 6- and 12-months. Efficacy outcomes utilize objective measures. The design also includes a multi- stakeholder qualitative post-intervention evaluation guided by the RE-AIM framework to characterize factors that will inform future implementation and maintenance of CoachToFit. This will include interviews with Veterans randomized to CoachToFit (n=30); interviews with staff stakeholders (n=18); a discussion with Veterans in local Veteran groups (n=2 groups; n=11 Veterans), and interviews with national leadership (n=3).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>CoachToFit: Those randomized to CoachToFit will have the CoachToFit app downloaded to their phone by the peer coach and will work with the coach to initialize the app. Individuals will receive an activity tracker compatible with Android OS and iOS (Amazfit Bit) and a Bluetooth scale (Smart Body scale). Participants will be instructed by the peer to complete at least two CoachToFit modules per week. Modules take about 15 minutes to complete and have embedded knowledge quizzes and end with a choice of three goals to practice over the next week. They will also set up a time for the first 20-minute coaching call, which will then continue weekly.</description>

The handout was developed with input from a VA dietitian as well as Veterans and is graphically appealing, with a simple layout, and provides information on diet and activity as well as the local MOVE! schedule</description>

&#xD;
          -  chart diagnosis of dementia;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  history of bariatric surgery;&#xD;

          -  psychiatric hospitalization during the month prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additionally, we will follow the American College of Sports Medicine recommendations for&#xD;
        health screening and risk stratification in preparation for starting a moderate intensity&#xD;
        exercise program to ensure that participants enrolled are capable of safely engaging in the&#xD;
        app's recommendations regarding physical activity. Specifically, all potential participants&#xD;
        will be given the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q), a screening tool often&#xD;
        used in weight management trials. If they endorse symptoms or major signs suggestive of&#xD;
        cardiopulmonary disease (i.e., angina, anginal equivalent, dyspnea, syncope, orthopnea,&#xD;
        edema, palpitations or claudication), which is a score 1 on the PAR-Q, they will need&#xD;
        clearance from a VA physician before enrolling.&#xD;
