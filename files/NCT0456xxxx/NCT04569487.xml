  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to constitute a cohort of sarcopenic versus non-sarcopenic&#xD;
      patients to validate the most relevant biological, imaging, mobility and clinical markers&#xD;
      considered individually or in association for the diagnosis of sarcopenic patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is part of a Research Program partly funded by a grant from the Walloon region&#xD;
      entitled &quot;Development of Markers of Sarcopenia Using an Integrated Approach : From Cell to&#xD;
      Human&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistent with the above-mentioned observation, there is not only one biological marker that&#xD;
      perfectly matches the sarcopenia criteria but there is a range of complementary biomarkers -&#xD;
      including but not limited to inflammation markers, products of oxidative damage, serum&#xD;
      creatinine and urinary creatinine excretion, endocrine function, urine proteomics panel,&#xD;
      N-terminal procollagen peptides, myostatin and agrin fragment - that will together constitute&#xD;
      the ideal panel of markers (Fougère et al, 2015). These current biomarkers and the thresholds&#xD;
      for correlation with clinical outcomes have to be deeply evaluated in clinical trials before&#xD;
      being considered as good biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, one research priority is to investigate and define novel biomarkers allowing an&#xD;
      improved assessment, characterization and follow-up of elderly people with sarcopenia.&#xD;
      Biomarkers derived from blood can indeed easily be measured in a standardized and low-cost&#xD;
      way and are therefore very attractive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial aims at confirming the relevance of new soluble markers and validating&#xD;
      the most relevant biological (previously and newly identified), imaging, mobility and&#xD;
      clinical markers for clinical research in sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newly identified soluble markers of sarcopenia coming from DEMAIN Research program and using&#xD;
      secretomic approach (to be identified in secretome of human myotubes during the program&#xD;
      research) using immunoassays on biological fluids.&#xD;

The SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported questionnaire that covers eight health domains: physical functioning (10 items), bodily pain (2 items), role limitations due to physical health problems (4 items), role limitations due to personal or emotional problems (4 items), emotional well-being (5 items), social functioning (2 items), energy/fatigue (4 items), and general health perceptions (5 items). Scores for each domain range from 0 to 100, with a higher score defining a more favorable health state.</description>
