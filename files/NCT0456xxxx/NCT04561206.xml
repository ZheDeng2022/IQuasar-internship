  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how well brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab work in treating&#xD;
      patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back (relapsed). Brentuximab vedotin&#xD;
      is a monoclonal antibody, brentuximab, linked to a toxic agent called vedotin. Brentuximab&#xD;
      attaches to CD30 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them.&#xD;
      Nivolumab is an antibody that enhances the immune system to better fight Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
      cells. Giving brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab may be able to defer stem cell transplant&#xD;
      treatment and spare the considerable cost and toxicity on transplantation.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the durability of response to brentuximab vedotin (BV) plus nivolumab (nivo) by&#xD;
      24-month progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with 1st relapse of classical&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma (RcHL) who achieved early complete metabolic response (CMR) (CMR after 4&#xD;
      cycles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate CMR and overall response rate (ORR) after 4 cycles and at the end of BV-nivo&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate the PFS and overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort and for subgroups of&#xD;
      patients defined by their response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Estimate the PFS and OS separately for responders who did and did not receive&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate the toxicities of BV-nivo in the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate the second PFS after salvage therapy for patients who progress after study&#xD;
      therapy, and for the subset of these patients who proceeded to autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (ASCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Explore the association between clinical outcomes and pathological tumor characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Explore the association between clinical outcomes and circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (ctDNA) characteristics (mutation profile, kinetics of clearance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and nivolumab IV over&#xD;
      30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 16 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and 6, 12, 18, 24,&#xD;
      36, 48, and 60 months.&#xD;
