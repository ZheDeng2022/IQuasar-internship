      The aim of the present study is to identify the prevalence and prognostic impact of sodium&#xD;
      imbalance on sepsis and septic shock patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis and septic shock are among the most prevalent causes of intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
      admissions. They account for around 10-50% of the mortality rate, which remains high despite&#xD;
      extensive research of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, and national core measures Sepsis is&#xD;
      defined as &quot;Organ dysfunction that threatens the patient's life caused by the impaired host&#xD;
      response to infection&quot; septic shock is defined as hypotension and serum lactate level greater&#xD;
      than two mmol/L, as well as not responding to adequate fluid resuscitation requiring the use&#xD;
      of vasopressors to maintain the mean blood pressure of 65 mm Hg or higher . Sepsis and septic&#xD;
      shock are considered medical emergencies .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute hypernatremia is considered one of the features of homeostasis disturbances, which is&#xD;
      common in septic patients with an incidence reaching up to 47% Finding biomarkers which&#xD;
      predict the outcome of sepsis is challenging . Since electrolyte imbalance, specifically&#xD;
      hypernatremia, is one of the commonest problems associated with sepsis and septic shock&#xD;
      patients [20, 21]. It is, therefore, of current interest to study the evolution of sepsis in&#xD;
      patients who have been shown to have hypernatremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence shows that serum sodium levels may not be completely explained by fluid&#xD;
      balance or sodium intake . Some studies suggest that sodium is intimately tied to the immune&#xD;
      system, thus raising the question of whether inflammatory states such as sepsis can play a&#xD;
      role in the development of hypernatremia&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The diagnosis of sepsis and septic shock was made prior to the ICU admission. Sepsis and&#xD;
        septic shock were defined according to the 3 definition using the Quick Sofa score of 2 or&#xD;
        more&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sepsis : 2 or more of the SIRS criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Temperature &gt;38 or &lt;36 c&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heart Rate &gt;90 beats/minute&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Respiratory rate &gt;20 cycle /minute&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  wbc &gt;20,000 or &lt; 4,000 Plus the presumed existence of infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood pressure can be normal Septic shock : the same as sepsis plus refractory&#xD;
             hypotension&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  After bolus of 20- 40 ml/kg patient has one of the following :&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  SBP &gt;90 mm Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  MAP &lt;65 mm Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Decrease of 40 mm Hg of base line hypernatremia [Na+]&gt; 145 mmol/L eunatremia&#xD;
                  [135-145]mmol/l hyponatremia &lt;135 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        patients under the age of 18 years patients with a previous diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism&#xD;
        patints diagnosed with Cushing syndrome, patients diagnosed with diabetes insipidus.&#xD;
