  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at investigating if splinting and early mobilization is a better method,&#xD;
      regarding range of motion, for treating fractures of the base phalanx of the fingers compared&#xD;
      to surgery with pinning. This will be achieved through a randomised clinical trial comparing&#xD;
      the two methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proximal phalangeal fractures of the hand are very common and affect patients of all ages. .&#xD;
      Most fractures heal without complications but these injuries can result in impaired hand&#xD;
      function and prolonged inability to work and perform activities of daily living. If there is&#xD;
      a dislocation that cannot easily be repositioned to a stable position, surgery might be&#xD;
      required. Surgery is often performed with percutaneous pinning and immobilisation in plaster&#xD;
      for 4 weeks. Good results of non-surgical treatment with a splint that allows immediate&#xD;
      mobilization of the interphalangeal joints has been reported. This study will compare these&#xD;
      two methods for treating fractures of the base phalanx of the fingers. Recruited patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms: 1. surgery with pinning 2. conservative&#xD;
      treatment with a splint. Primary outcome is total active range of motion in the affected&#xD;
      finger at 3, 6 months and 1 , 3 years. Secondary outcomes are number of sick days and various&#xD;
      patient related outcome measures.&#xD;
