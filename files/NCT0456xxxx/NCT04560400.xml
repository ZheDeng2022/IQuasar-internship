  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of concussion history and reading&#xD;
      direction on baseline King- Devick Test (KDT) performance, a common component of sideline&#xD;
      concussion assessments. The KDT is a timed assessment of saccades, or quick movements of the&#xD;
      eyes between two points. This test is a form of rapid automatized naming and involved&#xD;
      subjects reading digits arranged on a tablet screen as quickly and accurately as possible.&#xD;
      The test has three progressively more challenging test &quot;cards,&quot; as the horizontal guidelines&#xD;
      between digits disappear from test card 1 to 2, and the vertical spacing between the lines of&#xD;
      digits decreases from test card 2 to 3. KDT performance is evaluated in terms of both speed&#xD;
      (duration to all three test cards) and the number of errors (digits read incorrectly or&#xD;
      omitted). Previous studies have identified several factors that affect KDT performance aside&#xD;
      from head injury, including age, sex, sleep deprivation, learning disabilities, and first&#xD;
      languages other than English. History of concussion has not been shown to influence KDT&#xD;
      performance. The investigators hypothesize that since the left-to-right (L-R) reading&#xD;
      direction of the KDT is the same way in which to read English, the long-term effects of prior&#xD;
      concussions on saccadic eye movements may be masked. The investigators want to answer the&#xD;
      following three research questions: 1) What is the effect of KDT reading direction on&#xD;
      baseline KDT performance? If the test is performed by reading digits in a right-to-left (R-L)&#xD;
      direction, will KDT times be slower and the number of errors increase relative to a typical&#xD;
      L-R KDT? 2) What is the effect of a history of multiple concussions on KDT performance&#xD;
      relative to no history of concussion? 3) Is the R-L KDT more sensitive to a history of&#xD;
      multiple concussions? The investigators hypothesize that individuals with a history of&#xD;
      multiple concussions will perform significantly worse (longer test durations, more errors)&#xD;
      than individuals with no concussion history on the R-L KDT. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that baseline performance on the traditional L-R KDT will not be&#xD;
      able to discriminate individuals with a history of multiple concussions from those with no&#xD;
      concussion history.&#xD;

      Subjects will first be asked to complete a questionnaire. This questionnaire will collect&#xD;
      demographic data (age, sex, years of education, native language and other languages spoken)&#xD;
      and other pertinent data (vision correction, concussion history, ocular/visual injury and&#xD;
      disorder history, learning disability diagnoses). The questionnaire will take approximately 3&#xD;
      minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the concussion history provided in the questionnaire, the subject will be assigned&#xD;
      to either Group NoHx (no concussion history) or Group HxMC (history of multiple concussions.)&#xD;
      Then the subject will be randomized into one of two KDT formats: L-R KDT (natural reading&#xD;
      direction) or R-L KDT (reverse reading direction) via a coin flip. The researcher will&#xD;
      explain the KDT procedure by saying, &quot;This test evaluates your saccadic eye movements, or&#xD;
      rapid eye movements from one fixation point to the next. This test is comprised of three test&#xD;
      cards. Each test card has eight lines of several digits (numbers). Please read the digits&#xD;
      aloud as quickly but as accurately as possible from [L-R condition: 'left to right and top to&#xD;
      bottom'; R-L condition: 'right to left and top to bottom']. If participants make a mistake,&#xD;
      correct it if participants can and continue on. This is a timed test--tapping the tablet&#xD;
      screen starts and stops the stopwatch. Participants will have a brief break in between cards&#xD;
      to catch participants' breath. Each test card will get progressively harder. The horizontal&#xD;
      lines guiding participants from digit to digit on each line on Test Card 1 disappear on Test&#xD;
      Card 2. The lines of digits on Test Card 3 are closer together than they were on Test Card 2.&#xD;
      Do you have any questions?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will start the app and pull up the demonstration card for the L-R condition.&#xD;
      For the R-L condition, the researcher will open a picture of the adapted demonstration card&#xD;
      with the diagonal lines switched to indicate that subjects follow from the left-most digit to&#xD;
      the right-most digit on the subsequent line. Subjects will complete the demonstration card&#xD;
      twice according their condition instructions. Subjects will be reminded to &quot;read the digits&#xD;
      as quickly but accurately as possible&quot; and in the direction according to their assigned test&#xD;
      condition before starting the test. The researcher will silently count any errors while the&#xD;
      subject completes each test card one at a time, taking a brief (1-2s) pause after tapping the&#xD;
      screen to stop the timer and tapping again to start the timer and bringing up the next test&#xD;
      card. At the conclusion of the test, the researcher will record the total time and number of&#xD;
      errors on the subject data collection sheet. The subject will complete the test a second&#xD;
      time, following the same instructions. The total time and number of errors for the second&#xD;
      attempt will also be recorded. The investigators anticipate this portion of the data&#xD;
      collection to take approximately 6 minutes. The total duration of the data collection will be&#xD;
      approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
