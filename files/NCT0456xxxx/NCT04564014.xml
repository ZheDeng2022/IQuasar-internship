      This RCT develops an ISSS program for secondary teachers. The primary objective is to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy of such an intervention in reducing depression/anxiety, compared with a WLC&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondary teachers are under great stress and have prevalent mental/emotional health problems&#xD;
      with limited coping resources and treatment. Selective intervention with an ISSS program is&#xD;
      potentially useful as it is effective in preventing clinical/severe mental disorders and&#xD;
      enhancing cost-effectiveness in health promotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) develops an Internet-based guided self-help&#xD;
      intervention for secondary school teachers. The primary objective is to evaluate the relative&#xD;
      efficacy of an Internet-based self-help skill strengthening (ISSS) program in reducing levels&#xD;
      of depression and/or anxiety among secondary school teachers that have depressive symptoms&#xD;
      and anxiety symptoms versus a wait-list control (WLC) group at post-treatment time and the&#xD;
      6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and methods: The study design is two-armed RCT. The participants are secondary&#xD;
      school teachers (n=427) with at least mild levels of depression ( Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire score &gt;=15) and/or anxiety(Generalized Anxiety Disorder score&gt;=20) identified&#xD;
      through screening. Evaluation involves surveys at baseline, end of intervention, and 6 months&#xD;
      afterwards. In addition to information received by the wait-list control group, the&#xD;
      intervention group receives a carefully designed ISSS program with 5 sessions. The control&#xD;
      group will participate in the ISSS program after the 6-month follow-up. Trained e-Coaches&#xD;
      with a master degree in psychology or counseling will support and provide feedback to the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and measures: The primary outcomes are depression and anxiety. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include perceived stress, self-efficacy, job performance and well-being. Measures of&#xD;
      potential mediators (problem-solving and time management) include: the General Self-Efficacy&#xD;
      Scale (GSE),the Performance Maintenance Scale (PMS), the World Health Organization Well-Being&#xD;
      Index (WHO-5), theProblem Solving Inventory (PSI), and the Time Management Behavior Scale&#xD;
      (TMBS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis will be performed. ANOVA and Chi-square&#xD;
      tests will be conducted to test between-group differences in baseline characteristics.&#xD;
      Pearson's correlation analyses will be used to test inter-correlations among all outcome&#xD;
      variables and mediators. ANCOVA will be used to test changes in outcome variables at&#xD;
      post-test or follow-up with pre-scores controlled. Mean improvement scores will be computed&#xD;
      by calculating Cohen's d for ISSS as compared to WLC. Remission rates will be calculated&#xD;
      (based on percentage of individuals dropping below PHQ-9 and/or GAD-7 cut-offs). Binary&#xD;
      logistic regression will be used for odds ratios between the remission rates in ISSS with&#xD;
      WLC. PHQ and GAD will be compared in two groups using ANCOVA. Post-test/follow-up score will&#xD;
      be compared among two conditions, with pre-scores as covariates, to examine the group effect.&#xD;
      The potential mediation effects of problem solving and time management between intervention&#xD;
      conditions and emotional problems will be tested by using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)&#xD;
      and bootstrapping analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications: The findings may lead to an evidence-based selective intervention online&#xD;
      program for the improvement of secondary teachers' mental/emotional health, a problem with&#xD;
      scare coping resources and treatment. Enhancement of teachers' mental/emotional health,&#xD;
      related knowledge and coping ability (problem solving, time management) would also benefit&#xD;
      students.&#xD;

    <description>The outcome will be measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) consisting of nine questions designed to correspond to the nine diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder covered in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Items are rated from 0 to 3 according to increased frequency of experiencing difficulties in each area covered. Scores are summed and can range from 0 to 27. Score 10 is often recommended as the cut-off score to detect major depressive disorder. Scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent cut-off points for mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. The Chinese version has been validated.</description>

A score of 10 or greater represents a cut point for identifying cases of generalized anxiety disorder, while cut points of 5, 10, 15, and 20 are interpreted as representing mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe levels of anxiety. The Chinese version has been validated.</description>

    <description>The ISSS aims to help participants acquire problem-solving (e.g., interpersonal problems) and time management based on the treatment manual of the therapy. Video introductions for each session and example teacher characters who depict the targeted problems and demonstrate implementation of coping/management techniques in a variety of situations. ISSS will use metaphors, daily examples, and lively narrative stories to enhance motivation for participation and understanding of the intervention contents. Session 2-5 will assign exercise and homework. Within 48 hours, participants will receive personalized written feedback (e.g., suggestions) from an e-Coach on the exercises they have completed. Participants can contact e-Coaches via the online system if they have any questions regarding the contents. Questions that beyond the contents will be referred to the health psychologist (PI) by e-Coaches.</description>
