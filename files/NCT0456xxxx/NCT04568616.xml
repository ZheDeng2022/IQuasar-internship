      This is a single-arm, open-label study testing the effects of neoadjuvant therapy with the&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitor letrozole in post-menopausal women with Stage I-III ER+, HER2- breast&#xD;
      cancer. Eligible subjects will be treated with letrozole therapy for 4 to 12 weeks prior to&#xD;
      surgical resection of the tumor. Tumor specimens obtained at baseline (diagnostic biopsy) and&#xD;
      at surgery (surgical specimen) will be compared using molecular analyses. A subset of&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to provide an optional research tumor biopsy prior to treatment for&#xD;
      molecular analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 70% of breast cancers express estrogen receptor alpha (ER), which is activated&#xD;
      by estrogens and typically drives cancer cell growth. Adjuvant therapy with anti-estrogens&#xD;
      such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) is commonly used to inhibit ER to prevent&#xD;
      cancer (re)growth after early-stage breast tumors are surgically removed. However, ~33% of&#xD;
      such patients (~300,000 new cases per year worldwide) will eventually develop&#xD;
      anti-estrogen-resistant breast cancer that is metastatic or locally advanced; at this stage,&#xD;
      the disease is almost never cured using available therapies and is uniformly fatal.&#xD;
      Therefore, more effective treatment early in the course of disease (i.e., in the adjuvant&#xD;
      setting, shortly after surgical removal of a tumor) has huge potential to prevent cancer&#xD;
      regrowth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most often, ER+ breast cancers re-emerge in the years after the end of the standard five-year&#xD;
      anti-estrogen treatment regimen (called 'late recurrence'). Recent data indicate that&#xD;
      continued anti-estrogen therapy in patients who remain &quot;disease-free&quot; after five years of&#xD;
      anti-estrogen therapy modestly prevents cancer recurrence. However, tumor cells are&#xD;
      detectable in bone marrow of patients who are &quot;disease-free.&quot; Thus, anti-estrogen therapy in&#xD;
      &quot;disease-free&quot; patients likely suppresses the growth of undetectable tumor cells, keeping&#xD;
      them in a &quot;clinically dormant&quot; state (i.e., undetectable by standard clinical methods).&#xD;
      Little is known about how such dormant cancer cells survive. This clinical study will help&#xD;
      identify the signaling pathways essential for the survival of clinically dormant ER+ breast&#xD;
      cancer cells to enable the development of more effective therapies to eradicate such cells&#xD;
      and prevent cancer recurrence.&#xD;

    <description>Determine the proportion of subjects who experience clinical response, defined as a â‰¥50% decrease in the longest dimension of the primary tumor. The longest dimension(s) of the primary tumor(s) will be measured from radiological images acquired as per standard of care before (up to 4 wk prior to) neoadjuvant letrozole treatment, and after neoadjuvant letrozole treatment (prior to surgery).
