      face-to-face consultation for patients with obstructive sleep apnea on patients' CPAP use&#xD;
      (minutes/per night), self-efficacy, risk outcomes, outcome expectancies, experiences with&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of video consultation versus&#xD;
      face-to-face consultation for patients with obstructive sleep apnea on patients' CPAP use&#xD;
      (minutes/per night), self-efficacy, risk outcomes, outcome expectancies, experiences with&#xD;
      technology and, patients' and nurses' satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a non-blinded randomized controlled trial with an intervention group (video&#xD;
      consultations) and a usual care group (face-to-face consultations), with assessements after&#xD;
      1, 2, 3, 4, 12 and 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were recruited from a large teaching hospital (Rijnstate, hospital), and included&#xD;
      from January 2, 2019 until June 26, 2019.In total, 140 patients were randomized, (1:1&#xD;
      allocation).&#xD;

    <description>The first video consultation with a nurse was planned one week after start with CPAP. Three focus points were discussed during the consultations: 1) adherence (&gt;6 hours per night); 2) rest AHI &lt; 5 (or &lt;10 if age &gt;70), and 3) (improvements in) complaints. If these objectives were achieved after one week, a new consultation was planned three weeks later (four weeks after start). As long as these objectives were not achieved, video consultations were planned weekly (until after four weeks).</description>
