  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to pilot test the effect of reducing time to spaced-out&#xD;
      appointments from 18 to 6 months for newly-diagnosed people living with HIV (PLWH) in Rwanda&#xD;
      who have initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART). PLWH are currently required to visit the&#xD;
      health center monthly for ART and clinical appointments for the first 18 months on ART, after&#xD;
      which they can attend quarterly. Reducing the time to spaced-out appointments from 18 to 6&#xD;
      months has the potential to reduce the burden on patients and the health system, but may lead&#xD;
      to suboptimal treatment outcomes. To better understand the effects of early spaced-out&#xD;
      appointments as well as the degree of viral load monitoring needed to determine stability on&#xD;
      ART, the investigators will conduct a 3-arm pilot intervention study. The investigators will&#xD;
      randomize participants to 1) 6-month advancement to spaced-out appointments after 1 viral&#xD;
      load measurement; 2) 6-month advancement to spaced-out appointments after 2 viral load&#xD;
      measurements; or 3) usual care. The investigators will compare the study arms with respect to&#xD;
      viral suppression at 12 months after enrollment in ART care (primary outcome) and&#xD;
      appointment/ pharmacy adherence (secondary outcome).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most countries in sub-Saharan Africa have adopted differentiated care models for people&#xD;
      living with HIV (PLWH), including Rwanda. Current Rwandan HIV guidelines classify&#xD;
      newly-diagnosed PLWH as &quot;unstable&quot;, requiring monthly visits to the health facility. Before&#xD;
      they can advance to being &quot;stable&quot; patients, with spaced-out appointments that allow them to&#xD;
      visit the health facility every three months, they must be on antiretroviral therapy (ART)&#xD;
      for 18 months and virally suppressed on two consecutive measurements. Patients face multiple&#xD;
      barriers to attending frequent appointments including structural issues (such as distance to&#xD;
      the health facility, transportation cost, long waiting times) and facing stigma while&#xD;
      traveling to and while at the health facility. Reducing the time newly-diagnosed PLWH spend&#xD;
      in the &quot;unstable&quot; category could potentially decrease the burden on patients and the health&#xD;
      facility and potentially decrease the costs of frequent appointments. The investigators&#xD;
      therefore propose a pilot study to examine the effect of reducing the time from ART&#xD;
      initiation to advancement to the &quot;stable&quot; category from 18 to 6 months. The investigators&#xD;
      will enroll 90 patients: 30 will be randomized to 6-month advancement to spaced out&#xD;
      appointments after 1 viral load is measured (at 5 months after enrollment in ART care)&#xD;
      (&quot;Early 1&quot;); 30 will be randomized to 6-month advancement to spaced-out appointments after 2&#xD;
      viral loads are measured (at 3- and 5-months after enrollment in ART care) (&quot;Early 2&quot;); and&#xD;
      30 will be randomized to continue in usual care with monthly visits (&quot;Usual care&quot;). The&#xD;
      investigators will compare study arms with respect to viral suppression at 12 months (primary&#xD;
      outcome) and appointment/pharmacy adherence (secondary outcome). The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that reducing the time to the &quot;stable&quot; category with spaced out appointments will&#xD;
      be feasible, acceptable, not inferior to 18 months with respect to viral suppression or&#xD;
      adherence, and will be cost-effective.&#xD;

    <description>Repeated measures analysis of participant quality of life as measured by the EuroQOL-5 Dimension-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L). The EQ-5D-5L is a 5-level scale that measures self-rated problems (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems) in 5 domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) as well as self-rated health. Each domain is scored from 1 (no problems) to 5 (extreme problems); the overall health state is described by a 5-digit number defined by combining one level from each dimension, ranging from 11111 (full health) to 55555 (worst health).</description>

    <description>Repeated measures analysis of participant satisfaction with health care received as measured by scales developed by Lannes, et al. and Parcescepe, et al. The Lannes scale is a 5-level scale (very satisfied, satisfied, no opinion, not satisfied, very unsatisfied) that asks participants to describe satisfaction with several elements of receiving health care. The Parcescepe, et al scale is a 2-level scale (agree, disagree) that asks participants to agree or disagree with various aspects of care received at the health center.</description>

    <description>Repeated measures analysis of enacted stigma in community and health care settings as measured by the HIV/AIDS Stigma Instrument-PLWA (HASI-P) Scale. The HASI-P is a 33-item scale that contains questions in 6 different stigma-related domains or factors. For each item, participants are asked to describe the frequency of experienced stigmatizing events in the past 3 months on a 4-point Likert scale (0- Never, 1- Once or twice, 2- Several times, or 3- Most of the time). The instrument is scored by summing the scores (0-3) for each item and then dividing by the number of items within each factor. Higher scores are interpreted as reflecting greater levels of received or associated stigma.</description>

    <description>Repeated measures analysis of internalized, anticipated and enacted stigma as measured by an adapted version of the HIV stigma scale. Items are rated on 5-point Likert-type scales (Internalized: ranging from Strongly Disagree [1] to Strongly Agree [5]; Anticipated: ranging from Very Unlikely [1] to Very Likely [5]; Enacted: ranging from Never [1] to Very Often [5]) with higher scores indicating greater stigma. Items are averaged to create composite scores, subdivided by type of stigma (internalized, anticipated or enacted).</description>
