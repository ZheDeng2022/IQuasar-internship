      The study will (1) assess feasibility of a TMS treatment in an underserved population; (2)&#xD;
      determine if this TMS treatment protocol improves PTSD symptoms and biological markers of&#xD;
      PTSD such as brain functioning and startle responses; (3) define new brain targets for future&#xD;
      TMS studies; (4) provide the first data for individual differences, which will help&#xD;
      personalize treatment for PTSD patients; (5) improve knowledge of the neurobiology of PTSD&#xD;
      and treatment response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder is a psychiatric disorder that can develop in response to a&#xD;
      traumatic event, and half of civilians living in inner-city areas with high levels of&#xD;
      violence suffer from PTSD. The currently recommended treatment for PTSD is focused on&#xD;
      discussing the trauma, but a third to half of patients cannot participate or do not benefit&#xD;
      from this treatment, especially individuals with low levels of education or literacy.&#xD;
      Therefore, new treatments for PTSD are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
