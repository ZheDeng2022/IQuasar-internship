  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to explore the feasibility, acceptability and&#xD;
      potential effects of the online MBCR program in gynecological cancer settings. This will&#xD;
      provide preliminary efficacy data in prevision of a larger, confirmatory, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. As this study will be one of the first led in a French speaking country and&#xD;
      the first conducted in a university hospital environment in Switzerland, the investigators&#xD;
      would like to investigate the early implementation of this program among professionals and&#xD;
      patients. Furthermore, they will investigate if in the online MBCR group, participants will&#xD;
      show improvement in psychosocial outcomes, consumption of psychotropic and opioid medication,&#xD;
      spirituality and meaning in life and in different biological processes.&#xD;

    <description>Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) is a standardized group program which focuses primarily on the challenges faced by people living with cancer. It is an 8-week program consisting of weekly group meetings of 1.5 to 2 hours. Home practice of 45 minutes per day (15 min yoga; 30 min meditation) is prescribed. As the weeks progress, different forms of meditation are introduced, beginning with a body scan sensory awareness experience, progressing to sitting and walking meditations. Gentle Hatha yoga is incorporated throughout, as a form of moving meditation. Didactic instruction as well as group discussion and reflection, problem solving and skillful inquiry are commonly applied teaching tools.</description>
