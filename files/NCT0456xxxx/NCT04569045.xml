      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of pain relief of modified&#xD;
      sodium hyaluronate gel for injection when used for the correction of moderate or severe&#xD;
      nasolabial folds.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      One hundred and thirty patients were enrolled and there two sides of nasolabial folds (NLF)&#xD;
      were randomized to receive HA with lidocaine or HA. The primary outcome was immediate visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS) of pain evaluated after injection for both NLF sides. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      including VAS pain, wrinkle severity rating scale (WSRS), global aesthetic improvement scale&#xD;
      (GAIS) and AE were observed at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 follow-ups.&#xD;
