  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be designed as a prospective clinical trial. Patients scheduled for lower limb&#xD;
      arterial bypass surgery will be randomly allocated for treatment with spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      associated with spontaneous ventilation (nasal cannula with supplemental oxygen - Group 1) or&#xD;
      treatment with general anesthesia under controlled mechanical ventilation (tidal volume 6 to&#xD;
      8 ml / kg of the predicted body weight and PEEP of 5 cmH2O - Group 2).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective and randomized study, only adult ASA II to IV patients, aged over 18&#xD;
      years, scheduled to undergo lower limb arterial revascularization surgery at the Hospital de&#xD;
      Clínicas in Porto Alegre and at the Hospital Nossa Senhora da Conceição will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be designed as a prospective clinical trial. Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated for treatment with spinal neuraxial anesthesia associated with spontaneous&#xD;
      ventilation (nasal glasses with supplemental oxygen - Group 1) or treatment with general&#xD;
      anesthesia under controlled mechanical ventilation (tidal volume from 6 to 8 ml / kg of the&#xD;
      assumed weight and PEEP of 5 cmH2O - Group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling will be carried out for convenience, including patients routinely seen in the&#xD;
      operating room of the hospitals involved and who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria of&#xD;
      this study. The allocation of patients will be performed through a table of random numbers&#xD;
      generated prior to the beginning of the protocol. The process of randomization of patients in&#xD;
      the groups will be carried out using random blocks. The method for blinding the study will be&#xD;
      carried out using sealed envelopes and will include the blinding of the researchers,&#xD;
      evaluators and those responsible for statistical analysis, but will not include the blinding&#xD;
      of the attending physician and the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be stored in Excel and analyzed statistically using STATA 12.0 software. The&#xD;
      statistical approach will be carried out through the &quot;intention-to-treat&quot; model. The&#xD;
      assessment of ventilatory and hemodynamic parameters between the groups will be performed&#xD;
      using ANOVA associated with Bonferroni for parametric data or the Kruskal-Wallis test&#xD;
      associated with the Mann-Whitney test for nonparametric data. For categorical variables, we&#xD;
      will use Fisher's exact test or Chi-square test. Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to&#xD;
      assess outcomes between treatment groups over the follow-up period. In order to control&#xD;
      important variables, such as surgical time, surgical complications, age, body mass index, and&#xD;
      ASA classification (comorbidities), a statistical approach to assess confounding factors&#xD;
      (linear regression model) will be performed after the period data collection. Results will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant when type I (P) error is less than 0.05.&#xD;
