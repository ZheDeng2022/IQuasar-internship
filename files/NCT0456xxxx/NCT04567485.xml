  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The target rate for outpatient surgery has been set by the Ministry of Health at 70% for&#xD;
      2020. To achieve this objective, this requires increasing the panel of eligible outpatient&#xD;
      procedures to more mutilating surgeries and usually performed in conventional&#xD;
      hospitalization. This switch from conventional hospitalization to an outpatient stay&#xD;
      increases the risk of converting stays into unscheduled hospitalization. Postoperative pain&#xD;
      is one of the main factors in converting outpatient stays. Poor control is associated with&#xD;
      increased length of stay, and unscheduled consultations and readmissions. In addition, the&#xD;
      increased time spent with severe pain during the first 24 hours postoperatively is a risk&#xD;
      factor for chronicization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proctology, and, in particular, hemorrhoidal surgery is the perfect example. Outpatient&#xD;
      management of open pedicle hemorrhoidectomy is increasing year by year, but the rate of&#xD;
      conversion to unscheduled hospitalizations remains high. Urine retention, postoperative&#xD;
      hemorrhage and poor pain control are the main causes. Within the Paris Saint Joseph Hospital&#xD;
      Group, hemorrhoidal surgery has the highest rate of conversions from hospitalization to&#xD;
      proctology (8% in 2019), despite the implementation since 2015 of a dedicated, developed&#xD;
      according to the current recommendations of the SNFCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain after hemorrhoidal surgery is always severe in the absence of analgesics and appears&#xD;
      upon arrival in the post-interventional monitoring room (SSPI). Despite the administration of&#xD;
      analgesics or the implementation of locoregional analgesia techniques (pudendal block),&#xD;
      moderate to severe pain is frequently observed in the post-intervention monitoring room. In&#xD;
      the medical literature, there is little data evaluating the means of management of&#xD;
      postoperative pain in this surgery, and even less the effect of the different associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospectively and, from the data collected in our information systems, we wish to assess&#xD;
      the impact on the length of stay of the presence of moderate to severe pain in the IPSS after&#xD;
      a two-way or tri-pedicle hemorrhoidal surgery open on our cohort of patients operated in&#xD;
      outpatient surgery. Our hypothesis is that the presence of moderate to severe pain in PPSS&#xD;
      increases the total length of stay, placing the patient at an increased risk of conversion.&#xD;
      The purpose of our study is also to identify predictive factors (aggravating or protective)&#xD;
      of the onset of moderate to severe pain immediately after surgery, in order to establish a&#xD;
      strategy to limit its frequency.&#xD;
