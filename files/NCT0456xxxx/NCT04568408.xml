      Introduction: Polysomnography (PSG) is currently the accepted Gold Standard for sleep studies&#xD;
      as it measures multiple variables that lead to a clear diagnosis of any sleep disorder.&#xD;
      However, it has some clear drawbacks as it can only be performed by qualified technicians,&#xD;
      has a high cost and complexity and is very invasive. In the last years, Actigraphy has been&#xD;
      used along with PSG for sleep studies. In this study, the investigators intend to assess the&#xD;
      capability of the new Xiaomi Mi Band 5 to be used as a sleep self-assessment tool for&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Determine whether sleep stages recorded by the new Xiaomi Mi Band 5 can&#xD;
      effectively replace PSG sleep stages classification in patients that undergo a sleep study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: the study will be carried out with patients in a hospital from A Coruña&#xD;
      (Galicia, Spain) that are &gt; 18 years old. Patients who are performed a polysomnography test&#xD;
      will be given the wearables so the investigators can record sleep stages with both techniques&#xD;
      in order to compare both recordings afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational, analytic and longitudinal study. In other words, in this study&#xD;
      different variables from the population of interest will be observed and recorded without any&#xD;
      direct intervention, so as to establish causality associations between these variables. It is&#xD;
      considered as longitudinal since a six-months tracking of the variables will be performed,&#xD;
      continually (and sometimes occasionally) recording and monitoring sleep quality (wearable&#xD;
      wristbands).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained from PSG and Xiaomi Mi Band 5 will be preprocessed and explored before&#xD;
      extracting the features of interest for the study. Then, Paired sample T-Test will be&#xD;
      performed to compare the means among the different variables, Bland-Altman plots will be used&#xD;
      to assess the concordance between both techniques and, finally, Epoch by Epoch analysis will&#xD;
      be performed to compare the classification of the sleep stages carried out by both PSG and&#xD;
      Xiaomi.&#xD;

      Introduction: Sleep disorders are becoming a widespread health problem within the general&#xD;
      population. Beyond the tiredness itself, these disorders have been found to be related to&#xD;
      physical and mental issues like cardiovascular pathologies, obesity, depression and anxiety.&#xD;
      This makes clear the necessity of achieving a quality rest to prevent potential chronic&#xD;
      diseases. On this issue, Polysomnography (PSG) is currently the accepted Gold Standard for&#xD;
      sleep studies as it measures multiple variables that lead to a clear diagnosis of any sleep&#xD;
      disorder. However, it has some clear drawbacks as it can only be performed by qualified&#xD;
      technicians, has a high cost and complexity and is very invasive. In the last years, several&#xD;
      studies that focus on validating wearable devices as useful sleep trackers have emerged. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators intend to assess the capability of the new Xiaomi Mi Band 5 to&#xD;
      be used as a tool for sleep self-assessment for patients. The interest in studying this&#xD;
      smartband is due to its low price and acceptance among the population. If this device proves&#xD;
      to be a good sleep tracker, it would allow the population to assess their own sleep and&#xD;
      consider if they need to visit their medical practitioner, which would improve the prognosis&#xD;
      of any underlying condition they may be developing derived from their restlessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Determine whether sleep stages recorded by the new Xiaomi Mi Band 5 can&#xD;
      effectively replace PSG sleep stages classification in patients that undergo a sleep study.&#xD;
      The following features will be calculated for both devices: total sleep time, sleep&#xD;
      efficiency, sleep latency and wake after sleep onset. Sleep stages will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: the study will be carried out with patients in a hospital from A Coruña&#xD;
      (Galicia, Spain) that are &gt; 18 years old. Patients who are performed a polysomnography test&#xD;
      will be given the wearables so the investigators can record sleep stages with both techniques&#xD;
      in order to compare both recordings afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational, analytic and longitudinal study. In other words, in this study&#xD;
      different variables from the population of interest will be observed and recorded without any&#xD;
      direct intervention, so as to establish causality associations between these variables. It is&#xD;
      considered as longitudinal since a six-months tracking of the variables will be performed,&#xD;
