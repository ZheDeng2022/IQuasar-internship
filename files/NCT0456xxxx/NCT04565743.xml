  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study on the effects of education on secondary fracture prevention in primary&#xD;
      health care centers (PHCC) and referral from hospitals to these PHCC of patients with recent&#xD;
      fragility fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is Cluster-randomized controlled study with two arms. 40 primary health care&#xD;
      centers (PHCC) are included, each PHCC constitutes a cluster. The intervention group contains&#xD;
      20 PHCCs and the control group of the remaining 20 PHCCs. The educational part of the&#xD;
      intervention is divided into three sessions; one web based course succeeded by two&#xD;
      multiprofessional seminars with six months interval. During the intervention period patients&#xD;
      enlisted at the intervention PHCCs, aged 60 or more who are diagnosed on a fragility fracture&#xD;
      are referred to their respective PHCC. The primary outcome are the proportions of patients&#xD;
      who receive bone specific treatment after their fracture in the intervention group compared&#xD;
      to the control group.&#xD;

      Fragility fractures are in this study defined as a fracture of the spine, hip, pelvis,&#xD;
      proximal humerus och distal radius caused by low energy trauma. A trauma not exceeding the&#xD;
      force implied on the body from a fall from standing height on a flat surface, is regarded to&#xD;
      be a low energy trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The educational intervention targets general practitioners and nurses from the PHCC as well&#xD;
      as physiotherapists, occupational therapists and dietitians from a nearby rehabilitation&#xD;
      centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All professions go through the same web course before educational session #1 which is held at&#xD;
      the PHCC. The web course includes basic knowledge about risk factors for fragility fractures&#xD;
&#xD;
      At session #1 all professions first participate in a common seminar of 45 minutes. After that&#xD;
      physicians, nurses and rehabilitation related professions each have an additional seminar of&#xD;
      45 minutes, that means three separate seminars. Three teachers lead the seminars; a&#xD;
      specialist in family medicine, a nurse specialized in primary care and a physiotherapist.&#xD;
      They are all present during all of the seminars at each PHCC and the same three individuals&#xD;
      leads the seminars at all PHCCs. The seminars focus on identification of persons at high risk&#xD;
      of fracture and different methods to lower that risk. The importance of multiprofessional&#xD;
      care for these patients is stressed. The participants are given opportunity to discuss how&#xD;
      they might facilitate cooperation between the different health vare professions. Development&#xD;
      of local routines for multiprofessional care is encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational session #2 is held approximally 6 months after session #1. Session #2 invites the&#xD;
      same health care professionals as session #1. There are three parts. A first part of 45&#xD;
      minutes for the physicians and nurses. A second part of 45 minutes where personnel from the&#xD;
      rehabilitation center joins. The third part of 45 minutes incudes just the rehabilitation&#xD;
      personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At session #2 includes a short review of the contents discussed in session #1. The focus&#xD;
      however is on the development of new local routines to secure the ability for patients with a&#xD;
      high risk of fracture to be offered multiprofessional care. What needs to be done and who&#xD;
      does what at your PHCC/rehabilitation center? The participants also get feedback on the&#xD;
      number of patients being treated with bone-specific drugs before and after the start of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of patients stops at december 1 2020. Referrals to the PHCC of the patients&#xD;
      included last will be conducted during January 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome data is gathered at each PHCC from the medical journals of the enlisted&#xD;
      patients aged &gt;60 with fragility fractures. Data includes the time frame one year before&#xD;
      start of study, until two years after the last patient was incuded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes, fractures and fall related injuries will be collected from National&#xD;
      health care registers, three and five years after the last patient was included.&#xD;
