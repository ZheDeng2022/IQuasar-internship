      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate pinch strength improvements and&#xD;
      improvements in coordination and functional ability. Pinch strength measurements are made on&#xD;
      subjects both with and without the device to evaluate the potential improvements. Also,&#xD;
      coordination and functional testing is performed both with and without the device to compare&#xD;
      performance under both conditions and evaluate potential improvement.&#xD;

      This study tests the powered hand orthosis device on a small number of participants (up to&#xD;
      6). Research participants with neuromusculoskeletal impairments were recruited for the study&#xD;
      and consented with an approved protocol. The study was conducted during 1 visit to LTI in&#xD;
      Holliston, MA . The study consists of several assessments. Participants are surveyed for&#xD;
      cognitive limitations and self-assessment of difficulties in completing tasks of daily living&#xD;
      by completing surveys such as the Quickdash Questionnaire [1], the Mini-Mental State test&#xD;
      [2], and the McGann Feedback form [3]. Pinch strength without and with the powered orthosis&#xD;
      is evaluated. A selection of functional outcome measures are performed such as the&#xD;
      Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP) [4], the Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHP) [5], and the&#xD;
      Box and Blocks Test (BBT) [6].&#xD;
