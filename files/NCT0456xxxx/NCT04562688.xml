  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a validation study to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and impact of CICADAS&#xD;
      (Care Improving Cognition for ADolescents on the Autism Spectrum), a clinician-assisted,&#xD;
      digital application that aims to prime the brain to engage in flexible, adaptive long-term&#xD;
      learning about social-emotional events through closed-loop technology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will employ an innovative and evidence-based digital intervention that includes&#xD;
      ten digital assessments (CICADAS app) that will capture data on sensory processing&#xD;
      abnormalities and associated cognitive deficits. We will leverage pilot data collected in&#xD;
      adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and accumulate preliminary evidence for&#xD;
      CICADAS app to function as 1) a stand-alone treatment; 2) a primer for PEERS (Program for the&#xD;
      Education and Enrichment of Relationship Skills); 3) an enhancer for PEERS. This study will&#xD;
      test CICADAS app in adolescents with ASD in a three-arm, active-controlled randomized&#xD;
      crossover trial to document the acceptability and evaluate its potential as a stand-alone&#xD;
      treatment, as a primer for PEERS, or as a treatment enhancer of PEERS.&#xD;

    <description>Participants assigned to Arm A will engage in CICADAS app only for the first 16 weeks of the intervention period. After the completion of the first intervention period and the mid-intervention assessment (V3) visit, these participants will then be assigned to the PEERS only group for the second 16 weeks of the intervention period. Participants will be asked to attend weekly 1-hour group sessions led by a PEERS clinician.</description>

After the completion of the first intervention period and the mid-intervention assessment (V3) visit, these participants will then be assigned to No-Contact (no active intervention) for the second 16 weeks of the intervention period.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete sensory processing assessments and neuroplasticity-based social cognitive training (NB-SCT) exercises on a digital device for a total of 40 hours. The CICADAS app captures user-specific sensory processing abnormalities (SPA) through 10 brief computerized assessments. The data from these assessments guide and personalize the delivery of 10 NB-SCT exercises. After 16 weeks, participants will then crossover to PEERS, participants will be asked to attend weekly 1-hour group sessions led by a PEERS clinician. Each PEERS group session will consist of a minimum of 3 participants and will meet as a group using Zoom. PEERS teaches how to solve real-life social dilemmas, appraise affect and social contexts, and initiate and maintain conversations while receiving feedback from peers and clinicians.</description>
