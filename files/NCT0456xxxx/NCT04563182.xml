      Background Balance and jumping mechanisms are important to prevent injuries in sports such as&#xD;
      handball, which require immediately change of direction, jumping and landing strategy. Strong&#xD;
      proximal stability is required for accurate jump performance and stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To investigate the relationship between gluteus medius strength and static, dynamic&#xD;
      balance, horizontal and vertical jump performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Prospective field trial study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Elite women handball players in Turkish Handball Super League. Patients (or&#xD;
      Participants): Forty-two elite women handball players from Turkish Handball Super League were&#xD;
      included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions (or assessment of risk factors) The Lafayette Hand-Held Dynamometer was used to&#xD;
      determine the strength of the gluteus medius. Single leg hop (SLH) test was used for&#xD;
      horizontal jump and Lafayette Vertimetric device was used for vertical jump (VJ) evaluation.&#xD;
      Y Balance Test (YBT) was used for the dynamic balance with direction of anterior,&#xD;
      posteriomedial, posteriolateral and Standing Stork Test (SST) with eyes closed for the&#xD;
      measurement of static balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measurements Gluteus medius strength with hand dynamometer compared with YBT,&#xD;
      SST, VJ and SLH tests.&#xD;
