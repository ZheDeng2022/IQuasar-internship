  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      a prospective, single center, observational clinical trail. Aim to to compare the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of the Bioabsorbable scaffold (BRS) Neovas BRS and Drug-coating balloon (DCB) in&#xD;
      the treatment of STEMI patients with coronary artery disease and to further evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of the two new interventional methods in STEMI intervention, so as&#xD;
      to better guide clinical practice.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      1. To study the advantages and disadvantages of Neovas BRS and DCB in interventional&#xD;
           treatment of de novo lesions in STEMI patients, in order to better guide the clinical.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the safety of Neovas BRS in interventional treatment of ide novo lesions in&#xD;
           STEMI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore the safety of DCB in interventional treatment of de novo lesions in STEMI&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;

    <description>All STEMI patients were predilated (including predilated balloon or cutting balloon) before randomization. Thrombus aspiration was determined by the surgeon according to the specific situation.&#xD;
Sufficient predilation criteria: the following two conditions must be met: A. residual stenosis &lt; 30%; B. no flow limiting dissection or TIMI grade 2-3.</description>
