  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop novel optical imaging technologies for use as a non-destructive and minimally&#xD;
      invasive tool for detection and diagnosis of various diseases that affect the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal system.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have previously developed optical imaging systems that have been able to&#xD;
      provide highly detailed images of tissue structures in multiple application areas including&#xD;
      Cardiology, Gastroenterology, and Pulmonology. They are looking to continue the advancement&#xD;
      of these various technologies under development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population will include subjects who are undergoing elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy&#xD;
      with biopsy, colonoscopy with biopsy, and/or endo-mucosal resection.The endoscopist will take&#xD;
      no more than 3 biopsies in addition to the standard of care biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be optical imaging of the ex vivo GI specimens that are being collected.&#xD;
      Specimens will be collected for research purposes only. Offline analysis of the samples will&#xD;
      be performed, and optical imaging findings will be correlated with the pathology findings.&#xD;
      This will require review of the medical record to link the findings of the imaging with the&#xD;
      pertinent medical information. Samples will be de-identified and subjects will be assigned a&#xD;
      unique number. The tissues will be placed in marked containers labeled &quot;for research purposes&#xD;
      only&quot;. The samples collected will be brought to the Tearney Research Laboratory for imaging&#xD;
      and processing. The Optical imaging of the tissue samples will not affect the standard of&#xD;
      care procedure.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Imaging data is collected during the procedure, and analyzed within 1 year of collection.</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility will be determined by at least one of the following parameters: 1) assessing image adequacy (resolution, contrast, etc.) qualitatively, 2) confirming that microscopic features observed in the images are also seen by correlative histopathology, 3) ability to develop preliminary criteria or algorithms based on image-histopathology matches.</description>

    <description>Consented participants will allow their endoscopist to collect 3 additional biopsies from the participants. These biopsies will be used to develop our imaging techniques at our lab. We will use the standard of care histology images from the endoscopy procedure as a control comparison.</description>
