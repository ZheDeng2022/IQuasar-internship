  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hamstring muscle injuries (HMI) occurs frequently during excessive motions of the physiologic&#xD;
      capability of these muscles. It is reported in the literature that impairments in muscle&#xD;
      architecture, such as a decrease in the eccentric strength of the hamstring muscles of the&#xD;
      knee (lengthening and contraction of the muscle), delay in the reaction time of the hamstring&#xD;
      muscles, overactivity of the hamstring muscles, a decrease in the length of the hamstring&#xD;
      muscle fibers, and inadequate cognitive functions may lead to HMI. Preventive and therapeutic&#xD;
      exercises of HMI consist many different eccentric exercises, such as the Askling L-protocol&#xD;
      and particularly Nordic hamstring exercise, for increasing the hamstring flexibility.&#xD;
      However, it has been stated in recent studies that hamstring muscles should not be focused on&#xD;
      alone, and a holistic exercise intervention that includes and addresses the present risk&#xD;
      factors related to HMI is needed. Within our knowledge, the effect of a defined or improved&#xD;
      holistic exercise approach to prevent and/or treat HMI has not been studied in the&#xD;
      literature. Considering the risk factors underlying HMI, an exercise involving a holistic&#xD;
      approach is needed to prevent all the risk factors. Turkish Get Up (TGU) exercise is a kind&#xD;
      of cognitive exercise which activates all muscles and let to contract simultaneously during&#xD;
      standing up from the supine position and turning back in 7 stages. Since the exercise&#xD;
      originates from former Turkish athletes, it has been included in the literature as TGU.&#xD;
      Hence, the exercise originates from former Turkish athletes, it has called as TGU. TGU&#xD;
      exercise improves the effective and strong transition ability of the body while developing&#xD;
      the pattern of standing up from the lying position on the floor and turning back by&#xD;
      increasing condition/ endurance. Meanwhile, this exercise is a progressive coordinative and&#xD;
      cognitive exercise, it requires completing each step before the next movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of cognitive skills and neuroscience in the interpretation, prediction and&#xD;
      improvement of sports performance is getting popular in recent years. Previous researches&#xD;
      reported that athletes with reduced cognitive skills had lower sportive achievements. It has&#xD;
      also stated that the impairment in cognitive skills tend muscles to be injured. However, no&#xD;
      studies that investigate the effectiveness of cognitive function in preventing HMI have been&#xD;
      encountered. So, the present study will be the first study investigating effects of a special&#xD;
      exercise addressing cognitive function which is generally ignored in the treatment of HMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is aimed to figure out whether Turkish Get Up exercise or Supine sliding leg curls and&#xD;
      Nordic Hamstring exercises are more effective on hamstring muscle function, ınjury risk,&#xD;
      agility and cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy recreational people aged between 18-25 will assign to this study. The participants&#xD;
      will randomly be allocated four groups (Nordic protocol group, Supine sliding leg curls&#xD;
      group, Turkish Get Up (TGU) and control group). The exercise protocols will be applied two&#xD;
      days a week for 6 weeks, and the control group will receive no special exercise training.&#xD;
      Participants' hamstring muscle strengths will be evaluated with ISOMED 2000 isokinetic&#xD;
      dynamometer, the hamstring flexibility with digital inclinometer device, injury risk with&#xD;
      FMS™, agility with T-agility test, and the cognitive function with CNS Vital Signs in&#xD;
      computer environment at baseline and 6 weeks after interventions.&#xD;
