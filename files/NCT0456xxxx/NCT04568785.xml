  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza virus has high morbidity rates during annual epidemics, with certain high-risk&#xD;
      groups being particularly susceptible to complications and mortality. Vaccination is the main&#xD;
      prevention measure, alongside with hygiene measures. Nevertheless, vaccine coverage remains&#xD;
      low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies suggest that short, standardized interventions can improve coverage of several&#xD;
      vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Brief Intervention is an effective tool in improving vaccination coverage in&#xD;
      people who have initially rejected it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the effectiveness of a Brief Intervention in increasing influenza&#xD;
      vaccination (IIV) coverage compared with the usual advice in people who refuse it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: cluster randomized clinical trial. The study population was individuals with high&#xD;
      risk factors who initially refused the influenza vaccine. Professionals participants (doctors&#xD;
      and nurses) were assigned randomly to the intervention group (brief intervention) and the&#xD;
      control group (usual advice).&#xD;

      General objective: To determine the effectiveness of the use of BI for IIV compared to the&#xD;
      usual advice, in people who refuse to be vaccinated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the effectiveness of Brief Intervention compared to the usual advice in&#xD;
           different risk groups (&gt; 60 healthy, &gt; 60 years old with a Risk Factor [RF], &lt;60 years&#xD;
           old with RF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quantify influenza vaccine coverage in people with the most frequent RF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Record the patients' reasons for refusing to be vaccinated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD A cluster randomized controlled clinical trial. The reference population consisted of&#xD;
      patients assigned to and treated by urban and rural health centres in the centre of&#xD;
      Catalonia, an area with a population of approximately 405,000. 135,648 were the risk factor&#xD;
      population that could be vaccinated against influenza virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consisted of individuals with high risk factors who were treated in&#xD;
      healthcare centres during the 2017 influenza campaign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (CEI) of the Institut&#xD;
      Universitari d'Investigació en Atenció Primària (IDIAP Jordi Gol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants (doctors and nurses) decided voluntarily whether or not to participate and&#xD;
      they were randomly assigned to either the Intervention Group (IG) or the Control Group (CG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment of patients suitable to participate in the study was carried out during the&#xD;
      IIV campaign, as part of the health centre's routine activities. Patients with inclusion&#xD;
      criteria who came to see a doctor or nurse were invited to participate in the study. Those&#xD;
      who accepted participating signed an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consisted of a standardized Brief Intervention for the Influenza&#xD;
      Vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data was collected anonymously and confidentially via the electronic health record of&#xD;
      Catalonia [eCAP in Catalan]. The variables analysed for the two groups were: IIV at the end&#xD;
      of the 2017 vaccination campaign (yes/no), age, IIV risk factors and reasons for&#xD;
      non-vaccination.&#xD;
