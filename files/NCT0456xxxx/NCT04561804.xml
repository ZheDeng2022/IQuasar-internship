  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease resulting from excessive&#xD;
      fat accumulation in the liver. Due to its close association with obesity, it has become the&#xD;
      most common liver disease in children in the United States. NAFLD can result in progressive&#xD;
      fibrosis and lead to end-stage liver disease. Best practices in management of pediatric NAFLD&#xD;
      are not clearly defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to clarify the natural history of NAFLD in obese children after weight loss&#xD;
      surgery compare to lifestyle intervention. Our secondary aim is to investigate the added&#xD;
      value of elastography for the screening and diagnosis of NASH with fibrosis.&#xD;

      The study population will consist of obese adolescents, male and female, age 7-18, that will&#xD;
      go through weight loss reduction surgery (WLS) in the Obesity Clinic at Tel Aviv Sourasky&#xD;
      Medical Center. A control group matched for age and sex will consist of patients that will go&#xD;
      through conventional treatment (see below) at the Obesity Clinic in Dana Dwek Children's&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent form will be signed by the participant before enrollment Patient&#xD;
      Population Patients with a diagnosed primary liver disease (autoimmune liver disease,&#xD;
      metabolic liver disease, Wilson's disease, alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency), patients treated&#xD;
      with medications known to induce steatosis (such as valproate, amiodarone or prednisone), and&#xD;
      patients with hepatic virus infections or history of parenteral nutrition were excluded from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and measurements This clinical trial aims to asses the effect of bariatric&#xD;
      surgery and dietary intervention on hepatic fibrosis in obese pediatric population with NAFLD&#xD;
      (Clinical Trial Registration- MOH_2017-06-07_000470,&#xD;
      https://my.health.gov.il/CliniTrials/Pages/MOH_2017-06-07_000470.aspx). At the initial visit,&#xD;
      data were collected on socioeconomic parameters, lifestyle, birth details, and medical,&#xD;
      family, and social histories. All patients underwent anthropometric measures (height, weight&#xD;
      and BMI) and a physical examination focused on obesity-related conditions. Laboratory&#xD;
      evaluation included liver enzyme profile, lipid profile, glucose, insulin, and HbA1C. Liver&#xD;
      fibrosis was estimated by Shearwave elastography (Supersonic) and categorized into 4 levels,&#xD;
      F0-F4, according to liver stiffness (measured by kPa), as recently demonstrated elsewhere&#xD;
      [9]. Liver steatosis was calculated by a hepatorenal index (HRI) and divided into 3 levels of&#xD;
      severity. All measurements were taken by a single experienced radiologist (MW), who was&#xD;
      blinded to the results of other parameters of the patients. A multidisciplinary team included&#xD;
      a gastroenterologist, hepatologists, a registered dietitian (RD) and a psychologist. All&#xD;
      participants received nutritional recommendations (see below) and general recommendation for&#xD;
      a healthy lifestyle (regular engagement in daily physical activity and reduction of screen&#xD;
      time). Compliance with the dietary guideline was reviewed by a RD on a biweekly basis with a&#xD;
      3-day food questionnaire (2 weekdays and 1 day of the weekend). Blood tests and elastography&#xD;
      were repeated after 3 months of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of the BMI percentiles for age and gender was based on WHO growth charts.&#xD;
      &quot;Obesity&quot; was defined as a BMI &gt;95th percentile . Abnormal glucose metabolism included taking&#xD;
      a hypoglycemic medication or having an elevated homeostatic model assessment index of insulin&#xD;
      resistance, glucose, or HBA1c. Hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia were defined as&#xD;
      a serum level &gt;95 percentile for age and sex. Hypertension was diagnosed as systolic and/or&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure ≥95 percentile for age and sex. Patients with clinical suspicion of&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were diagnosed by polysomnography that was conducted by the&#xD;
      hospital's sleep specialists. Socioeconomic status was defined according to parents' years of&#xD;
      education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dietary intervention The participants received nutritional recommendations for a low&#xD;
      carbohydrate, low glycemic load, and isocaloric diet. The diet was composed of carbohydrates&#xD;
      (CHO;30-40%), fats (35-50%), and proteins (20-25%), and was tailored to individual&#xD;
      preferences and calorie requirements. The number of CHO, protein and fat servings was&#xD;
      determined based on the recommended total energy requirements for age, calculated on the&#xD;
      basis of dietary reference intake (DRI). Participants were not instructed to restrict&#xD;
      calories, but to reduce carbohydrate based on their glycemic load. High glycemic index (GI)&#xD;
      carbohydrate intake (refined grains, potatoes, sweet and salted snacks and sugar sweetened&#xD;
      beverages) was completely restricted, low GI carbohydrates (non-starchy vegetables, legumes,&#xD;
      nuts,) were allowed and some low /moderate GI carbohydrate were allowed but limited such as&#xD;
      fruits and whole grain bread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects were instructed about appropriate food choices, and each participant was&#xD;
      provided a diet information booklet containing food list, sample menus and recipes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses Descriptive statistics were examined for all variables. Continuous&#xD;
      variables were expressed as median with interquartile range (IQR) when they were not normally&#xD;
      distributed and as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for normally distributed variables.&#xD;
      Categorical variables were presented as number and percentage. Categorical variables were&#xD;
      compared by the McNamer test and continuous and ordinal variables by the Wilcoxon test. The&#xD;
      Fischer test was used when the McNamer test was not applicable for some variables. The&#xD;
      Pearson correlation and simple linear regression analysis were performed to examine bivariate&#xD;
      associations between fibrosis and metabolic and nutritional parameters. The Wilcoxon signed&#xD;
      rank test was applied to compare the difference between steatosis, fibrosis, and metabolic&#xD;
      parameters between the 2 time points (baseline and 3-month follow-up). A P level &lt;0.05 was&#xD;
      considered statistically significant. All statistical tests were 2-sided. The statistical&#xD;
      analysis was performed with SPSS (IBM SPSS statistics, version 22, IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA,&#xD;
      2013.).&#xD;
