  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized controlled clinical trial in patients who have undergone primary&#xD;
      unilateral total knee arthroplasty at Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital and Brigham and&#xD;
      Women's Hospital. Study subjects will receive either a shared decision aid (SDA) about pain&#xD;
      management or standard of care at the time of discharge. The impact of the SDA on the number&#xD;
      of leftover opioid pills on postoperative day 30 and average NRS pain score on postoperative&#xD;
      day 7 will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized controlled trial for primary, unilateral total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty (TKA) patients at Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital and Brigham and Women's&#xD;
      Hospital to determine the impact of using a SDA on the number of leftover opioid pills on&#xD;
      postoperative day 30 and average NRS pain score on postoperative day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SDA includes factual information about the World Health Organization pain ladder, the&#xD;
      0-10 NRS pain scale, pharmacologic pain management options, opioid medication benefits and&#xD;
      risks and predicted post-discharge opioid requirements based on previous modeling in TKA&#xD;
      patients. The SDA has been developed by the principal investigator solely for the purpose of&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled on postoperative day 0 or 1 and randomized to intervention or&#xD;
      control groups. The intervention group will view the SDA slides on the study iPad. SDA&#xD;
      viewing will be guided by the research assistant, who will read a pre-written script as each&#xD;
      slide is viewed. Following the guided viewing of the SDA, subjects in the intervention group&#xD;
      will have the opportunity to ask questions to the research assistant to confirm their&#xD;
      comprehension of the presented facts. The control group will receive no intervention and will&#xD;
      receive standard of care and standard discharge prescriptions. The intervention group&#xD;
      subjects will choose the number of opioid pills they wish to include in their discharge&#xD;
      opioid prescription (anywhere from 0 to the maximum allowable by law in Massachusetts i.e. no&#xD;
      more than 7 days of pills).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily analgesic intake, adverse effects and numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores will be&#xD;
      collected and analyzed.&#xD;
