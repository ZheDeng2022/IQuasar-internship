      A cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of placing GeneXpert Omni&#xD;
      platforms at primary health care clinics combined with rapid communication of results on time&#xD;
      to treatment initiation of microbiologically confirmed TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a setup period (survey of study centers) before randomization, the healthcare facilities&#xD;
      (=clinics) of 4 sites will be asked to provide information about the number of TB&#xD;
      notifications per quarter covering the period 1/2018-6/2020. From this information the&#xD;
      foreseeable number of examined patients (&quot;size of a clinic&quot;) will be derived, which will be&#xD;
      used as a strata variable in randomization process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facilities will be randomly allocated to the standard of care (control), or GeneXpert&#xD;
      OMNI/Ultra® (and MTB/XDR cartridges).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cluster refers to a clinic. The clusters will be assigned to intervention or control arm to&#xD;
      one of two diagnostic procedures (SOC [smear microscopy and/or Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra off-site]&#xD;
      vs Omni/Ultra on-site) following a restricted randomization strategy, whereby 6 to 8 strata&#xD;
      of clusters will be established using the stratification variables site (clinics belong to a&#xD;
      site) and size and apply balance criteria for them. The number of strata per site depends on&#xD;
      heterogeneity of the sizes of the clinics as established in setup period and may be&#xD;
      increased, typically 1 or 2 strata per site will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be compared in an individual level analysis with strata and&#xD;
      intervention as fixed effects and cluster as random effect.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The objective of the trial is to assess Omni/Ultra platform in routine use. The use of Omni/Ultra does not allow blinding of clinicians and participants in this trial. The trial-related procedures will be embedded into the routine practice at the primary-level facility. Data analysts will be blinded to intervention allocation.&#xD;
Randomisation takes place on a cluster level rather than for the individual patients to avoid contamination between the arms within a health facility. Since clinics will be relatively far apart, contamination is unlikely.</masking_description>

    <description>Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, a molecular diagnostic test developed by Cepheid, detects TB more accurately than microscopy and provides a result within 90 min. The diagnostic test is run on the GeneXpert platform. The GeneXpert® Omni is able to perform the same TB diagnostic test as the conventional GeneXpert but has been designed specifically to be located at primary health care facilities. It is smaller and easier to operate with an internal battery. There is no need for a computer or laptop, as it is operated by a mobile phone.</description>
