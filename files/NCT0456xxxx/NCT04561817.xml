    <textblock>
      This is a phase II open label, non-randomized, study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      Ipatasertib (GDC-0068) in combination with paclitaxel in platinum-resistant recurrent&#xD;
      epithelial ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine - the safety and objective response rate&#xD;
      of treatment with ipatasertib (GDC-0068) in combination with paclitaxel in platinum-resistant&#xD;
      recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer at week 12 for two cohorts of patients: with PI3K/AKT&#xD;
      mutations (altered) and without PI3K/AKT mutations (non-altered)&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 39 patients will participate in the study and the accrual will take place over a course&#xD;
      of 30 months Patients will be treated until disease progression and followed for 1 year&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two drugs are ipatasertib and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ipatasertib will be given 400mg PO daily: day 1-21 of 28 day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paclitaxel will be given 80mg/m2 IV weekly: day 1, 8, 15 of 28 day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that the combination of Ipatasertib (GDC-0068) plus paclitaxel will&#xD;
      safely induce a tumor response and increase the objective response rate in patients with&#xD;
      platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, with or without PI3K/AKT mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will enroll patients with platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer.&#xD;
      Given the relatively poor prognosis and limited treatment options for these patients, this&#xD;
      population is considered appropriate for trials of novel therapeutic candidates. The&#xD;
      benefit-risk ratio for ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel is expected to be&#xD;
      acceptable in this setting.&#xD;
