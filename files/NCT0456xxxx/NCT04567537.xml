  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators seek to evaluate the effects of a laser treatment on the&#xD;
      redistribution/regeneration of collagen on the clinical, microscopic, and molecular profiles&#xD;
      of hypertrophic scars and scleroderma.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of laser treatment for the improvement of the&#xD;
      clinical appearance of disorders of collagen metabolism, including hypertrophic scars and&#xD;
      scleroderma. The investigators will be performing a randomized-controlled split-lesion study,&#xD;
      where each patient will act as his or her own control. One half or side of the lesion will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive laser treatment only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to have 20 patients (10 patients with hypertrophic scars and 10&#xD;
      patients with scleroderma) complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must be equal to greater than 18 years old, but may be any gender or Fitzpatrick&#xD;
      skin type. They must have one of the following: at least one extragenital hypertrophic scar,&#xD;
      or at least one extragenital area of scleroderma . Subjects must not have received any&#xD;
      prescription or in-clinic medications or treatments, such as intralesional corticosteroids or&#xD;
      excision, on the eligible scars/scleroderma in the previous 3 months. Those on&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive medications will also be excluded.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Clinically significant abnormal findings or conditions which might, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the Investigator, interfere with study evaluations or pose a risk to subject safety&#xD;
             during the study.&#xD;
