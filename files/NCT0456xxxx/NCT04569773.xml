      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the factors that influence decision-making&#xD;
      before surgery (distress about cancer and/or reproductive concerns) and the possibility of&#xD;
      regret after surgery.&#xD;

    <description>The IES-R is a validated 22-item self-report scale measuring psychological stress reactions after a major life or traumatic event.1-3Items are rated with reference to the past 7 days on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 to 4. Three subscale scores are calculated by taking the mean of the item responses: Intrustion (8 items), Avoidance (8 items), and Hyperarousal (6 items). The total score is similarly computed by taking the mean of all 22 items. All scores range from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating higher event-related distress. Internal consistency estimates(Cronbach's alpha) for all scores range between 0.79 to 0.92.</description>

    <description>The RCS is a 14-item, 5-point Likert-type self-report measure that assesses concern among cancer survivors whose reproductive ability may have been impaired or lost due to disease and/or treatment. Answers are rated on a 5-point scale (0 to 4), and a single total score is produced by summing responses to all 14 items (range, 0-56 points). A higher score represents more reproductive concerns, and a lower score represents fewer reproductive concerns. In the RCS validation study, internal consistency reliability was 0.91 among long-term female cancer survivors and 0.81 among control women.</description>

    <description>The DRS is a 5-item, 5-point Likert-type self-report measure that assesses distress or remorse after a health-care decision.5 Items are rated on a scale from 1 (&quot;strongly agree&quot;) to 5 (&quot;strongly disagree&quot;). Two of the statements (items 2 and 4) are phrased in the negative direction.&#xD;
A single, total score is produced by first reversing the scores of the 2 negatively phrased items, then taking the mean of the 5 items. This mean is then rescaled to range from 0 to 100 by subtracting 1, then multiplying by 25. A score of 0 indicates no regret, whereas a score of 100 indicates high regret. Internal consistency reliability coefficients for the DRS range from 0.81 to 0.92.</description>

        Patients will be recruited from the Gynecology Service, Department of Surgery, at MSK. All&#xD;
        women undergoing surgery for endometrial cancer without clear preoperative suspicion for&#xD;
        advanced-stage disease will be screened for participation in this study. No selectivity&#xD;
        will be exercised by the investigators to minimize bias. The specific type of surgery for&#xD;
        each patient, as well as its timing, will be determined by the treating gynecological&#xD;
        surgeon.&#xD;
