  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to confirm the relevance of PET using [68Ga]Ga -PentixaFor ligand, in&#xD;
      comparison with FDG, for initial staging and therapeutic evaluation of symptomatic multiple&#xD;
      myeloma patients in first line treatment. The prognostic value of positive CXCR4 expression&#xD;
      will also be assessed and [68Ga]Ga -PentixaFor/FDG discordances explored.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the sensitivity of [68Ga]Ga-PentixaFor-PET to detect Multiple Myeloma (MM) lesions [Bone marrow (BM) lesions and/or extra-medullary disease (EMD) ] at the time of initial diagnosis.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity will be assessed by patient and lesion analysis by defining:&#xD;
True positive (TP):&#xD;
lesion positive with [68Ga]Ga-PentixaFor-PET and positive by FDG-PET&#xD;
or lesion positive with [68Ga]Ga-PentixaFor-PET, negative on FDG-PET but confirmed by another CT scan/ MRI or histology, or confirmed by follow-up (until therapeutic evaluation).&#xD;
False negative (FN): - lesion negative with [68Ga]Ga-PentixaFor-PET and positive by FDG-PET and confirmed by CT or MRI or histology, or confirmed by follow-up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>

    <time_frame>1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>The specificity (PPV and NPV) of [68Ga]Ga-PentixaFor-PET at the time of initial diagnosis will be assessed by patient and lesion analysis using the same definitions of TP and FN as for the primary objective.</description>

    <time_frame>1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>The prognostic impact of PET-FDG and [68Ga]Ga-PentixaFor-PET based on the number of lesions detected and their intensity of uptake by each imaging technique will be evaluated by assessing the impact of these data on the PFS and OS. PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment to relapse or progression. OS is defined as the time from the start of first treatment to death.</description>

    <measure>To determine at the time of initial diagnosis the tolerance of [68Ga]Ga-PentixaFor-PET</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerance of [68Ga]Ga-PentixaFor will be assessed by clinical monitoring of the patient for 1 hour after [68Ga]Ga-PentixaFor injection. Clinical data (heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure) will be collected prior [68Ga]Ga -PentixaFor injection before acquisition (at 60 min)</description>
