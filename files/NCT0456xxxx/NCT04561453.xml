  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is going to test the ability to successfully obtain results from certain&#xD;
      personalized tests for patients with biliary tract cancers that are able to be surgically&#xD;
      removed. Through surveys, this study will also evaluate the usefulness of these tests to&#xD;
      medical oncologists as they make decisions on what standard or experimental treatments might&#xD;
      benefit the patient's enrolled in the study. The study is observational and does not require&#xD;
      any change in the standard approach to treating biliary tract cancer. Results of the&#xD;
      personalized tests will be provided to the treating medical oncologist and the medical&#xD;
      oncologist can choose to whether or not to change management based on these results. These&#xD;
      personalized tests include reading of the cancer DNA, testing whether a panel of drugs can&#xD;
      kill a patient's cancer cells in a test tube, and testing for small amounts of cancer DNA in&#xD;
      the blood as a way to check for the presence of leftover cancer in the body after it is&#xD;
      removed surgically. This study will also give extra pieces of cancer, that would otherwise be&#xD;
      discarded, from surgery for laboratory research into how biliary tract cancers respond to&#xD;
      drugs and the body's immune system. The investigators hypothesize that the drug screen test&#xD;
      will, in some cases, be useful to the medical oncologist and may lead to the use of cancer&#xD;
      drugs that would not otherwise have been chosen based on standard guidelines or based on&#xD;
      cancer DNA testing. The investigators hypothesize that the test tube drug screening method&#xD;
      will correlate with how the cancer responds to the drugs in real life for those patients that&#xD;
      end up receiving a drug that was included in the drug screen panel. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that monitoring of cancer DNA in the blood stream will help us predict which&#xD;
      patients are most likely to have their cancer return after surgery. The investigators also&#xD;
      hypothesize that in many cases the appearance of cancer DNA in the blood stream will happen&#xD;
      weeks to months prior to the cancer showing up on usual body imaging or other lab tests.&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators hypothesize that, for patients undergoing medical treatment for&#xD;
      their cancer, trends in the amount of cancer DNA in the blood stream will correlate with the&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatment.&#xD;
