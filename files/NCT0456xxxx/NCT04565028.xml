  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disabling psychiatric disorder that affects 20%-30%&#xD;
      of U.S. Veterans. PTSD is strongly associated with increased risk for substance abuse&#xD;
      comorbidity, including cannabis use disorder. Multiple states now include PTSD as a condition&#xD;
      for which patients can be legally prescribed medical marijuana, despite the fact that there&#xD;
      has not been a single large-scale randomized clinical trial demonstrating the efficacy of&#xD;
      cannabis to treat PTSD to date. The overall objective of the current proposal is to study the&#xD;
      impact of reduced cannabis use on functioning among Veterans with PTSD. The investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate the relationship between cannabis use and daily functioning among cannabis&#xD;
      users and heavy cannabis users. The central hypothesis is that reductions in cannabis use&#xD;
      will lead to positive changes in the functional outcomes of Veterans. The rationale for this&#xD;
      research is that it will provide the first and only real-time data concerning the impact of&#xD;
      reduced cannabis use on daily functioning among Veterans with PTSD.&#xD;

      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disabling psychiatric disorder that affects 20%-30%&#xD;
      of U.S. Veterans. PTSD is strongly associated with increased risk for substance abuse&#xD;
      comorbidity, including cannabis use disorder; however, multiple states now include PTSD as a&#xD;
      condition for which patients can be legally prescribed medical marijuana, despite the fact&#xD;
      that there has not been a single large-scale randomized clinical trial demonstrating the&#xD;
      efficacy of cannabis to treat PTSD to date. The overall objective of the current proposal is&#xD;
      to prospectively study the impact of reduced cannabis use on psychosocial functioning among&#xD;
      Veterans with PTSD. To do so, the investigators will first use ecological momentary&#xD;
      assessment (EMA) methods to evaluate the relationship between cannabis use and daily&#xD;
      functioning among Veterans with PTSD. Next, the investigators will use mobile contingency&#xD;
      management (CM) and EMA to assess the impact of reduced cannabis use on daily functioning&#xD;
      among Veterans with PTSD who are heavy cannabis users. The central hypothesis is that&#xD;
      reductions in cannabis use will lead to positive changes in the functional outcomes of&#xD;
      Veterans. The rationale for this research is that it will provide the first and only&#xD;
      real-time data concerning the impact of reduced cannabis use on daily functioning among&#xD;
      Veterans with PTSD. As a result, this innovative and timely project has the potential to&#xD;
      significantly advance VHA healthcare and will directly inform the ongoing national debate&#xD;
      concerning the impact of cannabis use on the long-term functional recovery of Veterans with&#xD;
      PTSD.&#xD;
