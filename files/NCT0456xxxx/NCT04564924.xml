      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a higher risk of fractures than those&#xD;
      without. The purpose of this study is to develop a non-invasive Magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) method that can improve fracture risk prediction and provide early diagnosis for bone&#xD;
      abnormalities in patients with CKD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (MBD） is a common complication of chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease (CKD), which may lead to defective mineralization, altered bone morphology,&#xD;
      and/or bone turnover. Animal research found that bone changes occur even in the early stage&#xD;
      of CKD , and with CKD progression, the patient may show symptoms such as bone pain, joint&#xD;
      pain, bone deformation, and even spontaneous fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite significant advances in understanding bone disease in CKD, most clinical and&#xD;
      biochemical targets used in clinical practice remain controversial, resulting in an&#xD;
      undermanagement of bone fragility.Our ability to diagnose CKD-MBD and to initiate strategies&#xD;
      that could prevent fractures remains limited by the lack of accurate and noninvasive&#xD;
      diagnostic tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to develop a non-invasive method that can improve fracture risk&#xD;
      prediction and provide early diagnosis for bone abnormalities in patients with CKD.&#xD;
