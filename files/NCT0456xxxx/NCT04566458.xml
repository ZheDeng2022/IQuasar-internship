  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective observational study will collect Canadian real-world data (RWD) from HER2+&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients to describe treatment sequences of all therapies&#xD;
      received in the metastatic setting, to measure overall survival (OS), progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS), time to next active anti-cancer therapy, and to estimate the health resources&#xD;
      utilization (HRU) during third-line therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proportion of treatment received during all lines of therapy in the metastatic setting&#xD;
      will be described. The 2-year survival rate and median OS with interquartile range (IQR) for&#xD;
      third-line therapy will be calculated. HRU data and costs during third-line therapy will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
