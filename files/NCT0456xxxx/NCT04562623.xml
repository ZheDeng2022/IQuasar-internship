  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GYNECO-IMM&amp;Co is a prospective clinical and biological cohort ; this study aims to identify&#xD;
      immune surveillance and escape mechanisms and also predictive biomarkers for survival&#xD;
      patients who suffer from ovarian and breast carcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the main cancer in women and is the second cause of mortality by cancer in&#xD;
      the world for women ; high grade serous ovarian cancer is a rare pathology but survival is&#xD;
      less 25% at 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast and ovarian cancers are complex entities with heterogeneous tumor cells but also&#xD;
      normal cells including immune cells with represent the microenvironment of the tumor.This&#xD;
      microenvironment limits tumor progression but also has been shown to play a crucial role in&#xD;
      disease progression, tumor angiogenesis, maintenance and resistance to anticancer therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite newly developed immunotherapies, only one-third of patients with breast and ovarian&#xD;
      cancer responds to checkpoint inhibitors ; so today there is poor benefit to treat breast and&#xD;
      ovarian cancers with immunotherapies. Therefore it needs to better understand immune&#xD;
      mechanisms which reduce treatment efficacy. The aim of this clinical study is to better&#xD;
      understand mechanisms of immune response inhibition in breast and ovarian cancers. It would&#xD;
      characterize actionable targets in patients with resistance to conventional anticancer&#xD;
      treatments or immunotherapies.In this context, the hypothesis is that some specific&#xD;
      phenotypical or functional alterations of specific immune cells populations (DC, LB,&#xD;
      plasmocytes IgA, neutrophils, NK cells, CD8+CD39+ LT, Treg) induce tumoral progression in&#xD;
      breast and ovarian cancer. These immune populations will be described (qualitative,&#xD;
      quantitative and functional descriptions ; proteic, transcriptomic and genomic profiles) in&#xD;
      order to i) determine new immune surveillance mechanisms ii) new targets which allow&#xD;
      efficient antitumoral immunity in breast and ovarian cancers.&#xD;
