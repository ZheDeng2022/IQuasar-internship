  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative neurocognitive disorders (PND), which include postoperative delirium and both&#xD;
      acute and longlasting neurocognitive deficits, are a significant public health problem,&#xD;
      leading to a cascade of deleterious complications. Older adults are particularly at-risk of&#xD;
      developing PND both in the short and long term. Although age is consistently reported as an&#xD;
      important risk factor, the exact pathophysiology of PND remains poorly understood, but may&#xD;
      include postsurgery-compromised blood brain barrier (BBB) function. This project proposes&#xD;
      that perioperative BBB dysfunction is associated with measurable brain morphologic findings&#xD;
      in cognitive control areas that can be discovered with non-invasive magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI). Patients scheduled for surgery with an age range of 65-75 years of age, will&#xD;
      participate in brain diffusion-weighted pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (DW-pCASL)&#xD;
      and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), cognitive assessments, and evaluation of a BBB marker&#xD;
      from blood (at baseline, at two weeks, and at six months after surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a brain scan (MRI) within before surgery and two weeks and six months&#xD;
      after surgery. During this visit cognitive function will be assessed. Patients will also be&#xD;
      asked to participate in a blood draw.&#xD;

      The investigators will examine the potential mechanisms contributing to PND in an older&#xD;
      surgical population. It is proposed that BBB will be altered contributing to brain tissue&#xD;
      changes in cognitive control areas that can be examined with MD measures and blood&#xD;
      biomarkers. Therefore, the specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM #1: Examine BBB function, using DW-pCASL procedures, and BBB marker (S100β levels), in&#xD;
      older adult subjects between pre- ) and post-surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM #2: Assess brain tissue changes, using DTI-based MD measures, and cognition function,&#xD;
      between pre- and post-surgery in older adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM #3: Examine the relationships between BBB blood biomarker, BBB function index, and MD&#xD;
      values from cognitive control areas (prefrontal cortex, caudate, and hippocampus) between&#xD;
      pre- and post-surgery in an older surgical population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A One-group comparative and longitudinal study design will be used in this proposal. A total&#xD;
      of 34 older subjects scheduled for surgery will be recruited. Patients of either sex, in the&#xD;
      age range 65-75 years scheduled for abdominal, gynecologic or urologic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess cognitive function, the WRAML2 and MoCA tests will be performed within one week&#xD;
      before surgery and at two weeks and six months after surgery. These tests have been used by&#xD;
      our team in several conditions, and will be introduced just before MRI procedures. An average&#xD;
      mean score of 100±15 on WRAML2 and a score ≥26 on MoCA will be considered normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination of BBB integrity from blood. To account for interindividual variation, baseline&#xD;
      systemic biomarkers will be measured preoperatively (within one week before surgery).&#xD;
      Postoperative samples will also be collected at two weeks and 6 months of surgery. Samples&#xD;
      will be batch analyzed using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (S100β) by the UCLA Department&#xD;
      of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging. All brain MRI studies will be performed on a 3.0-Tesla MRI&#xD;
      scanner (Siemens, Magnetom, Prisma) at the Department of Radiology, UCLA. MRI studies will be&#xD;
      performed within one week before surgery, and at two weeks and six months after surgery.&#xD;
