  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence (IPV), including violence in teen dating relationships [teen dating&#xD;
      violence (TDV)], is a common and a serious threat to adolescent health, safety, and&#xD;
      well-being. TDV may include psychological/emotional abuse, sexual harassment or coercion,&#xD;
      stalking (including cyberstalking), and physical or sexual violence. For many, the first&#xD;
      experience of violence is in a dating or casual relationship with a partner or acquaintance&#xD;
      during adolescence. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      an adapted version of the myPlan app for adolescents (ages 15-17 years) to prevent and&#xD;
      respond to TDV. myPlan is an app available for mobile download or by web browser that&#xD;
      interactively assists users to assess the health and safety of user's intimate relationship,&#xD;
      receive personalized strategies on how build healthier relationships, stay safe and healthy&#xD;
      while navigating an unsafe relationship, and get connected to support and resources.&#xD;
