    <textblock>
      This trial is designed as a prospective, multi-center, single-blind, parallel, randomized&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial. The trial will be carried out in 5 centers, involving 220 subjects&#xD;
      as estimated who will be divided into the test group or control group randomly on an equal&#xD;
      basis (each group includes 110 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be carried out in 4 stages, including the screening period, random grouping,&#xD;
      operation date and follow-up period. In the screening period, the informed consent forms are&#xD;
      collected and inclusion and exclusion criteria are verified; after that, the accepted&#xD;
      subjects will be randomly divided into the control group or test group; on the operation&#xD;
      date, the operation is carried out using the device; safety follow-up visit is carried out&#xD;
      during the follow-up period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prospective, multi-center, single-blind, parallel, randomized controlled non-inferiority&#xD;
      trial design is adopted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the real-time endoscopic&#xD;
      near infrared fluorescence image provided by the LED light source system for endoscope by&#xD;
      evaluating at least one main extrahepatic bile duct (common bile duct and ductuli hepaticus&#xD;
      communis). The trial will be carried out in 5 centers, with the competitive grouping mode&#xD;
      adopted. Totally 220 patients to receive laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be involved (110&#xD;
      patients for each of the control group and the test group). The subjects, after signing the&#xD;
      informed consent form approved by the Ethics Committee, will be screened by the&#xD;
      investigators. Qualified subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and do not meet any of&#xD;
      the exclusion criteria will be randomly divided into the control group or the test group. For&#xD;
      the subjects in the control group, the Pinpoint Endoscopic Fluorescence Imaging System&#xD;
      commercially available will be used for operation. For subjects of the test group, the LED&#xD;
      light source system for endoscope will be used for operation. On the operation date,&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the display performance of the device by judging whether at least&#xD;
      one main extrahepatic bile duct (common bile duct and ductuli hepaticus communis) is&#xD;
      displayed. During the follow-up period, the investigators will evaluate the safety of the&#xD;
      device based on the results of vital signs, physical examination, blood routine examination,&#xD;
      routine urine examination, blood biochemistry and 12-lead ECG.&#xD;
