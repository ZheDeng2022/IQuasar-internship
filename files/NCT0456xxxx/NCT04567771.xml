    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial compares the side effects between patients treated with proton&#xD;
      radiation therapy versus intensity modulated radiation therapy after surgery for the&#xD;
      treatment of endometrial or cervical cancer. Radiation therapy uses high energy protons or&#xD;
      x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Using quality of life questionnaires and&#xD;
      adverse event assessments may help doctors learn whether proton radiation therapy is&#xD;
      associated with lower acute gastrointestinal toxicities at the end of treatment compared to&#xD;
      intensity modulated radiation therapy in patients with endometrial or cervical cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess whether proton radiation therapy (RT) is associated with lower acute&#xD;
      gastrointestinal toxicities at the end of treatment compared to intensity modulated radiation&#xD;
      therapy (IMRT) as measured with the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) bowel&#xD;
      domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the association of bowel and bladder dose-volume histogram (DVH) with bowel and&#xD;
      bladder toxicities, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess whether urinary toxicity rate is improved with proton RT compared to IMRT as&#xD;
      measured with the EPIC urinary domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine if well-being is improved with proton RT compared to IMRT as measured by&#xD;
      the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) cervix domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine if proton RT reduces grade 2+ hematologic toxicities (Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v] 4.0) compared to IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Evaluate progression-free and overall survival between patients receiving proton RT and&#xD;
      IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine if proton RT improves overall patient quality of life compared to IMRT using&#xD;
      the European Quality of Life Five Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate ability to tolerate chemotherapy concurrent or after RT. II. Correlate bone&#xD;
      marrow DVH with blood marrow function, and ability to tolerate chemotherapy concurrently or&#xD;
      after RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Correlate bowel and skin DVH with acute toxicity. IV. To evaluate patient-reported&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities as a predictor of assigned treatment regimen, as well as&#xD;
      physician-reported GI toxicities as a predictor of assigned treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Confirm the validity of the EPIC bowel and urinary domains when referencing the last 7&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo standard of care proton or intensity modulated radiation therapy. Patients&#xD;
      also complete quality of life questionnaires and adverse event assessments over 10-15 minutes&#xD;
      each at baseline, at the end of radiation therapy, and at 1 month, 1 year, and 3 years&#xD;
      post-radiation therapy.&#xD;
