      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of Immune Globulin&#xD;
      Intravenous (Human) GC5107 in pediatric subjects with Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency&#xD;
      (PHID).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, single-arm, historically controlled, multi-center Phase&#xD;
      III study to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)&#xD;
      GC5107 in pediatric subjects aged â‰¥ 2 years and &lt; 12 years with PHID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive intravenous infusions of the investigational product at the same dose&#xD;
      and interval as used for their previous Immunoglobulin intravenous (IGIV) maintenance&#xD;
      therapy. GC5107 will be infused every 21 or 28 days for a period of 12 months.&#xD;
