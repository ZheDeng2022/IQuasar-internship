    <textblock>
      We will perform a retrospective cohort study to assess the construct validity and performance&#xD;
      of days alive and out of hospital at day 90 (DAOH90) in cohorts of patients with sepsis and&#xD;
      septic shock who have been included in recent clinical trials.&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a retrospective cohort study. After obtaining all required ethics approvals,&#xD;
      we will obtain data from the ARISE, CHEST, and ADRENAL studies. We will obtain from each&#xD;
      dataset, for each trial participant with sepsis, data regarding; Demographic details,&#xD;
      co-morbidities, pre-morbid living situation, baseline severity of illness, receipt of and&#xD;
      duration of organ support during the index hospitalisation, Duration of ICU stay during index&#xD;
      hospitalisation, ICU mortality, Hospital length of stay (LOS) and mortality for index&#xD;
      hospitalisation, Discharge destination from index hospitalisation, readmissions to hospital&#xD;
      up to 2 years, long term mortality, and quality of life as measured by the EQ5D at longest&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the association between Days Alive and Out of&#xD;
      Hospital at day 90 and longer-term quality of life as measured by the EQ5D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the characteristics of DAOH90 in patients with sepsis and septic shock with&#xD;
           respect to the distribution and the pattern of variability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the construct validity of DAOH90, by testing the association between baseline&#xD;
           variables and process of care variables and DAOH90, with the hypothesis that indicators&#xD;
           for more &quot;sickness&quot; will be associated with fewer DAOH&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Higher age&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Higher APACHE II&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Higher baseline lactate&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Higher SOFA score at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Premorbid accommodation in a long term care facility compared to independent living&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  More co-morbidities at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Requirement for more organ support: requirement for 1, 2 or 3 (CVS, Resp, RRT)&#xD;
                organ supports, and duration of organ support&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants with septic shock compared to sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Longer duration of admission for the index ICU admission&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Longer duration of hospital admission for the index hospitalisation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the extent to which DAOH90 captures long term mortality and resource use, by&#xD;
           comparing the DAOH at day 90 to the DAOH at day 30, day 180 and day 365.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analysis For the primary analysis we will calculate the Days Alive and Out of&#xD;
      Hospital with DAOH=0 for all patients who die prior to day 90, regardless of whether the&#xD;
      death occurred in hospital or subsequent to discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a sensitivity analysis with Days Alive and Out of Hospital = the number of&#xD;
      days alive and out of hospital prior to death. For example of a patient had a one week&#xD;
      hospital admission and then spent 5 days at home prior to death the number of days alive and&#xD;
      out of hospital = 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a subgroup analysis based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The group of trial participants who were admitted to the ICU directly from the Emergency&#xD;
           Department compared to those admitted from the Operating Theatre or ward&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sex&#xD;
