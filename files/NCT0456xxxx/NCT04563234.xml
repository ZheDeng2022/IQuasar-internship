  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 30% of patients undergoing thoracic surgical procedures develop persistent&#xD;
      post-surgical pain (PPSP), which results in impaired functioning, diminished quality of life,&#xD;
      and increased risk of chronic opioid use. The proposed project aims to determine whether a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, controlled study of smartphone-based perioperative cognitive&#xD;
      flexibility training will reduce the incidence of PPSP in high-risk individuals undergoing&#xD;
      thoracic surgery.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The presence of clinically meaningful persistent post-surgical pain 3 months after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked about pain at or around their surgical area (dichotomous yes/no answer), and rate the intensity of pain, if present, on 0-10 numerical rating scale, where 0=no pain, and 10=worst imaginable pain. The presence of PPSP will be compared between the intervention arm and the control arm</description>

    <description>PROMIS® (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) is a set of person-centered measures that evaluates and monitors physical, mental, and social health. Each item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (1=never; 2=rarely; 3=sometimes; 4=often; and 5=always) with a range in score from 7 to 35 with higher scores indicating greater severity of anxiety. The score will be compared between the arms</description>
