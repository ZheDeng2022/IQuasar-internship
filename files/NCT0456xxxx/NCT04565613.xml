  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot trial is part of a long-term research program leading to a large trial to&#xD;
      determine if a strategy of supplementing protein in a subset of critically ill children is&#xD;
      superior to standard enteral nutrition care. The investigators hypothesize that protein&#xD;
      supplementation to critically ill children with body mass index (BMI) z-score ≤ -2 reduces&#xD;
      the length of stay in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and hospital, as well as the&#xD;
      duration of mechanical ventilation (MV).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protein malnutrition is prevalent among critically ill children and associated with poor&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. Current guidelines for provision of protein in daily management of&#xD;
      critically ill children in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) are based on limited and&#xD;
      not high-quality evidence. The current protein supplementation approach, &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot;&#xD;
      nutrition prescription, may not be appropriate for every critically ill child. Given the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of the patients admitted to the PICU, a targeted approach based on individuals'&#xD;
      needs represents a potential advancement in PICU care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that protein supplementation in PICU care leads to improved&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in subgroups of patients only. The investigators propose a dual-centre&#xD;
      pilot randomized controlled trial in Singapore with two major aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To obtain key information for planning and conducting a large-scale multicentre study in&#xD;
           Asia; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate the benefit of protein supplementation to critically ill children with body&#xD;
           mass index (BMI) z-scores on PICU ≤ -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main clinical outcome of interest is total number of days of hospital stay (from PICU&#xD;
      admission to hospital discharge). Two protein supplementation regimes (≥ 1.5g/kg/day vs.&#xD;
      standard care) will be randomly allocated to PICU patients with body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      z-scores ≤ -2. The investigators will determine the effect of protein supplementation on&#xD;
      total length of hospital stay and other clinical outcomes, and assess the impact of protein&#xD;
      supplementation on acquired functional impairment of PICU survivors 6 months after hospital&#xD;
      discharge. In addition, the investigators will explore whether muscle ultrasound is a&#xD;
      biomarker for protein balance in pediatric critical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of this study, the investigators will have strong preliminary data to plan,&#xD;
      refine their study approach, and execute a future large multi-centre study across Asia. These&#xD;
      data will ultimately guide protein provision and nutritional management of patients in PICU&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;

    <description>The participants in the study interventional group will receive protein supplementation to reach a final goal of 1.5 g/kg/day of protein on full feeds. This will be via 100% whey protein isolate (Nestle Beneprotein). Doses will be calculated on the patient's admission weight and rounded up to the nearest 1g. Doses will not be adjusted to account for weight changes in the PICU.&#xD;
Protein supplementation will continue for a total of 7 days from the start of enrolment into the study or until PICU discharge, whichever is earlier. If the patient is able to take solid feeds during the study intervention period, the intervention will be stopped. However, if the device required for feeding is removed but the patient takes milk/liquid feeds fully, protein supplementation will continue.</description>
