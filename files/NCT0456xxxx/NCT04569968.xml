  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke affects the vital activities of daily living such as breathing and swallowing. After&#xD;
      stroke excursion of the diaphragm reduces about 50%, and also the maximum expiratory pressure&#xD;
      of the individual 50% or higher. Dysphagia occurs in 29% to 45% of the acute stroke cases.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As a third leading cause of death and one of the major causes of disability, stroke still&#xD;
      maintain its bad reputation in worldwide. Stroke owes its fame on wide range of symptoms&#xD;
      mostly the musculoskeletal system symptoms such as spasticity, equilibrium and gait problems.&#xD;
      Although mentioned symptoms keep their popularity devious two dysfunction caused by stroke;&#xD;
      stomatognathic system dysfunction and respiratory dysfunction appears to change this&#xD;
      equation. Considering the high incidence of dysphagia and the reduced cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      capacity of the stroke patients, it seems inevitable. From this perspective aim of this study&#xD;
      is to assess the effect of expiratory muscle training on the stomatognathic system in&#xD;
      patients with stroke and as mentioned aid to shatter the mentioned equation.&#xD;

    <description>To assess masticatory performance of the patients, patients will be asked to chew 3 gr of peanuts with 20 chewing stroke and then spit on a sieve with 10 mesh and 1700 µm width. Then the residue will be collected and put into the centrifuge tube. After that residue will be centrifuged for 3 minutes with 1500 rpm. Same procedure will be used for the sieved content. Then this two values will be divided and recorded as the masticatory performance index.</description>

All measurements will be taken while the patients are seated with their head supported. Digital caliper will be positioned in central incisors for the mandibular depression and the protrusion. For lateral deviation first upper central incisor location in relation to the lower central incisor will be drawn by a biocompatible pen then measurement will be performed. After that, a second drawing made. Then the horizontal distance between these two points will be measured for the lateral deviation range of motion. Reference values for mandibular depression, protrusion and the lateral deviation are as follows: 40 mm, 6 mm, and 8 mm.</description>

    <description>For training group first maximum expiratory pressure measurement will be assessed with portable expiratory measurement device. Measurement will be taken while the patient in a sitting position. Three measurement values with 5% variation will be taken an average of these values recorded as a maximum expiratory pressure of the patient. After the maximum expiratory pressure of the patient is measured 50% percent of the related value will be set on the expiratory muscle trainer. Then patient will be informed about how to use the trainer. Trainer will be used daily for four weeks with 50 repetitions. At the end of every week pressures will be measured again for re-calibration of the trainer.</description>
