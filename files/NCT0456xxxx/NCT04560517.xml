  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a complex and multifactorial psychiatric disease that affects mostly&#xD;
      women and is characterized by a self-restriction of food intake leading to life-threatening&#xD;
      consequences whose underlying mechanisms are largely unexplored. AN encompasses a&#xD;
      constellation of risk factors including genetic, biological, neuro-psychological and social&#xD;
      factors. Although AN has a prevalence of only 1-3% in the general population, it has the&#xD;
      highest mortality rate amongst any psychiatric disorder. Recovery of normal feeding behaviour&#xD;
      in patients often requires several months with a large between-patient variability and a high&#xD;
      percentage of relapse, which can occur in 35 to 41% of the patients. There is a huge unmet&#xD;
      need for optimal understanding of processes underlying relapse. Reward processing&#xD;
      abnormalities represents an important hypothesis underlying AN development and perpetuation.&#xD;
      We aim to investigate the mechanisms that contribute to the maintenance and chronicity of the&#xD;
      disease after inpatient treatment with a longitudinal design across intensive standardized&#xD;
      inpatient treatment. We will challenge our hypothesis through brain imaging,&#xD;
      neuropsychological, metabolic and genetic approaches. One hundred twenty-five AN female&#xD;
      patients admitted for intensive inpatient treatment will be recruited and evaluated: at&#xD;
      admission, after weight recovery and at 6 months after discharge with neurocognitive tests&#xD;
      (including the Delay Discounting Task), genetic/epigenetic examination, hormonal blood&#xD;
      samples (at each visit and repeated sampling around a meal for a 10-patient subgroup) and&#xD;
      brain imaging (including fMRI during a Delay Discounting Task for fifty patients). One&#xD;
      hundred healthy controls will be also recruited and be subjected to the same study&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
