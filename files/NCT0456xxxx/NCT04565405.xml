  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biofilms pose a potential risk with reusable inner cannulas, by increasing the risk of&#xD;
      infection. Effective decontamination is vital in eliminating these biofilms. An appropriate&#xD;
      method of cleaning and decontamination to make inner cannula safe for reuse should be&#xD;
      practiced. The current recommendations for cleaning inner cannula are varied with multiple&#xD;
      techniques being put forth. The current practice of using sterile water to clean inner&#xD;
      cannula is not supported by strong evidence. This Randomized Controlled Study looks into the&#xD;
      microbiological efficacy of sterile water in cleaning inner cannulas.&#xD;

      Tracheostomy Care of Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tracheostomy care of all patients included in the study will be the same as any other&#xD;
      tracheostomy patient in the hospital, as directed by the tracheostomy care nursing policy.&#xD;
      Before study procedure, inner cannula is to be checked to ensure it is not clogged with&#xD;
      secretion, any secretion is to be removed with suction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decontamination methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may fall under group A or group B as determined by the random allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in decontamination group A: Detergent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre Decontamination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The inner cannula care will be removed using aseptic precautions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 ml of normal saline will be flushed along the inner surface in an uniform manner over&#xD;
           30 seconds. The inner cannula will be turned gently to ensure that the entire inner&#xD;
           surface has been flushed by Normal Saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The solution will be collected in the sterile bottle and sent for laboratory analysis of&#xD;
           colony counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small proportion of pre decontamination samples will be randomly selected for typing and&#xD;
           naming of organisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decontamination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inner cannula will be cleaned with commercially available tracheostomy cleaning fluid /&#xD;
           powder (Ex: Trachoe - Kapitex healthcare, UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cleaning is done as per manufacturers recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Decontamination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using aseptic technique, 10 ml of normal saline will be flushed along the inner surface&#xD;
           in an uniform manner over 30 seconds. The inner cannula will be turned gently to ensure&#xD;
           that the entire inner surface has been flushed by Normal Saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The solution will be collected in the sterile bottle and sent for laboratory analysis of&#xD;
           colony counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in decontamination group B: Water&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre Decontamination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The inner cannula care will be removed using aseptic precautions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 ml of normal saline will be flushed along the inner surface in an uniform manner over&#xD;
           30 seconds. The inner cannula will be turned gently to ensure that the entire inner&#xD;
           surface has been flushed by Normal Saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The solution will be collected in the sterile bottle and sent for laboratory analysis of&#xD;
           colony counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small proportion of pre decontamination samples will be randomly selected for typing and&#xD;
           naming of organisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decontamination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Inner cannula is cleaned as per the current tracheostomy care guidelines as directed by the&#xD;
      Nursing Policy for Tracheostomy Care, Changi General Hospital. Only Sterile water is&#xD;
      recommended as per the policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Decontamination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using aseptic technique, 10 ml of normal saline will be flushed along the inner surface&#xD;
           in an uniform manner over 30 seconds. The inner cannula will be turned gently to ensure&#xD;
           that the entire inner surface has been flushed by Normal Saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The solution will be collected in the sterile bottle and sent for laboratory analysis of&#xD;
           colony counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crossover of Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid the influence of confounding covariates, we propose to have a cross over study. The&#xD;
      cross over patient will act as his own control. The selected patients will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to sequence AB or BA in 1:1 fashion using permuted blocks with different block&#xD;
      sizes. The subjects and lab operators will be blinded to the block size and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change of sequence A &gt; B and B &gt; A will take place only after minimum of 24 hours after&#xD;
      the first part of sequence has been completed. Exclusion criteria will still be applicable&#xD;
      after completion of one part of the sequence. Small proportion of pre decontamination samples&#xD;
      will be randomly selected for typing and naming of organisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lab Method for Colony Counts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the flush solution, 100 microlitres and further sequential serial dilutions of 1:10 (in&#xD;
      saline) are cultured directly onto blood agar plates. After 72 hours aerobic incubation at&#xD;
      35oC, all plates are examined and growth from plates with 10 to 100 colonies per plate are&#xD;
      counted. Total bacterial growth will be expressed as colony-forming unit (cfu)/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small proportion of pre decontamination samples will be randomly selected for typing and&#xD;
      naming of organisms.&#xD;
