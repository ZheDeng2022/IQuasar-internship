  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is the most common head and neck cancer in South China and South&#xD;
      East Asia. Worldwide, there are 80,000 incident cases and 50,000 deaths annually. In Hong&#xD;
      Kong, NPC ranked as the tenth most common cancer in man. Up to 30% of NPC patients will&#xD;
      develop recurrence or metastases after primary radiotherapy or chemoradiation. Platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen has been the main stay of first line treatment for recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic NPC. However, the duration of response is short and currently there is no&#xD;
      recommended standard second line chemotherapy. Axitinib is a highly potent and selective&#xD;
      inhibitor of VEGF receptor. Selectively targeting a single growth factor receptor pathway&#xD;
      provides the potential to rationally adjust dosages and combine drugs directed at specific&#xD;
      parts of the pathway to minimize toxicity and achieve the optimum therapeutic benefit. In the&#xD;
      phase 2 axitinib monotherapy in recurrent or metastatic NPC who failed at least one line of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, the clinical benefit rate (CBR, complete response + partial response + stable&#xD;
      disease) was 78.4% at 3 months but decreased to 43.2% at 6 months. However, the confirmed&#xD;
      objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST was only 2.7% and unconfirmed ORR of 18.9%, with no&#xD;
      complete response.Recently, the promising clinical activity of immune check point inhibitors&#xD;
      has been demonstrated in NPC. The ORR was 25.9% (7 partial responses out of 27 patients) for&#xD;
      single agent pembrolizumab, and 20.5% (including 1 complete response and 7 partial responses&#xD;
      out of 44 patients) for single agent nivolumab,9 in recurrent or metastatic NPC who failed at&#xD;
      least first line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of axitinib and avelumab has been studied in renal cell carcinoma (RCC).&#xD;
      Based on the above promising and positive results in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and head and&#xD;
      neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), the investigators hypothesize that the combination of&#xD;
      axitinib and avelumab in the second line setting of NPC will achieving a more complete, deep&#xD;
      and durable response than either agent alone, without a significant increase in toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, single arm, phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the activity and safety&#xD;
      of the combination of axitinib and avelumab in recurrent or metastatic NPC patients who&#xD;
      failed at least one line of platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
