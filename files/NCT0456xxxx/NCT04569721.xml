  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of freezing&#xD;
      (cryoablation) of the splanchnic nerve for management of diabetes. The splanchnic nerves&#xD;
      carry signals from the brain to help regulate the way organs function. Quieting these&#xD;
      signals, by freezing the splanchnic nerves, may help the body regulate blood sugar. The study&#xD;
      procedure will take about 30 minutes and the researchers hope that it will help people to&#xD;
      control their blood sugars, lose weight, and possibly improve blood pressure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a disease of pandemic proportion, affecting approximately 425&#xD;
      million adults worldwide. The incidence of T2D is increasing in most countries and it is&#xD;
      predicted that by the year 2045, 629 million adults will be diagnosed with T2D worldwide.&#xD;
      Chronically elevated sympathetic activity has been shown to contribute to the development of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome and T2D. Overweight/obese individuals demonstrate elevated noradrenaline&#xD;
      and metabolite levels relative to lean healthy individuals - this is particularly concerning&#xD;
      since long term prospective studies have shown that noradrenaline levels predict future risk&#xD;
      of T2D. Furthermore, dysfunctional sympathetic response to glucose loads is demonstrated&#xD;
      amongst those with T2D compared to pre-diabetes. Since the greater splanchnic nerve is the&#xD;
      main source of sympathetic input to the viscera, the researchers postulate that denervation&#xD;
      of the splanchnic nerve would lead to decreased sympathetic tone, thereby improving glycemic&#xD;
      control in patients with T2D. To the researchers' knowledge, this would be the first study to&#xD;
      evaluate the role of splanchnic cryoablation as a potential therapeutic for T2D and insulin&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;

    <description>The patient will be sedated and continuously monitored by the anesthesia team, who will be present for the entire procedure. The puncture site will be anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine infiltration. Following tract anesthesia, and utilizing fluoroscopic CT guidance, four cryoablation probes (Ice Rods®) will be advanced, 2 on each side. In addition, a temperature monitoring probe (Boston Scientific, Multipoint 1.5 Thermal Sensor®) will be advanced on each side. The cryoablation process will include a 10-minute freeze, followed by a 3-minute passive thaw, and a brief active thaw to facilitate probe removal. A final scan will be obtained following removal of the probes. After the procedure, a sterile dressing will be applied, and subjects will be monitored for at least 12 hours in an observation bed in the hospital post-procedure.</description>
