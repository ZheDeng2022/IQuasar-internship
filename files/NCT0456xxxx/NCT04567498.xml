  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An electronic-nose (e-nose) had been investigated as a diagnostic tool for tuberculosis by&#xD;
      examining exhaled breath of the patients. Universitas Gadjah Mada has developed an e-nose&#xD;
      device for TB diagnostic tool. Here the investigators test the device in order to analyze the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity electronic-nose as a screening tool for tuberculosis.&#xD;

      The study population consists of 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - presumptive TB patients. Group 2 - residents of area with high risk of TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants provide written informed consent. The participants are asked to breathe&#xD;
      normally using a mask for 2 times then inhale and exhale in a forced expiratory volume to the&#xD;
      air collecting bag until the collecting bag is full. The collecting bag is sealed and&#xD;
      connected to the e-nose machine via a collecting hose and HEPA-filter protecting the e-nose&#xD;
      from microbes. The breath pattern will be recorded in the e-nose device, which is connected&#xD;
      to a laptop that will display the recorded breath pattern. Other data are collected: clinical&#xD;
      symptoms, results of chest X-ray, smear microscopic, and Xpert MTB/Rif examinations.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The study use a triple-blind masking, in which the research subjects, breath sample takers, and laboratory sample examiners do not know the results of each sampling that has been done. The final data processor is also blinded to the results of Xpert or other laboratory examinations. The breath sampling data is saved in graphic form which interpretation will be carried out later by the data processor at the final stage.</masking_description>
