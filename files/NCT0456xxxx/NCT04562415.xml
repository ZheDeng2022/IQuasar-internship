  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to investigate the effect of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS)&#xD;
      and low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on upper extremity&#xD;
      spasticity and functional recovery in patients with chronic ischemic stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sham-controlled double-blind randomized study was undertaken. 20 patients with chronic&#xD;
      stroke were randomized into active rTMS group (n=7), active cTBS group (n=7) and sham cTBS&#xD;
      group (n=6). In the active rTMS group, 10 sessions of intact hemispheric upper extremity&#xD;
      motor area (M1) were targeted and inhibitor rTMS was applied with a frequency of 1 Hz&#xD;
      consisting of 1200 pulses for 20 minutes. In the active cTBS group, 10 sessions of intact&#xD;
      hemispheric upper extremity motor area (M1) were targeted and cTBS was administered for a&#xD;
      total of 600 pulses consisting of 3 burst stimulations of 50 Hz repeated every 200&#xD;
      milliseconds for 40 seconds. Sham cTBS was applied in the same protocol but using sham coil.&#xD;
      Within 30 minutes after TMS sessions, all patients underwent 10 sessions of joint range of&#xD;
      motion, stretching, strengthening, balance and coordination exercises, hand rehabilitation&#xD;
      and daily living activities under the guidance of a physiotherapist, regardless of which&#xD;
      group they were in. Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Motor Function Scale, Modified Ashworth Scale&#xD;
      (MAS), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Motor Activity Log-28 (MAL-28) and Brunnstrom&#xD;
      upper extremity and hand motor recovery stage were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment&#xD;
      and follow up at 4 weeks.&#xD;
