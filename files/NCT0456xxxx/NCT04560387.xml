  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a well-established risk factor for the development of atrial fibrillation (AF),&#xD;
      while the reduction of body weight was shown to reduce the risk of AF. However, little is&#xD;
      known about the effect of different weight-reducing interventions on AF burden. The study&#xD;
      will evaluate the effect of a complex program aimed at weight reduction on AF burden in&#xD;
      subjects after catheter ablation for AF and at least 1st degree obesity. This will be&#xD;
      investigated in randomized study design and compared with patients receiving standard care&#xD;
      without specific obesity-related intervention. The weight loss program will consist of diet,&#xD;
      lifestyle and exercise counselling and, in selected subjects, also bariatric surgery in order&#xD;
      to achieve a sustained weight loss of &gt;10% of initial body weight. Secondary aims include&#xD;
      identification of patient phenotypes with the most benefits from weight reduction as well as&#xD;
      elucidation of potential pathomechanisms linking obesity and AF, with the main focus being on&#xD;
      low-grade inflammation. The project will help to define the optimal weight-reducing regimen&#xD;
      in AF and to tailor the interventions to individual patient needs.&#xD;

    <description>A structured motivational and goal directed program will be used for weight reduction involving physicians, nutritionists, educators and physiotherapists. Initially, based on the input data provided by the patient an individual nutritional plan will be designed with the aim of reducing caloric intake by 10%. Low-intensity aerobic exercise for 30 min will be prescribed 3-times a week with the aim of increasing the frequency to 5-times a week and participants will be offered the possibility to participate in regular physiotherapist-lead group exercises. Patients will be required to maintain a diet and physical activity diary. Regular reviews will be scheduled every 3-6 months according to the actual weight loss.</description>

Sleeve gastrectomy was selected as the currently most frequent restrictive type of bariatric surgery with a proven efficacy on weight reduction, metabolic status and low-grade inflammation</description>
