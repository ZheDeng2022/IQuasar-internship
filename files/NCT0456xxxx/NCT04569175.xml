    <textblock>
      This study includes 30 patients with Meniere's disease confirmed with AAO-HNS criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the new optimized 3D FLAIR sequence developed at our site&#xD;
      with a standard 3D FLAIR sequence performed 4h after a single intravenous dose of macrocyclic&#xD;
      gadolinium-based contrast agents for the detection of endolymphatic hydrops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be explored with the new 3D FLAIR optimized sequence before injection&#xD;
      (method to validate) and again 4 hours after contrast media administration with the same&#xD;
      sequence 3D FLAIR&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Meniere's disease (MD) is a pathology of the inner ear defined by episodes of spontaneous&#xD;
      vertigo usually accompanied by tinnitus, pressure within the ear and fluctuating&#xD;
      sensorineural hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endolymphatic hydrops (EH) is the main pathophysiological substratum of Meniere's disease.&#xD;
      Temporal bone MRI has long been used performed to exclude other pathologies mimicking MD,&#xD;
      such as vestibular schwannoma or endolymphatic sac tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, delayed 3D-FLAIR sequence is the imaging technique of choice for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      endolymphatic hydrops. The endolymphatic space could be assessed on MRI with 3D-FLAIR&#xD;
      sequences delayed acquisition after the intravenous administration of gadolinium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The saccule appears to be the most involved structure in MD. The reproducibility of the&#xD;
      hydrops protocols with various MRI scan manufacturers is debatable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because endo and peri lymphatic spaces have different biochemical compositions, a new FLAIR&#xD;
      3D sequence on healthy volunteers can be tuned in order to separate endo and peri lymphatic&#xD;
      spaces. The hypothesis of the study is that this new method could detect saccular hydrops&#xD;
      with the same performances as the standard FLAIR that is done after gadolinium injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will prospectively include 30 patients with MD confirmed with AAO-HNS criteria .&#xD;
      All patients will sign an informed consent. They will be explored with the new 3D FLAIR&#xD;
      optimized sequence without injection (method to validate). Then, they will be injected, and&#xD;
      they will be explored again 4 hours after contrast product administration with the same&#xD;
      sequence (the reference method),to take advantage of the intravenous injection of gadolinium&#xD;
      that will be performed in the care. The optimized non enhanced 3D FLAIR sequence will be&#xD;
      compared with the reference method and with the same sequence four hours after gadolinium&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
