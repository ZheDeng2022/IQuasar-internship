  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With increased aging population, there is a higher rate of having chronic diseases and&#xD;
      cognitive impairment. In order to achieve successful aging, it is important for&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults to perform better self-management with improved health&#xD;
      literacy and various kinds of support. The study aims to develop a Nurse-Led E-Health program&#xD;
      (NeLP), evaluate the effectiveness of NeLP, and refine the program based on the outcome&#xD;
      measurement. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be adopted. A follow-up process&#xD;
      evaluation will be conducted to assess the acceptability, strengths and limitations of&#xD;
      Nurse-led e-Health program based on the participants' perspectives. The research contributes&#xD;
      to engage and empower older adults living in the community to manage their chronic condition,&#xD;
      and foster collaboration with the goal of translating evidence into action.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With increased aging population, there is a higher rate of having chronic diseases and&#xD;
      cognitive impairment. In order to achieve successful aging, it is important for&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults to perform better self-management with improved health&#xD;
      literacy and various kinds of support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to develop a Nurse-Led E-Health program (NeLP), evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      NeLP, and refine the program based on the outcome measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will develop the Nurse-led e-Health program, and assess the effects of the&#xD;
      program. A needs assessment will be carried out using focus group discussion with the older&#xD;
      adults. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be adopted. A follow-up process evaluation&#xD;
      will be conducted to assess the acceptability, strengths and limitations of Nurse-led&#xD;
      e-Health program based on the participants' perspectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion and conclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research contributes to engage and empower older adults living in the community&#xD;
      to manage their chronic condition, and foster collaboration with the goal of translating&#xD;
      evidence into action. This research will offer important insights into the need for educating&#xD;
      and engaging older adults in managing chronic conditions to promote health and well-being,&#xD;
      and therefore contribute to health and well-being of the elderly population.&#xD;
