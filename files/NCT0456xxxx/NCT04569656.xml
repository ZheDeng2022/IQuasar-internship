  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder&#xD;
      characterized by motor symptoms. In recent years it has become clear that motor symptoms are&#xD;
      associated with non-motor and non-dopaminergic symptoms throughout the natural progression of&#xD;
      the disease, and sometimes even before the onset of motor manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic constipation is the most common gastrointestinal symptom reported by PD patients; it&#xD;
      could be one of the manifestations of disease onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past, constipation was considered a side effect of neurological therapy, but more&#xD;
      recent studies have evidenced that it is widely present in patients with early untreated PD&#xD;
      too and it may precede of years the onset of motor symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of constipation can reach 80% of patients with PD, with an incidence of&#xD;
      decreased stool frequency (less than 3 bowel movements per week) of 57-67% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although constipation should be interpreted as part of the disease, patients often don't link&#xD;
      it to PD, with the result that it may be neglected or poorly managed. Moreover, continuous&#xD;
      and incongruous use of laxatives, that are often used in increasing doses in order to&#xD;
      maintain efficacy, may cause the onset of abdominal pain and diarrhoea with the risk of bowel&#xD;
      incontinence and other side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constipation also adversely affects quality of life of PD patients: beyond being an annoying&#xD;
      symptom, it may also cause other serious gastrointestinal pathologies (i.e. magacolon,&#xD;
      intestinal pseudo-obstruction, volvolus, bowel perforation). Moreover, constipation can&#xD;
      directly or indirectly influence the absorption of PD drugs, with the result of a poor&#xD;
      control on motor symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, finding an effective treatment of constipation would be very important for&#xD;
      quality of life of PD patients; this treatment should be easy to be administered and should&#xD;
      not have any interference with other PD drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHGG fiber is extracted from a herbaceous plant (Cyamopsis Tetra-Gonolobus, family:&#xD;
      Leguminosae) of Indian origin: it produces 5/9 pods containing seeds which produce the famous&#xD;
      guar gum, that is a natural polysaccharide. It differs from fibers derived from other plants&#xD;
      for its high content of Galactomannan. Guar gum (referred to as GG) is classified in the&#xD;
      European list of additives under the symbol E 412. Recently, a partially hydrolyzed guar gum&#xD;
      (indicated with the abbreviation PHGG) has been developed. Unlike the original and other&#xD;
      fibers (eg. Psillium), it has the characteristic to remain liquid and, due to its low&#xD;
      molecular weight, to not turn into gel. The introduction of molecules of water (hydrolysis),&#xD;
      by an enzyme called Mannanase, reduces the length and the molecular weight of guar gum and&#xD;
      creates a fiber with unique properties: by remaining liquid, it does not cause bloating,&#xD;
      flatulence and meteorism, that are adverse events typically associated to other fibers. The&#xD;
      association with sodium hyaluronate (low molecular weight depolymerizes) rapidly attracting&#xD;
      water and amplifying the desired clinical effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this pilot research study is to investigate the effectiveness of this formula&#xD;
      (Stick pack 30 ml containing PHGG 5 g and Hyaluronic 200 mg) in PD patients affected by&#xD;
      constipation.&#xD;

    <description>using the scale the Patient Assessment of Constipation-Symptoms PAC-SYM The 12-item questionnaire is divided into three symptom subscales: abdominal (four items); rectal (three items); and stool (five items). Items are scored on 5-point Likert scales, with scores ranging from 0 to 4 (0 = 'symptom absent', 1 = 'mild', 2 = 'moderate', 3 = 'severe' and 4 = 'very severe'). A mean total score in the range of 0-4 is generated by dividing the total score by the number of questions completed; the lower the total score, the lower the symptom burden.</description>

Response choice is a Likert scale from 0 to 4. Higher scores mean higher negative effects on quality of life. Items 25, 26, 27, and 28 should be scored reversed because they are positive questions.</description>
