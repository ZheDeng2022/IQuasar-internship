  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study of the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of osimertinib (80 mg orally once daily) in patients with LM associated with EGFRm+ NSCLC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in approximately 5 sites across South Korea and will include EGFR&#xD;
      TKI pre-treated patients. All patients will be required to have NSCLC associated with at&#xD;
      least 1 site of LM as identified by the Investigator that can be assessed by magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) scan and that is suitable for repeat assessments. Presence of&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) measurable intracranial&#xD;
      (INC) metastases (ie, brain parenchyma and cranial leptomeninges) and/or extracranial (EXC)&#xD;
      metastases is not mandatory. The presence of LM will be based on the Investigator assessment&#xD;
      of the brain MRI scan. LM will be confirmed by radiologist from the central site to ensure&#xD;
      that patients enrolled in the study are assessable for LM radiologically. Patients negative&#xD;
      for LM according to radiologist assessment but enrolled in the study will be replaced. The&#xD;
      replaced patient will be included in the study and will receive investigational product (IP)&#xD;
      if, in the opinion of the Investigator, the patient is able to receive clinical benefit. Such&#xD;
      a patient will not be evaluable for LM response in the LM-EFR analysis set.Full analyses set&#xD;
      (FAS) is defined as patients enrolled who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. In&#xD;
      addition to Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria for Leptomeningeal Metastases&#xD;
      (RANO-LM) assessments, separate RECIST 1.1 imaging assessments on EXC disease and INC (both&#xD;
      LM and non-LM) disease will be performed on images acquired using the preferred method of&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen (and pelvis when&#xD;
      indicated) (EXC) and gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI scan of the brain (INC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline scans will be acquired within 28 days prior to first dose of IP and then every 8&#xD;
      weeks (±1 week) and every 12 weeks (±1 week) after 12 months relative to first dose. Patients&#xD;
      who discontinue IP for reasons other than objective disease progression in all of INC, EXC,&#xD;
      and LM, will continue scans every 8 weeks (±1 week; relative to date of first dose of IP) and&#xD;
      every 12 weeks (±1 week, after 12 months) until objective progression in INC, EXC, and LM or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent. Progression refers to progression assessed objectively by imaging&#xD;
      using RECIST 1.1 for non-LM INC and EXC or RANO-LM criteria as appropriate. If a patient has&#xD;
      been deemed to have LM subjective disease progression according to radiological and clinical&#xD;
      assessment by the Investigatorstudy treatment can be continue, and the patient should&#xD;
      maintain tumor imaging assessments according to the schedule of assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSF sampling for cytology is not mandatory, but is strongly encouraged, in patients who are&#xD;
      willing to have lumbar punctures during the study, or in those patients who have Ommaya&#xD;
      reservoirs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)/World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO) performance status score, vital signs, and laboratory tests (hematology, clinical&#xD;
      chemistry, and urinalysis) will be conducted at each visit. Adverse events (AEs) will be&#xD;
      monitored and recorded on an ongoing basis. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline and at the time point of investigator's decision and will include&#xD;
      measurement of the QT interval. A multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram will&#xD;
      be performed at baseline and at the time point of investigator's decision for left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurement. Plasma and CSF (if feasible) samples for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis will be collected at pre-dose on Cycle 3 Day 1 and Cycle 6 Day&#xD;
      1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) questionnaires, including European Organization for Research&#xD;
      and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 items (EORTC QLQ-C30),&#xD;
      EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brain Cancer Module 20 items (EORTC QLQ-BN20) will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline (prior to first dose of IP and prior to all other assessments on Cycle&#xD;
      1 Day 1) and at home (every 8 weeks [±3 days for EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BN20 relative to&#xD;
      administration of IP). The patient is asked to report PROs up to the end of Cycle 8 or to IP&#xD;
      discontinuation, whichever comes first.&#xD;
