  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor development of the premature infant often exhibits deviations that trigger functional&#xD;
      limitations and disability. In Colombia, one out of every five births corresponds to&#xD;
      premature babies. In preterm infants requiring hospitalization, early clinical interventions&#xD;
      focused on home care have been shown to improve motor development and decrease morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, interdisciplinary work, supported by information and communication Technologies&#xD;
      (ICT), shows a knowledge gap that can be explored. This leads to the following research&#xD;
      question: What is the effect of the Interdisciplinary Hospital-Home Intervention on the&#xD;
      adaptation of the motor development of premature children compared to traditional&#xD;
      intervention in Colombia and Polonia?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the effect of the interdisciplinary Hospital-Home intervention on the&#xD;
      adaptation of the motor development of premature children compared to traditional&#xD;
      intervention in Colombia and Polonia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Experimental quantitative study with pre-test and post-test to two groups,&#xD;
      experimental and control, which compares before and after the intervention. The intervention&#xD;
      will be developed in two scenarios: the hospital and the home. The experimental group will&#xD;
      receive the intervention and the control group the traditional care established in the&#xD;
      institutions for premature children. The calculation of the sample size is 130 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of results expected to be obtained It is expected to obtain a supported that justifies&#xD;
      the importance of education from hospital stay, post discharge follow-up and parental&#xD;
      participation in the adequate stimulation of motor development of the premature. It is&#xD;
      expected to incorporate the use of ICT in home monitoring, while implementing the use of a&#xD;
      mobile application for this purpose. It is also expected to contribute to the research&#xD;
      training of undergraduate and graduate students. In addition, participate in national and&#xD;
      international presentations and in the production of scientific articles.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will start in NICU and to be continued at home with the support of ICT. The NICU intervention will have theoretical and practical components, the theoretical one will be about motor development in premature infants, and practical one will have strategies for motor early intervention, it will be demonstrated with pediatric simulator and parents should be demonstrate it with a infant: 1Sensorial motor stimulation, visual and auditory follow-6up; Tactile integration 3Extension muscle activation 4Middle line integration 5Alignment reaction stimulation in prone position 6Flexor muscle activation with transition to lateral position 7Flexor muscle activation with transition to sitting position 8Facilitation of reciprocal flexion and extension lower limbs. All parents will receive a motor sensorial kit that will include roller, visual tags, blankets and rattles, it will be for apply the strategies for motor early intervention, and will be supported by ICT</description>
