  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a prospective, multi-center, single-blind, parallel, randomized&#xD;
      controlled superiority clinical trial. The trial will be carried out in 5 centers, involving&#xD;
      120 subjects as estimated who will be divided into the test group or control group randomly&#xD;
      on an equal basis (each group includes 60 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be carried out in 4 stages, including the screening period, random grouping,&#xD;
      operation date and follow-up period. In the screening period, the informed consent forms are&#xD;
      collected and candidates are screened; after screening, the accepted subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into the control group or test group; on the operation date, the operation&#xD;
      is carried out using the device tested; safety follow-up visit is carried out during the&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;

      The prospective, multi-center, single-blind, parallel, randomized controlled superiority&#xD;
      trial design is adopted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the LED light source&#xD;
      system for endoscope during ureter transillumination. The trial will be carried out in 5&#xD;
      centers, with the competitive grouping mode adopted. This trial will be carried out in the&#xD;
      General Surgery Department and the Gynecology Department. Totally 120 subjects with rectal&#xD;
      cancer, endometriosis, cervical cancer, adenomyosis and pelvic adhesion requiring operation&#xD;
      (60 subjects for each of the test group and control group) are involved. The subjects, after&#xD;
      signing the informed consent form approved by the Ethics Committee, will be screened by the&#xD;
      investigators. Qualified subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and do not meet any of&#xD;
      the exclusion criteria will be randomly divided into the control group or the test group. The&#xD;
      subjects in the control group will accept the ureteral stent (manufacturer: Cook Ireland&#xD;
      Ltd.) during operation. The subjects in the test group will undergo surgery using the LED&#xD;
      light source system for endoscope and the supporting IRIS ureter kit. On the operation date,&#xD;
      the investigators will score the performance using a scale to evaluate the resolution of the&#xD;
      ureter in the whole process of operation. During the follow-up period, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of the device based on the results of vital signs, physical examination,&#xD;
      blood routine examination, routine urine examination, blood biochemistry, 12-lead ECG and&#xD;
      B-mode ultrasonography of urinary system.&#xD;
