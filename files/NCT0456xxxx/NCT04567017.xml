  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On-call work is an integral part of senior and junior patricians in a critical care&#xD;
      department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have examined the effect of sleep deprivation on physicians on call and the&#xD;
      impact of sleep deprivation on the quality of patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of these studies have shown that practitioners' concentration capacities have&#xD;
      deteriorated as the guard progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, few studies have looked at the physical activity of practitioners over a period of&#xD;
      on-call time (distance covered, number of steps,...), as well as other parameters than the&#xD;
      time spent in communication over the telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The age and seniority of practitioners seem to be factors that can influence these different&#xD;
      parameters, and there are few figures in the literature.&#xD;

      Practitioners and juniors will be informed of the study. If they agree to participate in the&#xD;
      study, each volunteer will receive an assessment of their cognitive functions before taking&#xD;
      up their duties via the Montr√©al Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) version 7.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The place of exercise (emergencies, anaesthesia and ICU Each participant will be equipped&#xD;
      with a connected watch with pedometer and cardiofrequencemeter function (Fitness Tracker&#xD;
      F07Max).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During his on-call period a questionnaire will be given to him, with socio-demographic data,&#xD;
      sleep duration and quality and the number of acts during the on-call period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The telephone data will be analysed by querying the internal telephone system of the Reims&#xD;
      University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the on-call period, the analysis of the data from the connected watch will be&#xD;
      analyzed and each volunteer will benefit from an evaluation of his cognitive functions via&#xD;
      the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) version 7.3 after taking up his duties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected during 2 shifts for each practitioner and junior&#xD;
