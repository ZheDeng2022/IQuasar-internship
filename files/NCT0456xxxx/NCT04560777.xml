  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acquired brain injury (ABI) in childhood are the cause of disabling motor, cognitive and&#xD;
      behavioural disorders, with severe consequences on the later development of autonomy and&#xD;
      learning, with long-term repercussions on independence for activities of daily living, and&#xD;
      social and professional integration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among cognitive disorders, executive function (EF) deficits are among the most frequent and&#xD;
      disabling, with major consequences on the development of autonomy and the course of schooling&#xD;
      and learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) could be an interesting&#xD;
      approach for the rehabilitation of these consequences. CO-OP is a performance-based treatment&#xD;
      approach for children and adults who experience difficulties performing the skills they want&#xD;
      to, need to or are expected to perform. CO-OP is a specifically tailored, active&#xD;
      client-centered approach that engages the individual at the meta-cognitive level to solve&#xD;
      performance problems. Focused on enabling success, the CO-OP approach employs collaborative&#xD;
      goal setting, dynamic performance analysis, cognitive strategy use, guided discovery, and&#xD;
      enabling principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown to be effective in a variety of populations, but has been little explored&#xD;
      in children with ABI. The hypothesis that CO-OP is effective in improving the occupational&#xD;
      performance and executive functioning of these children on a daily basis is emerging, but&#xD;
      needs to be confirmed. This study falls within this framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure the distance maintenance of the knowledge acquired through rehabilitation, as&#xD;
           well as the generalization and transfer into everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Maintenance of acquired knowledge&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Generalization and transfer&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Impact of a consolidation session on generalization and transfer&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gather the experience of family members/caregivers in accompanying their child in the&#xD;
           CO-OP process outside of rehabilitation sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Establish the parental educational style and identify whether there is a link between&#xD;
           the parental educational style and the commitment of the family members/caregivers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twelve participants will be included (aged 8 to 21 years old). Participants will have&#xD;
      different assessment times, before, during and after the CO-OP intervention (immediate&#xD;
      post-intervention, 2, 4 and 6-months post-intervention). Parents will be asked to answer&#xD;
      questionnaires and interview and to participate in certain CO-OP sessions, if they can.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will choose four objectives (problematic everyday life activities they want to improve).&#xD;
      Three will be worked on in CO-OP sessions, the fourth will be the control objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 14 sessions of rehabilitation with the CO-OP approach (2 sessions per&#xD;
      week for 7 weeks).&#xD;

    <description>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) is a method for writing personalized evaluation scales in order to quantify progress toward defined goals.&#xD;
GAS methodology consists in:&#xD;
Defining a rehabilitation goal;&#xD;
Choosing an observable behaviour that reflects the degree of goal attainment;&#xD;
Defining the patient's initial level with respect to the goal;&#xD;
Defining five goal attainment levels (ranging from a ''no change'' to a ''much better than expected outcome'');&#xD;
Evaluating the patient after a defined time interval;&#xD;
Calculating the overall attainment score for all the rehabilitation goals. A five-point scale is used: ''-2'' is the initial pretreatment (baseline) level, ''-1'' represents progression towards the goal without goal attainment, ''0'' is the expected level after treatment, (and therefore, the ''most likely'' level after treatment), ''+1'' represents a better outcome than expected, and ''+2'' is the best possible outcome that could have been expected for this goal.</description>

    <measure>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before baseline, at immediate post-intervention, at 2, 4 and 6-months post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>This semi-structured interview helps children/parents identify problematic occupations in different daily areas. COPM will be used: (1) To determine (only with the child) the 4 problematic occupations identified as the most important (3 will be used as target goals, while the 4 will serve as a control goal); (2) To determine changes in occupational performance in self-selected goals: children and parents will rated their performance and satisfaction associated with these 4 occupations.&#xD;
Performance and satisfaction are rated by children and parents on a scale of 1 to 10 (1= not at all able to perform the activity (performance) / not at all satisfied with the way the activity is performed (satisfaction); 10 = perfectly able to perform the activity (performance) / perfectly satisfied with the way the activity is performed (satisfaction). A difference of 2 points between pre- and post-intervention is clinically significant.</description>

    <description>The parent and teacher report forms of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF, or BRIEF-A for adults'version) provide an ecological assessment of executive functioning through its repercussions in family and school context. Currently, this questionnaire is the best validated and most widely used in children in various congenital, developmental or acquired conditions.&#xD;
The outcome measure is the Global Executive Composite score (GEC) T-Scores (Mean: 50; SD: 10; clinical range cutoff: T-Scores≥65).</description>

    <measure>Évaluation des Pratiques Éducatives Parentales (EPEP, Parental Childrearing Behavior Scale for French-Speaking Parents, Children, and Adolescents)</measure>
    <time_frame>one time before baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The EPEP represents an efficient solution to the search for conceptually and psychometrically sound instruments to assess parents' child-rearing behavior. A 5-point Likert-type scale is provided for each item ranging from &quot;never&quot; &quot;to always&quot; (explaining to parents that there are no right or wrong answers). The results are obtained by averaging the scores per subscale (8 subscales). The purpose of this evaluation is to define the parenting educational style: there are not a better or worse outcome per se.</description>

    <description>The objective of this questionnaire is to collect information on the use of CO-OP by family caregivers with the participant, outside of rehabilitation sessions. No scale of score, just a collection of factual facts.</description>

    <description>The general structure of the intervention will follow the original key principles of CO-OP, with some adjustments to adapt it to the specificities of the ABI population (14 CO-OP sessions vs 10 in the original protocol).&#xD;
The global strategy will be taught to the participant at the first session. The following sessions will be consisted of an process of implementation of the global strategy in the context of guided discovery to identify domain specific strategies to overcome performance ''breakdowns&quot; the participant will be experiencing when performing the self-selected tasks. In addition, &quot;homework&quot; will be assigned to encourage the application and practice of the cognitive strategies discovered during the intervention sessions. Parents will be invited to attend the sessions if it will be possible for them. In any case, the global strategy, as well as the progress of the child, will be explained to the parents.</description>
