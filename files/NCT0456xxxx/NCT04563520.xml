    <textblock>
      The purpose of the aPCC-emicizumab safety study is to prospectively investigate the safety&#xD;
      and hemostatic efficacy of a personalized dose of aPCC in children and adults with hemophilia&#xD;
      A and inhibitors on emicizumab prophylaxis during acute bleeding events or prior to&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;

      The previous standard of care for high titer antibody eradication in hemophilia A (HA)&#xD;
      included a labor-intensive, immune tolerance induction (ITI) regimen administered with&#xD;
      concomitant bypassing agent (BPA) prophylaxis, either daily recombinant activated factor VII&#xD;
      (rFVIIa) or at least 3 non-consecutive days of activated prothrombin complex concentrate&#xD;
      (aPCC) given intravenously (IV) each week.&#xD;

    <description>Personalized dose of aPCC-emicizumab will be administered to participants.

If there is less than a &quot;good' response in bleed event response efficacy as stated above at 48 hours or less than &quot;moderate&quot; for surgical event control, the local PI can consider the use of thrombin generation guided rFVIIa with max dose no more than 90 µg/kg/dose every 8 hours for 72 hours, with wean to occur for no more than 7 total days without further discussion with the PI.</description>

          -  Adequate hepatic function (total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN and both AST/ALT ≤3x ULN at&#xD;
             screening (excluding known Gilbert's)&#xD;

          -  Adequate renal function (≤2.5 x ULN and CrCl ≥30 mL/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inherited or acquired bleeding disorder other than hemophilia A excluding low VWF&#xD;
             (&gt;30% VWF:RCo or VWF:GP1bm)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous or current treatment for thromboembolic disease or signs of thromboembolic&#xD;
             disease (excluding previous resolved line associated thrombosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Conditions that may increase risk of bleeding or thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of clinically significant hypersensitivity associated with monoclonal antibody&#xD;
             therapies or components of the emicizumab injection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV infection with CD4 count &lt;200 cells/µL within 24 weeks prior to screening.&#xD;
             Testing not required if &lt;35 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of systemic immunomodulators at enrollment or planned use during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are at high risk for TMA (for example, have a previous medical/family&#xD;
             history of TMA), in the investigator's judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent disease, treatment, or abnormality in clinical laboratory tests that could&#xD;
             interfere with the conduct of the study, may pose additional risk, or would, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, preclude the participant's safe participation in and&#xD;
             completion of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Every effort will be made to include participants that are considering minor and major&#xD;
             procedures over the next 2 years to capture this important data with the goal of 10&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
