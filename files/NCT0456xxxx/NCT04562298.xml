    <time_frame>90 days post infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) refers to a drug-related toxicity during treatment with the drug, the severity of which is clinically unacceptable, limiting the further escalation of drug dose. An adverse event refers to any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product (investigational or non-investigational), which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) after administration</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years post infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR or PR after treatment via LCAR-M23 cell infusion, and the objective tumor response rate will be calculated for patients with measurable disease as per RECIST 1.1 criteria only.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR) after administration</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years post infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of Response (DOR) is defined as the time from the first documentation of response (PR or better) to the first documentation of disease progression evidence (as per RECIST 1.1 criteria) of the responders (who achieve PR or better response).</description>

    <description>Prior to infusion of LCAR-M23, subjects will receive a premedication regimen (intravenous infusion of cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 and fludarabine 30 mg/m2 once daily for 3 days; fludarabine dose reduction to 25 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide to 250 mg/m2 are allowed if the subject' s creatinine clearance is 50-70 mL/min/1.73 m2). A single dose, single Infusion of LCAR-M23 is scheduled 5 to 7 days after the initiation of the premedication regimen.</description>
