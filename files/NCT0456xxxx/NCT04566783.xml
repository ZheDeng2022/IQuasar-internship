      Investigation of (possible etiological) factors associated with PGAD symptomatology as well&#xD;
      as description of comorbid disorders subjects with PGAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) is a presumably rare, although debilitating&#xD;
      condition, which was first defined at the beginning of this century and has not yet found&#xD;
      consideration by any of the international classification systems of diseases. PGAD is&#xD;
      commonly characterized by persistent and unwanted sensations of genital arousal which are not&#xD;
      related to subjective feelings of sexual desire or arousal. Affected patients which are&#xD;
      predominantly women can suffer tremendously. The lack of basic research on the etiology of&#xD;
      PGAD leads to insufficient therapeutical approaches.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The entire approach is of multimodal and explorative nature as only very limited information&#xD;
      on this disease is available so far (hypotheses generating). Moreover, the aim of the study&#xD;
      is to characterize PGAD patients in terms of their biography (e.g. trauma), comorbidities and&#xD;
      life quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological/psychiatric examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gynecological/urological examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Structural and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There is a morphological correlate of PGAD that affects or represents a neuronal&#xD;
           structure leading to altered perception of genital sensation (e.g. Tarlov cysts,&#xD;
           varices, …).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is a functional correlate of PGAD in the central nervous system (CNS) indicating a&#xD;
           hyperfunction (excitation or disinhibition) or hypofunction (inhibition) of specific&#xD;
           brain areas including hypothalamus, sensory cortex of the genitals and secondary brain&#xD;
           areas, brain stem centers (e.g. raphe nuclei) and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with PGAD show an elevated rate of previous pharmacological treatment with&#xD;
           drugs that may alter the central processing of sexual/genital perception or reveal a&#xD;
           specific pattern of comorbid diseases (e.g. affective or somatoform disorders) that may&#xD;
           predispose other disorders such as PGAD, pain disorders etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results and exploitation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project will help to identify clinical and neurobiological correlates of&#xD;
      persistent genital arousal (PGAD) and will provide&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a deeper clinical, (neuro)psychological and (neuro)biological understanding of PGAD&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. help to identify related etiopathological mechanisms of PGAD&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. inform clinicians and (sex) therapists on diagnostic issues and promising treatment&#xD;
           targets in PGAD derived from comprehensive clinical and experimental measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. stimulate further neurobiological and clinical research in the field of PGAD, leading to&#xD;
           further national and international cooperation and applications&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. a considerable number of publications in leading scientific journals and raise awareness&#xD;
           of a rare disease not only among all clinicians dealing with sexual problems but also&#xD;
           general practitioners and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigation of (possible etiological) factors associated with PGAD symptomatology as well&#xD;
      as description of comorbid disorders subjects with PGAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical (psychological, neurological and gynecological/urological) data is analyzed using a&#xD;
      descriptive approach of frequencies and mean values of diverse clinical findings as well as a&#xD;
      group comparison (patients versus healthy controls) using respective statistical analyses&#xD;
      such as ttests, chi-square test and others after having tested for normal distribution where&#xD;
      necessary. MRT data is analyzed using state-of-the-art special software (SPM) including group&#xD;
      comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional study of a rare disease. At MHH usually 10 new patients occur per&#xD;
      year. The investigator tries to include as many patients as possible and will probably&#xD;
      achieve higher numbers by advertising the study and using data banks of already existing&#xD;
      cases. Due to the presumably rare number of people affected with PGAD and the very few&#xD;
      existing publications which are mostly case reports and the even fewer PGAD related MRI data&#xD;
      a statistically neat sample size computing is not simple. The investigator cannot refer to&#xD;
      prior carried out PGAD related MRI studies and to publications mentioning PGAD sample sizes.&#xD;
      However, for MRI studies methodological work investigating the reliability of statistical&#xD;
      effect in fMRI studies exist. An article by Thirion in 2007 shows that a sample size between&#xD;
      20 and 30 subjects per group is sufficient to detect statistical effects. This is also in&#xD;
      accordance with common practice in fMRI aiming at at least 20 subject per group at which&#xD;
      results become quite stable (Murphy &amp; Garavan 2004) Thus, the investigator aims at a sample&#xD;
      size of 25 subjects per group. To account for potential dropouts (~10%, mainly due to&#xD;
      excessive head movement in the MRI scanner) it is planned to include approximately 30&#xD;
      subjects per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion of Perceived / Expected Risks and Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When considering all exclusion criteria for MRI there are no risks known for using a magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging system. Clinical and (neuro)psychological testing might be perceived&#xD;
      stressful by some participants and therefore may lead to a temporary increase in blood&#xD;
      pressure and/or heart rate that will normally end after testing. Clinical examination&#xD;
      (neurological and gynecological/urological) might lead to discomfort in some participants.&#xD;
      Besides the neurological examination which can result in uncomfortable feelings (e.g. minor&#xD;
      pain) during the ENoG-testing and Pudendus-SEP and that will normally end immediately after&#xD;
      testing the clinical examination is pain-free. Blood Sampling might be painful and lead to&#xD;
      hematoma. The amount of blood is low (approx. 30ml). Any serious damage to the organism&#xD;
      during clinical examination and blood sampling is very unlikely.&#xD;
