    <textblock>
      Low volume sprint exercise training has been shown to reduce body fat despite small total&#xD;
      energy expenditure (for ref see Gillen and Gibala 2014). IL-6 has been shown to increase&#xD;
      adipose tissue lipolysis in vitro. Therefore, in an initial study on effects of sprint&#xD;
      exercise on adipose tissue metabolism the investigators will examine acute short-term&#xD;
      exercise effects on adipose tissue IL-6 exchange.&#xD;

      PURPOSE: Low volume sprint exercise training has been shown to reduce body fat despite small&#xD;
      total energy expenditure (for ref see Gillen and Gibala 2014). IL-6 has been shown to&#xD;
      increase adipose tissue lipolysis in vitro. Therefore, in an initial study on effects of&#xD;
      sprint exercise on adipose tissue metabolism the investigators examined acute short-term&#xD;
      effects on adipose tissue IL-6 exchange.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Four female and four male subjects perform repeated sprint exercise (3 x 30s with 20&#xD;
      min rest between; Wingate-test). Blood samples are repeatedly obtained, up to 120 min after&#xD;
      the last sprint (9 min post ex), from catheters inserted percutaneously into brachial artery&#xD;
      and a superficial subcutaneous vein on the anterior abdominal wall providing access to the&#xD;
      venous drainage from the subcutaneous adipose tissue and analyzed for IL-6 by ELISA and&#xD;
      lactate by spectrophotometry. Fat biopsies from the stomach will be obtained before, 15 min&#xD;
      and 120 min after the last sprint. Blood flow will be determined by administration of&#xD;
      Xenon-133 in the adipose tissue of the stomach. The release rate of Xenon-133 will be&#xD;
      registrated continuously during the total investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUPPORT: This study is supported by grants from the Swedish National Center for Research in&#xD;
      Sports&#xD;
