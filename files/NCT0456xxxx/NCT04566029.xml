  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy has become an essential therapeutic weapon against many cancers. Control point&#xD;
      inhibitors (CPI, PD-1/PD-L1) have shown efficacy in the therapeutic management of tumors in&#xD;
      the bladder in progression after administering platinum derivatives. But only 20% of patients&#xD;
      get any clinical benefit from these heavy treatments in the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treating metastatic patients without distinction means taking a considerable risk of toxicity&#xD;
      and generates major costs. It is therefore urgent and important to exceed the current&#xD;
      criteria for using immunotherapy. Recent studies have shown the interest of studying&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota as a marker of the efficacy of immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that the proteomic signature of the intestinal microbiota in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinomas who responded to&#xD;
      immunotherapies was special, and has very different characteristics from that of patients&#xD;
      with the same pathology who do not respond to immunotherapy.&#xD;

    <time_frame>At the inclusion visit on Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D (EuroQoL -5 Dimension) self-report questionnaire will be used to measure the quality of life under various health conditions and treatments according to 5 dimensions: mobility, personal autonomy, everyday living activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. There are 3 versions of this questionnaire: EQ-5D-3L with 3 levels of severity for each dimension, EQ-5D-5L with 5 levels of severity for each dimension and EQ-5D-Y which is the children's version. Each version is available in several languages. The questionnaire has 2 pages : page one with 5 items representing the 5 dimensions and page two with a visual analogue scale graded from 0 to 100 with 100 as the best possible state of health. For each dimension the patient must indicate what condition he/she is in. When all the answers are combined, a 5-figure number is obtained, indicating the patient's health condition. For example, the number 11111 shows that there are no problems in any of the 5 dimensions.</description>

    <description>The NCI PRO-CTCAE (National Cancer Institute - Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) scale will be used to evaluate the side-effects of treatment so that they can be declared for clinical studies in cancerology. The measurement of the result is declared directly by the patient based on the last seven days of treatment. The choice of terms and the categories of toxicity depend on the adverse events targeted. A French version is available on the following link: https://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/pro-ctcae/countries.html. The questionnaire for this particular study will be created on the PROCTCAE website via the option &quot;build a custom form&quot; (https://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/pro-ctcae/builder.html). 20 symptoms or side effects that may occur during treatment will be selected to build a patient-reported outcomes questionnaire adapted to the study.</description>

    <description>Version 4.03 of the NCI-CTCAE (National Cancer Institute- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) scale in French will be used to declare adverse events. It has 26 categories describing over 300 undesirable events, graded according to their severity (5 grades, each with its unique medical term). Grade 1 = Slight; asymptomatic or slight symptoms, only diagnosed upon clinical examination, requiring no treatment. Grade 2 = Moderate; requiring minimum local or non-invasive treatment; interfering with instrumental activities of daily living.Grade 3 = Severe or medically significant but vital prognosis is not compromised. Indication for hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation, invalidating, interfering with simple activities of daily living. Grade 4 = vital prognosis compromised, requiring emergency management. Grade 5 = Death due to the adverse event. Not all grades are appropriate for all adverse events and therefore some are listed with a choice of below Grade 5.</description>

It has 26 categories describing over 300 undesirable events, graded according to their severity (5 grades, each with its unique medical term). Grade 1 = Slight; asymptomatic or slight symptoms, only diagnosed upon clinical examination, requiring no treatment. Grade 2 = Moderate; requiring minimum local or non-invasive treatment; interfering with instrumental activities of daily living.Grade 3 = Severe or medically significant but vital prognosis is not compromised. Indication for hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation, invalidating, interfering with simple activities of daily living. Grade 4 = vital prognosis compromised, requiring emergency management. Grade 5 = Death due to the adverse event. Not all grades are appropriate for all adverse events and therefore some are listed with a choice of below Grade 5.</description>
