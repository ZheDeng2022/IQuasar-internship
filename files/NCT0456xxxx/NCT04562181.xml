      The first objective of this work is to compare the performances of three electroencephalogram&#xD;
      based indices, the qCON index, the qNOX index and the bispectral index (BIS), in patients&#xD;
      receiving gastrointestinal surgery during first postoperative night. Secondly, their&#xD;
      behaviors under general anesthesia are also pointed out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qCON and qNOX indices are implemented in an Angel 6000 monitor (WellHealth Medical Co&#xD;
      Ltd., Shenzhen, China), and BIS indices are recorded in a BIS monitor (Aspect Medical&#xD;
      Systems, Norwood, MA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be obtained from 30 patients scheduled for selective surgery undergoing general&#xD;
      anesthesia with a combination of propofol, sufentanil and cis-atracurium in the first&#xD;
      Hospital of China Medical University. The values of qCON, qNOX and BIS were statistically&#xD;
      compared. The qCON, qNOX indices are recorded together with BIS during the whole operation&#xD;
      period (Awake- Anesthesia-Recovery stages), as well as during the first night postoperatively&#xD;
      (from 8:00pm to 06:00am). The values of qCON, qNOX and BIS were statistically compared. The&#xD;
      Consistency evaluation will be conducted between qCON/qNOX and BIS.&#xD;

      This study was approved by the ethics committee of China Medical University. The study will&#xD;
      be carried out in the 1st Hospital of China Medical University. Thirty patients scheduled for&#xD;
      selective gastrointestinal surgery undergoing general anesthesia will be enrolled. There are&#xD;
      two steps in this study: In step1, The qCON and qNOX indices will be continuously recorded&#xD;
      throughout the whole surgery, using a Angel-6000 monitor (WellHealth Medical Co Ltd.,&#xD;
      Shenzhen, China). Meanwhile, the bispectral index (BIS) will be recorded using Aspect BIS&#xD;
      monitor (Aspect Medical Systems, Norwood, MA, USA) in the same patient in order to compare&#xD;
      with qCON and qNOX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general anesthesia protocol is as following: Anesthesia will be induced with bolus&#xD;
      infusion of propofol, sufentanil and cis-atracurium intravenously. The patients will be&#xD;
      intubated subsequently. TOF (T4/T1) value will be observed throughout using muscle relaxation&#xD;
      monitoring (GE healthcare, USA). Anesthesia are maintained with a combination of sevoflurane,&#xD;
      propofol, sufentanil and cis-atracurium. Dosage of the anesthetics will be adjusted according&#xD;
      to the BIS value and hemodynamics fluctuating. Anti-emetic and opioids will be routinely&#xD;
      administrated prior to abdominal closure. Neostigmine will be administrated for reversing the&#xD;
      residual neuromuscular blockade after the patient get his breath. Tracheal extubating is&#xD;
      indicated by a TOF value above 70% in addition to other physical signs. The qCON, qNOX and&#xD;
      BIS indices will be continuously recorded before anesthesia induction (fully awake), during&#xD;
      the operation (sleep) and after the operation (fully recovery). The dosage of propofol,&#xD;
      sufentanil and cis-atracurium used in the operation are also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In step2, all these three electroencephalogram-based indices are collected again at the 1st&#xD;
      postoperative night. The Angel-6000 and Aspect BIS monitor will be placed again to the&#xD;
      identical patient who have received the operation on the daytime. Data collecting period is&#xD;
      from 8:00 pm to 6:00 am the next day. Sleep was defined as the duration of BIS value below 80&#xD;
      in the 10 hours of monitoring (from 8:00pm to 6:00am).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are specific requirements for management with regards to postoperative pain or any&#xD;
      other anesthesia related complications, name and the dosage of the treatments will also be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
