  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial followed by a phase II randomized trial. The purpose of phase I study&#xD;
      is the feasibility of treating patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;
      related to COVID-19 infection (COVID-19) with cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
      (MSC). The purpose of the phase II trial is to compare the effect of MSC with standard of&#xD;
      care in these patients. MSCs are a type of stem cells that can be taken from umbilical cord&#xD;
      blood and grown into many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other&#xD;
      diseases. The MSCs being used for infusion in this trial are collected from healthy,&#xD;
      unrelated donors and are stored and grown in a laboratory. Giving MSC infusions may help&#xD;
      control the symptoms of COVID-19 related ARDS.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety of administering cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cell (CB-MSC)&#xD;
      infusions for treatment of COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. In the group of patients who present intubated on ventilator support, assess the&#xD;
      proportion that are able to be successfully extubated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. In the group of patients who present requiring supplemental oxygen but otherwise&#xD;
      breathing without assistance, assess the rate of progression to intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Estimate the survival rate at day 30 post treatment separately by group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the treatment effect on clinical parameters, oxygenation and respiratory&#xD;
      parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVa. Resolution of fever. IVb. Changes in oxygen demand (increased oxygen saturation at&#xD;
      similar fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] or decreased FiO2 requirement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVc. Progression to mechanical ventilation. IVd. Length of mechanical ventilation. IVe.&#xD;
      Decrease in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in intubated patients. IVf. Decrease in&#xD;
      FiO2 in intubated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the treatment effect on laboratory markers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Va. Complete blood count. Vb. C-reactive protein (CRP). Vc. Ferritin. Vd. D dimer. Ve.&#xD;
      Procalcitonin. Vf. Cytokine levels. VI. Estimate hospitalization and intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) stay. VII. Report on study related adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently not shipping cells outside of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PILOT STUDY: Patients receive MSCs intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on day 1. Patients may&#xD;
      receive a second infusion of MSCs within 7 days after the first infusion per physician&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II STUDY: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive MSCs IV over 1-2 hours on day 1. Patients may receive a second&#xD;
      infusion of MSCs within 7 days after the first infusion per physician discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 7, 14, 30, 60, and&#xD;
      months 6 and 12.&#xD;
