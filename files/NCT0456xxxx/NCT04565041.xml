  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      University of California, Los Angeles researchers will recruit healthy participants and&#xD;
      anxious participants (those diagnosed with social anxiety disorder) age 18-55 years old to&#xD;
      participate in a study examining whether the ability of social support figure reminders to&#xD;
      enhance the extinction of fear in healthy participants extends to those with anxiety&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being recruited from the UCLA community (healthy participants, n = 50) or referred by&#xD;
      treatment providers at the Anxiety and Depression Research Center at UCLA (anxious&#xD;
      participants, n = 50) and undergoing a telephone screening and in-person screening, 100&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in the study. During the experiment, all participants will&#xD;
      undergo the same procedures: undergoing a fear extinction procedure in which threatening&#xD;
      cues--cues that predict electric shock--will be paired with either an image of a social&#xD;
      support figure (provided by participants) or an image of a smiling stranger. These pairings&#xD;
      will be presented repeatedly in the absence of shock in order for fear extinction to occur.&#xD;
      Participants will return for a follow-up test to determine if fear extinction was successful.&#xD;
