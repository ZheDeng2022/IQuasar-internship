      Eyes from 80 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the assigned treatment,&#xD;
      dexamethasone insert placed at the time of surgery, or topical prednisolone acetate 1%&#xD;
      therapy prescribed on a tapering dose schedule post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Males and Females 18 years and older with 1)Presence of a visually significant cataract with&#xD;
      plans to undergo clear cornea cataract surgery with phacoemulsification and implantation of a&#xD;
      posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL), and potential postoperative Snellen pinhole&#xD;
      corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) of at least 20/200 in both eyes and 2) 10 patients&#xD;
      with mild-to-moderate primary open angle glaucoma and a visually significant cataract with&#xD;
      plans to undergo clear cornea cataract surgery with phacoemulsification and implantation of a&#xD;
      posterior chamber Intraocular Len (IOL) combined with a Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery&#xD;
      (MIGS) procedure in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will consist of eye exam with ocular photos from an Optical Coherence Tomography&#xD;
