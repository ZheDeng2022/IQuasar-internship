      Settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly selected from patients who will come to Oral and Maxillofacial&#xD;
      Radiology department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University for CBCT imaging for implant&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic imaging of the patients by CBCT machine will be done at Oral and Maxillofacial&#xD;
      Radiology Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University. While the steps of impression&#xD;
      taking followed by stone dental cast pouring, then surface laser optical scanning of the&#xD;
      patients' stone cast will be done at the Removable Prosthodontics Department, Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry, Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of this study is accuracy and reliability of non-explored new registration&#xD;
      technique (automatic registration) versus commonly used registration method (point-based&#xD;
      registration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables involved in this study includes: the CBCT image resolution, the accuracy of the&#xD;
      surface optical scanner, the software used, the number of points used for registration (in&#xD;
      point-based registration), the skills of the investigator who will carry out the registration&#xD;
      procedures. To cancel the effect of these variables, Investigators are going to standardize&#xD;
      the CBCT resolution, the surface optical scanner used, the software used in both registration&#xD;
      techniques, the number of points used for point-based registration while regarding the&#xD;
      investigator factor more than one will carry out the same procedures to assure the&#xD;
      reliability and validity of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources and management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - CBCT scanning: Each patient will be scanned by CBCT machine (Planmeca Promax 3D Mid -&#xD;
      Asentajankatu, Helsinki, Finland) with a field of view that covers the entire jaw. Image will&#xD;
      be exported and stored in DICOM (digital imaging and communication in medicine) format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Cast scanning: Dental cast will be obtained by taking impressions using alginate impression&#xD;
      material and filling the impressions with plaster. The plaster cast will then be scanned by a&#xD;
      3D laser scanner to obtain digital image of the dental arch that will be exported and stored&#xD;
      as STL (standard tessellation language) file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Image registration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DICOM file of CBCT image and STL file of digital dental model will be imported to a dental 3D&#xD;
      planning software (Blue Sky Plan, Blueskybio). Image registration of digital cast to CBCT&#xD;
      images will be performed for each patient by two methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Automatic registration After importing the STL (standard tessellation language) file of&#xD;
           the digital model, direct registration function of the software will be used to&#xD;
           automatically perform the registration process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Point-based registration Using point registration function of the software, three points&#xD;
           will be selected at the same areas on the image of dental cast and CBCT image. Then,&#xD;
           registration of both images will be automatically processed to finalize the&#xD;
           superimposition of digital dental model to maxillofacial model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      potential sources of bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigators are going to standardize the CBCT resolution, the surface optical scanner&#xD;
           used, the software used in both registration techniques, the number of points used for&#xD;
           point-based registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registration will be performed by two oral radiologists independently; blinded from the&#xD;
           results of each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One of the radiologists will perform the registration twice with two weeks interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra-observer and inter-observer will be evaluated to assure the reliability and&#xD;
           validity of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      investigators are planning a study of a continuous response variable from independent control&#xD;
      and experimental subjects with 1 control(s) per experimental subject. In a previous study by&#xD;
      Sang-Hoon in 2014 the response within each subject group was normally distributed with&#xD;
      standard deviation 0.04. If the true difference in the experimental and control means is&#xD;
      0.07, investigators will need to study 12 subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis&#xD;
      that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal with probability&#xD;
      (power) 0.8. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis&#xD;
      is 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of quantitative variables in the analyses The study involves two main groups; one&#xD;
      for automatic registration and one for point based registration. Assessment of deviation in&#xD;
      both groups will be made using a third party software and will be expressed in form of mean Â±&#xD;
      standard deviation in mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed using IBM SPSS advanced statistics (Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Sciences), version 26 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Continuous data will be described using mean&#xD;
      and standard deviation. Comparison between continuous data will be performed using t-test and&#xD;
      ANOVA will be used to test interaction of variables. A p-value less than or equal to 0.05&#xD;
      will be considered statistically significant and all tests will be two tailed. Statistical&#xD;
      power of the study will be set at 80 % with 95 % confidence level.&#xD;
