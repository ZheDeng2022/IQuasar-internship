      This study is a single center, single arm, open study design. The main purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the tolerance and efficacy of SHR1701 with synchronous radiotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have failed after systematic&#xD;
      treatment. Large fraction radiotherapy is given to all lesions as much as possible, and&#xD;
      low-dose radiotherapy is given to the lesions that cannot be tolerated or have no obvious&#xD;
      benefit.&#xD;
