  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To analyse driving behavior of individuals with type 1 diabetes in eu- and progressive&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia while driving in a real car. Based on the driving variables provided by the car&#xD;
      the investigators aim at establishing algorithms capable of discriminating eu- and&#xD;
      hypoglycemic driving patterns using machine learning neural networks (deep machine learning&#xD;
      classifiers).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoglycaemia is among the most relevant acute complications of diabetes mellitus. During&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia physical, psychomotor, executive and cognitive function significantly&#xD;
      deteriorate. These are important prerequisites for safe driving. Accordingly, hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      has consistently been shown to be associated with an increased risk of driving accidents and&#xD;
      is, therefore, regarded as one of the relevant factors in traffic safety. Despite important&#xD;
      developments in the field of diabetes technology, the problem of hypoglycaemia during driving&#xD;
      persists. Automotive technology is highly dynamic, and fully autonomous driving might, in the&#xD;
      end, resolve the issue of hypoglycemia-induced accidents. However, autonomous driving (level&#xD;
      4 or 5) is likely to be broadly available only to a substantially later time point than&#xD;
      previously thought due to increasing concerns of safety associated with this technology.&#xD;
      Therefore, solutions bridging the upcoming period by more rapidly and directly addressing the&#xD;
      problem of hypoglycemia-associated traffic incidents are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the supposition that driving behaviour differs significantly between euglycaemic state and&#xD;
      hypoglycaemic state, the investigators assume that different driving patterns in hypoglycemia&#xD;
      compared to euglycemia can be used to generate hypoglycemia detection models using machine&#xD;
      learning neural networks (deep machine learning classifiers).&#xD;
