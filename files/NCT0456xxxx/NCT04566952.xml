  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PARP inhibitors have changed the treatment paradigm of ovarian cancer. Most patients using&#xD;
      PARP(poly-ADP ribose polymerase) inhibitors will suffer different grades of adverse&#xD;
      events(AEs), followed by dose reduction. It has not been reported whether the dose-reduced&#xD;
      olaparib as maintenance treatment have an impact on efficacy. Both PAOLA-1 and AVANOVA 2&#xD;
      studies showed that combined PARP inhibitors and antiangiogenic drugs have synergistic&#xD;
      anti-tumor effect. Anlotinib is a novel multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can&#xD;
      inhibit VEGFR(vascular endothelial growth factor receptor), FGFR(fibroblast growth factor&#xD;
      receptor), PDGFR(platelet-derived growth factor receptor) α/β, c-Kit, and Ret. And anlotinib&#xD;
      has been approved as orphan drug designations for treatment of ovarian cancer by FDA in 2015.&#xD;
      Previous studies showed that anlotinib had manageable toxicity and promising antitumor&#xD;
      effect. Our study is expected to investigate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib combined&#xD;
      with dose-reduced olaparib as maintenance treatment in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian&#xD;
      cancer patients.&#xD;

      This study is a single-arm, single-center, exploratory phase II study to observe the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of anlotinib combined with dose-reduced olaparib in patients with&#xD;
      platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal&#xD;
      cancer. We will enroll the subjects who are treated with olaparib as maintenance treatment&#xD;
      followed by dose reduction due to adverse events. The primary end points are progression free&#xD;
      survival and adverse events. The secondary end points include objective response rate,&#xD;
      disease control rate, overall survival, time from enrollment to first subsequent treatment,&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
