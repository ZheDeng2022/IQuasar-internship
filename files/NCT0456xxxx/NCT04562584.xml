  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to test the accuracy of pulse oximeters (devices intended to&#xD;
      measure oxygen saturation in blood noninvasively) during mild, moderate and severe hypoxia (a&#xD;
      lower-than-normal concentration of oxygen in arterial blood); ie, a range of arterial HbO2&#xD;
      saturations from 100 to down to 70%. This is done by comparing the reading of the pulse&#xD;
      oximeter during brief, steady state hypoxia with a gold-standard measurement of blood&#xD;
      oxyhemoglobin (hemoglobin carrying oxygen) saturation, that is arterial blood sample&#xD;
      processed in a laboratory.&#xD;
