  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to determine (1) the feasibility of tethered capsule OCT&#xD;
      esophageal imaging in the Parkinson's Disease population; (2) the morphologic changes in the&#xD;
      enteric nervous system of the esophagus in patients with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the esophageal pathology findings as imaged with&#xD;
      tethered capsule microscopy in subjects with Parkinson Disease. Images from patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson disease will be compared to our previously obtained images in healthy subjects to&#xD;
      establish the spectrum of esophageal pathologies occurring in patients with Parkinson disease&#xD;
      by OCT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of imaging internal luminal organs, like the esophagus, OCT light is delivered&#xD;
      via a long catheter. We have developed a new technique termed Tethered Capsule Endomicroscopy&#xD;
      (TCE). TCE involves swallowing a tethered capsule that acquires cross-sectional microscopic&#xD;
      images of the entire esophagus as it traverses the luminal organ via peristalsis or is pulled&#xD;
      up towards the mouth using tether. The catheter is connected to the imaging system, and the&#xD;
      side-viewing optical beam rotates either proximally by a motorized rotary joint or distally&#xD;
      by a micro-motor, effectuating circular scanning of the lumen wall. Three-dimensional OCT of&#xD;
      the entire length of the lumen can be acquired by simultaneous rotation and translation of&#xD;
      the focused OCT beam creating a helical pattern.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Imaging data is collected during the procedure, and analyzed within 1 year of collection.</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility will be determined by at least one of the following parameters: 1) assessing image adequacy (resolution, contrast, etc.) qualitatively, 2) confirm morphologic changes in the enteric nervous system of the esophagus compared to matched controls. (This is a comparison performed by the PI against historical controls, as this imaging technique is to novel to have standard quality grading.)</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to swallow the TCE. They may use mild numbing spray, and lubrication spray to help swallowing. Imaging will be conducted once the TCE is past the pharynx. We will advance the TCE until the stomach and then slowly pull the TCE back up the esophagus. This may be repeated twice.</description>
