  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the tetravalent&#xD;
      recombinant Norovirus vaccine at different doses, to initially explore the immunogenicity of&#xD;
      the vaccine, and to determine the appropriate dose of the product for later clinical&#xD;
      trials.This trial adopts the seamless design of phase I/IIa, which is carried out in two&#xD;
      phases, phase I and phase IIa, phase I is the age/dose climbing phase, and phase IIa is the&#xD;
      dose expansion phase.It is planned to enroll 580 subjects, divided into 5 age groups,&#xD;
      including: young adults (18-59 years old, 60 people), adolescents (6 -17 years old, 60&#xD;
      people), and elderly (≥60 years old, 160 people) , Toddlers (2-5 years old, 140), infants (6&#xD;
      weeks to 23 months old, 160).The test vaccine contains recombinant HuNoV GI.1-VP1 protein,&#xD;
      HuNoV GII.3-VP1 protein, HuNoV GII.4-VP1 protein, HuNoV GII.17-VP1 protein, and each dose&#xD;
      contains 12.5μg/type/0.5ml/bottle (Low dose), 25μg/type/0.5ml/piece (high dose).&#xD;

      A single-center, randomized, blinded, multi-cohort, placebo-controlled trial design was&#xD;
      adopted.This trial adopts the seamless design of phase I/IIa, which is carried out in two&#xD;
      phases, phase I and phase IIa, phase I is the age/dose climbing phase, and phase IIa is the&#xD;
      dose expansion phase.It is planned to enroll 580 subjects, divided into 5 age groups,&#xD;
      including: young adults (18-59 years old, 60 people), adolescents (6 -17 years old, 60&#xD;
      people), and elderly (≥60 years old, 160 people) , Toddlers (2-5 years old, 140), infants (6&#xD;
      weeks to 23 months old, 160).Research phase and trial grouping: age/dose climbing phase: 340&#xD;
      subjects are planned to be enrolled in Liuzhou City, and they will be enrolled in the group&#xD;
      according to the age order of young adults → adolescents and old people → toddlers → infants&#xD;
      and young children. There are 10 cohorts, randomly divided into experimental group (low-dose&#xD;
      or high-dose), placebo group (containing aluminum), and the random ratio of each entry stage&#xD;
      is 2:1. Among them, infants and the elderly will be added a placebo group without aluminum&#xD;
      adjuvant, test group (low dose or high dose), placebo group (aluminum), placebo&#xD;
      (aluminum-free), the random ratio is 2:1:1; Dose expansion stage: It is planned to enroll 240&#xD;
      subjects in Rong'an County. The elderly, infants, and infants will be divided into 3 cohorts,&#xD;
      and each age group will be randomly divided into low-dose or high-dose groups, with a random&#xD;
      ratio of 1:1.According to the order of young adults → adolescents and elderly → toddlers →&#xD;
      infants and young children, the dose is from low to high, and the investigator (including the&#xD;
      main investigator and the field investigator) will review the safety of the low-dose/placebo&#xD;
      group 7 days after the first dose. After the safety data is confirmed, you can enter the&#xD;
      high-dose/placebo group for this age group to explore. After DSMB examines the safety data of&#xD;
      the first dose of young and middle-aged people to 30 days after the full exemption and&#xD;
      confirms safety, they can enter the adolescent and elderly age group; DSMB examines the&#xD;
      safety and confirms the safety of the first dose of adolescents and the elderly to 30 days&#xD;
      after the full exemption After that, you can enter the infant age group; the investigator&#xD;
      (including the main investigator and the field investigator) will review the safety data 7&#xD;
      days after the first dose of the infant low-dose/placebo group and confirm the safety, then&#xD;
      you can enter the infant age group explore. The three age groups (cohorts 4 and 6, 7 and 8, 9&#xD;
      and 10) of the elderly, toddlers, and infants can be entered into the corresponding age after&#xD;
      the DSMB reviews the safety data of the first dose to 30 days after the full exemption and&#xD;
      confirms the safety. In the dose expansion phase (cohorts 11, 12, 13), 80 subjects were&#xD;
      enrolled in each cohort (of which, 40 were vaccinated with low-dose trial vaccine and 40 were&#xD;
      vaccinated with high-dose trial vaccine).&#xD;
