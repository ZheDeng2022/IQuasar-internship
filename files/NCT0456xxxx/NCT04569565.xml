    <textblock>
      Refractory ascites (fluid build up in the abdomen that can not bet managed by medications)&#xD;
      occurs in at least 10% of patients with end stage liver disease (cirrhosis). Two major&#xD;
      options for management include large volume paracentesis (LVP)-drainage with a needle through&#xD;
      the abdominal wall) and placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt&#xD;
      (TIPS)-re-directs blood flow across the cirrhotic liver), Not all patients are candidates for&#xD;
      TIPS or transplant, are left with LVP as the only long-term treatment option. Patients listed&#xD;
      for transplant require LVP while they wait for transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LVP can cause pain, bleeding, leakage from the drain site and frequent hospital visits which&#xD;
      result in health care cost as well as patient and caregiver fatigue. In between the drains,&#xD;
      living with ascites can negatively affect quality of life because of discomfort and&#xD;
      limitations. Patients with ascites are more malnourished than those without.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specialized drains tunnelled under the skin, are used in patents with ascites due to cancer&#xD;
      (malignant). There are not many studies evaluating these drains in patients with cirrhosis,&#xD;
      One of the reasons for the lack of studies is the potential for infection. As opposed to&#xD;
      malignant ascites, cirrhotic ascites generally has a low protein content, a risk factor for&#xD;
      development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). From available studies, infection&#xD;
      rates in cirrhotic patients with tunnelled drains who are not on antibiotics are estimated at&#xD;
      10% (4/40). Infection rates on antibiotic prophylaxis would be expected to be lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study includes the evaluation of indwelling tunnelled PleurX catheters as an&#xD;
      alternative option. The hypothesis is that with careful monitoring of kidney function and&#xD;
      prevention of infection with antibiotics, PleurX catheters will be safe, cost-effective and&#xD;
      improve quality of life and nutritional status compared to the standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ascites not manageable by diuretic therapy occurs in at least 10% of patients with cirrhosis.&#xD;
      Two major options for management include intermittent large volume paracentesis (LVP) and&#xD;
      placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Unfortunately, not all&#xD;
      patients are candidates for TIPS. Those unable to receive TIPS or transplant are left with&#xD;
      LVP as the only long-term treatment option. Non-TIPS candidates who are listed for transplant&#xD;
      require LVP as a bridge to transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LVP is performed by inserting a non-tunnelled drain, removing ascites fluid via, replacing&#xD;
      ascites fluid losses &gt;5 litres(L) with albumin, removing the drain. It can be associated with&#xD;
      pain, bleeding, leakage from the site and frequent hospital visits. In between the drains,&#xD;
      living with ascites can negatively affect quality of life, particularly the physical&#xD;
      discomfort and limitation component scales. In addition, patients with tense ascites have&#xD;
      lower protein intake and are more malnourished than those without. Fluid removal improves&#xD;
      gastric accommodation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indwelling ascites drains are routinely used in patents with malignant ascites. Data&#xD;
      evaluating indwelling drains in patients with cirrhosis is limited. One of the reasons that&#xD;
      this may not have been explored as a therapeutic option is the potential for infection. As&#xD;
      opposed to malignant ascites, cirrhotic ascites generally has a low protein content, a known&#xD;
      risk factor for development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). From available data,&#xD;
      infection rates in cirrhotic patients with tunnelled drains, not on antibiotic prophylaxis&#xD;
      are estimated at 10%. Infection rates on antibiotic prophylaxis would be expected to be&#xD;
      lower, but this remains unstudied. Other concerns particular to the patient with cirrhosis&#xD;
      are renal dysfunction and acute kidney injury. Limitation of the amount of ascites that is&#xD;
      drained to &lt;5L per time and infusion of albumin 8grams(g)/L removed for amounts drained &gt;5L&#xD;
      has shown benefit in preventing post paracentesis circulatory and renal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, as some patients with cirrhosis will be left with intermittent LVP as their only&#xD;
      option for management, and as this therapy has implications for quality of life (QOL),&#xD;
      worsening nutritional status and cost, we propose an evaluation of an indwelling tunnelled&#xD;
      PleurX catheter as an alternative therapeutic option. In this prospective uncontrolled pilot&#xD;
      study, the hypothesis is that use of indwelling drains with careful monitoring of renal&#xD;
      function and prophylaxis with antibiotics, will be safe, cost-effective and improve quality&#xD;
      of life and nutritional status compared to the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective uncontrolled interventional pilot study of 12 patients followed for&#xD;
      3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Patients will be recruited from Hepatology departments at the University of&#xD;
      Alberta hospital (UAH) and Royal Alexandra hospital (RAH) in Edmonton. All Hepatologists at&#xD;
      these sites will be informed of the protocol. If a patient meets inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and is interested in hearing more about the study, the Hepatologist can contact the&#xD;
      study personnel. Patients will be made aware that their decision to participate in the study&#xD;
      will not influence their medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PleurX drain insertion by interventional radiologist&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient drainage protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ascites fluid drainage performed at participant's home via home care nurse 1-3 times per week&#xD;
      (maximum 3L- with each drain) for 3months. PleurX drain bottles will be used instead of&#xD;
      urinary drainage bags&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home care nurses are trained in the use of PleurX drains. Patients will be taught and given&#xD;
      information about complication monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Albumin infusion at 1g/kilogram(kg) as an outpatient when: the serum creatinine increases&#xD;
      from baseline &gt;26umol/L or by 1.5-2 times (Stage 1 Acute Kidney Injury), or the patient has&#xD;
      clinical signs of hypovolemia Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis with&#xD;
      Norfloxacin 400mg daily Patient counselling on avoidance of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drugs (NSAIDs), aminoglycosides, radiologic contrast, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)&#xD;

&#xD;
      At 90 days, all patients that choose to continue with fluid drainage as per the study&#xD;
      protocol, will be offered the option to continue contributing data to the study for the&#xD;
      duration of time they have the drain inserted, or until they no longer wish to participate.&#xD;
      Patients will be made aware that their decision to continue to participate in the study will&#xD;
      not influence their medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients that agree to continue participating, the initial protocol for drain frequency,&#xD;
      volume, care, and safety measures will be followed. Data will be collected, including:&#xD;
