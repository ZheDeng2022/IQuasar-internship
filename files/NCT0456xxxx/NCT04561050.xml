  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the 2000s, many prognostic scores were developed to predict traumatic haemorrhage. Most&#xD;
      of these studies were retrospectives based on registers. Due to missing data on death due to&#xD;
      bleeding, these studies chose to predict the massive transfusion risk as a surrogate of&#xD;
      haemorrhagic death. These scores include clinical parameters (vital signs), laboratory values&#xD;
      (Haemoglobin, lactate, Base excess) and/or imaging (CT or ultrasound) values. The scores&#xD;
      showing best performance are the Trauma Associated Severe Haemorrhage (TASH) score, developed&#xD;
      and validated on the German register (DGU-Register) and the ABC score developed and validated&#xD;
      in the United States of America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the majority of these scores cannot be applied at the trauma scene due to the&#xD;
      unavailability of laboratory and imaging values. Therefore, their clinical utility remains&#xD;
      unclear. To overcome the need for diagnostic tests, authors have developed and recently&#xD;
      validated a clinical prognostic score in identifying trauma patients with, or at risk of,&#xD;
      significant haemorrhage based on predicted probabilities of death due to bleeding: BATT&#xD;
      score. This score was developed from an international cohort using data from 271 Trauma&#xD;
      Centres in 41 countries on 5 continents and uses first clinical parameters at initial&#xD;
      assessment. The BATT score predicts death due to bleeding and has been validated on a large&#xD;
      population in England and Wales. It could also predict massive transfusion, as a surrogate of&#xD;
      haemorrhagic death, earlier at the trauma scene. Its feasibility and external validation&#xD;
      would make its clinical utility superior to other scores while identifying a greater number&#xD;
      of patients requiring early management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is an external validation of pre-existing prognostic scores of traumatic&#xD;
      haemorrhages (TASH , ABC and BATT score) at different times of care (Scene of Injury,&#xD;
      admission at the trauma room) in order to assess their overall performance, discrimination&#xD;
      and calibration in the prediction of massive transfusion, and haemorrhagic death. The&#xD;
      objective of the study is to assess a comparison of score performances (Overall performance,&#xD;
      discrimination and calibration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the study population (STR), which is partly integrated into the German DGU-Register,&#xD;
      the investigators expect good transportability of the TASH score to the Swiss Trauma Registry&#xD;
      in terms of overall performance, discrimination and calibration. The ABC score should show&#xD;
      lowers results in terms of discrimination due to its validation on small cohorts exclusively&#xD;
      in North America. The new BATT score predicting death due to bleeding has been validated on a&#xD;
      large English cohort of more than 100,000 patients. It identifies all patients with&#xD;
      haemorrhage and not only patients who have received a massive transfusion subject to survival&#xD;
      bias. In this context, the BATT score provides good discrimination with only simple&#xD;
      physiological variables available at the trauma scene. In case of its external validation on&#xD;
      the STR as part of our study, its feasibility would make its clinical utility superior to&#xD;
      other pre-existing scores, while identifying a greater number of patients requiring early&#xD;
      management. Its application would activate a massive transfusion plan directly at the trauma&#xD;
      scene and save precious time.&#xD;

      1 Study Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MTP STUDY is a retrospective, observational, non-interventional study based on a&#xD;
      multicentric, anonymised Register. The Study is conducted by the emergency department of the&#xD;
      University Hospital (CHUV) in Lausanne, Switzerland. The study design is observational, and&#xD;
      no intervention is applied as part of the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Sample Size and Power consideration&#xD;
&#xD;
      As his study is retrospective, the sample size is fixed. The number of participants will&#xD;
      depend on the STR Database. The investigators anticipate using the data of 10'000&#xD;
      participants included in the Swiss Trauma Registry from 1st January 2015 to 31st December&#xD;
      2019. A post-hoc power calculation will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Timing of Final analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      This statistical analysis plan is added before receiving the dataset and before any analyses&#xD;
      have been conducted. After receiving the dataset, the investigators will check for data&#xD;
      consistency. Once the database has been checked, statistical analysis will be performed&#xD;
      (October 2020)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Baseline patient characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4.1 Collected baseline patient characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observational study is designed to record a set of demographical data, clinical&#xD;
      examination in prehospital or in-hospital setting, in-hospital biochemical values and imaging&#xD;
      variables for each included patient. The investigators will extract the data from the Swiss&#xD;
      trauma registry (STR). The Investigators plan to extract the biological parameters from the&#xD;
      register at the trauma room stage. The clinical examinations will be the first measures at&#xD;
      the pre and in-hospital stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4.1 Descriptive summary of baseline patient characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will list general patient characteristics in a baseline characteristics&#xD;
      table. Data will be presented as mean with standard deviation (SD) when normally distributed&#xD;
      or as median with interquartile range in case of skewed data. Dichotomous and categorical&#xD;
      data will be presented in proportions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5 Assumed confounding covariate&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of the requested variables from the STR are inevitably correlated, as most&#xD;
      relate to the haemodynamic status of the patient and the trauma severity. The values of the&#xD;
      variables can be confounded by unmeasured factors, such as environmental, genetic or&#xD;
      psychological influences. Therefore, the investigators provide an example of possible&#xD;
      confounding variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examinations in prehospital settings (i.e. heart rate, systolic blood pressure,&#xD;
           respiratory rate, Glasgow Coma scale) are assumed to be confounded by:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Quality of the measurements, stress, pain and anxiety. These confounding covariates&#xD;
           should be minor for the statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examinations at hospital admission (i.e. vitals signs) are assumed to be&#xD;
           confounded by:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Quality of the measurements, administration of inotropes and/or vasopressors during&#xD;
           transport, administration of propofol (negative inotropic effect), induced comas and the&#xD;
           need for mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Because some patients will not survive long enough to receive 10 red blood cell units,&#xD;
           massive transfusion is subject to misclassification. To correct this misclassification,&#xD;
           the investigators add in the massive transfusion definition the use of â‰¥ 3 RBC&#xD;
           administered in the first hour (if the variable is available in the registry).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The trauma-induced coagulopathy as secondary outcome is assumed to be confounded by&#xD;
           anticoagulant treatments. To counteract the confounding covariate, the investigators&#xD;
           will include the fibrinogen &lt; 1.5 g/L in the definition of trauma-induced coagulopathy.&#xD;
           The investigators will also define a subgroup of patients with anticoagulant treatment&#xD;
           or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators acknowledge that there will be residual confounding in our dataset due to&#xD;
      the presence of unmeasured confounding, some of which is listed above. However, the actual&#xD;
      measured variables reflect daily practice and so are assumed to reflect similar confounding&#xD;
      in daily assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. Analysis methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.1. Efficacy analyses of primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the investigators will assess the accuracy (overall performance), discrimination and&#xD;
      calibration of ABC, TASH and BATT score for the prediction of massive transfusion in trauma&#xD;
      patients at the trauma scene and at the hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.2. Accuracy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accuracy will be assessed using the Brier score. Where Y is the observed outcome and p is&#xD;
      the prediction of the model The Brier score depends on the prevalence of the outcome, the&#xD;
      investigators will also calculate the scaled Brier score to account for the baseline risk of&#xD;
      Massive transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scaled Brier score ranges from 0% to 100% and indicates the degree of error in&#xD;
      prediction. A scaled Brier score of 0% shows perfect accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.3. Discrimination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discrimination is the ability of the score to correctly identify patients with the outcome.&#xD;
      The investigators will estimate the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative&#xD;
      likelihood ratio for the defined threshold of each score (ABC, TASH, BATT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The likelihood ratio is the likelihood of a positive score in a patient with the outcome&#xD;
      compared to the likelihood of a positive score in a patient without the outcome. The positive&#xD;
      likelihood ratio is the ratio of sensitivity to 1-specificity. The negative likelihood ratio&#xD;
      is the ratio of 1-sensitivity to specificity. A positive likelihood ratio of 10 or above will&#xD;
      result in a large increase in the probability of the outcome. A negative likelihood ratio of&#xD;
      0.1 or less will result in a large decrease in the probability of the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will plot the Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve which is the&#xD;
      sensitivity (true positives) on 1-specificity (false positives) for each defined threshold of&#xD;
      each score. An ideal score will reach the upper left corner (all true positive with no false&#xD;
      positive). The investigators will estimate the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) that&#xD;
      corresponds to the concordance statistic (C- Statistic) for binary outcome. A C-statistic of&#xD;
      1.0 shows perfect discrimination ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.4. Calibration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calibration is the agreement between observed and predicted outcomes. The investigators will&#xD;
      mostly estimate calibration as the difference between the mean predicted and observed&#xD;
      probabilities and the ratio of the predicted and observed number of events (P/O). The&#xD;
      investigators will plot the observed and predicted probabilities of massive transfusion by&#xD;
      decile of the score and with local regression based on LOESS algorithm. The investigators&#xD;
      will estimate the calibration intercept and slope of the calibration plot as a measure of&#xD;
      spread between predicted and observed outcome. Ideally, the intercept would be zero&#xD;
      indicating that the predictions are neither systematically too low or too high and the slope&#xD;
      would be 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the investigators cannot estimate the calibration of the BATT score, because&#xD;
      of its different outcome (death due to bleeding and not the massive transfusion as the TASH&#xD;
      and ABC score). For the BATT, calibration will be assessed with the outcome of death due to&#xD;
      bleeding or early death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.1.1 Efficacy analyses of secondary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform the same analysis for secondary outcomes as the primary&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Missing Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the retrospective aspect of the study based on a multicentric registry, the&#xD;
      investigators expect to have some missing data for some prehospital and in-hospital&#xD;
      predictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.1. Imputation method&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate baseline risk for the full dataset, the investigators will replace missing&#xD;
      predictors using multiple imputation by chained equations on sex, age, systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, Glasgow coma scale, Haemoglobin, base excess, type of&#xD;
      injury (penetrating/blunt) Instable pelvis fracture and open/dislocated femur fracture with&#xD;
      20 imputed dataset. All analysis and results will be present in two subgroups: missing data&#xD;
      imputed and missing data excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.2. Early deaths and early deaths with haemorrhage as a proxy for death due to bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the investigators don't know if the Swiss Trauma Registry record the cause of death,&#xD;
      the investigators expect some missing data about death due to bleeding as a secondary&#xD;
      outcome. In case of missing data on secondary outcomes, the investigators will use early&#xD;
      deaths and early deaths with evidence of haemorrhage as a proxy for death due to bleeding.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators will included deaths from all causes within 12 hours of&#xD;
      injury (excluding massive destruction of skull or brain; asphyxia, drowning and hanging are&#xD;
      already excluded from the STR) and deaths between 12 to 24 hours with evidence of bleeding&#xD;
      (Activation of massive transfusion protocol or blood within 6 hours or an abbreviated injury&#xD;
      scale (AIS) diagnosis associated with haemorrhage: Blood loss &gt;20%, Aorta [OR] Vena Cava&#xD;
      [OR]carotid [OR]femoral [OR]Major arteries [OR]veins AND laceration, - Spleen [OR]liver [OR]&#xD;
      Kidney [OR] Myocardium [AND] major laceration, major haemothorax, retroperitoneum&#xD;
      haemorrhage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Subgroup analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the sample size permits, the investigators will conduct subgroup analysis in different&#xD;
      subpopulations for the primary and secondary outcomes. The investigators will create the&#xD;
      following subgroups in our MTP study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subgroup 1: subdivide the population into two groups: with or without isolated severe&#xD;
           traumatic brain Injury (TBI) with AIS HEAD â‰¥ 3 and AIS thorax/abdominal &lt; 3 and/or AIS&#xD;
           lower extremity &lt; 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subgroup 2: subdivide the population into two groups: with or without anticoagulation&#xD;
           treatment before trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subgroup 3: subdivide the population into two groups: with or without trauma- induced&#xD;
           coagulopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subgroup 4: subdivide the dataset in prehospital settings and in-hospital settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subgroup 5: All analysis and results will be present into two subgroups: missing data&#xD;
           imputed and missing data excluded with the complete case analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Statistical Software&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be performed using STATA software (version 16.0; Stata Corp, College&#xD;
      Station, Texas, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Ethical Approval&#xD;
&#xD;
      As is mandatory in Swiss law (KVG), STR is authorised by the Human Research Act (HRA) as a&#xD;
      quality registry for the Highly Specialised Medicine (HSM). Due to the retrospective aspect&#xD;
      of our observational study based on an anonymized registry (identity, date of birth, trauma&#xD;
      scene and hospital location unknown) and according to the swiss law by the HRA (Art. 2), the&#xD;
      investigators don't need a protocol submission to an ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 Conclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Statistical analysis plan (SAP) presents the principles of analysis of the MTP study and&#xD;
      discusses its major methodological and statistical concerns. The investigators hope that the&#xD;
      results of the MTP study will be as transparent and robust as possible, so that the&#xD;
      investigators minimized the risk of outcome reporting bias and data-driven results.&#xD;
