  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of Bare-metal stents (BMS) since 1986 has alleviated the limitations of&#xD;
      plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) related elastic recoil and flow-limiting dissections.&#xD;
      Later on, higher restenosis rates due to exaggerated neointimal growth in BMS has led to the&#xD;
      development of drug-eluting stents (DES), which elutes an antiproliferative drug to the&#xD;
      vessel wall and reduce the restenosis rate. However, late stent thrombosis and restenosis,&#xD;
      with a hazard of nearly 2% per year after implantation, remained a concern and motivated the&#xD;
      development of drug-coated balloons (DCB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages of DCB are that leaving no metal in the blood vessel and respect the vessel&#xD;
      anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, studies with the strategy of DCB angioplasty with bailout stenting have&#xD;
      demonstrated safety and efficacy for the small-vessel disease. In the BASKET-SMALL 2 trial,&#xD;
      which compared SeQuent Please DCB with EES or Taxus DES in the vessels that have reference&#xD;
      diameter&lt;3mm, showed that at 12-month follow-up, DCB was non-inferior to DES (MACE [cardiac&#xD;
      death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and target-vessel revascularisation] rates: 8% vs.&#xD;
      9%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although some small-scale RCT using surrogate endpoints have reported that no significant&#xD;
      difference in MLD or late lumen loss between the two groups in large vessels, up to now,&#xD;
      there is no large-scale RCT comparing the clinical outcomes of DCB versus DES in large&#xD;
      vessels with de novo lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that in patients undergoing non-complex&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for de-novo stenoses, drug-coated balloon (DCB) is&#xD;
      non-inferior to drug-eluting stents (DES).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the ischemic events to be observed, there might be also a potential benefit of the&#xD;
      DCB strategy by reducing the bleeding events. Although there is scarce evidence showing the&#xD;
      optimal DAPT duration for DCB, in the current study, according to our empirical clinical&#xD;
      experiences and previous expert consensus, the investigators chose aspirin +&#xD;
      Ticagrelor/Clopidogrel for 3-month followed by Ticagrelor/Clopidogrel monotherapy for 3-month&#xD;
      to be the antiplatelet regimen in DCB arm. In contrast to the antiplatelet regimen for the&#xD;
      DES arm used in the current trial, which is aspirin + Ticagrelor/Clopidogrel for 3-month&#xD;
      followed by Ticagrelor/Clopidogrel monotherapy for 9-month, the DCB and its antiplatelet&#xD;
      strategy is estimated to reduce the bleeding events during follow-up.&#xD;
