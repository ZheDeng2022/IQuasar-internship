      This is a prospective, controlled, multi-center study. Patients will be enrolled and treated&#xD;
      with a radiofrequency device in this study if they have unwanted fat in the flank (love&#xD;

      Subjects are to be enrolled in this clinical study if they are 18 - 55 years old. A maximum&#xD;
      of 55 subjects will be enrolled at up to 6 study centers. Subjects will receive up to 5&#xD;
      treatments with the TempSure® Firm on one flank. The other flank will be left untreated to&#xD;
      serve a control. Subject will be required to return for follow-up visits at 6 weeks and at 12&#xD;
      weeks after the subject's final treatment. All subjects will receive a phone call 1 week&#xD;
      (1-10 days) post each treatment.&#xD;
