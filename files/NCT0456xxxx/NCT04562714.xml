      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a flash glucose monitor&#xD;
      device in achieving optimal glycemic control among adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately&#xD;
      controlled with non-insulin antihyperglycemic therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The IMMEDIATE study is a multi-centre, randomized controlled, open-label, two-phase&#xD;
      cross-over study evaluating the effectiveness of a flash glucose monitor device to increase&#xD;
      the proportion of time spent in target glucose range (3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L) among adults with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with non-insulin antihyperglycemic therapy compared&#xD;
      to a control group not using a flash glucose monitor device. The study will consist of two&#xD;
      phases; each 16 weeks long. In Phase 1, study participants who meet eligibility criteria will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive a flash glucose monitor device combined with diabetes&#xD;
      self-management education, or diabetes self-management education alone. In Phase 2,&#xD;
      participants initially assigned to receive education alone will crossover to receive a flash&#xD;
      glucose monitor device while participants initially using the flash glucose monitor will&#xD;
      continue using their device. No diabetes self-management education will be provided during&#xD;
      Phase 2.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The IMMEDIATE study is a two-phased, cross-over study. In Phase 1, participants will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio, stratified by use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist to receive either a flash glucose monitor (FGM) + diabetes self-management education (DSME) (Intervention arm) or to DSME alone (Control arm). Participants randomized to the Intervention arm will receive a FreeStyle Libre FGM System, 1 training session on its proper use, and 6 DSME sessions. Participants randomized to the Control arm will receive 6 DSME sessions matched to time and location of the Intervention group. DSME sessions for both groups will consist of four individual in-clinic sessions and two telephone sessions. After 16-weeks, participants initially assigned to DSME alone will cross-over to receive the intervention FGM device, while those initially randomized to using a FGM will continue using their device for an additional 16 weeks (Phase 2). No DSME will provided during Phase 2.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The FreeStyle Libre FGM device consists of a skin-worn disposable sensor that automatically measures and continuously stores glucose readings. The sensor is placed by a single-use applicator and is activated by a wireless scan with a handheld reader. It is designed to stay on the body for up to 14 days, and can be worn under clothing. After a 1-hour warm-up period, the sensor takes automatic measurements of glucose every 15 minutes for up to 14 days. The device collects the interstitial glucose values and stores them for subsequent upload at the end of the 14-day wear period. With each scan, users receive their glucose reading; the last eight hours of glucose data; and an arrow illustrating the direction their glucose is heading.</description>
