  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the efficacy and efficiency of the Projection-Based&#xD;
      augmented reality therapy under two conditions: multiple stimuli (different types of&#xD;
      cockroaches) (P-ARET MS) versus single stimulus (one cockroach) (P-ARET SS) for the treatment&#xD;
      of participants diagnosed with cockroach phobia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific phobia (SP) refers to an extreme and persistent fear of a specific object or&#xD;
      situation that is out of proportion to the actual danger or threat. SP is the most prevalent&#xD;
      anxiety disorder with substantial impairment and comorbidity. Animal fear is one of the most&#xD;
      prevalent subtypes of SP. In vivo exposure is the treatment of choice for this problem, but&#xD;
      this technique presents limitations in its implementation related to the access and&#xD;
      acceptability (i.e., low acceptance on the part of patients and therapists, high dropout&#xD;
      rates, limited access to the treatment and, difficulties in its application in the clinical&#xD;
      context). Augmented Reality (AR) offers some advantages in delivering the exposure technique:&#xD;
      1) Exposure to multiple virtual stimuli; 2) Going beyond reality; 3) Allowing complete&#xD;
      control over the situation; 4) It allows privacy and confidentiality. Particularly, the most&#xD;
      significant aspect of AR is that the virtual elements add relevant and helpful information to&#xD;
      the physical information available in the real world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We pretend to go a step beyond and explore ways of optimizing exposure therapy based on the&#xD;
      inhibitory learning approach. AR can maximize some strategies like &quot;variability&quot; (varying&#xD;
      stimuli, durations, levels of intensity, or the order of the hierarchy items), greater&#xD;
      control by the therapists or &quot;exposure to multiple contexts&quot; which can produce a positive&#xD;
      effect in terms of fear renewal and generalization of the results. Therefore, the aim of this&#xD;
      study is to test the efficacy and efficiency of varying the phobic stimuli during the ARET:&#xD;
      using multiple stimuli (MS) (P-ARET MS) versus single stimulus (SS) (P-ARET SS) in&#xD;
      participants with cockroach phobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) will be conducted following the Consolidated Standards of&#xD;
      Reporting Trials (CONSORT: http://www.consort-statement.org) and the SPIRIT guidelines&#xD;
      (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Intervention Trials). Participants (N = 80) who&#xD;
      received a diagnosis of SP for cockroaches (DSM-5), will be randomized into two experimental&#xD;
      conditions: 1) Projection-based augmented reality therapy (P-ARET) with Multiple Stimuli (MS)&#xD;
      (P-ARET MS); 2) Projection-based augmented reality therapy (P-ARET) with Single Stimulus (SS)&#xD;
      (P-ARET SS). Five evaluation moments will be included: pre-intervention, post- intervention,&#xD;
      and 1-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups.&#xD;
