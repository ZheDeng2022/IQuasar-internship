  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a 12-week sport climbing course&#xD;
      versus unsupervised physical exercise on motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Sport climbing (SC) is known as a whole-body workout, which additionally trains&#xD;
      cognitive, mental, and social abilities. In contrast to its public image, SC in a controlled&#xD;
      environment using &quot;top-rope&quot; belay, is a safe sport and can be performed at any age and at&#xD;
      any level. In the field of neurological rehabilitation, it is already used as &quot;therapeutic&#xD;
      SC&quot; for other neurological diseases, such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, depressions etc. but&#xD;
      studies on climbing in PD patients are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: to find significant improvement of motor symptoms in the climbing group compared&#xD;
      to the control group as well as biopsychosocial improvements after 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6&#xD;
      months after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Effects of SC on motor symptoms in 48 PD patients in total, who will be randomized&#xD;
      into a climbing group (n=24) and a control group (n=24) will be evaluated. The climbing group&#xD;
      will follow a 12-week 90 min/week climbing trainings course, led by professional climbing&#xD;
      instructors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive education/information material of the European physiotherapy&#xD;
      guidelines for physical activity recommended by the WHO and will be instructed to follow the&#xD;
      recommendation of the guidelines to independently live an active lifestyle and train&#xD;
      unsupervised. All patients will be evaluated with clinical assessments at baseline, in&#xD;
      between the study period (mid), after completing the 12-weeks study period (post). As&#xD;
      additional outcomes, health benefits of SC in PD with a holistic approach, covering&#xD;
      biopsychosocial aspects will be investigated. Therefore, non-motoric and motoric parameters&#xD;
      will be evaluated, and follow-up assessments 6 months after.&#xD;
