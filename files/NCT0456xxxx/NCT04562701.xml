  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between hamstring length and gluteus&#xD;
      maximus strength with and without normalization in patients with mechanical low back pain&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      seventy-three patients diagnosed as mechanical low back pain. Firstly, gluteus maximus (GM)&#xD;
      strength was measured isometrically as a force (kg) and then converted to torque (Nm). GM&#xD;
      strength was normalized for body weight and height using the following formula: % (body&#xD;
      weight × h) = torque (N × m) ×100 / body weight (N) × h (m), then assessment of hamstring&#xD;
      length flexibility using the active knee extension method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data was collected and the correlation was determined.&#xD;

    <description>The gluteus maximus strength was evaluated by using hand-held dynamometer (HHD). The patient was asked to lie in the prone position. Belt was used to support the pelvis, then the patient was asked to maximally extend the hip joint with the knee joints flexed to 90°). Resistance belt (non-elastic strap) was placed 15 cm above the knee joint above popliteal fossa with the Hand-held dynamometer below it. Each subject was instructed to perform maximal isometric hip extension for 5 seconds. Measurement was done three times, with 2-minutes rest between trials. Subject's hand was places behind waist to control the substitute motions of arm or hand. The peak force for each trial was recorded, and the average value was calculated</description>

    <description>Patient was positioned supine with the non-tested limb flat with knee extended and supported with strap over the mid-thigh to eliminate any substitutive movement. An another strap was rapped over the pelvis for fixation, to maintain 90 degrees of the hip joint, a wooden frame was then placed on the plinth in line with the participant's anterior superior iliac spine of the pelvis. The participant was asked to flex the hip of the test leg so that their thigh touching the wooden apparatus all over test time</description>
