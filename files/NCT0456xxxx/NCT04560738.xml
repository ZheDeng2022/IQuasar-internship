          2. Participant has a history of chronic pruritus or clinically significant chronic&#xD;
             dermatologic disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant has contraindication or intolerance to first-generation antihistamine&#xD;
             medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant has a history of benign ethnic neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant has a history of any clinically significant and relevant neurological,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, psychological, pulmonary, metabolic,&#xD;
             endocrine, hematological, allergic disease, drug allergies, or other major disorders&#xD;
             as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participant has any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities,&#xD;
             which places the participant at unacceptable risk if he were to participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participant has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participant was exposed to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30&#xD;
             days prior to dosing or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug, if known (whichever&#xD;
             is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participant has used any prescribed systemic or topical medication (including but not&#xD;
             limited to analgesics, anesthetics, etc) within 14 days or 5 half-lives of that&#xD;
             medication, whichever is longer, prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participant has used any non-prescribed systemic or topical medication (including&#xD;
             vitamin/mineral supplements and herbal medicines) within 7 days prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Participant has used CYP3A inducers and/or inhibitors (including St. John's Wort)&#xD;
             within 30 days prior to dosing. The Indiana University &quot;Cytochrome P450 Drug&#xD;
             Interaction Table&quot; should be utilized to determine inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A&#xD;
             (http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Participant has any surgical or medical conditions possibly affecting drug absorption,&#xD;
             distribution, metabolism, and excretion, eg, bariatric procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: prior appendectomy is acceptable, but prior cholecystectomy would result in&#xD;
             exclusion from the study.&#xD;

             drug test reflecting consumption of illicit drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Participant has a history of alcohol abuse (as defined by the current version of the&#xD;
             DSM) within 2 years prior to dosing, or positive alcohol test.&#xD;

             surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab), or have a reactive result to&#xD;
             the test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Participant has a history of smoking/use of tobacco or nicotine-containing products&#xD;
             within 3 months prior to check-in (Day -1).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Participant has received immunization with a live or live-attenuated vaccine within 2&#xD;
             months prior to dosing or is planning to receive immunization with a live or&#xD;
             live-attenuated vaccine for 2 months following dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Participant participated in a radiolabeled drug study, where exposures are known to&#xD;
             the Investigator, within the previous 4 months prior to check-in (Day -1); or&#xD;
             participated in a radiolabeled drug study, where exposures are not known to the&#xD;
             Investigator, within the previous 6 months prior to check-in (Day -1). The total&#xD;
             12-month exposure from this study and a maximum of 2 other previous studies within 4&#xD;
             to 12 months of this study will be within the CFR-recommended levels considered safe:&#xD;
             less than 5000 mrem whole body annual exposure, with consideration given to the&#xD;
             half-lives of the previous radiolabeled study drugs received.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Participant was exposed to significant radiation (eg, serial X-ray or computed&#xD;
             tomography scans, barium meal, current employment in a job requiring radiation&#xD;
             exposure monitoring) within 12 months prior to check-in (Day -1).&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. History of less than 1 to 2 bowel movements per day.&#xD;
