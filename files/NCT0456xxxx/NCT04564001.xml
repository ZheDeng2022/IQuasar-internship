  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a vasculitis of unknown origin, resulting in progressive&#xD;
      thickening and stenosis of large and medium arteries (the aorta and its major branches, and&#xD;
      the pulmonary arteries). First line therapy of TA consists of high dose corticosteroids (CS).&#xD;
      Between 20 and 50% of cases respond to CS alone, with subsequent resolution of symptoms and&#xD;
      stabilization of vascular abnormalities. Although second-line agents (methotrexate,&#xD;
      azathioprine, mercaptopurine, mycophenolate mofetil) may result in initial remission,&#xD;
      relapses remain common when prednisone is tapered. Thus, 50% of CS-resistant or relapsing TA&#xD;
      patients may achieve sustained remission with the addition of methotrexate. During the last&#xD;
      decade, biologics such as anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) and anti-interleukin-6&#xD;
      (anti-IL-6) have been used as third-line treatment in refractory or relapsing TA. Almost 90%&#xD;
      of CS-methotrexate resistant TA cases responded to infliximab, an anti-TNFα, and sustained&#xD;
      remission was obtained in 37 to 76% of the cases. Tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 has given similar&#xD;
      results with 68% of sustained remission in refractory TA. Irrespective of classical&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors, the systemic inflammation and CS use play a pivotal role in the&#xD;
      occurrence of cardiovascular thrombotic events (CVEs). As CVEs overlap with TA complications&#xD;
      it is primordial to drastically taper CS in that vasculitis. We therefore hypothesize that&#xD;
      Infliximab or Tocilizumab can achieve a remission in more than 70% of refractory/relapsing TA&#xD;
      cases to CS associated to a second-line agent. INTOReTAK, first randomized prospective study&#xD;
      in TA, has an original design testing Infliximab and Tocilizumab propensity to achieve over&#xD;
      70% of sustained remission in refractory/relapsing TA and evaluating jointly the 2 arms. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this study is to obtain, by arm, ≥ 70% of patients at 6 months after&#xD;
      randomization with prednisone ≤ 0.1mg/kg per day and inactive disease (NIH score ≤ 1) during&#xD;
      the last 3 months.&#xD;
