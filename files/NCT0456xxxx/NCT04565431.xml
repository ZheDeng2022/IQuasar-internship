  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the effectiveness of Tysabri on&#xD;
      cognitive fatigue in persons with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS). Cognitive&#xD;
      fatigue is the kind of fatigue that occurs after intense mental concentration as after a&#xD;
      session of problem solving.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researchers aim is to investigate the effects of Tysabri on cognitive fatigue and on&#xD;
      specific brain areas that have been shown to underlie cognitive fatigue in individuals with&#xD;
      RRMS. The researchers will investigate the effects on the cognitive fatigue that develops&#xD;
      during the performance of a demanding task and also on how cognitive fatigue changes as a&#xD;
      function of duration of treatment.&#xD;
