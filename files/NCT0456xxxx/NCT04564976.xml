  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      University of California, Los Angeles researchers will recruit healthy participants and&#xD;
      anxious participants (those diagnosed with social anxiety disorder) age 18-55 years old to&#xD;
      participate in a study examining whether the ability of social support figure reminders to&#xD;
      prevent the acquisition of fear in healthy participants extends to those with anxiety&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being recruited from the UCLA community (healthy participants, n = 50) or referred by&#xD;
      treatment providers at the Anxiety and Depression Research Center at UCLA (anxious&#xD;
      participants, n =50) and undergoing a telephone screening and in-person screening, 100&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in the study. During the experiment, all participants will&#xD;
      undergo the same procedures: undergoing fear acquisition procedures--the repeated pairing of&#xD;
      a neutral image with a mild electric shock that ultimately leads to the association of threat&#xD;
      of shock with the image--in the presence of an image of a social support figure (provided by&#xD;
      participants) and an image of a smiling stranger.&#xD;

    <description>An image of a social support figure specific to each participant (provided by the participant) will be present while participants undergo a fear acquisition procedure. Specifically--the image will be presented alongside a neutral image that is either consistently paired with shock (CS+) or never paired with shock (CS-), so that assessment of whether there are differences in fear responding (evaluated via SCR) due the shock pairing can be assessed. This is a typical fear acquisition procedure, and a typical outcome would be for SCR to be higher for the CS+ compared to the CS- toward the end and following the procedure, indicating that the CS+ is now associated with the aversive shock and is bringing about a fear response (in this case indexed by increased sympathetic nervous system activity preparing the body to fight or flee).</description>
