  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will aim to evaluate the effect of therapeutic and supratherapeutic oral doses of&#xD;
      GSK3640254 on cardiac conduction compared to placebo and a single oral dose of Moxifloxacin&#xD;
      in healthy adult participants. The study has 2 parts: Part 1 will determine the&#xD;
      supratherapeutic dose for Part 2, which will be the main corrected QT interval (QTc) study.&#xD;
      Part 1 consists of 2 sequential cohorts: Sentinel Cohort 1 will evaluate once daily (QD)&#xD;
      dosing of GSK3640254 or placebo for 7 days and Sentinel Cohort 2 will evaluate twice daily&#xD;
      (BID) dosing of GSK3640254 or placebo for 7 days. Part 2 will investigate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and Pharmacokinetics (PK) of GSK3640254 doses on cardiac conduction as compared&#xD;
      to placebo and a single oral dose of Moxifloxacin in healthy adult participants. Moxifloxacin&#xD;
      will be included as a positive control. All doses of study intervention will be administered&#xD;
      under fed conditions and will receive a moderate-fat meal 30 minutes prior to dosing. The&#xD;
      total duration of the study is approximately 91 days. Approximately 58 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any acute laboratory abnormality (including hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, or&#xD;
             hypomagnesemia) at Screening which, in the opinion of the investigator, should&#xD;

             provide a compelling explanation for the laboratory result(s) and has the assent of&#xD;
             the sponsor. A single repeat of any laboratory abnormality is allowed within a single&#xD;

             is longer) prior to the first dose of study intervention and for the duration of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;

             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another concurrent clinical study or prior clinical study (with the&#xD;
             exception of imaging trials) prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30&#xD;
             days, 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the study&#xD;
             intervention (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior exposure to GSK3640254 in this or another clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior intolerance to Moxifloxacin.&#xD;

             in excess of 500 mL within 56 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any positive (abnormal) response confirmed by the investigator on a screening&#xD;
             clinician- or qualified designee-administered Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale&#xD;
             (C-SSRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A sustained supine systolic blood pressure &gt;150 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or &lt;90&#xD;
             mm Hg or a supine diastolic blood pressure &gt;95 mm Hg or &lt;50 mm Hg at Screening or&#xD;
             Check-in (Day -2). Blood pressure may be retested once in the supine position. The&#xD;
             blood pressure abnormality is considered sustained if either the systolic or the&#xD;
             diastolic pressure values are outside the stated limits after 2 assessments, in which&#xD;
             case the participant may not be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A resting HR of &lt;50 bpm or &gt;100 bpm when vital signs are measured at Screening or&#xD;
             Check-in (Day -2). A HR from 100 to 110 bpm can be rechecked by ECG or vital signs&#xD;

             bradycardia, non-sustained or sustained atrial arrhythmias, ventricular&#xD;
             pre-excitation, non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia, any degree of&#xD;
             atrioventricular block, complete left bundle branch block, or conduction abnormality)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria for Screening ECG (a single repeat is allowed for eligibility&#xD;
             determination):&#xD;
&#xD;
             (i) HR: &lt;50 or &gt;100 bpm (ii) QTcF interval1: &gt;450 ms (iii) QRS interval: &gt;110 ms (iv)&#xD;
             PR interval: &gt;200 ms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening Holter (24 hours) with any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             (i) Sinus bradycardia less than or equal to (&lt;=)35 bpm or junctional arrhythmia &gt;60&#xD;
             bpm for 10 seconds or longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (ii) Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia or more than 30 ventricular premature&#xD;
        depolarizations during an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (iii) Atrial arrhythmia &gt;100 bpm for 3 seconds or longer or more than 40 atrial premature&#xD;
        depolarizations during an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of alcoholism and/or drug/chemical abuse or regular alcohol consumption within&#xD;
             6 months of screening, defined as an average weekly intake of &gt;14 units. One unit is&#xD;
             equivalent to 8 grams of alcohol: a half-pint (approximately 240 mL) of beer, 1 glass&#xD;
             (125 mL) of wine, or 1 (25 mL) measure of spirits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to refrain from tobacco or nicotine-containing products within 3 months prior&#xD;
             to Screening and for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications or components thereof or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical&#xD;
             Monitor, contraindicates their participation.&#xD;
