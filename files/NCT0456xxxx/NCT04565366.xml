      The overall goal of Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Spinal Cord Injury&#xD;
      (TRACK-SCI) study is to determine the relationships among the clinical, neuroimaging,&#xD;
      cognitive, genetic and proteomic biomarker characteristics of acute traumatic spinal cord&#xD;
      injury (SCI). TRACK-SCI seeks to combine high quality care variables with high density&#xD;
      physiology data collection to better understand diagnose, characterize, and track the&#xD;
      temporal profile of recovery for SCI patients. The Investigators are enrolling patients&#xD;
      within 24 hours of injury who present to a TRACK-SCI site with a spinal cord injury that&#xD;
      meets eligibility criteria.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a major cause of morbidity worldwide with debilitating impacts on&#xD;
      quality of life and the healthcare system. To date, a data-dense research registry specific&#xD;
      to SCI remains to be constructed. To this end, the study will collect SCI data across five&#xD;
      primary domains: 1) demographics and baseline history, 2) clinical course variables from ED&#xD;
      to ICU, 3) standard of care neuroimaging (CT and MRI) and intraoperative neuromonitoring, 4)&#xD;
      blood and CSF samples for proteomic and genetic biomarkers, and 5) outcome measures of&#xD;
      functional disability, mental health and quality of life at 3, 6, and 12 months. The&#xD;
      investigators seek to correlate these high-density physiology data with baseline risk&#xD;
      factors, imaging parameters, and biomarkers for a comprehensive approach to SCI diagnosis&#xD;
      during acute care as well as prognosis across subacute and chronic phases of recovery -- in&#xD;
      order to truly step toward the advancement of research and clinical knowledge in SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to provide a comprehensive prospective analysis of multiple variables&#xD;
      in acute SCI that impact long-term outcomes. This is intended to provide a rich resource for&#xD;
      asking key questions related to the optimization of treatment, and the planning and execution&#xD;
      of pivotal clinical trials in SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Multiple critical care variables will be predictive of both sensorimotor and autonomic&#xD;
           outcomes, and susceptibility to infections at discharge and 6 and 12 mos after injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quantitative MRI indices of cord damage, and biomarkers of acute immune responses to&#xD;
           injury will predict neurological outcomes at discharge and at 6 and 12 mos.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The multivariate analysis of the constellation of acute variables and long-term outcome&#xD;
           measures will yield new derived predictors of outcome that will facilitate&#xD;
           stratification for clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Diagnosis: Building a knowledge network for acute SCI. A detailed prospective study of&#xD;
      critical care practices and outcomes for SCI patients admitted to TRACK-SCI sites will be&#xD;
      conducted to build a knowledge network for acute SCI diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Prognosis: Predictive models and biomarkers. The research team will develop&#xD;
      multidimensional prognostic indicators for predicting outcomes and stratifying patients using&#xD;
      detailed physiological, imaging, and genetic datasets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Data analysis and sharing. The development of better predictors of outcome and methods&#xD;
      for stratification will be advanced by allowing qualified access to our granular data. The&#xD;
      availability to qualified users of the detailed acute 'diagnostic' dataset along with&#xD;
      gene-expression data and functional outcomes at 6&amp;12 mos will leverage the project as a&#xD;
      valuable international SCI community resource.&#xD;
