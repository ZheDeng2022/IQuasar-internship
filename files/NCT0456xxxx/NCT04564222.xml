  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our earlier research has highlighted a high prevalence of anaemia, micronutrient&#xD;
      deficiencies, and impaired infant growth among lactating women and infants in Sumedang&#xD;
      district, West Java, Indonesia that were associated with large deficits in their&#xD;
      micronutrient intakes. In response to these disturbing findings we have developed the&#xD;
      micronutrient- enriched crackers (MEC) based on powdered eggshells and chicken liver, a&#xD;
      readily available and affordable, local animal-source food. We will supply these MEC or a&#xD;
      placebo, manufactured locally, weekly to a group of women in Sumedang district from 14 weeks&#xD;
      gestation to 5 months post-partum in an effort to enrich the micronutrient content of the&#xD;
      daily diets of the treatment group so they no longer have any dietary shortfalls in&#xD;
      micronutrients. Our overall aim is to determine if MEC consumed daily by mothers for 6 months&#xD;
      during pregnancy improves the birth length of their infants, and if daily consumption of MEC&#xD;
      is continued daily to 5 months post-partum enhances infant linear growth compared to the&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind two-phase cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted in West&#xD;
      Java, Indonesia to determine whether daily consumption of MEC from 14 weeks' gestation to&#xD;
      delivery improves birth length compared to placebo (Phase 1) and whether daily consumption of&#xD;
      MEC from 14 weeks gestation to 5 months post-partum improves attained linear growth of&#xD;
      infants at age 5 months and linear growth velocity of infants from birth to age 5 months&#xD;
      compared to placebo (Phase 2). A total of 308 pregnant women will be recruited through&#xD;
      midwives/public health centre from 28 clusters (villages) in Sumedang district. Clusters will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to receive placebo or micronutrient- enriched crackers (MEC) daily,&#xD;
      distributed by cadres from 14 weeks gestation to 5 months post-partum. Women who fulfil trial&#xD;
      criteria (20 pregnant women from each cluster) will be randomized and the first 11 eligible&#xD;
      pregnant women will be invited to participate in the RCT. We will have 2-3 rolling&#xD;
      recruitments to obtain the number of participants required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo and MEC (based on powdered eggshells and chicken liver) will be manufactured locally&#xD;
      according to Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs), so they are identical in size, color,&#xD;
      and packaging, with a code known only by the local production manager. The code will not be&#xD;
      shared until the primary outcome has been analysed statistically or if requested by the&#xD;
      Ethics Committee and/or Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).&#xD;

Selected pregnant women from these villages will receive daily interventions in the form of 75 gram food products, made from chicken liver and chicken eggshells (Micronutrient-enriched Crackers/MEC) or placebo.

On the next day after each weighed food record has been completed by the mother, an experienced research assistant will conduct a 24-hour recall on the mother using telephone/online communication. Results from the weighed record and recall will be combined to determine maternal food intake, which will be converted into nutrient intakes based on the weight and nutritional value of each food using the Indonesian Food Composition Table. The Multiple Source Method (MSM) program will be applied to estimate individual usual intakes of energy and nutrients as well as the usual intake distributions for the study population.</description>

    <time_frame>5 months (+/- 1 week) post partum</time_frame>
    <description>The deuterium dose-to-the mother technique will be performed to measure the volume of breast milk consumed by the infants and the status of breastfed infants. As much as 30 grams of Deuterium Oxide (D2O) are taken by the mother orally, which is then excreted into the breast milk consumed by the infant. Saliva sampling will be carried out according to protocol guidelines established by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA; Human Health Series No. 7) with some adjustments to the number of days of sampling. Maternal and infant saliva samples will be taken on the 0th day before the mother is given D2O dose, and subsequently post-dose on day 2 or 3, day 8 or 9, and on day 13 or 14. A total of 2 mL of maternal and 1 mL of infant saliva will be collected on each sampling day. Saliva will be analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR), from which exclusive breastfeeding categorization and breast milk volume will be calculated using the Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet.</description>
