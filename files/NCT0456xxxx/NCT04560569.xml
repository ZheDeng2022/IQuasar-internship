  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to assess the antiviral activity, clinical safety and tolerability&#xD;
      parameters of albuvirtide/3BNC117 combination therapy in reducing HIV-1 viral load during the&#xD;
      1-week induction period treatment period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      ABT/3BNC117 combination in conjunction with an existing failing antiretroviral therapy (ART)&#xD;
      for 1 week, and then with optimized background regimen (OBR) for 24 weeks, respectively. A&#xD;
      total of 20 eligible subjects who demonstrate evidence of HIV-1 replication despite ongoing&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy with documented genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance to multiple&#xD;
      classes of HIV drugs (3 classes or more) will be enrolled. Patients must have been treated&#xD;
      with HAART for at least 6 months and be failing or have recently failed (i.e., in the last 8&#xD;
      weeks) therapy to determine baseline viral load.&#xD;
