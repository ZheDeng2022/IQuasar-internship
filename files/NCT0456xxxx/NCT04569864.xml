    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to analyze the immediate and long-term results between patients&#xD;
      undergoing hemiarch replacement with ACP under mild hypothermic (30-32 °C) circulatory arrest&#xD;
      versus moderate hypothermic (26-28 °C) circulatory arrest. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      circulatory arrest using mild hypothermia (30-32°C) and uSACP will result in complications&#xD;
      reduction, during aortic hemiarch replacement, when compared to moderate hypothermia&#xD;
      (26-28°C) and uSACP. For this purpose all of the patient population will be randomized into 2&#xD;
      groups. The first group of the patients during aortic hemiarch replacement, mild hypothermia&#xD;
      (30-32°C) will be used during circulatory arrest. The second group of the patients during&#xD;
      aortic hemiarch replacement, moderate hypothermia (26-28°C) will be used during circulatory&#xD;
      arrest.&#xD;

      Mild versus moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest during aortic hemiarch replacement&#xD;
      Hypothermic circulatory arrest with unilateral selective anterograde cerebral perfusion&#xD;
      (SACP) is an important surgical technique, allowing complex aortic surgeries to be performed&#xD;
      safely. One of the main positive aspects of the strategy for changing the hypothermia&#xD;
      temperature is to reduce the systemic inflammatory response, minimize visceral organ&#xD;
      dysfunction, and reduce the risk of postoperative bleeding - the adverse effects of&#xD;
      hypothermia Patients will be operated for ascending aortic aneurysm in a hypothermic&#xD;
      circulatory arrest with unilateral SACP. The main difference is during aortic hemiarch&#xD;
      replacement, moderate hypothermia (26-28°C) and mild hypothermia (30-32°C) will be used&#xD;
      during circulatory arrest. All data will be prospectively collected and recorded. All&#xD;
      surgeries will be perform concurrently in the same time period. Experienced in aortic&#xD;
      pathology surgeons will perform these operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgical procedures will be performed via median sternotomy. During the aortic arch&#xD;
      anastomosis, continuous, unilateral SACP using innominate artery will be employed. Unilateral&#xD;
      SACP may be converted to bilateral ACP at the surgeon's discretion if adequate cerebral flows&#xD;
      are not achieved or if there are concerns with cerebral oximetry measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once on CPB, the patient will be cooled to a nasopharyngeal (NP) temperature of either 30-32&#xD;
      °C or 26-28 °C, depending on to which treatment arm the patient has been randomized. Rectal&#xD;
      temperature with be monitored as an additional temperature sites. Unilateral SACP will only&#xD;
      be initiated once the target temperature has been reached. SACP via the innominate artery&#xD;
      will be commenced with target flows of 8-10 ml/kg/min and perfusion pressure of 60-80 mmHg.&#xD;
      Perfusion adequacy will be evaluated using measurement of blood pressure in both radial&#xD;
      arteries and cerebral oximetry using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the aortic hemiarch replacement, CPB will be resumed and the patient&#xD;
      re-warmed to 36 °C prior to coming off CPB, with a = 1 °C temperature difference between&#xD;
      temperature monitoring sites (NP and rectal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative information will be collected from the anesthetic record, surgical notes and&#xD;
      perfusion records. Intraoperative data collection will include total operative time, CPB&#xD;
      time, cross-clamp time, hypothermic cardiac arrest time, uSACP time, lowest nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      and rectal temperature, arterial pressure in both radial arteries, perfusion rate and&#xD;
      perfusion pressure during both of CPB and unilateral SACP, lowest hemoglobin concentration&#xD;
      (g/L) and hematocrit (%), acid-base indices, intraoperative red blood cell transfusion&#xD;
      (units), highest dose/agent used for intraoperative inotrope or vasopressor support. Also&#xD;
      during the surgery will be performed NIRS and BIS-monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative data will include valuation of following indicators: mortality (hospital&#xD;
      mortality and death from any cause); neurological injury (TIA, stroke, delirium), MRI and&#xD;
      CT-scan only in event of postoperative stroke; acute kidney injury (creatinine level prior&#xD;
      and 1, 2, 4 postoperative day (POD), urine output-up to 24-48 h, renal replacement therapy&#xD;
      (dialysis); time of mechanical ventilation; re-exploration for bleeding, tamponade or other&#xD;
      reasons; postoperative transfusion (packed red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen&#xD;
      platelets, cryoprecipitate); postoperative myocardial infarction (electrocardiogram and&#xD;
      troponins); inotropic support during 24-48 h (agent and dose (VIS)); length of stay&#xD;
      (intensive care unit and total hospital days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before surgery and on 12-16 POD, patients will undergo neurocognitive screening by trained&#xD;
      personnel. Neurocognitive tests will include: MOCA examinations, Schulte Table and The&#xD;
      Bourdon Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, indicators of specific markers of brain damage will be evaluated. Indicators&#xD;
      such as neuron-specific enolase (NSE), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), brain-derived&#xD;
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) will be evaluated before surgery and on first POD. Also will be&#xD;
      evaluated indicators of the hemostatic system: thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes,&#xD;
      prothrombin fragments 1+2, glu-plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), endothelin&#xD;
      1-21 and thromboelastography (TEG) in following points - before surgery, lowest temperature&#xD;
      during arrest time, after inactivation of heparin and 4 h after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up information will be collected using direct or phone contact with patients,&#xD;
      relatives, or physicians.&#xD;
