    <textblock>
      This study has a Phase II with part A and part B and a Phase III with part C. This Adaptive&#xD;
      seamless design will prospectively include planned modifications and incorporate both dose&#xD;
      selection (parts A and B) and confirmation of the selected dose (part C) based on the&#xD;
      accumulation of subjects' data within the entire study period as shown below. Part C will be&#xD;
      randomized for immunogenicity subset and will be open label for safety cohort. The&#xD;
      participants assigned to the control group from all parts (i.e, Part A, B and C) will be&#xD;
      continuously followed up from the enrollment until the end of the study.&#xD;

      Study Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study is designed as a Phase II/III Adaptative Seamless study in healthy subjects&#xD;
           aged 12 to 65 years to establish immunogenicity and safety profiles of 2-dose regimen of&#xD;
           inactivated BBV87 chikungunya vaccine in 3 endemic countries in Asia and Latin America&#xD;
           and to select the optimal dose strength for confirmatory study phase (i.e., pivotal&#xD;
           phase III based on immunogenicity endpoint), for licensure. This study design is&#xD;
           composed of parts A and B (i.e., 20µg and 40µg) to support the selection of the optimal&#xD;
           dose in part C.Thus, there will be 3 partsin the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The vaccine regimen is safe and induces neutralizing antibody response to CHIK based on&#xD;
           the phase 1 study conducted in India assessing 10µg, 20µg, and 30µg dose strengths. An&#xD;
           additional safety study is being conducted in India with higher dose strength (i.e.,&#xD;
           40µg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the 40µg BBV87 administered in 2 doses at 0-6&#xD;
           M schedule (applicable to part A) and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
           20µg and 40µg BBV87 administered in 2 doses at 0-28 days schedule (applicable to parts B&#xD;
           and C).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity interms of GMTs of the 20µg and 40µg BBV87 at 28 days PD2&#xD;
           administered at 0-28 days interval (applicable to parts B and C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity in terms of seroconversionof the 20µg and 40µg BBV87 at&#xD;
           28 days and 6 months PD2. (Applicable to parts B and C).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity in terms of GMTs and seroconversion of the 40µg BBV87 at&#xD;
           28 days PD2 administered at 0-6 M. (Applicable to part A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity in terms of GMTs and seroconversion of the 20µg and 40µg&#xD;
           of BBV87 28 days PD1.(Applicable to parts A, B, and C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the number of confirmed Chikungunya cases in vaccine and placebo recipients&#xD;
           during the 6 month-follow-up period PD2. (Applicable to 3 parts, A, B, and C).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the early immune response at D14 PD1 in phase II for potential outbreak use&#xD;
           of the vaccine in future. (Applicable to part A 1st component only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :This is an adaptative seamless phase II/III study. This study design combines&#xD;
      the objectives of the phase II investigational stage with safety and dose strength finding,&#xD;
      before moving to the phase III as confirmatory stage using immunogenicity endpoint, into a&#xD;
      single study protocol moving from one stage to the subsequent stages after the regular&#xD;
      reviews of safety by DSMB with Go/No Go decisions defined for each part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be a multicentre, randomized clinical trial to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of&#xD;
      BBV87 vaccine in Panama, Colombia, and Thailand and it will be planned in three parts as&#xD;
      mentioned below :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Part A: An observer-blind, randomized controlled safety study of 0-6M schedule with&#xD;
      40µg in 12-65 year old subjects. Age stratification (i.e., 12-17 yrs and 18-65 yrs) is&#xD;
      planned. Part A is aimed at testing dose strength of 40µg at 0-6M schedule before moving into&#xD;
      a larger safety and immunogenicity study. The sample size calculation of Part A is based on&#xD;
      the safety endpoint and the randomization ratio 2:1 with 2 treatment groups (i.e., Group 1:&#xD;
      test vaccine with 40µg of BBV87 and Group 2: placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Part B: Anobserver-blind, randomized, controlled trial comparing two doses, 20µg and&#xD;
      40µg to assess immunogenicity and safety in healthy volunteers aged 12-65 years. Part B will&#xD;
      include 3 study arms (20µg, 40µg, and placebo) to compare 40µg versus 20µg at 0-28 days apart&#xD;
      schedule. Randomization ratio will be 2:2:1.The data collected from D0 toone month post dose&#xD;
      2 (8 weeks PD1), will be reviewed by the DSMB at week 13 PD1, and this board will review&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity data and provide recommendation for go/no go decision to proceed to&#xD;
      Part C. The &quot;go&quot; decision from DSMB will allow proceeding with the part C with the confirmed&#xD;
      optimal dose strength and regimen (i.e., 0-28 days apart).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III Part C: Phase III is aimed to evaluate safety and Immunogenicity of BBV87 at the&#xD;
      selected dose from part B, in two dose regimen (0-28 days apart). The Immunogenicity subset&#xD;
      will be randomized, observer-blind controlled cohort and the safety cohort will be open&#xD;
      label.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational vaccine is administered as 2-dose series: BBV87 will be administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly on days 0 and 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical strategy is designed to reach safety sample size requirement (~3000 vaccine&#xD;
      exposed participants) for WHO prequalification. For this purpose,in the first component of&#xD;
      Part A, 90 participants will be recruited and will be followed for 1 week for safety&#xD;
      assessment after the first dose. After the 7th day safety follow-up PD1 (Post-dose 1) data&#xD;
      obtained, there will be a DSMB review of safety data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;go&quot; decision from DSMB will trigger the following: second component of Part A and&#xD;
      recruitment for part B. In the second component of part A, additional participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled. All of the participants from both components of part A will receive second dose at&#xD;
      6 months and will be followed-up for 6 months after the second dose. Part A may provide data&#xD;
      for a potential emergency use regimen with 6 month- interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part B, a safety analysis will be carried out by DSMB at Week 13 based on data obtained in&#xD;
      Week 8 PD1. The &quot;go&quot; decision from DSMB will trigger the recruitment for part C with the&#xD;
      selected dose strength. Participants from part B will receive second dose at D28 PD1 and will&#xD;
      be followed for 6 months after the second dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from part C will receive second dose at D28 PD1 and will be followed-up for 6&#xD;
      months after the second dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DSMB&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Go/No Go decision will be determined by DSMB to move from part A to B and then to C using&#xD;
      the single dose strength (i.e., 20µg or 40µg). Part B will primarily determine dose and part&#xD;
      C will serve to confirm the safety and immunogenicity profile of the selected dose in the&#xD;
      0-28days schedule. Safety data will be reviewed on a regular basis as defined per DSMB&#xD;
      charter. Formal sequential stopping rules will be set up and could be formed using a defined&#xD;
      statistical method once discussed with DSMB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring committee (SMC) Safety monitoring committee (SMC) from IVI will review the&#xD;
      safety data on a regular basis during the conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods There are two primary comparisons to demonstrate superiority of BBV87&#xD;
      40µg compared to BBV87 20µg in Part B and superiority of BBV87 selected optimal dose compared&#xD;
      to placebo in Part C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical hypotheses for these two comparisons are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demontrate superiority of BBV87 40µg compared to BBV87 20µg • GMT of neutralization&#xD;
      antibody measured by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) at 28 days post second&#xD;
      dose of BBV87 40µg is superior to GMT at 28 days post second dose of BBV87 20µg vaccination&#xD;
      using superiority ratio margin of one (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demontrate superiority of BBV87 selected optimal dose compared to placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      • GMT of neutralization antibody measured by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) at&#xD;
      28 days post second dose of BBV87 selected optimal dose is superior to GMT at 28 days post&#xD;
      second dose of placebo using superiority ratio margin of two (2) The optiomal dose selection&#xD;
      in Part B and confirmation of the selected dose in Part C are considered separately. No&#xD;
      multiplicity adjustment is taken relative to these two comparisons. The superiority test of&#xD;
      BBV87 40µg vs. BBV87 20µg in Part B will be performed at a 0.025 significance level using&#xD;
      one-sided test (which is equivalent to significant level of 0.05 using a two-sided test). The&#xD;
      superiority test of BBV87 selected optimal dose vs. placebo in Part C will be performed at&#xD;
      the 0.025 significance level using a one-sided test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Titres of neutralizing antibodies persistence assessment against Chikungunya virus will&#xD;
           be quantified using the PRNT50. Chikungunya-binding IgG will be quantified by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Chikungunya suspected cases: CHIKV (RT-PCR) will be used to confirm Chikungunya&#xD;
           cases (blood sample will be taken during the acute phase of the disease as soon as&#xD;
           possible and within 7 days of the onset of fever).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, qRT-PCR for DENV and ZIKV may be performed by study site based on the local&#xD;
      practice to rule out these aetiologies according to investigator's judgment. Alternatively,&#xD;
      site-specific CHKV clinical diagnostic algorithm will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated Number of participants to Enroll: A total of 3,210 participants will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample sizes distribution by parts and age strata is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      N (Part A)= 450 participants (40µg; 0-6M schedule, 300 with BBV87 vaccine and 150 with&#xD;
      placebo); N (Part B)= 400 participants (40µg and 20 µg; 0-28 days schedule; 320 with BBV87&#xD;
      vaccine and 80 with placebo); N (Part C)=2,360 participants (Selected dose; 0-28 days&#xD;
      schedule, 2,270 with BBV87 vaccine and 90 with placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
      No formal power analysis if applicable to the safety data in Part A, as descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be used to summarize the safety data. A sample size of 30 in placebo of the&#xD;
      initial phase of Part A among Estimated Number of participants to Enroll: A total of 3,210&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample sizes distribution by parts and age strata is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      N (Part A)= 450 participants (40µg; 0-6M schedule, 300 with BBV87 vaccine and 150 with&#xD;
      placebo); N (Part B)= 400 participants (40µg and 20 µg; 0-28 days schedule; 320 with BBV87&#xD;
      vaccine and 80 with placebo); N (Part C)=2,360 participants (Selected dose; 0-28 days&#xD;
      schedule, 2,270 with BBV87 vaccine and 90 with placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
      No formal power analysis if applicable to the safety data in Part A, as descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be used to summarize the safety data. A sample size of 30 in placebo of the&#xD;
      initial phase of Part A among adults (18 to 65 yrs) will provide 95% confident that the&#xD;
      incidence of SAEs is &lt;10% if no vaccine-related SAEs are observed in a study group. Further&#xD;
      sample size of 120 in placebo of the second phase of Part A among adults (18 to 65 yrs) and&#xD;
      adolescent (12 to 17 yrs) will provide 95% confident that the incidence of SAEs is &lt;2% if no&#xD;
      vaccine related SAEs are observed in a study group. With 2:1 ratio in BBV87 40µg group and&#xD;
      placebo group. The total sample size of Part A is 450 paticipants (300 participants in BBV87&#xD;
      40µg group and 150 participants in placebo group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using superiority test for the ratio between two GMTs from parallel-group design (1:1 ratio&#xD;
      in BBV87 40µg vs. 20µg) in Part B, a total sample size of 320 participants (160 participants&#xD;
      per BBV87 vaccine group) would provide &gt;90% power at a one-sided significance level of 2.5%&#xD;
      to detect a mean rato (GMT 40µg to GMT 20µg) is greater than one (1). The coefficient of&#xD;
      variation on immune response is assumed as 3.0. In the ratio 2:1 between BBV87 40µg (or 20µg)&#xD;
      group and placebo group, a sample size of 240 participants [160 participants in BBV87 40µg&#xD;
      (or 20µg) group and 80 participants in placebo group] would provide &gt;80% power at a one-sided&#xD;
      significance level of 2.5% to detect superiority with margin mean ratio of two (2). The total&#xD;
      sample size of Part B is 400 paticipants in a 2:2:1 ratio (160 participants in BBV87 40µg&#xD;
      group, 160 participants in BBV87 20µg group, and 80 participants in comparator group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pivotal immunogenicity sub-cohort in Part C, a total of 360 participants in a 3:1&#xD;
      ratio (270 BBV87 vaccinees and 90 placebo recipients) would provide &gt;90% power at a one-sided&#xD;
      significance level of 2.5% to detect superiority with margin mean rato of two (2). The&#xD;
      coefficient of variation on immune response is assumed as 3.0. In the sample size&#xD;
      calculations, a 10% drop out rate is assumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In safety cohort, a total of 2,000 participants will receive BBV87 vaccine to have safety&#xD;
      data of optimal selected dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total sample size of Part C is 2,360 paticipants: the immunogenicity sub-cohort with 360&#xD;
      participants (270 in BBV87 selected dose group and 90 in the placebo group) and the safety&#xD;
      cohort with 2,000 participants receiving the BBV87 selected dose.&#xD;
