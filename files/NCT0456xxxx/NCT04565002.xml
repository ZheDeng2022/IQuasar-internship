      1. INTRODUCTION Patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) have an intense&#xD;
           predisposition to the development of muscle weakness in the first hours after the&#xD;
           orotracheal intubation process, since they are exposed, among other factors, to sedative&#xD;
           drugs, immobilization and properly controlled ventilation (DEMOULE et al., 2016). It is&#xD;
           observed that approximately 25% to 50% of patients submitted to ventilatory support have&#xD;
           muscle weakness and, of this proportion, 85% to 95% persist with neuromuscular&#xD;
           impairment for a period of two to five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this context, the elderly deserve attention because the demographic transition&#xD;
           process has the inversion of the age pyramid as one of its characteristics (WONG et al.,&#xD;
           2006). This leads to a higher incidence of admissions of these patients in intensive&#xD;
           care units compared to young people and adults, considering that they represent the&#xD;
           largest portion of the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Among the muscles affected by permanence in IMV in the general population and especially&#xD;
           in the elderly, the diaphragm can be highlighted, which evolves with a reduction in its&#xD;
           ability to generate tension due to the atrophy of its muscle fibers. This leads to an&#xD;
           alteration called diaphragmatic dysfunction (DD). The mechanisms involved with DD are&#xD;
           the reduction in the number of myofibrils (proteins that involve filaments of actin and&#xD;
           myosin responsible for the production of muscle contraction), oxidative stress (inducing&#xD;
           the activation of the forkhead box O1 protein, involved with the processes of&#xD;
           gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis) and the abnormal activation of a pathway responsible&#xD;
           for the proteolysis of adenosine triphosphate, ubiquitin-proteasome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Considering the progressive characteristic of DD, some consequences such as increased&#xD;
           IMV time, increased risk of respiratory complications and prolonged hospital stay can be&#xD;
           observed, if no specific intervention is performed . Therefore, it is necessary to adopt&#xD;
           measures that allow the early detection of diaphragmatic weakness, as well as the use of&#xD;
           conducts that prevent or treat this clinical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As for the diagnosis of DD, it can be performed using instruments that measure&#xD;
           inspiratory muscle strength, such as the manovacuometer, in addition to imaging tests&#xD;
           that show the diaphragmatic thickness (FDI), such as pulmonary ultrasonography (PU) .&#xD;
           The variable referring to inspiratory muscle strength in manovacuometry is the maximum&#xD;
           inspiratory pressure (MIP), while the thickness of the diaphragm, verified through the&#xD;
           PU, is represented by the diaphragmatic thickening index (DTI), obtained through the&#xD;
           difference between the diaphragm thickness total lung capacity (DTTLC) and functional&#xD;
           residual capacity (DTFRC), divided by DTTLC. The FDI contributes to the initial&#xD;
           diagnosis of DD and is also relevant for monitoring the evolution of diaphragm function&#xD;
           during the period of hospitalization and ventilatory weaning. According to Goligher et&#xD;
           al. (2015), the decrease in FDI is associated with impaired function of the diaphragm&#xD;
           and is correlated with low values of MIP in critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After obtaining variables related to the function of the diaphragm, as previously&#xD;
           described, conducts aimed at preventing or treating DD are important in an attempt to&#xD;
           minimize possible damage to the critical patient. Within outpatient pulmonary&#xD;
           rehabilitation, positive effects have been demonstrated with the use of electrotherapy,&#xD;
           specifically through the technique of transcutaneous electrical diaphragmatic&#xD;
           stimulation (TEDS) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This&#xD;
           technique consists of placing electrodes on the skin, in places close to the motor&#xD;
           points of the diaphragm, transmitting an intermittent current and generating action&#xD;
           potentials capable of producing muscle contractions. However, in the literature, there&#xD;
           is no evidence on the effects of this therapy on the FDI of elderly critically ill&#xD;
           patients, or even to assess the impact of TEDS on the time of mechanical ventilation and&#xD;
           hospitalization of this population. In view of the practicality of this treatment, its&#xD;
           low cost and the scarcity of evidence on this topic, the objective of the present study&#xD;
           will be to assess the influence of TEDS on respiratory muscle strength, diaphragm&#xD;
           thickness and duration of mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients under care&#xD;
           intensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. Study Design and Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
           The present study will be a controlled randomized clinical trial. It will also be&#xD;
           registered in the Clinical Trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All research participants will be submitted to the assessment of respiratory muscle&#xD;
           strength (manovacuometry) and diaphragm thickness (PU), and only EG patients will be&#xD;
           exposed to an intervention through the use of TEDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Sample&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sample will consist of participants of both sexes, over the age of 60, who have&#xD;
           undergone IMV. The research participants will be divided into a control group (CG) and&#xD;
           an experimental group (EG) and will carry out the same evaluation steps during the&#xD;
           spontaneous breathing test after weaning from mechanical ventilation, with only the EG&#xD;
           undergoing TEDS. The details of the intervention will be exposed later.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3 Proposed Procedures / Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           The evaluation of the research subjects will take place in the Adult Intensive Care&#xD;
           Units (I and II) of the Hospital e Maternidade Therezinha de Jesus - Juiz de Fora.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.1. Distribution of Participants, Evaluation and Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
           The research participants will be submitted to the evaluation of the FDI through the PU,&#xD;
           as well as of the respiratory muscle strength, through the manovacuometry, immediately&#xD;
           after the ventilatory weaning. It is worth noting that weaning and extubation will be&#xD;
           carried out following an institutional checklist (Appendix I) for greater patient&#xD;
           safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The EG, immediately after the 24-hour period on VMI, will be submitted to TEDS, twice a&#xD;
           day, with an interval of six hours between therapies to prevent respiratory muscle&#xD;
           fatigue. Initially, it will be performed with the patient in assisted-controlled&#xD;
           ventilation mode and well adapted to ventilation. The sensitivity parameter will be&#xD;
           adjusted to the value necessary so that the contractions produced by electrical&#xD;
           stimulation do not trigger the mechanical ventilator, preventing episodes of asynchrony.&#xD;
           After the suspension of drugs with a sedative effect (such as benzodiazepines and&#xD;
           endogenous opioids) and the ventilatory drive is resumed, TEDS will continue to be used&#xD;
           in EG patients until extubation, in spontaneous ventilation, following the same&#xD;
           protocol, however with the sensitivity readjusted to the standardized values to prevent&#xD;
           muscle fatigue. The procedures will be detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.2. Pulmonary Ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ultrasonography is a simple, safe and relatively low-cost procedure that, when using&#xD;
           exact equipment and standardized techniques applied by trained professionals, provides&#xD;
           relevant information on the respiratory system that has been demonstrated over the last&#xD;
           few years (DEMI et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient will position himself in the supine position and there will be the use of&#xD;
           the linear transducer to evaluate the superficial structures and the cardiac transducer&#xD;
           to evaluate the deep ones. There is a wide range of techniques to be employed, but the&#xD;
           eight-zone assessment is practical and quick to perform in emergency assessment and in&#xD;
           intensive care patients. The latter consists of the scanning of four areas by&#xD;
           hemithorax, namely: zones 1 and 2 indicate the upper anterior chest wall and the lower&#xD;
           anterior one respectively, and zones 3 and 4 indicate the upper lateral chest wall as&#xD;
           well as the lower lateral wall, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The equipment used to perform all pulmonary ultrasound exams will be the GE LogiqE&#xD;
           (Logiq-E GE 2014, Contagem, MG, Brazil), from the Ultrasonography Sector of the Hospital&#xD;
           and Maternidade Terezinha de Jesus, Juiz de Fora (MG).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.3. Assessment of Respiratory Muscle Strength&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to the American Thoracic Society (2002), the appropriate protocol for&#xD;
           obtaining the measurements related to respiratory muscle strength (MIP) must respect the&#xD;
           following characteristics: a) environment with a temperature of approximately 21ºC; b)&#xD;
           previous calibration of the manovacuometer; c) patient in a sitting posture (head&#xD;
           elevated by 90 °); and d) execution of a maximum inspiration starting from the residual&#xD;
           volume (RV) to reach the total lung capacity (TLC). The procedure must be repeated two&#xD;
           more times, with an interval of two minutes between repetitions (prevention of muscle&#xD;
           fatigue) and the measures of MIP and maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) considered will&#xD;
           be the highest recorded. The equipment used will be brand M120, with a scale of 4 cmH2O,&#xD;
           with variation of +/- 120 cmH2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.4. Transcutaneous Electrical Diaphragmatic Stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
           The TEDS protocol will consist of the following parameters: a) frequency of 30 Hz; b)&#xD;
           pulse width of 0.4 ms; c) respiratory rate of 15 irpm; d) holding time of 1 s; e) rise&#xD;
           time of 1 s; f) 2 s descent time; and g) 2 s non-stimulus time. Phrenics equipment&#xD;
           (Dualpex 961, Quark®, SP, Brazil) will be used. The positioning of the electrodes will&#xD;
           be performed according to a study by Cancelliero et al. (2012), who proposed the&#xD;
           placement of two electrodes in the right and left paraxiphoid regions, and two others in&#xD;
           the direction of the axillary midline, over the seventh intercostal space, also on the&#xD;
           right and left sides. The duration of the procedure will be 30 minutes, twice a day,&#xD;
           with a six-hour interval between applications, until the patient undergoes the&#xD;
           extubation process. As long as it does not have a level of consciousness, is not in&#xD;
           spontaneous ventilatory mode and without the use of drugs with a sedative effect, the&#xD;
           sensitivity of the ventilator will be adjusted in a way that does not trigger the&#xD;
           equipment, to avoid episodes of asynchrony. Immediately after recovering the level of&#xD;
           consciousness, resuming the ventilatory drive and suspending sedative drugs, the patient&#xD;
           during TEDS will be stimulated to inhale after the perception of the arrival of the&#xD;
           electric current, in spontaneous mode, and with the sensitivity adjusted to the baseline&#xD;
           values.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.4. Scratchs&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are chances of hemodynamic decompensation and respiratory distress during the use&#xD;
           of TEDS in EG patients, including changes in heart rate, blood pressure, as well as&#xD;
           respiratory rate and synchronization with the mechanical ventilator. If the events&#xD;
           described occur, the TEDS procedure will be stopped immediately. Ventilatory adjustments&#xD;
           will be made by the researcher according to the demands presented and the doctor on duty&#xD;
           will be informed to adopt conducts aimed at the patients' hemodynamic recovery,&#xD;
           regarding medication adjustments. There will be supervision by the responsible&#xD;
           researcher and the rest of the multidisciplinary team.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.5. Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
           Benefits may be generated for the study participants, including the reduction in the&#xD;
           time of mechanical ventilation, hospitalization, in addition to the probable rapid&#xD;
           reintegration of patients into activities of daily living after discharge, since&#xD;
           diaphragmatic muscle weakness contributes substantially to the delay in the process of&#xD;
           recovering functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. FINANCIAL SUPPORT&#xD;
&#xD;
      The equipment used in the research is available at the Therezinha de Jesus Hospital and&#xD;
      Maternity Hospital in the city of Juiz de Fora, state of Minas Gerais.&#xD;
