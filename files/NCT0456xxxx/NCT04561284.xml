  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem with a wide range of functions, and it is thought&#xD;
      that it can influence multiple processes in the human body. In turn, the composition and&#xD;
      activity of the gut microbiome is affected by many factors as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics can be very effective in treating bacterial infections, but they are also&#xD;
      associated with detrimental health effects. Previous studies have already shown that&#xD;
      antibiotics disturb the human gut microbiome composition by destroying commensal bacteria. As&#xD;
      it is well known that the microbiome influences host metabolism, perturbation of the healthy&#xD;
      microbiome (dysbiosis) is thought to be disease causing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prebiotics, on the other hand, are beneficial for the gut microbiome. These so-called&#xD;
      indigestible fibers are naturally present in our foods, but cannot be metabolised by the&#xD;
      human body. Many bacteria in the human gut are able to ferment these fibers and they&#xD;
      subsequently produce beneficial products for the rest of the body. Besides this, fiber intake&#xD;
      stimulates growth of commensal bacteria in the human gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it has become increasingly clear that prebiotics have a beneficial effect on the gut&#xD;
      microbiome and general health, it is still unclear to which extent the beneficial effects of&#xD;
      prebiotics supplementation occur after the gut microbiome is disturbed by antibiotics. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that prebiotic supplementation after antibiotics use will improve restoration of&#xD;
      the gut microbiome to a healthy state compared to placebo.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study, 40 overweight, but otherwise&#xD;
      healthy adults will first receive vancomycin for 7 days (3x 500mg per day) to disturb the gut&#xD;
      microbiome. They will then receive either indigestible fiber supplementation (classified) Ã³r&#xD;
      a placebo for the following 8 weeks. All study parameters will be assessed in two parallel&#xD;
      groups, to which subjects will be assigned using minimization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After initial screening, participants will be asked to visit the university for a total of 6&#xD;
      times during a period of 11 weeks. A clinical investigation day will take place at baseline,&#xD;
      after antibiotics use and after the supplementation period. The remaining 3 visits will be&#xD;
      short visits during the supplementation period (week 2, 4 &amp; 6 of supplementation).&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to collect feces every day before the university visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the clinical investigation days, an abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue will be&#xD;
      taken under fasting conditions. Participants will also perform a 7-point oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test to assess their insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, blood samples will be taken&#xD;
      in the fasted state to assess markers of fat metabolism, short-chain fatty acids, gut&#xD;
      hormones and inflammatory markers. Participants will be asked to hand in collected feces and&#xD;
      to fill in questionnaires regarding stool consistency, stool frequency and physical activity.&#xD;
      Lastly, they will be asked to hand in filled-in 3-day food diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the 3 remaining visits during the supplementation period, participants will hand in&#xD;
      collected feces and food diaries, and fill in the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these 6 visits, participants will have to invest approximately 14 hours.&#xD;
