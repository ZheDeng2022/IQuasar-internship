  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to validate 2 multi-contrast sequences, namely the&#xD;
      Multi-contrast ATherosclerosis Characterization (MATCH) and Bright-blood and black-blOOd&#xD;
      phase SensiTive (BOOST) inversion recovery sequence for the quantification of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaque components with conventional multi-sequence MRI and histology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque is the most important cause of&#xD;
      stroke and myocardial infarction. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with its high soft tissue&#xD;
      contrast is well suited for atherosclerotic plaque imaging to identify high-risk plaques.&#xD;
      High soft tissue contrast enables the visualisation of different plaque components based on&#xD;
      which the plaque can be classified as stable or vulnerable. To identify the various plaque&#xD;
      components, in a conventional MRI examination multiple MRI sequences are acquired, which can&#xD;
      take approximately 30-40 minutes. This can be uncomfortable for the patient and it is&#xD;
      impractical in daily clinical practice. As an alternative, multi-contrast sequences have&#xD;
      recently been developed which acquire multiple contrast weightings simultaneously,&#xD;
      significantly reducing the scan time (&lt; 6 minutes). Apart from a reduction in scan time,&#xD;
      because these contrast weightings are acquired simultaneously, they are inherently&#xD;
      co-registered which is not the case with conventional sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of this study is to validate 2 multi-contrast sequences, namely the&#xD;
      Multi-contrast ATherosclerosis Characterization (MATCH) and Bright-blood and black-blOOd&#xD;
      phase SensiTive (BOOST) inversion recovery sequence for the quantification of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaque components with conventional multi-sequence MRI and histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: cross-sectional validation study Study population: 40 patients with a carotid&#xD;
      artery plaque ≥2 mm based on ultrasound or Computed Tomography Angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): not applicable Main study parameters/endpoints: the presence&#xD;
      and volumetric measures of plaque components (fibrous tissue, lipid-rich necrotic core,&#xD;
      intraplaque hemorrhage and calcifications) and volumetric measures of the vessel wall and&#xD;
      lumen as assessed with multi-contrast MRI will be compared to those as assessed by&#xD;
      conventional multisequence MRI and, if available, histology of the surgically removed&#xD;
      specimen in patients that are scheduled for carotid endarterectomy.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective is to investigate the level of agreement between scoring presence of IPH on MR images acquired with MP-RAGE (conventional sequence) with scoring IPH on the multi-contrast sequences. The level of agreement will be assessed by calculating Cohen's k.</description>

    <description>In addition, we will report the sensitivity and specificity of scoring the presence of IPH, a LRNC, calcifications, a thin or rupture fibrous cap, and ulcerations using the multi-contrast images with the scores based on the conventional multi-sequence images as reference standard.</description>

        40 patients (18 years or older) with a carotid plaque ≥ 2 mm based on ultrasound or CTA,&#xD;
        will be included in this study. These patients will undergo a 3T MRI scan. Inclusion will&#xD;
        be done by an investigator. All the research will take place at Maastricht University&#xD;
        Medical Centre (MUMC). Vascular surgeons, neurophysiologists and neurologists at MUMC are&#xD;
        willing to participate in this study. Some of the included patients will be scheduled for&#xD;
        CEA as part of standard clinical care. The MRI scan of these patients will take place at&#xD;
        least one day before CEA is performed. At MUMC, approximately 10 patients per month fit the&#xD;
        criteria (≥ 2 mm carotid plaque size).&#xD;
