      Text2Connect (T2C) proposes to test a text-based intervention designed to improve engagement&#xD;
      with mental health treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To enhance outcomes for transition-age youth with mental health disorders during the&#xD;
      vulnerable period that occurs during their first several months of college, the investigators&#xD;
      propose an automated TM intervention, &quot;Text to Connect&quot; (T2C), that aims to increase mental&#xD;
      health self-efficacy through psychoeducation, self-monitoring of symptoms and stressors, and&#xD;
      cues to action for college-bound youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment of Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will utilize block randomization whereby 2/3 of participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive T2C, and 1/3 to receive PE. Blocks will balance the groups on site (CCP&#xD;
      versus STAR/CABS). A 2:1 randomization scheme will randomize 50 youth to either receive T2C&#xD;
      (n=30) or a link to brief psychoeducational videos about mental health (PE; n=20). All&#xD;
      participants will then complete a brief battery of self-report assessments online at baseline&#xD;
      and again monthly through month 4. Youth randomized to receive PE will receive a text message&#xD;
      with the link to the webpage with the psychoeducational videos. Youth randomized to receive&#xD;
      T2C will be onboarded and initiate the TM intervention that sends automated prompts at&#xD;
      minimum monthly through month 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To examine the feasibility of T2C for transition-age youth with psychiatric disorders&#xD;
      (n=3 clinics, 50 adolescents). Youth randomized to receive T2C will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a. engage with T2C at high rates (&gt;70% response rate to SMS prompts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b. report high levels of satisfaction (&gt;70% satisfaction) and usability with T2C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To examine the impact of T2C versus PE on mental health self-efficacy, symptoms and&#xD;
      functioning, and treatment engagement. Over 4 months, youth who receive T2C, as compared with&#xD;
      youth who receive PE, will report:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2a (Primary). Greater mental health self-efficacy Hypothesis 2b (Secondary). Lower&#xD;
      symptom severity and greater psychosocial functioning Hypothesis 2c (Secondary). Higher rates&#xD;
      of follow-through with mental health services&#xD;

    <description>Satisfaction with the technical components of interventions will be assessed through the certain questions from the Post System Satisfaction and Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ), as the primary outcome of Text2Connect Phase 2. The PSSUQ is utilizing 16 out of 19 items with response options ranging from 1 to 7 where 1=strongly disagree and 7=strongly agree. The PSSUQ has sub-scores derived from subsets of the questions which reflect system usefulness, information quality, and interface quality. Questions from sub-domains were chosen to tailor the questioning to this particular intervention. Scores range from 16-112, with higher score indicating less satisfaction.</description>

    <ipd_description>All requests for study data will follow NIMH's data sharing and data use policies. The final completely de-identified dataset(s) will include demographic and clinical data at baseline, and primary and secondary outcomes for all studies, including those funded by the innovation contests. These analytic datasets may also include derived variables with documentation. Our form datasets will include original case report forms, a detailed codebook of variable names, value labels, and programming formats and all study documentation including the protocol and manual of procedures. For descriptive/raw data, study investigators/study staff will upload to NIMH's National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Health Illness (NDCT) on a semi-annual basis all analyzed data being uploaded prior to primary paper publication.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>These data will be released to the NDCT soon after each project's &quot;main outcomes&quot; manuscript is accepted for publication</ipd_time_frame>
