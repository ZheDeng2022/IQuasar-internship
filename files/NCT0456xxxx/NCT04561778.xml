    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, prospective, single-blinded trial to determine the overall rate of&#xD;
      successful His-Purkinje conduction system pacing Optimized Trial of Cardiac Resynchronization&#xD;
      Therapy (HOT-CRT) versus biventricular pacing using coronary sinus lead (BVP) to compare&#xD;
      acute and mid-term outcomes. Acute outcomes include change in QRS duration pre-and&#xD;
      post-pacing (degree of QRS narrowing) and incidence of major periprocedural complications&#xD;
      (pericardial tamponade, need for lead revision, etc.). Mid-term outcomes include&#xD;
      echocardiographic response at 6 months along with a composite clinical outcome of heart&#xD;
      failure hospitalization, ventricular arrhythmias, crossover, and all-cause mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blinded study of 100 patients randomized to a strategy of His-Purkinje&#xD;
      conduction system pacing Optimized Trial of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (HOT-CRT)&#xD;
      versus biventricular pacing using coronary sinus (CS) lead (BVP). Both treatment options use&#xD;
      standard-of-care, FDA-approved devices. The distinction is only in the allocation toward&#xD;
      HOT-CRT and BVP. Treating physicians will be aware of assignment in order to facilitate&#xD;
      routine device follow-up. Echocardiographic and electrocardiographic evaluation will also be&#xD;
      performed in a blinded manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-over is permitted between treatment group allocation if:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CS lead cannot be placed due to difficult cannulation of the CS, limited branches at the&#xD;
      posterolateral or lateral wall, or phrenic nerve capture. These subjects may then cross-over&#xD;
      to HOT-CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOT-CRT subjects may cross-over if His or left bundle pacing lead cannot be positioned with&#xD;
      adequate stability and reasonable pacing output, or if optimal QRS narrowing cannot be&#xD;
      achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant procedure will be per routine percutaneous access, as is standard for pacemaker and&#xD;
      Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs). . All subjects will receive an FDA-approved&#xD;
      cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker or defibrillator device, as per standard of care&#xD;
      outlined for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be performed at 2 weeks post-implant for incision check and device&#xD;
      interrogation as is standard of care. In addition, routine device and clinical follow-up will&#xD;
      be scheduled at 3 and 6 months. Electrocardiography (ECG) will be performed pre-implant,&#xD;
      prior to hospital discharge, at 3 months, and 6 months. Echocardiography will be performed&#xD;
      pre-implant and 6 months to evaluate for change in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF),&#xD;
      chamber dimensions, volumes, and change in Left Ventricular (LV) end systolic volume index as&#xD;
      is standard of care in the treatment of patients with advanced heart failure. New York Heart&#xD;
      Association (NYHA) functional class and quality of life (utilizing the Kansas City&#xD;
      Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and EQ 5D) will be assessed pre-implant and at 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects randomized to HOT-CRT will undergo CRT as described below. His bundle pacing lead will be placed initially to achieve CRT. If complete resynchronization is achieved (BBB normalization) but capture thresholds are high (1.5-2V), the lead may be placed in the distal conduction system (left bundle branch area). If only partial QRS narrowing is achieved, a coronary sinus lead may be placed and LV timing may be optimized to achieve maximal resynchronization. This will be at the discretion of the implanting physician. Only FDA approved leads and devices will be used.</description>
