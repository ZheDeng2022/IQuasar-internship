  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study was conducted to compare the physical performances of the upper extremity and lower&#xD;
      extremity of handball players according to the positions they played.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this cross-sectional study, a total of 39 elite female handball players with at least of 5&#xD;
      years playing experience were tested.Maximal voluntary isometric (MVIC) knee flexion and&#xD;
      extension strength were measured using a handheld dynamometer (HDD) (Lafayette Instrument&#xD;
      Company, Lafayette, IN). Lower extremity vertical power was identified through the use of the&#xD;
      VertiMetric (Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette, IN) according to protocols suggested by&#xD;
      Ambegaonkar et al. Trunk extension endurance was measured using the Biering-Sorensen test as&#xD;
      previously described.The Davies test (DT) was used to assess upper body agility and&#xD;
      stabilization.The Closed Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability Test (CKCUEST) was utilized&#xD;
      to assess shoulder performance function and stability according to protocol suggested by&#xD;
      Goldbeck and Davies.The Shark Skill Test (SST) was developed in order to assess lower&#xD;
      extremity agility and neuromuscular control.&#xD;

        In this cross-sectional study, a total of 39 elite female handball players with at least of&#xD;
        5 years playing experience were tested. Player positions were identified for each athlete&#xD;
        by their coaches or by self-report as: goalkeepers, centres, pivots, or wing players. All&#xD;
        of them were playing in the premier Turkish professional handball league.&#xD;
