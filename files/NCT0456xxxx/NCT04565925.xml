      The goal of this study is to determine whether administration of sildenafil will decrease&#xD;
      urine leakage in patients with spinal cord injuries.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition affecting 291,000 women and men in the US&#xD;
      alone. Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common problem in these patients, affecting 52% of the&#xD;
      population, with episodes of incontinence occurring daily in 20-27% of affected persons. UI&#xD;
      after spinal cord injury (SCI) is a major cause of distress and morbidity amongst patients&#xD;
      with SCI, and is associated with decreased quality of life in general, physical, and&#xD;
      emotional domains. UI has the undesirable side effects of perineal irritation and infection,&#xD;
      increased odor, disrupted sleep, embarrassment, need to change clothes/bedding, and sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction, as well as significant financial burden. Persons living with a SCI have ranked&#xD;
      urinary problems as the most important health problem after injury. Addressing this&#xD;
      significant problem and providing relief has the potential to significantly improve the lives&#xD;
      of patients with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typical treatment options are geared toward the type of UI in each patient. For stress UI,&#xD;
      the goal of treatment is to provide support to the pelvic floor and urethra. Pessaries&#xD;
      (devices placed inside the vagina in women) or surgery (e.g. suburethral sling) to elevate&#xD;
      the urethra and/or bladder neck to increase the resistance to leak through the urethra are&#xD;
      commonly used. Urethral bulking agents or pelvic muscle floor therapy are also employed to&#xD;
      strengthen the closure pressure of the urethra in patients with stress UI. No pharmacologic&#xD;
      agents are currently available to treat stress UI. For urge UI, medications or electrical&#xD;
      stimulation aimed at relaxation of the detrusor muscle, including anticholinergics, are used.&#xD;
      For overflow or obstructive UI, treatments are aimed at shrinking or removing the&#xD;
      obstruction, such as medications to shrink the prostate, prostatectomy or mass removal. For&#xD;
      neurogenic UI, surgery for diversion or implant placement may be utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sildenafil (Viagra) has been well studied and used extensively in males to treat erectile&#xD;
      dysfunction. Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including sildenafil, are potent&#xD;
      vasodilators that enhance tissue perfusion, relax smooth muscle of the vasculature and&#xD;
      bladder, and stimulate skeletal muscle protein synthesis. It has been reported to improve&#xD;
      lower urinary tract symptoms, including urge UI and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in&#xD;
      men. In our team's recent study using sildenafil for treatment of UI in women, the&#xD;
      investigators found improvement in quality of life and a decrease in the number of&#xD;
      incontinence episodes in women taking sildenafil. Higher sildenafil plasma levels were&#xD;
      associated with greater improvement in symptoms. While the types of UI in women are somewhat&#xD;
      different than in men, studies have shown improvements in UI in both sexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators propose to conduct a two month randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      crossover trial of sildenafil in male and female adult SCI patients with UI to assess the&#xD;
      therapeutic potential of sildenafil to reduce the symptoms of urinary leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine whether sildenafil will decrease episodes of leakage of UI in adult women&#xD;
      and men with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine the effects of sildenafil on the subjective measures of UI, including&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will study patients with spinal cord injuries (aged 18-70) with current urine&#xD;
      leakage of more than 3 times/week (n=24). Subjects will undergo a double blinded randomized&#xD;
      cross over treatment of sildenafil (20mg TID) and placebo. Each treatment period will last 4&#xD;
      weeks with a 2 week washout between treatment periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after each treatment period, subjects will undergo testing which will consist of&#xD;
      measurements of urine post void residual volume (PVR), adverse event assessment, and&#xD;
      questionnaires of quality of life and urinary health.&#xD;

    <description>Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ-7) is a 7 item questionnaire measuring how much urinary symptoms affect activities of daily living, relationships and feelings. Each question is answered three times each, corresponding to the three scales - bladder/urine; bowel/rectum; vagina/penis). Responses for each question range from &quot;not at all&quot; (0) to &quot;quite a bit&quot; (3). Each scale is scored separately by calculating the mean of all seven questions and multiplying that number by 100 and then dividing by 3. Scale scores range from 0-100 with lower scores indicating less effect on quality of life. PFIQ-7 summary score is calculated by summing all three subscale scores (range 0-300).</description>
