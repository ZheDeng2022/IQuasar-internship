  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Starting in 2001, the Look AHEAD study randomized patients with type 2 diabetes to an&#xD;
      intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss versus a control group&#xD;
      receiving diabetes education (&quot;Diabetes Support and Education,&quot; or DSE). The ILI successfully&#xD;
      reduced weight, improved diabetes control, and functional status, among other outcomes. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators will compare employment, earnings, and retirement between the&#xD;
      ILI and the control group during and after the intervention period (2001-2018).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Starting in 2001, the Look AHEAD study randomized 5145 patients with type 2 diabetes to an&#xD;
      intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss versus a control group&#xD;
      receiving diabetes education (&quot;Diabetes Support and Education,&quot; or DSE).The Look AHEAD study&#xD;
      tested whether participants with type 2 diabetes assigned to an intensive lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention (ILI) for weight loss exhibited reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, relative to a control group receiving usual care and diabetes support and&#xD;
      education. During the 12-year intervention period, the ILI led to persistent reductions in&#xD;
      weight, waist circumference, and hemoglobin A1c and improvements in physical fitness, among&#xD;
      other clinical benefits. After the conclusion of the intervention in 2012, participants were&#xD;
      consented to be linked with administrative data. The investigators attempted to link 3188&#xD;
      consenting participants with Social Security Administration databases. Of these, the&#xD;
      investigators were able to successfully link 3093 participants. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will compare employment, earnings, and retirement between the ILI and the&#xD;
      control group during and after the intervention period (2001-2018). The investigators will&#xD;
      determine ILI-versus-control differences in employment, earnings, and retirement in each year&#xD;
      after randomization, relative to a pre-randomization assessment period. The investigators&#xD;
      will also investigate ILI-versus-control differences in cumulative years of employment and&#xD;
      earnings after randomization which occurred between 2001-2004. The investigators will use&#xD;
      multivariate regressions controlling for baseline participant characteristics and clinic site&#xD;
      and also survival analyses that estimate whether the time until retirement differs between&#xD;
      the ILI and control groups.&#xD;
