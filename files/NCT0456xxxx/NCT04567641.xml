    <textblock>
      Introduction: Nutritional support is a vital therapy of most surgical patients. Early&#xD;
      initiation via the enteral route has a significant effect on postoperative recovery. The&#xD;
      prognostic role of CRP and albumin can be explained by their abilities to reflect&#xD;
      inflammation in the acute phase in critical settings and assess the nutritional status of&#xD;
      critically ill patients, respectively. This indicates the prognostic value of the CRP/ALB&#xD;
      ratio in postoperative patients admitted to the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of work: Determine the effect of early enteral &amp; parenteral nutrition on ICU outcome &amp;&#xD;
      nutritional status in postoperative abdominal surgical patients and investigate the effect of&#xD;
      enteral &amp; parenteral nutrition on CRP/albumin ratio as an inflammatory marker &amp; its&#xD;
      correlation with SOFA score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A prospective cohort non randomized study included 80 postoperative abdominal&#xD;
      surgical patients at Critical Care Department, Cairo University over one year duration. Forty&#xD;
      patients (50%) received enteral nutrition 6 hours after surgical procedures and 40 patients&#xD;
      (50%) received parenteral nutrition 6 hours after surgical procedures. Nutritional status and&#xD;
      inflammatory markers were screened. All patients were followed up during the ICU stay &amp; up to&#xD;
      3 months. SOFA scoring was done every 48 hours.&#xD;

        The study included patients with age more than 18 years underwent major abdominal&#xD;
        surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pre-operative nutrition screening was done using Nutritional risk screening (NRS 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients were divided into two groups: Group A: 40 patients (50%) received enteral&#xD;
        nutrition 6 hours after surgical procedure &amp; Group B: 40 patients (50%) received parenteral&#xD;
        nutrition 6 hours after surgical procedure according to the surgeons preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Enteral feeding in group (A) was started 6 hours postoperatively via ryle tube or feeding&#xD;
        jejunostomy including proteins (1.5 gm/kg/day) with a caloric value (4.1 kcal/gm), fat&#xD;
        (caloric value = 9 kcal/gm) &amp; carbohydrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Parenteral feeding in group (B) was started 6 hours postoperatively using SmofKabiven&#xD;
        Peripheral [FRESENIUS KABI] : 1200 ml , 38 gm amino acids, 34 gm lipids, 85 gm glucose,&#xD;
        osmolarity 850 mosmol/L with total energy approximately 800Kcal.&#xD;
