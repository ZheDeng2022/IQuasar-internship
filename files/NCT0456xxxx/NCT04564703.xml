  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study with two parallel cohorts of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM)&#xD;
      patients in at least partial response (PR) after induction with proteasome inhibitors (PIs)&#xD;
      plus IMIDs and single or double ASCT Subjects will receive two dose levels of Iberdomide,&#xD;
      they will be evaluated for efficacy and safety. In case, in one cohort will be registered&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, a third cohort will be opened. Subjects will receive treatment until&#xD;
      progression, intolerance or unacceptable toxicity. Subsequently subjects will be followed for&#xD;
      24 months. The maximum number of subjects is 130 for cohort 1 and 2, 160 in case a third&#xD;
      cohort will be opened.&#xD;
