  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there are no diagnostics capable of predicting treatment response to intravesical&#xD;
      BCG. Because of this severe limitation, nearly 50% of patients treated with BCG fail therapy&#xD;
      and will a) require additional intravesical therapy or b) require cystectomy. A urine-based&#xD;
      diagnostic that possesses the potential to accurately identify patients who will respond&#xD;
      favorably to intravesical BCG is desperately needed.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically proven Ta, carcinoma in situ (CIS) or T1 stage&#xD;
             urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder diagnosed within 90 days prior to scheduled&#xD;
             BCG&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had all grossly visible papillary tumors removed within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to scheduled BCG or cystoscopy confirming no grossly visible papillary tumors&#xD;
             within 30 days prior to scheduled BCG&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with T1 disease must have cross-sectional imaging of abdomen/pelvis&#xD;
             demonstrating no evidence of nodal involvement or metastatic disease (CT scan or MRI&#xD;
             scan) within 90 days prior to scheduled BCG&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have intermediate or high-grade bladder cancer as defined by 2004&#xD;
             WHO/ISUP classification&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have pure squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients' disease must not have micropapillary components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have no evidence of upper tract (renal pelvis or ureters) cancer&#xD;
             confirmed by one of the following tests performed within 90 days prior to BCG: CT&#xD;
             urogram, intravenous pyelogram, MR urogram, or retrograde pyelograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No other prior non-bladder malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately&#xD;
             treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately&#xD;
             treated Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete&#xD;
             remission, or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for five&#xD;
             years. Patients with localized prostate cancer who are being followed by an active&#xD;
             surveillance program are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may be treated with immediate post-operative intravesical instillation of&#xD;
             a chemotherapeutic agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Scheduled to undergo intravesical BCG therapy within 4 weeks of signing consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to give written informed consent (see Appendix 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to provide voided urine sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous intravesical BCG therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be taking oral glucocorticoids at the time of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be planning to receive concomitant biologic therapy, hormonal&#xD;
             therapy, chemotherapy, surgery, or other cancer therapy while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have known history of tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have incomplete TUR, i.e., visible residual disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had radical cystectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a known active urinary tract infection or urinary retention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have active stone disease (renal or bladder) or renal insufficiency (creatinine &gt;2.0&#xD;
             mg/dL) - Serum creatinine value can be up to 2 years before consent, otherwise repeat.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have ureteral stents, nephrostomy tubes or bowel interposition&#xD;
&#xD;
