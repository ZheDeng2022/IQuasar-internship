  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since air pollution contains harmful toxicants, it is important for potential exposure to&#xD;
      indoor and outdoor air pollution to be considered as part of an overall health risk reduction&#xD;
      strategy. This is a behavioral intervention to assess the effectiveness on an air quality&#xD;
      education program in reducing exposure to air pollution and negative health effects. Trial&#xD;
      participants will complete a pre-test and home air quality assessment tool. Then, they will&#xD;
      participate in an educational module on air quality learn about suggestions to take to avoid&#xD;
      exposure and complete a spot test. One month after the educational intervention, the&#xD;
      participants will be contacted and asked qualitative questions to assess study effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution must be considered as part of an&#xD;
      overall health risk reduction strategy. Toxicants identified in outdoor air pollution, fine&#xD;
      particulate matter (PM2.5), and photochemical ozone cause a systemic inflammatory response to&#xD;
      the heart and lungs after exposure. Inside the home, health issues from exposure to carbon&#xD;
      monoxide (CO), PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) are&#xD;
      intensified when the home is sealed with the windows and doors closed. This exploratory study&#xD;
      seeks to promote health by teaching participants about strategies to reduce risks related to&#xD;
      indoor and outdoor effects of air pollution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will consist of an electronic demographic data collection form, home air&#xD;
      quality assessment, pre-test and post-test around an educational program and follow-up&#xD;
      interview one month after the educational program. Avoidance of air pollution as a health&#xD;
      risk reduction method is identified in the literature, however, there is limited research&#xD;
      addressing the influence of education on avoidance of environmental toxins as a health risk&#xD;
      reduction strategy. Therefore this study will provide a foundation for developing broader&#xD;
      educational and behavioral initiatives to improve health outcomes. Due to the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic, all aspects of this study will be completed either on-line via the Internet or by&#xD;
      telephone.&#xD;
