      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  obinutuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  venetoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  acalabrutinib&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of investigational drugs to learn whether the drugs work in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved [1] venetoclax- obinutuzumab and [2]&#xD;
      acalabrutinib individually as treatment options for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or&#xD;
      small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). However, the combination of all 3 drugs has not yet been&#xD;
      approved by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax is a targeted therapy drug that works by blocking a protein called Bcl-2 in&#xD;
           cancer cells. Bcl-2 helps cancer cells survive and resist the effects of cancer&#xD;
           treatments. By blocking Bcl-2, venetoclax may kill cancer cells and/or make them more&#xD;
           open to the effects of other cancer treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obinutuzumab is a drug that targets a protein called CD20, which is found on the surface&#xD;
           of B cells, the white blood cells that are affected by CLL. When obinutuzumab attaches&#xD;
           to CD20, it directly both destroys the B cells and makes them more &quot;visible&quot; to the&#xD;
           immune system. The immune system then attacks and destroys the cancerous B cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acalabrutinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). BTK is a&#xD;
           protein inside of the cell that may be over-expressed in malignant B cells. It is&#xD;
           involved in the signaling pathway from the B-cell receptor. BTK inhibition caused by&#xD;
           taking acalabrutinib results in decreased malignant B-cell growth and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this study, participants will receive obinutuzumab and venetoclax. We will monitor for&#xD;
      minimal residual disease (MRD) using a test called &quot;Adaptive ClonoSEQ&quot; after treatment with&#xD;
      obinutuzumab and venetoclax. MRD is a molecular test, which can detect whether there is any&#xD;
      evidence of CLL/SLL in the blood or bone marrow. For participants with detectable MRD despite&#xD;
      treatment with obinutuzumab and venetoclax, acalabrutinib will be added with the goal of&#xD;
      achieving undetectable MRD. Additionally, for participants who have progressive CLL/SLL&#xD;
      despite venetoclax and obinutuzumab, acalabrutinib will be added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment, end of&#xD;
      treatment visit, follow-up visits and an off-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive study treatment for 2 or 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be followed for 2 years after completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that 40 people will take part in this research study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genentech is supporting this research study by providing venetoclax and obinutuzumab.&#xD;

    <description>A treatment cycle is defined as 28 consecutive days. Participants with undetectable MRD (uMRD) at 1 year will complete an additional 1 year of VO then stop therapy.&#xD;
Participants with high detectable MRD at 1 year will complete an additional 1 year of VO plus acalabrutinib then stop therapy.&#xD;
