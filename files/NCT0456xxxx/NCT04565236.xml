      The goal of this study is to gather more information on safety and efficacy of Kovaltry for&#xD;
      the prevention and treatment of bleeds in Chinese children, adolescents/adults with severe&#xD;
      hemophilia A. In addition, pharmacokinetic parameters of Kovaltry will be assessed in a&#xD;
