      This is an investigator initiated prospective open-label, within-patient, masked, randomized&#xD;
      study in patients with neovascular AMD, DME, or RVO undergoing bilateral anti-VEGF&#xD;
      injections. Patients will be randomized into two cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) and then&#xD;
      followed for 3 consecutive injection visits. Treatment will be rendered at each injection&#xD;
      visit based on the individualized routine established anti-VEGF injection interval for each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;

      This is an investigator initiated prospective open-label, within-patient, masked, randomized&#xD;
      study in patients with neovascular AMD, DME, or RVO undergoing bilateral anti-VEGF&#xD;
      injections. Patients will be randomized into two cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) and then&#xD;
      followed for 3 consecutive injection visits. Treatment will be rendered at each injection&#xD;
      visit based on the individualized routine established anti-VEGF injection interval for each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the respective cohorts, one eye per patient will be randomized to receive either an&#xD;
      intracanalicular dexamethasone insert or the control treatment at each injection visit.&#xD;
      Cohorts are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total N= 40 eyes (20 patients). Twenty eyes (one eye per patient) will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive an intracanalicular dexamethasone insert. The contra-lateral eye (Control) will&#xD;
      receive a sham dilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total N= 40 eyes (20 patients). Twenty eyes (one eye per patient) will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive an intracanalicular dexamethasone insert. The contra-lateral eye (Control) will&#xD;
      receive topical corticosteroids (prednisolone acetate 1%) QID tapered over 4 weeks (QID/ 1&#xD;
      week, TID/ 1 week, BID/1 week, QD/ 1 week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In eyes randomized to either DEXTENZA or sham dilation, DEXTENZA insertion or sham dilation&#xD;
      will be performed prior to injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In eyes randomized to either DEXTNEZA or topical steroids, eyes randomized to DEXTENZA will&#xD;
      receive insertion prior to injection. Eyes randomized to topical steroid therapy (Control)&#xD;
      will receive 1 drop of prednisolone acetate 1% pre-injection and the remaining 3 drops of&#xD;
      prednisolone acetate 1% post injection. Control eyes will follow tapered dosing over 4 weeks&#xD;
      (QID/ 1 week, TID/ 1 week, BID/1 week, QD/ 1 week) to ensure dose matching between DEXTENZA&#xD;
      and Control in Cohort 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain will be rated at 6 time points: (1) prior to any treatment, (2) after anesthesia, (3)&#xD;
      after intravitreal injection, (4) 6 hours by telephone (+/- 2 hours), (5) 24 hours by&#xD;
      telephone (+/-3 hours) and (6) 3-6 days at assessment visit. Pain will be evaluated by survey&#xD;
      administrators masked to treatment assignment. Patient comfort (right eye vs left eye) will&#xD;
      be assessed at each patient visit by masked survey administrator. Anterior cell count and&#xD;
      anterior cell flare assessment will be conducted at 3-6 days following each intravitreal&#xD;
      injection visit. There will be a final patient preference survey performed.&#xD;
