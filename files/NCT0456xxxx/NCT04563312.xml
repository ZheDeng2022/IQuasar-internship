      Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare balance, coordination and lower extremity&#xD;
      functional performances of Muay Thai (MT) athletes and bodybuilders (BB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Seventeen athletes (14 men and 3 women; mean age: 20.65 + 2.34) engaged in MT and 18&#xD;
      (13 men and 5 women, mean age: 25.89 + 4.83) engaged in BB were included in the study. The&#xD;
      Flamingo Balance Test and Y Balance Test were used to evaluate static and dynamic balance,&#xD;
      respectively. Coordination was assessed using the Hexagon Test. Lower extremity functional&#xD;
      performance was evaluated using the Single Leg Hop Test.&#xD;
