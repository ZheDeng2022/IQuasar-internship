  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a group of novel immunotherapies that boost the&#xD;
      body's own defense against the cancer by improving the immune system's ability to recognize&#xD;
      and destroy cancer cells. While it is relatively well-documented that conventional cancer&#xD;
      treatments (e.g., chemotherapy) are associated with cognitive impairment, virtually nothing&#xD;
      is yet known about effects on cognition during and after ICI treatment. Due to significantly&#xD;
      improved survival rates after ICI treatments, it becomes important to map possible adverse&#xD;
      effects associated with these treatments. The investigators therefore investigate possible&#xD;
      changes in cognitive function in a group of cancer patients from prior to ICI treatment to&#xD;
      nine months later. A gender- and age- matched healthy control group will serve as a&#xD;
      comparison. The study has the potential to broaden our understanding of associations between&#xD;
      cognition, the brain, and the immune system and to provide clinically relevant knowledge&#xD;
      about possible cognitive impairments associated with immunotherapy.&#xD;

      This controlled prospective observational study will include two groups with a total of 84&#xD;
      participants. A total of 42 patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma, referred to&#xD;
      treatment with ICI will be enrolled in the study and examined prior to treatment with ICI&#xD;
      (baseline), at nine weeks following baseline (T2), at 24 weeks following baseline (T3) and at&#xD;
      36 weeks following baseline (T4). A total of 42 gender- and age- matched healthy controls&#xD;
      will be included and assessed at similar time points. Assessments will include a battery of&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests, questionnaires, blood samples, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#xD;
      (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the study are to investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Changes in cognitive functions over the course of treatment with ICIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Possible associations between changes in cognitive function and immune markers during&#xD;
           and following ICI treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Possible associations between changes in cognitive function and changes in brain&#xD;
           morphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Changes over time in other possible adverse effects of ICI treatment, including&#xD;
           psychological distress, sleep disturbances, and fatigue.&#xD;
