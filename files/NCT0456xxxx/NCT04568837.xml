      This trial studies how well low-dose postoperative corticosteroids (FDA approved) affect&#xD;
      patient outcomes (patient reported outcomes, pain medication use, length of stay, major&#xD;
      complications, and time to first bowel movement) after thoracic and/or lumbar spine fusion&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES This study aims to compare patient outcomes (patient reported outcomes,&#xD;
      pain medication use, length of stay, major complications, and time to first bowel movement)&#xD;
      between subjects that receive either 20 mg of PO prednisone or 1 mL of 4 mg/mL of IV&#xD;
      dexamethasone sodium phosphate and a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE Participants are patients who elect to participate in the study prior to scheduled&#xD;
      thoracic and/or lumbar spine fusion surgery at Oregon Health and Science University.&#xD;
      Participants undergo their scheduled spine fusion surgery. After surgery, participants are&#xD;
      randomized into either the study drug group or the control (non-treatment) group. If&#xD;
      randomized into the study drug group, participants will orally take a daily dose of 20 mg of&#xD;
      prednisone (1 mL of 4 mg/mL dexamethasone sodium phosphate if unable to tolerate oral&#xD;
      administration) on postoperative days one and two.&#xD;
