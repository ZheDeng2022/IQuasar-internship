    <textblock>
      Persistent adherence to lifestyle modifications and blood pressure lowering medications were&#xD;
      the best way to control blood pressure. But low adherence was noted in reviews and studies&#xD;
      resulting those taking blood pressure lowering medications could not achieve a controlled&#xD;
      blood pressure. In this study, a theory-guided educational program will be developed with an&#xD;
      aim to improve the blood pressure, self-efficacy and adherence behaviors among those&#xD;
      diagnosed with high blood pressure in the community. 148 participants will be recruited and&#xD;
      divided into control group and intervention group randomly in a ratio of 1:1. The&#xD;
      intervention group will receive the theory-guided educational program, while the control&#xD;
      group will receive the usual care. The study will last for 12 weeks. Data will be collected&#xD;
      at baseline, week 8 and week 12. SPSS and generalized estimating equations model will be&#xD;
      employed for data analysis. The results will inform an effective way to conduct health&#xD;
      promotion in community. The improved adherence to lifestyle modifications and medications&#xD;
      will be beneficial to the clients' health.&#xD;

      Persistent adherence to lifestyle modifications and anti-hypertensive medications were&#xD;
      emphasized in hypertension guidelines to control blood pressure effectively. But low&#xD;
      adherence to lifestyle modifications and medication were noted in reviews and studies. Low&#xD;
      adherence would lead to those received hypertension treatment did not achieve a controlled&#xD;
      blood pressure. In this study, an educational program guided by the Health Promotion Model&#xD;
      will be conducted to examine the effect on blood pressure, self-efficacy and treatment&#xD;
      adherence among hypertensive patients in the community. A 2-arm parallel randomized control&#xD;
      trial will be conducted. 148 participants will be recruited and divided into control and&#xD;
      intervention group in a ration of 1:1. The intervention group will receive the theory-guided&#xD;
      educational program, while the control group will receive the usual care. The study will last&#xD;
      for 12 weeks. Data will be collected at baseline, week 8 and week 12. SPSS and generalized&#xD;
      estimating equations model will be employed for data analysis. The results will inform&#xD;
      community healthcare professionals about the effective way for health promotion, to enhance&#xD;
      the adherence to lifestyle modifications and medications among hypertensive clients resulting&#xD;
      sustainable benefits to the clients' health.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 8, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) is measured by a trained research assistant. A validated upper-arm blood pressure monitor is used for the blood pressure measurement.</description>

    <measure>Change of Treatment Adherence Questionnaire for Patients with Hypertension (TAQPH) at week 8 and week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 8, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>TAQPH consists of 28 items and covers the adherence to medications and lifestyle modifications in hypertension management. The responses are made on a 1-4 scale, and the sum of the score ranges from 28 to 112. The TAQPH has been proved to be reliable with good Cronbach's alpha coefficient 0.86 for Chinese hypertensive adults.</description>

    <measure>Change of Self-efficacy for managing chronic disease (SEMCD) at week 8 and week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 8, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>SEMCD consists of six self-report items to measure the self-efficacy of hypertension management. Summative scores range from 6 to 60. The scale was translated into Chinese and yielded a good reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.88-0.98; teste-retest reliability = 0.73-0.98) in Chinese hypertensive adults and Chinese older adults.</description>
