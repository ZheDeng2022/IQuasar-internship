    <textblock>
      To assess the impact of a 12-week virtual seated physical intervention on cardiovascular&#xD;
      health and wellness in people with chronic neurological impairments (CNI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine how effective seated Zoom exercise classes are for a person with&#xD;
      CNI for addressing cardiovascular health, physical wellness and quality of life. If these&#xD;
      classes prove to be effective, online platforms could be a viable avenue for those with CNI&#xD;
      to exercise and increase/maintain wellness without having to leave their homes. The&#xD;
      investigators are also attempting to determine if a class with a live instructor vs a&#xD;
      pre-recorded class has an effect on motivation, compliance, exertion and&#xD;
      modifications/safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire process, including screening and consenting, will be done via Zoom and Redcap,&#xD;
      potentially providing a blueprint for the future studies. This process can enable&#xD;
      participants to participate in studies with minimal inconvenience, expense and effort of&#xD;
      traveling for the consent process.&#xD;

Exercise will include repetitive bouts of high intensity exercises with intermittent periods of rest or active recovery. circuit of moves like 'jabs', 'hooks' etc, and a strength and endurance class that promotes postural awareness.</description>
