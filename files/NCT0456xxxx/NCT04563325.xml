  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A nationwide, multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority trial of children with bone and joint&#xD;
      infections. The primary objective is to determine if oral-only antibiotics (experimental arm)&#xD;
      is non-inferior to initial intravenous antibiotics followed by oral therapy (control arm).&#xD;
      Children will be randomized 1:1. The total treatment duration is identical in both groups.&#xD;
      The study is open label with blinding of the primary endpoint assessor.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The assessor (qualified pediatrician or pediatric surgeon) of the primary endpoint (sequelae 6 months after initiation of treatment) will be informed about the age of the child as well as the approximate location of the infection (categories: skull/face, spine, chest, arm, hands/wrist, hip, leg, foot/ankle). The exact anatomical location including side (left or right) will not be revealed. The child and parents will be followed by a study nurse who will secure that the blinding is respected. Any positive findings at the clinical examination will be presented to the endpoint committee. The endpoint committee is blinded only to the treatment allocation and will decide if any positive findings from the 6 months evaluation is related to the infection and if they are, the primary endpoint is met.</masking_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children aged 3 months to 18 years with antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated bone or&#xD;
             joint infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Severe disease, e.g. septic shock, or any concomitant infection, e.g. necrotizing&#xD;
             fasciitis, requiring IV antibiotics in the opinion of the treating clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Complicated bone or joint infection, e.g. prosthetic material, infection secondary to&#xD;
             or complicated by trauma, severe pyomyositis or other substantial soft tissue&#xD;
             infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Expected need of major surgery within the first 24 hours of treatment, e.g. drilling,&#xD;
             debridement, fenestration, surgical drainage, synovectomy. Minor surgery as diagnostic&#xD;
             surgical bone biopsy or diagnostic joint fluid aspiration including lavage is not a&#xD;
             criterion for exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Significant co-morbidities that might influence the choice of treatment or the course&#xD;
             of the infection, e.g. immunodeficiency, immunosuppressive therapy, sickle cell&#xD;
             anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Previous bone or joint infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Antibiotic therapy for more than 24 hours before inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Documented pathogen with limited treatment options that do not permit randomization,&#xD;
             e.g. the pathogen is only sensitive to intravenous antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Prior enrolment in the trial&#xD;
