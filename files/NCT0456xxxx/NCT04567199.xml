    <textblock>
      The aim of this retrospective study was to identify if the enrolled patient might have had a&#xD;
      profit of Cytosorb therapy. Primarily the decline in catecholamine therapy under Cytosorb&#xD;
      therapy will be investigated. Secondarily the outcome of surviving patients will be evaluated&#xD;
      and compared to expected mortality due to sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA). Thirdly&#xD;
      the patients deceased under this therapy were compared to the surviving patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe septic Shock has a high mortality ranging from 30-55% and might lead up to 100%&#xD;
      mortality under cardiovascular failure and vasoplegia in the initial phase of severe septic&#xD;
      shock . Mostly caused by bacteremia, it can also be triggered by viral or fungal infections.&#xD;
      Due to vasodilatation caused by toxins the circulatory system of the patient fails. This will&#xD;
      lead to further malfunctions of the patient organs (e.g. renal malfunction, vasodilation,&#xD;
      myocardial pump failure and DIG) and will cause multiorgan system failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays there is a symptomatic approach to treat septic shock. Except of giving antibiotics&#xD;
      less can be done to improve the patient's condition. Treatment with fluids, catecholamines,&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapies are all regimen to bridge failed organ&#xD;
      systems until normal organ function is restored and starts to improve. It is known that the&#xD;
      cytokines and toxins, which are liberated by the breakdown of bacterial cells, maintain the&#xD;
      inflammatory response of the body. This process might be overshooting and if not disrupted,&#xD;
      the patient will die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new approach is to bind this cytokines and toxins in an unspecific physical process to tiny&#xD;
      plastic beads, which are arranged in the CytoSorb System as they correlate with severity of&#xD;
      mortality in sepsis . This polymer beads allow adsorption and binding of molecules from 5-60&#xD;
      kDa (kilodalton) range. Therefore, Cytokines as IL(interleukin)-1, -6, -8 and -10 can be&#xD;
      effectively removed. CytoSorb has to get in contact with patient blood. To use this option of&#xD;
      treatment CytoSorb is implemented in a renal replacement system, a heart lung machine, ECMO&#xD;
      (extracorporeal membrane oxygenator) or any other extracorporeal pump driven system. By&#xD;
      extracorporeal blood purification in septic shock the main goal is to eliminate inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators and bacterial toxins. This might attenuate the excessive inflammatory response and&#xD;
      could lead to hemodynamic stabilization .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this retrospective study was to identify if the enrolled patient might have had a&#xD;
      profit of Cytosorb therapy. Primarily the decline in catecholamine therapy under Cytosorb&#xD;
      therapy will be investigated. Secondarily the outcome of surviving patients will be evaluated&#xD;
      and compared to expected mortality due to sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA). Thirdly&#xD;
      the patients deceased under this therapy were compared to the surviving patients.&#xD;

        Due to this relatively new treatment concept there is less data at the moment available. 50&#xD;
        patients treated with CytoSorb, if available, in suspicion of severe septic shock will be&#xD;
        examined to collect data on outcome. These patients will be compared to 50 patients not&#xD;
        treated with CytoSorb. Overall about 100 patients will be analysed.&#xD;
