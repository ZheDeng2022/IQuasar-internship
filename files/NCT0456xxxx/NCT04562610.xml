  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the impact and effect of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS)&#xD;
      principles in the recovery and rehabilitation of patients following elective orthopaedic&#xD;
      spine surgery with a specific emphasis on oral versus intravenous preoperative medication&#xD;
      administration and the resultant cost differences.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In orthopaedic surgery, ERAS programs have profoundly impacted outcomes in hip and knee&#xD;
      replacement surgery.4 Large, prospective studies have demonstrated a reduction in mortality&#xD;
      rate, median length of stay, and blood transfusion rates with no change in re-admission&#xD;
      rates.5,6 However, there is a paucity of data evaluating the application of ERAS principles&#xD;
      in other orthopaedic subspecialties, especially elective spine surgery. With over 35,000&#xD;
      cervical spine procedures performed in 2011, almost 200,000 elective lumbar fusion surgeries&#xD;
      performed in 2015, and 83.7 million people estimated to be â‰¥ 65 years old in 2050, the demand&#xD;
      for elective spine surgery is high and will continue to grow placing a significant economic&#xD;
      burden on the health care system.This increasing demand in conjunction with prolonged&#xD;
      hospital stays, extensive postoperative pain regimens, and the advent of minimally invasive&#xD;
      procedures provides a compelling argument for the suitability of ERAS protocols in elective&#xD;
      spine surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While distinct components of the ERAS pathway have been investigated in spine surgery&#xD;
      including preoperative education, multimodal pain management, surgical approach, nutrition,&#xD;
      and physical therapy, few studies have investigated the collective application of these&#xD;
      interventions. Furthermore, these studies have been retrospective in nature, limiting their&#xD;
      generalizability.The goal of this study is to perform a prospective, randomized trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of oral versus intravenous medications&#xD;
      preoperatively. The investigators also plan to evaluate the effect of the implementation of&#xD;
      the standard of care ERAS principles on the outcome of patients undergoing elective spine&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
