      The aim of this study is to develop an application in order to identify the most relevant&#xD;
      cognitive and behavioral parameters for the diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity&#xD;
      Disorder (ADHD) in conditions closer to reality&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      disorder in school-aged children. This disorder is characterized by a symptomatic triad&#xD;
      associating, inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Cognitive, emotional and behavioral&#xD;
      dysfunctions have a strong impact on the school, family and social domains of the child. The&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of ADHD is all the more difficult because there are currently no&#xD;
      biological, clinical or psychological markers that accurately measure the symptoms of ADHD.&#xD;
      The diagnosis is made during interviews with specialist doctors allowing the collection of&#xD;
      information from parents and the child. Virtual reality technology is most recognized as a&#xD;
      tool for assessment, rehabilitation of cognitive processes and functional skills. In addition&#xD;
      to traditional diagnostic assessment methods, a virtual reality application in an immersive&#xD;
      room (CAVE) in three dimensions could objectively assess the child in a dynamic environment&#xD;
      that is as close as possible to everyday situations&#xD;
