      In patients with high caries risk, will the use of cinnamon extract or chlorohexidine based&#xD;
      mouthwashes have an effect on the percentage of recovery and cariogenicity of Streptococcus&#xD;
      mutans (SM) detected by real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) over one month follow up&#xD;

      This clinical study will be held in the clinic of conservative dentistry department, Faculty&#xD;
      of Dentistry, Cairo University. The operator in charge will be Mostafa Mahmoud El-Ghazali.&#xD;
      Patients will be examined and selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, the&#xD;
      purpose and method of the study will be explaned to the selected patients, written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from the patients for participation in the study. In the first&#xD;
      visit, ADA caries risk assessment model will be done. Participants will be divided into two&#xD;
      groups according to the tested mouthwashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be instructed not to have breakfast and to refrain any oral hygiene&#xD;
      measures on the day of sample collection to avoid the inﬂuence of food consumption and&#xD;
      contamination on the composition of saliva. The patient will sit in an erect position on the&#xD;
      dental chair and will be given paraffin block to chew. The stimulated saliva will be&#xD;
      collected after 2 minutes of paraffin chewing in sterile containers held near the mouth. The&#xD;
      containers will be properly labeled. The study will be carried over a period of one month,&#xD;
      the saliva samples for each patient will be collected on the ﬁrst dental visit. These samples&#xD;
      will be then sent to the laboratory for microbiological assessment. Patients will be provided&#xD;
      with mouthwashes according to the tested groups and they will be instructed to use it 2 times&#xD;
      per day for 1 minute each time and no eating or drinking permitted for a minimum of 30&#xD;
      minutes post rinsing. Each patient will be given the same instructions with respect to oral&#xD;
      hygiene measures. They will be advised to continue on same diet and will be instructed not to&#xD;
      change their dietary habits. Patients will come after 2 weeks for salivary samples collection&#xD;
      and samples will be sent to the laboratory for microbiological assessment. After treatment&#xD;
      continuity for another 2 weeks, patients will come for the last visit to collect the salivary&#xD;
      samples which will be sent to the laboratory for microbiological assessment.&#xD;

    <description>Total extraction of DNA: Total plasmid DNA will be prepared. The solution will be centrifuged and then left at room temperature for few minutes for the phase separations. The aqueous phase containing DNA will be transferred to clean eppendorf.&#xD;
PCR Polymerase chain reaction: The PCR will be performed in 25µl reaction volume containing: DNA template, enzymes, primer and nuclease-free water. The tubes containing the PCR mixture will be transferred to the thermal cycler apparatus. The PCR products will be analyzed in agarose gel by electrophoresis, photographed and analyzed.</description>
