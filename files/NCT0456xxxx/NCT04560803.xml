  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing radiation for the treatment of malignancies may suffer from side effects&#xD;
      to the skin in the form of radiation dermatitis. This can lead to local wound formation with&#xD;
      poor healing. Treatment options for the resulting wound can range from watchful waiting to&#xD;
      more aggressive debridement and secondary grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidermal grafting is a technique in which autologous epidermis is used to cover wounds that&#xD;
      are larger than the donor site. Previous studies have demonstrated that this is an effective&#xD;
      treatment for different wounds and ulcers but its utility has not yet been evaluated for the&#xD;
      treatment of radiation induced injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CelluTome Epidermal Grafting System is a semi automated device that allows easy formation&#xD;
      of epidermal Blister.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will evaluate the efficacy of epidermal grafts collected using the CelluTome device&#xD;
      in the treatment of radiation dermatitis.&#xD;

      Patients participating in this study will undergo the epidermal grafting procedure to a part&#xD;
      of their radiation-induced wound. The remaining untreated area will serve as an irradiated&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The donor tissue will be collected from normal skin in the upper thigh area. In addition to&#xD;
      their primary screening visit, patients will be followed up closely in a series of 9 study&#xD;
      visits. During these sessions, photographs will be taken and patients will be asked to fill&#xD;
      out questionnaires.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Status post radiation treatment, with radiation-induced wound. This includes patient&#xD;
             with moist desquamation as well as full epidermal necrosis and superficial dermal&#xD;
             ulcerations, this wound would otherwise be allowed to heal by secondary intention;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having suitable areas of treatment: All wounds in the area of interest must be at&#xD;
             least 20 cm2 (~10 cm2 per treatment/control area);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The radiation injury must have a suitable adjacent irradiated control site before&#xD;
             initiation of treatment. This will be determined by objective measurements of % wound&#xD;
             epithelization, wound erythema, pliability, induration and thickness at enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to comply with all visit, treatment and evaluation schedules and&#xD;
             requirements;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Wound considered appropriate by physician to receive epidermal grafting;&#xD;
