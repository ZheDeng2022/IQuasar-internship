      The investigators designed the multicenter randomized parallel controlled clinical trial of&#xD;
      electroacupuncture on PHN which is rigorously designed and have an appropriate sample size,&#xD;
      aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture in pain relieving and pain&#xD;
      removing in the treatment of patients with PHN.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postherpetic neuralgia(PHN) is the most common complication of herpes zoster, is a severe and&#xD;
      intractable pain with a high incidence. Nearly 50% of PHN patients have experienced&#xD;
      persistent pain for more than one year. Although it is not directly life-threatening, will&#xD;
      lead to sleep disorders, even depression, seriously affecting the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients. This project is a multi-center randomized controlled trial, which will recruit 448&#xD;
      patients with PHN in 7 hospitals, aiming to evaluate the analgesic effect and safety of&#xD;
      electroacupuncture on postherpetic neuralgia, and provide evidence-based medical evidence for&#xD;
      electroacupuncture treatment of PHN.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Using the center stratification block randomization method, the center is used as the stratification factor, and subjects were randomly assigned to the electroacupuncture group and the sham electroacupuncture group at a ratio of 1:1. The central randomization system is used for randomization operations.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The randomization scheme is generated, validated and imported into the central randomization system by a statistician who do not participate in this trial by using R software. The central randomization system has set strict personnel permissions, and no one has right to view the randomization scheme except the highest-level system administrator. Patients and study investigators (i.e., outcome assessors, data recorders, data entry clerks and statistical analysts) will be blinded to the group assignment. Due to the nature of the intervention, acupuncturists will not be blinded to the treatment.</masking_description>

    <description>Choose the appropriate position according to the patient's herpes site, and routinely disinfect the skin. Paste the fixed insulating pad on the acupoint, and use a 0.30Ã—40mm acupuncture needle to penetrate the skin 10mm obliquely through the fixed insulating gasket at Ashi point; According to the above operation, the SJ6 and GB34 point of the affected side are directly penetrated into the skin 15-20mm. The local Ashi point connects the two poles of the electroacupuncture device according to the first and last points of the long axis of the painful part, and the SJ6 and GB34 point on the affected side are connected to the poles of the electroacupuncture device. Electroacupuncture waveform is continuous wave, frequency is 2Hz, and current intensity is 1-5mA (causing slight tremor of the skin around the acupuncture point without pain). Continue the electroacupuncture treatment for 30 minutes.</description>

    <description>Participants randomly assigned to the sham electroacupuncture (SA) group received sham electroacupuncture by using placebo blunt needles at the same acupoints. After disinfecting the skin and placing the sterile insulating adhesive pads on unilateral Zhigou, Yanglingquan and Ashi points, placebo blunt needles are inserted through the pads and reach the insulating adhesive layer, causing the participants to feel the needle resistance (a sensation of needle insertion). Other procedures, electrode placements, parameter of electroacupuncture apparatus and treatment settings are the same as in the EA group, but with no skin penetration or electricity output.</description>
