      Setting and Location:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CBCT data of this study will be obtained from the CBCT database available at the&#xD;
      Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University,&#xD;
      Cairo, Egypt. Being a retrospective study, CBCT scans of Egyptian patients who have already&#xD;
      been subjected to CBCT examination as part of their dental diagnosis and/or treatment&#xD;
      planning will be included according to the proposed eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on sample size calculation, a sample of 304 mandibular third molar teeth belonging to&#xD;
      Egyptian individuals will be examined. The selection of the scans to be included will be&#xD;
      based on the following eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria and selection method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT scans should show Mandibular third molars (Erupted &amp;/or impacted) of Egyptian patients&#xD;
      aging from 18 to 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mandibular third molars showing complete root formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intact lingual cortex as well as intact mandibular third molars' roots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT scans of different fields of view (quadrant, single, or inter-arch) could be included as&#xD;
      they show the mandibular third molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT scans of a maximum of 0.4 mm voxel resolution will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mandibular third molars with developmental anomalies, external or internal root resorption,&#xD;
      root canal calcification, previous root canal treatment, post restorations, and/or root&#xD;
      caries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mandibular third molars with any pathology associated with and/or surrounding their roots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT images of sub-optimal quality or artifacts/high scatter interfering with proper&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Matching criteria and allocation ratio: Not applicable in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Details about variable:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Relationship between mandibular third molars' roots and covering lingual cortex&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Morphology of lingual cortex around mandibular third molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Variation in number of roots of mandibular third molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data Sources / Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective Data Analysis will be performed after the CBCT images are pooled from the&#xD;
      computer database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure parameters of the scans will vary depending on the individual patient's sizes&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT scans showing mandibular third molars with a maximum of 0.4 mm voxel size will be&#xD;
      reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT images will be analyzed using Planmeca Romexis® Viewer software, where the sagittal and&#xD;
      coronal cross-sectional images will be oriented to be aligned with the long axis of the&#xD;
      roots, together with the help of axial cross-sectional images for proper evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the cross-sectional image, the relationship between mandibular third molars' roots and&#xD;
      covering lingual cortex will be assessed at two levels (root apex and most lingual portion on&#xD;
      apical one half) according to Emes classification: type A (non-contact), type B (contact), &amp;&#xD;
      type C (perforation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lingual cortex morphology around mandibular third molars' roots will also be assessed on&#xD;
      the cross-sectional image according to the modified classification by Chan &amp; Momin: Type U,&#xD;
      undercut on the lingual side; Type P, parallel to the buccal plate; Type S, slanted with&#xD;
      buccolingual width reduced on the lingual side, and Type R, round shape on the lingual side).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT images will be interpreted by two oral radiologists independently; blinded from&#xD;
      demographic data of the patients and from the results of each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each radiologist will evaluate the images for assessment of number of roots, their&#xD;
      relationship with covering the lingual cortex, and lingual cortex morphology. Then one of&#xD;
      them will re-evaluate the images twice with two weeks interval between the two reading&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-observer and inter-observer and variability between the observers will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Addressing potential sources of bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No source of bias. CBCT images will be interpreted by two oral and maxillofacial radiologists&#xD;
      independently blinded from demographic data of the patients and from the results of each&#xD;
      other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to detect the topographic relationship between mandibular third&#xD;
      molars' roots and covering lingual cortex, lingual cortex morphology and variation in number&#xD;
      of roots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This power analysis used the relation between the lingual plate of bone and third molars'&#xD;
      roots. Based upon Wang's results, the percentage of subjects with contact and perforation of&#xD;
      lingual cortical plate was 72.8% using Alpha (α) level of (5%), acceptable margin of error =&#xD;
      5%, the minimum estimated sample size was 304 mandibular third molar teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was performed using EPI Info 7.2.2.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Handling of quantitative variables in analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topographic relationship with the covering lingual cortex will be detected and categorically&#xD;
      classified according to Emes classification: Type A (non-contact), Type B (contact), and type&#xD;
      C (perforation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lingual cortex morphology will be detected and categorically classified according to&#xD;
      modified Chan &amp; Momin classification: (Type U, undercut on the lingual side; Type P, parallel&#xD;
      to the buccal plate; Type S, slanted with bucco-lingual width reduced on the lingual side,&#xD;
      and Type R, round shape on the lingual side).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of mandibular third molar roots will be numerically counted to estimate the&#xD;
      variations in the Egyptian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Statistical methods. Data will be statistically analyzed using IBM SPSS advanced statistics&#xD;
      (Statistical Package for Social Sciences), version 23.0, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. Numerical data&#xD;
      will be described as mean and standard deviation or median and range. Categorical data will&#xD;
      be described as numbers and percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A p-value less than or equal to 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All tests&#xD;
      will be two-tailed.&#xD;
