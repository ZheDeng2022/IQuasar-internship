    <textblock>
      This study aims to control risk factors of non communicable diseases by life style and care&#xD;
      intervention based on internet technology, looking forward to improve cardiovascular and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular complications, diabetes and all-cause death.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      and malignant tumors are the main chronic diseases, which have been the most important cause&#xD;
      of human death, consuming most health resources. In China, patients with cardiovascular and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular diseases account for more than 40% of all causes of death. After half a&#xD;
      century of research, we have a thorough understanding of risk factors of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, including genetics, aging, ethnicity, physical activity decreases, unbalanced&#xD;
      nutrition and calorie intake, smoking, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and glucose&#xD;
      abnormalities, etc. Many factors can be corrected through health education, indicating that&#xD;
      the occurrence of chronic diseases can be prevented through lifestyle changes and the control&#xD;
      of risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project collects risk factors of cardiovascular disease and establishes a real and&#xD;
      reliable health database by conducting a cross-sectional survey of chronic diseases among&#xD;
      residents of Tian Tong Yuan District (there are hundreds of thousands of people).On this&#xD;
      basis, community health management network was established with internet technology.&#xD;
      Meanwhile, prospective, open, community randomized and controlled lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      studies were carried out. Intervention was conducted on risk factors of cardiovascular and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular diseases, such as smoking, obesity, hypertension, lipid metabolism disorder,&#xD;
      and hyperglycemia. For patients with chronic diseases, lifestyle intervention and health&#xD;
      education should be carried out to improve the diagnosis rate and control rate. The project&#xD;
      focuses on the impact of lifestyle interventions and health education on risk factor control,&#xD;
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications, diabetes and all-cause death.&#xD;
