    <measure>Change in quality of life as measured by the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR).</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Baseline, Days 14, 28, 56, 112 and 196.</time_frame>
    <description>Scores are measured on a 100 point scale (0-100) with the lower score (0) indicating no difficulty and the higher score indicating very difficult (100).&#xD;
Extreme Fibromyalgia (FM): 75-100, Severe FM: 60-74, Moderate FM: 43-59, Mild FM: 0-42</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety as measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7).</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Baseline, Days 14, 28, 56, 112 and 196.</time_frame>
    <description>Seven items are rated from 0 - 3 with a lower score indicating less anxiety and a higher score indicated more anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8).</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Baseline, Days 14, 28, 56, 112 and 196.</time_frame>
    <description>Eight items are rated from 0 - 3 with a lower score indicating less depression and a higher score indicated more depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Baseline, Days 14, 28, 56, 112 and 196.</time_frame>
    <description>Seven component scores are derived from 0 -3. A lower score indicates better sleep quality and a higher score worse sleep quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Baseline, Days 14, 28, 56, 112 and 196.</time_frame>
    <description>Scores are measured on a 10 point scale with the lower score indicating less interference due to pain and the higher score indicating complete interference.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain as measured by the Pain Visual Analog Scale (P-VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily (Day 0 - 196)</time_frame>
    <description>Scores are measured on a 100mm VAS. The lower number indicates less pain and the higher number more pain.</description>

    <description>The Sana Device is an externally worn mask that physically contacts the skin of the face. The Sana Device delivers Audio Visual Stimulation (AVS) in the form of coordinated pulses of light (through closed eyelids) and sound at various frequencies.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The sham treatment device is designed to copy the look and feel of the Sana therapy to a degree that it would be indistinguishable from the true treatment. The sham treatment delivers a series of Audio-Visual Stimulation (AVS) in the form of pulses of light (through closed eyelids) and sound, but that offer no therapeutic effect.</description>
