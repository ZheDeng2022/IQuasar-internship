  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate the initial feasibility and determine preliminary impact on clinical outcomes&#xD;
      of the iCanCope-NF program in a pilot RCT. If successful this pilot study will support&#xD;
      conducting a larger randomized control trial (RCT). The primary research question is what is&#xD;
      the feasibility of the iCanCope-NF program? The investigators define feasibility as (1) rates&#xD;
      of accrual and dropout, daily log-ins, engagement, and outcome measures completed and (2)&#xD;
      perceptions regarding intervention acceptability and satisfaction; and what are the levels of&#xD;
      engagement. log-ins, with the intervention? The secondary questions are: (1) how does the&#xD;
      iCanCope-NF program compare with the control condition in differences of pain and&#xD;
      pain-related activity limitations, sleep functioning, emotional functioning (depression,&#xD;
      anxiety), opioid usage, pain catastrophizing, self-efficacy, respondent burden (i.e. Physical&#xD;
      Functioning, R, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health), and&#xD;
      psychological flexibility immediately post-treatment (T2), (2) does the iCanCope-NF + CM&#xD;
      increase the engagement of the iCanCope-NF program as compared to iCanCope-NF without CM, and&#xD;
      do their corresponding levels of pain and pain-related activity decrease with CM?, and (3) do&#xD;
      individuals with NF1 utilize the MBAA to help reduce pain symptoms? The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that by customizing and including MBAA to the program for adults with NF1, that&#xD;
      individuals who engage regularly as seen through Analytics Platform for Evaluating Effective&#xD;
      Engagement (APEEE) application, will acquire new sets of skills to facilitate pain&#xD;
      management, while pain as reported with the Brief Pain Inventory will decrease.&#xD;

    <description>A comparison within change of generalized anxiety measured by the generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7). After reading each statement, one of four choices are provided and respondents can select one response (1=not at all sure, 2=several days, 3=over half days, 4=nearly every day). Each column is then added, and a total score is obtained, with scores falling into four levels of anxiety, including minimal (1-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), and severe (15-21)</description>

The acceptance of chronic pain is thought to reduce unsuccessful attempts to avoid or control pain and thus focus on engaging in valued activities and pursuing meaningful goals will be measured across all groups. The items on the CPAQ are rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (never true) to 6 (always true). To score the CPAQ, add the items for Activity engagement and Pain willingness to obtain a score for each factor. To obtain the total score, add the scores for each factor together. Higher scores indicate higher levels of acceptance</description>

    <description>Psychological Inflexibility in Pain Scale (PIPS) 16-item scale used to assess psychological inflexibility (i.e. avoidance, acceptance, fusion, values orientation, dirty discomfort) in people with chronic pain will be measured across all groups. Respondents are asked to rate items on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (never true) to 7 (always true). Higher scores indicate greater levels of psychological inflexibility.</description>

Participants rated the items on a five-point Likert scale (1 = never or very rarely true to 5 = very often or always true), each facet score ranges from 8 to 40, except for the non-reactive facet which ranges from 7 to 35.</description>

    <description>In this group, individuals will receive the iCanCope-NF program. The intervention will be delivered on a restricted password-protected mobile application. Participants will be encouraged to log onto the pain diary app (via automated alerts) once per day over the 8-week period to complete pain diary entries and develop and track their goals related to their pain, physical, social activities, sleep, as well as work through content based on their goals.</description>

Points will be accrued through access to new sections, daily check-ins, and engagement of the mobile application. Based on research, the total amount of money that can be earned by the patient over the course of the two months is 50 dollars USD.</description>

    <description>The control group is designed to assess for potential effects on outcomes of time, attention, during the study. In addition to usual care, participants will be required to complete baseline and follow-up assessments similar to that of the intervention groups. They will be given that patient education, through preapproved flyers and information found from national websites regarding pain management, but no self-management strategies or opportunities for social support. They will not have access to the mobile application during the course of experiment; however, the control group will be offered the full iCanCope-NF program following the trial (T2) for a period of 2 months after the study is over.</description>
