      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and cost-utility of the&#xD;
      Trapezium-Metacarpal (TMC) prosthesis against Suspensionplasty with Abductor Pollicis Longus&#xD;
      (APL) for the treatment of patients with first carpometacarpal (CMC) joint osteoarthritis&#xD;
      (OA). Patients will be allocated to one of these two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Maïa® TMC prosthesis (Groupe Lépine TM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. APL Supensionplasty&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect patient data using the questionnaires administeredat baseline and after the&#xD;
      treatment. The primary outcome will be pain measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will include health-related quality of life measured by EuroQuol 5D&#xD;
      questionnaire,&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First Carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis (CMC-OA) is a common problem, being the second&#xD;
      location of degenerative osteoarthritis in the hand. The pain, weakness, and swelling cause&#xD;
      considerable interference in the activities of daily living, especially in activities that&#xD;
      involve repetitive fist-clamp movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conservative treatment available (pain killers, physiotherapy and splints) do not always&#xD;
      manage to achieve complete remission of the symptoms or prevent its recurrence. There are&#xD;
      several surgical techniques to treat osteoarthritis of the first CMC. The most common&#xD;
      surgical treatments used are prosthetic joint replacement and trapeziectomy. The later can be&#xD;
      done as an isolated procedure or associated with tendon interposition, ligament&#xD;
      reconstruction or both. The preference for indication for one treatment or another is based&#xD;
      on personal experience rather than on the available studies, which are highly heterogeneous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the direct and indirect costs (those associated with productivity losses as a&#xD;
      result of sick leave from the perspective of society) associated with the use of a CMC&#xD;
      prosthesis remain unknown, with the shorter recovery time being one of the reasons for its&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to determine whether the trapeziometacarpal prosthesis is&#xD;
      more effective, safe and cost-effective than suspension suspensionplasty. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the functional outcome and estimate the indirect costs and the&#xD;
      incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility (efficiency) ratios of the trapeziometacarpal&#xD;
      prosthesis with respect to suspensionplasty as a treatment for osteoarthritis of the basal&#xD;
      thumb joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be measured using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include Quick-DASH and health-related quality of life measured using the&#xD;
      European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D) and. In addition, we will collect&#xD;
      direct and indirect costs.&#xD;

    <description>The standard VAS diagram is a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 indicates No Pain (smiling face), and 10 indicates Worst possible, unbearable, excruciating pain (crying face).</description>

    <description>is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. It has been widely used in population health surveys, clinical studies, economic evaluation and in routine outcome measurement in the delivery of operational healthcare.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks after surgery, 6 weeks after surgery, 3 months after surgery, 6 months, 1 year after surgery, 2 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The short form QuickDASH questionnaire will be completed as a reflection of patient-reported specific upper extremity function. Absolute improvement in QuickDASH score will be compared within groups longitudinally and between groups at each time point. QuickDASH scores range from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability)</description>

    <measure>Change in pre-operative pinch and grip strength as measured by kilograms of pressure.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks after surgery, 6 weeks after surgery, 3 months after surgery, 6 months, 1 year after surgery, 2 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Power grip using a Jamar (Jackson, MO) dynamometer, followed by lateral (key) and pulp-to-pulp pinch, will be recorded (both in kilograms) with a pinch meter, taking the greater strength of three successive attempts at each position with a 15 second rest between each attempt. The dynamic position of the thumb metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint will be recorded with a small goniometer during lateral pinch testing (in degrees).</description>

    <description>To estimate the costs of both interventions from the provider perspective, direct medical costs will be calculated using activity-based cost analysis.&#xD;
To estimate them from the perspective of society, indirect costs will be added to the direct costs, which will be calculated using the following variables: age, sex, educational level, employment status, profession. It is considered a reasonable measure of labor productivity is the remuneration in the labor market (average earnings or salary).&#xD;
The utility measure to be used in the cost-utility analysis is the quality-adjusted life years (QALY) as the utility measure. The profits will be obtained through the EQ-5D-5L instrument in its Spanish version and through rates validated for Spain.</description>
