  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, phase II clinical trial conducted in&#xD;
      Canada. The purpose of the study is to determine the remission rate of acalabrutinib in&#xD;
      combination with R-CHOP in patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma prior to&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplantation. All patients will receive six cycles of R-CHOP&#xD;
      chemotherapy together with continuous acalabrutinib at the standard dose twice per day&#xD;
      orally. All patients will undergo response assessment at the end of six cycles of R-CHOP +&#xD;
      acalabrutinib with CT scan, PET/CT scan, and bone marrow biopsy. Responding patients will&#xD;
      proceed with stem cell mobilization, apheresis, and processing. Following ASCT, patients will&#xD;
      receive standard maintenance rituximab every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
