    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators are examining the neuronal processes of a mindfulness based&#xD;
      emotion regulation training for reducing depressive rumination. The research of depressive&#xD;
      rumination helps in the developement of new therapies for depressive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal of this project is to have a look at the coherences between stress, mindfulness&#xD;
      resources, depressive rumination and their neuronal correlates. Therefore the investigators&#xD;
      are collecting the data of 48 patients with a depressive diagnosis in a randomized&#xD;
      intervention-study with a treatment as usual (TAU) waiting-control-list versus an active&#xD;
      intervention group. An additional 48 healthy control subjects are planned to be measured.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized and (for gender and severity of depressive symptomatic) outbalanced design&#xD;
      the investigators are examining the neuronal processes of a mindfulness based emotion&#xD;
      regulation training (MBERT) for reducing depressive rumination in a cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore 48 patients with a depressive disorder get a MBERT that consists of one&#xD;
      psychoeducative session and 8 therapy sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For checking the efficacy of the MBERT each patient runs three times through the Trier Social&#xD;
      Stress Test (TSST). As the study design is a cross-over design, half of the patients get the&#xD;
      MBERT in block 1 (i.e. between the first and the second TSST) and half of the patients get&#xD;
      the MBERT in block 2 (i.e. between the second and the third TSST). In the block where they&#xD;
      don't receive the MBERT the patients don't get any treatment within the scope of the study&#xD;
      (waiting period), but any treatment as usual (TAU), including pharmacotherapy and&#xD;
      psychotherapy, can be continued and started at each point of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For analyzing the neuronal processes the investigators are measuring the cerebral oxygenation&#xD;
      using functional near-infrared-spectroscopy (fNIRS) during the TSSTs as well as during the 8&#xD;
      therapy sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using an ecological momentary assessment (EMA), the investigators additionally are collecting&#xD;
      data of the actual stress level, stressful events, rumination, equanimity, self-compassion,&#xD;
      mindfulness and sleep quality two times a day. Thus the investigators can (1) observe the&#xD;
      individual reaction to stress in the daily life, and (2) recheck if the patients are able to&#xD;
      transfer the learned strategies from the MBERT in their daily life. For those patients that&#xD;
      received the MBERT in the first block the investigators (3) additionally have data to&#xD;
      evaluate the sustainability (i.e. the lasting effectivity) of the MBERT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a control condition, 48 healthy subjects will get a single TSST session.&#xD;

Therefore items from different questionnaires (Self compassion scale (SCS), Ruminative Response Scale (RRS), Perseverative Cognitions Questionnaire (PCQ)) and self created items were taken. For self compassion, rumination and mindfulness mean scores can be calculated afterwards (self compassion: min: 0, max: 100; rumination &amp; mindfulness: min: 0, max: 5; for self compassion and mindfulness higher scores mean a better outcome, for rumination higher scores mean a worse outcome).</description>

    <description>In each of 8 sessions (allocated over 4 weeks) the patient brings an (actual) topic that induces rumination. After identifying the underlying affect, the patients are instructed (1) to concentrate on it, (2) to accept and tolerate it (considering the personal situation and experiences), (3) to give it a new interpretation so the patient can look at it with a more generous view, and (4) to dissociate from it, so the patient can perceive it as one of many affects and as one that hasn't the power to influence one's thoughts and actions that much (as it does through rumination). These steps are gradually instructed and trained throughout 20 trials (√† 40 seconds) in each session. After each trial there is room to talk about the trial, possible barriers and helpful strategies to overcome those. Between-sessions the patients are encouraged to train the strategies in their daily life and do some homework like a protocol of ruminative thoughts and meditation.&#xD;
