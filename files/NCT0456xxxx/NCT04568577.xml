  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will analyze the effects of an elastic taping application protocol in individuals&#xD;
      with chronic ankle instability. One group will perform a protocol with increased tape tension&#xD;
      for five weeks while the other group will receive the same tape without tension during the&#xD;
      same period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elastic taping is a method widely used in clinical practice for the treatment of ankle&#xD;
      instability and shows increasing interest in research to verify its effectiveness. The&#xD;
      literature presents several studies with short-term effects, largely in healthy individuals&#xD;
      and with several application techniques, with the incremental tensioning of the proposed tape&#xD;
      subjectively.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functionality</measure>
    <time_frame>The evaluation will occur at week 1 (baseline) and at the end of the protocol (week 6)</time_frame>
    <description>The functionality will be evaluated by the average of three executions of the side hop test and dynamic balance test (star excursion balance test modified). The side hop test consists of lateral jumps beyond the 30 cm mark on the ground in the shortest possible time (the shorter the time, the better the performance). The dynamic balance test consists of remaining in unipodal support and reaching as far as possible with the other member in the anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral directions. The greater the distance achieved improves the score. The calculation is performed to correct the measurements.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>The evaluation will occur at week 1 (baseline) and at the end of the protocol (week 6)</time_frame>
    <description>The balance will be evaluated by the force platform at baseline. The variables center of pressure, speed of displacement of the center of pressure in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions, frequency of displacement of the center of pressure in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions will be analyzed. The lower the score, the better the performance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported instability</measure>
    <time_frame>The evaluation will occur at week 1 (baseline) and at the end of the protocol (week 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported instability will be assessed by questionnaire. The Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool consists of 9 questions with a maximum score of 30 points. Ankle instability is considered to have a score less than or equal to 24. The lower the score, the worse the instability. The other questionnaire used will be Foot and Ankle Outcome Score, which has 42 questions divided into 5 domains. Each domain has a score of 100%. If the individual has &lt;75% in 3 domains, he is considered to have functional ankle instability. The lower the score, the worse the instability.</description>
