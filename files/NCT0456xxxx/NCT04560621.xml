  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Managed Problem Solving (MAPS) behavioral intervention is an EBP for behavior change in&#xD;
      people living with HIV (PLWH). The investigators propose that MAPS can be delivered by&#xD;
      trained Community Health Workers (CHWs). The use of CHWs to deliver MAPS is justified by&#xD;
      their ability to develop trusting relationships with their clients and the need for task&#xD;
      shifting in busy clinics. In order to also address retention in care, the investigators will&#xD;
      adapt MAPS to also focus on problem solving activities tailored toward retention in care (now&#xD;
      termed MAPS+). CHWs will be located in clinics to implement MAPS+ to improve viral&#xD;
      suppression and care retention in PLWH. Data-to-care allows for identification of people who&#xD;
      are lost to care and link these patients back to care. Currently, medication adherence and&#xD;
      retention in HIV care are not targeted in data-to-care so the investigators will build on&#xD;
      this approach to facilitate the identification of PLWH who are out of care and not virally&#xD;
      suppressed to offer them MAPS+. The set of implementation strategies include task-shifting&#xD;
      the delivery of MAPS+ to CHWs, providing the CHWs training and ongoing support, and&#xD;
      increasing communication between the CHWs and medical care team via standardized protocols.&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a hybrid type II effectiveness-implementation trial with a&#xD;
      stepped-wedge cluster randomized design in 12 clinics to test MAPS+ compared to usual care&#xD;
      using a set of implementation strategies that will best support implementation. Each clinic&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of three implementation start times. Baseline (usual care) data&#xD;
      will be collected from each clinic for 6 months, followed by MAPS+ and the package of&#xD;
      implementation strategies for 12 months, in three cohorts of 4 clinics each. Aim 1 will test&#xD;
      the effectiveness of MAPS+ on clinical effectiveness outcomes, including viral suppression&#xD;
      (primary) and retention (secondary). Aim 2 will examine the effect of the package of&#xD;
      implementation strategies on reach. Implementation cost will also be measured. Aim 3 will&#xD;
      apply a qualitative approach to understand processes, mechanisms, and sustainment of the&#xD;
      implementation approach. The results will guide future efforts to implement behavioral EBPs&#xD;
      across the HIV care continuum, consistent with the &quot;treat&quot; pillar of EHE, and move the&#xD;
      science of implementation services, consistent with NIH strategic priorities.&#xD;

    <description>MAPS is an individual-level, problem-solving intervention delivered in person and via telephone calls to HIV clinic patients. The intervention focuses on improving medication adherence through an iterative, five-step process which consists of 1) identifying barriers to adherence, 2) brainstorming to generate potential solutions, 3) decision-making and developing a plan of action, 4) implementing the plan, and 5) evaluating and modifying the plan as necessary. In-person sessions include education related to the treatment regimen and to common medication misperceptions; problem-solving to identify daily routines, cues, cognitive aids and social supports; screening to identify barriers related to depression, substance use, toxicity management and competing demands; and review of adherence data to determine where problems have occurred and to develop solutions.</description>
