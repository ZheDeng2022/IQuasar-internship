  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose the Standing Tall study, a prospective randomised study of strategy&#xD;
      to optimize community-based ART initiation in South Africa. Investigators will work closely&#xD;
      with community members to integrate community-based ART. One hundred participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled and followed for a total of up to 6 months. Those in the intervention arm will be&#xD;
      provided with the ST intervention which includes a behavioral component and access to ART.&#xD;
      The intervention will be linked to a clinic through a &quot;Nurse Initiated Management of ART.&quot;&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The premise for our study is based on three decades of HIV research that supports the need&#xD;
      for multi-component, multisystem interventions to promote testing, and adherence to treatment&#xD;
      and care for young people living with HIV. The proposed intervention, Standing Tall, is&#xD;
      informed and guided by Social Action Theory - a conceptual framework reflecting a holistic&#xD;
      understanding of health behavior and motivational factors that foster and maintain behavior&#xD;
      change. Standing Tall, a pilot randomized controlled trial, is designed to address&#xD;
      multi-factorial barriers using (1) a socio-behavioral group intervention; (2) social support;&#xD;
      (3) provision of immediate ART and refills. The primary outcome is ART initiation at three&#xD;
      months, and the secondary outcome is viral load suppression at six months. Other&#xD;
      tertiary/exploratory outcomes include behavioral outcomes and process evaluation of the&#xD;
      intervention itself, and the use of point-of-care diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administrative supplemental funding provides support for an additional objective of this&#xD;
      study: to understand how best to use point-of-care (POC) testing in clinical practice in&#xD;
      order to improve HIV care and treatment for South African young people. Understanding patient&#xD;
      perspectives and perceived barriers is critical to developing feasible, acceptable, and&#xD;
      effective protocols for implementing POC testing. The primary aim for achieving this&#xD;
      objective is to assess patient perspectives regarding POC testing through in-depth,&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews among study participants enrolled in Standing Tall's second aim.&#xD;

    <measure>ART Initiation</measure>
    <time_frame>Three Months</time_frame>
    <description>ART initiation will be assessed via a self-report measure of participants who will report whether they have or have not initiated ART.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>ART Initiation</measure>
    <time_frame>Three Months</time_frame>
    <description>ART initiation will also be assessed via a point-of-care diagnostic detecting Tenofovir concentrations in participants.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Viral Load Suppression</measure>
    <time_frame>Six Months</time_frame>
    <description>Viral suppression will be measured from plasma specimen collected at 6 months from enrollment. Persons missing plasma HIV RNA results for any reason (e.g. death) will be counted as not initiated. Additional records obtained through PHDC and NHLS will provide additional data (such as plasma HIV RNA concentration) that will be used for confirmation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Household Food Security</measure>
    <time_frame>Six Months</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess household food security via a self-report questionnaire. Participants will report how many times in the last 30 days they experienced anxiety and uncertainty about household food access and insufficient quality and quantity on a scale from rarely to more than 10 times.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mental Health</measure>
    <time_frame>Six Months</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess generalized anxiety disorder using the GAD-7 questionnaire and major depressive disorder using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Participants will self-report how many times in the last 2 weeks they experienced symptoms from not at all to nearly every day.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Substance Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Six Months</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess participants alcohol and drug use via the SAMISS (Substance Use Subsection - AUDIT) questionnaire. Participants will self-report how many times a month they partake in alcohol or drug use on a scale ranging from never to less than monthly, to daily. Participants may also refuse to answer questions.</description>
