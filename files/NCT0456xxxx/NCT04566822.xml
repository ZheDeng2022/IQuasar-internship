  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified insufficient sleep as a public&#xD;
      health epidemic, with more than 70 million US adults experiencing insomnia each year.&#xD;
      However, access to current evidence-based interventions for sleep disturbance (e.g.,&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Insomnia [CBT-I]) is limited due to the need for specialized&#xD;
      providers as well as monetary and logistical barriers that prevent many individuals from&#xD;
      attending in-person treatment sessions (e.g., scheduling, transportation, childcare). Novel&#xD;
      modes of delivery are needed to extend the benefits of these treatments to a wider range of&#xD;
      individuals in need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate Calm Sleep Coaching in adults with sleep disturbance&#xD;
      (score of greater than or equal to 8 on the Insomnia Severity Index) by 1) determining the&#xD;
      feasibility (i.e., acceptability, demand) of Calm Sleep Coaching and 2) determining the&#xD;
      preliminary effects of Calm Sleep Coaching on primary (sleep quality) and secondary outcomes&#xD;
      (i.e., symptoms of insomnia, mental health, well-being, resilience, and productivity).&#xD;
      Investigators also aim to explore coaches' experiences with implementation of Calm Sleep&#xD;
      Coaching using an investigator developed survey and assess the participants stage of change&#xD;
      (transtheoretical model) throughout the program. Investigators hypothesize that 1) Calm Sleep&#xD;
      Coaching will be feasible among individuals with sleep disturbance and 2) participating in&#xD;
      the Calm Sleep Coaching program is associated with improvements in primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes compared to the control group (with greater improvements observed among those&#xD;
      participating in higher touch coaching interventions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aim to recruit N=200 participants. Participants will be randomized into one of&#xD;
      four groups: 1) High-touch intervention (N=50; real-time video and chat messaging, coach&#xD;
      response via live videos), 2) medium-touch intervention (N=50; real-time video and&#xD;
      pre-recorded video and chat messaging with response from coach), 3) low-touch intervention&#xD;
      (N=50; chat messaging with response from coach), or 4) Sleep education control (N=50; no&#xD;
      coaching).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified insufficient sleep as a public&#xD;
      health epidemic, with more than 70 million US adults experiencing insomnia each year.&#xD;
      However, access to current evidence-based interventions for sleep disturbance (e.g.,&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Insomnia [CBT-I]) is limited due to the need for specialized&#xD;
      providers as well as monetary and logistical barriers that prevent many individuals from&#xD;
      attending in-person treatment sessions (e.g., scheduling, transportation, childcare). Novel&#xD;
      modes of delivery are needed to extend the benefits of these treatments to a wider range of&#xD;
      individuals in need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many individuals, digital intervention platforms may serve as an attractive alternative&#xD;
      to receiving treatment and health services that are otherwise difficult to access. The Calm&#xD;
      app is a consumer-based meditation smartphone app that is easy to use, inexpensive, and&#xD;
      widely accessible (currently over 3.1 million paying subscribers). Recent surveys (N=12,151;&#xD;
      N=11,210) indicate that between 76 and 89% of the Calm app subscribers were experiencing&#xD;
      sleep difficulties when they downloaded the app, and 63-76% downloaded the Calm app&#xD;
      specifically to improve their sleep. Given the Calm apps popularity and the need for&#xD;
      techniques to improve sleep, leveraging the Calm apps existing platform will allow for&#xD;
      efficient dissemination of a digital sleep intervention (i.e., Calm Sleep Coaching).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Calm app has developed a new 6-week online sleep-coaching school (Calm Sleep Coaching) to&#xD;
      improve the quality and quantity of sleep for individuals who complete the program. The&#xD;
      development of Calm Sleep Coaching was informed by evidence-based techniques (e.g., CBTi,&#xD;
      mindfulness practices, Self-Determination Theory, and Social Cognitive Theory). However, the&#xD;
      feasibility and effectiveness of Calm Sleep Coaching has not yet been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate Calm Sleep Coaching in adults with sleep&#xD;
      disturbance (score of greater than or equal to 8 on the Insomnia Severity Index) by 1)&#xD;
      determining the feasibility (i.e., acceptability, demand) of Calm Sleep Coaching and 2)&#xD;
      determining the preliminary effects of Calm Sleep Coaching on primary (sleep quality) and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes (i.e., symptoms of insomnia, mental health, well-being, resilience, and&#xD;
      productivity). Investigators also aim to explore coaches' experiences with implementation of&#xD;
      Calm Sleep Coaching using an investigator developed survey and assess the participants stage&#xD;
      of change (transtheoretical model) throughout the program. Investigators hypothesize that 1)&#xD;
      Calm Sleep Coaching will be feasible among individuals with sleep disturbance and 2)&#xD;
      participating in the Calm Sleep Coaching program is associated with improvements in primary&#xD;
      and secondary outcomes compared to the control group (with greater improvements observed&#xD;
      among those participating in higher touch coaching interventions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aim to recruit N=200 participants. Participants will be randomized into one of&#xD;
      four groups: 1) High-touch intervention (N=50; real-time video and chat messaging, coach&#xD;
      response via live videos), 2) medium-touch intervention (N=50; real-time video and&#xD;
      pre-recorded video and chat messaging with response from coach), 3) low-touch intervention&#xD;
      (N=50; chat messaging with response from coach), or 4) Sleep education control (N=50; no&#xD;
      coaching).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Examine the feasibility (acceptability, demand) of the Calm Sleep Coaching six-week&#xD;
      program in adults with sleep disturbance (N=200).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability is defined as participant satisfaction with content including perceived&#xD;
      appropriateness and usefulness of Calm Sleep Coaching for improving sleep. Acceptability will&#xD;
      be measured using an investigator developed satisfaction survey. H1.1: At least 70% of&#xD;
      participants will report that overall, they were satisfied with Calm Sleep Coaching. H1.2: At&#xD;
      least 70% of participants will perceive the components of Calm Sleep Coaching to be&#xD;
      appropriate and useful for reducing or managing sleep disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demand is defined as the number of sessions attended with the sleep coaches and compliance&#xD;
      with sleep diaries. H1.3: At least 70% of participants will attend 4/6 of Calm Sleep Coaching&#xD;
      sessions and (2) at least 70% will complete 70% of daily sleep diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Test the preliminary effects of the Calm Sleep Coaching program on primary (sleep&#xD;
      quality) and secondary outcomes (i.e., symptoms of insomnia, mental health, well-being,&#xD;
      resilience, and productivity). Investigators will test associations between participation in&#xD;
      Calm Sleep Coaching and changes in sleep disturbance (primary outcome) and symptoms related&#xD;
      to sleep disturbance (secondary outcomes; i.e., stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms,&#xD;
      well-being, resilience and productivity) compared to those in a sleep education control&#xD;
      group. H2.1: Participating in 6 weeks of Calm Sleep Coaching will be associated with&#xD;
      reductions in sleep disturbance. H2.2: Participating in 6 weeks of Calm Sleep Coaching will&#xD;
      be associated with improvement in symptoms related to sleep disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 (exploratory): Assess coaches experiences with implementation of Calm Sleep Coaching&#xD;
      via investigator developed survey. Questions asked will assess general experiences,&#xD;
      challenges, usability, content, and recommendations for change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4 (exploratory): Assess the participants stage of change (transtheoretical model)&#xD;
      throughout the program.&#xD;
