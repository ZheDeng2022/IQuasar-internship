  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to pilot test two types of pre-visit planning, where&#xD;
      clinical staff reviews charts and talks to patients before their doctors appointments, to&#xD;
      reduce the burden of diabetes care on the patient without increasing the visit workload&#xD;
      during busy primary care clinics.&#xD;
