  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effect of a mobile application system using the Patient&#xD;
      Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE)&#xD;
      to improve patients' participation in symptom management during cancer treatment. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that patients who use a mobile application using the PRO-CTCAE will more likely&#xD;
      to recognize symptoms due to cancer treatment and report them better to their clinicians than&#xD;
      patients who do not use the mobile application.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a mobile application system&#xD;
      using the Patient Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
      Events (PRO-CTCAE) to improve patients' participation in symptom management during cancer&#xD;
      treatment. Breast, lung, head and neck, esophagus, and gynecologic cancer patients who will&#xD;
      begin new lines of chemotherapy or radiation therapy will be randomly assigned into the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups (2:1 ratio). The intervention group will have the mobile&#xD;
      application installed on their smart phones which they could record symptoms and adverse&#xD;
      events due to cancer treatments using the pre-specified PRO-CTCAE questions for different&#xD;
      types of cancer. The control group will have usual care. Primary endpoint is patients'&#xD;
      participation/engagement of reporting symptoms and it will be evaluated at 8 weeks after the&#xD;
      intervention using a questionnaire developed by the research team. Secondary end points are&#xD;
      unexpected hospital visits during treatment during 8 weeks after the beginning of the&#xD;
      treatment and quality of life at 8 weeks after the intervention.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will be the use of a mobile application for recording symptoms during cancer treatments. Patients in the intervention group will have the mobile application (e-PRO) installed on their smart phones on the first day of cancer treatment (chemotherapy or radiation therapy) and patients will be asked to use the application for 8 weeks. Every week, the application will ask patients to report symptoms they experienced during past 7 days using the pre-specified PRO-CTCAE questions for different types of cancer. Patients also can memo and save photos related symptoms using the application and patients can monitor the progression of the symptoms over time.</description>
