  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kimmerle's anomaly is a bony bridge over the posterior arch of the first cervical vertebra&#xD;
      that forms a bony ring. The vertebral artery passes through the opening. This bone bridge&#xD;
      could theoretically be an extravasal compression of the artery and disrupt the normal blood&#xD;
      flow to the brain. Evaluating the data of X-ray methods, determine the frequency of&#xD;
      occurrence and types of Kimmerle anomaly.&#xD;

      It is planned to conduct an examination of 30 patients on the basis of the Department of&#xD;
      Radiation Diagnostics and Therapy of the Samarkand State Medical Institute. Patients of all&#xD;
      ages will be examined, directed by doctors for computed tomography of the brain with the&#xD;
      capture of the upper cervical spine and the cervical spine. with complaints of headache,&#xD;
      dizziness, pain in the cervical region Among those who have passed the study, it is necessary&#xD;
      to identify patients with Kimmerle's anomaly and determine the age at which it often occurs,&#xD;
      whether it is a congenital pathology or the result of degenerative-dystrophic changes. It is&#xD;
      also planned to calculate the frequency of occurrence among the population, the type of this&#xD;
      pathology (complete and incomplete bone bridge, right-sided and left-sided location), the&#xD;
      size of the hole formed. The condition of the posterior parts of the brain will be assessed&#xD;
      in the presence of Kimmerle's anomaly on a CT scan.&#xD;
