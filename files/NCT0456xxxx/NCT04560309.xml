  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease has the highest mortality rate worldwide and coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      grafting (CABG) is the most common cardiac surgery performed in patients with coronary artery&#xD;
      disease to revascularize the heart. Despite of improvement in operation techniques,&#xD;
      cardioplegia, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), myocardial injury related to on-pump CABG is&#xD;
      still prominent. In patient with low ejection fraction undergone on-pump CABG, myocardial&#xD;
      injury is related to worse outcome and prognosis during peri-operative and post-operative&#xD;
      period. On-pump CABG patients with low ejection fraction has increased (up to four times&#xD;
      higher) post-operative in hospital mortality rate compared to patient with normal ejection&#xD;
      fraction. Administration of intravenous glutamine had been documented in reducing myocardial&#xD;
      damage during cardiac surgery and previous studies indicated that glutamine can protect&#xD;
      against myocardial injury by various mechanism during ischemia and reperfusion. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study to determine whether intravenous glutamine could prevent the decline of plasma&#xD;
      glutamine level, reduce myocardial damage, improve hemodynamic profile, and reduce morbidity&#xD;
      of on-pump CABG in patients with low ejection fraction.&#xD;

      The study was a double-blind randomized controlled trial to assess the role of glutamine as a&#xD;
      myocardial protection during coronary artery bypass grafting under cardiopulmonary bypass in&#xD;
      patients with left ventricle ejection fraction of 31-50%. This study was approved by&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board of National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita and informed&#xD;
      consent was obtained before randomization for patient eligible for this study. Allocation of&#xD;
      participant to the treatment group was done by block randomization by staff who was not&#xD;
      involved in the study. The intervention drug was prepared by pharmacist who also was not&#xD;
      involved in the study. Glutamine solution was supplied as L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide&#xD;
      (Dipeptiven, 200 mg/mL, Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany) and was prepared to contain&#xD;
      0.5gr/kgbw glutamine diluted in NaCl 0.9% to a final volume of 500 mL. Placebo was supplied&#xD;
      as 500 ml of NaCl 0.9%, prepared in similar fashion and packaging as glutamine solution.&#xD;
      Principal investigator, care provider, outcome assessor, and participant were blinded to the&#xD;
      assigned group until after the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline participant characteristics were collected before the intervention included age,&#xD;
      sex, body weight, body height, body mass index, and documented pre-operative left ventricle&#xD;
      ejection fraction. Coronary artery bypass grafting and cardiopulmonary bypass was done in&#xD;
      concordance to standard operating procedure in National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita,&#xD;
      followed by transit time flow meter measurement to ensure quality of the graft. Modifying&#xD;
      factor of the study, the investigators measured duration of surgery, duration of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass, and duration of aortic cross clamp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study was plasma troponin I level. The investigators anticipated&#xD;
      plasma troponin I level difference of 20% with standard deviation of 0.04 ng/mL, and for&#xD;
      statistical power of 80% and level of significance of 0.05, the required sample size was 24.5&#xD;
      participants per group. As anticipation for participant drop out, the investigators planned&#xD;
      to recruit a total of 60 participants.&#xD;
