  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial that evaluates the efficacy of a network&#xD;
      intervention to promote regular HIV testing and prevention (risk reduction and PrEP awareness&#xD;
      and referrals) among friendship networks of Latino men who have sex with men and transwomen&#xD;
      (LMSMT) in three mid sized Midwestern cities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To benefit from early HIV diagnosis, the CDC suggests that groups at higher HIV risk get&#xD;
      tested regularly. The study will evaluate the efficacy of an intervention to promote regular&#xD;
      HIV testing and prevention (risk reduction and PrEP awareness and referrals) among friendship&#xD;
      networks of Latino men who have sex with men and transwomen (LMSMT) in three midsized&#xD;
      Midwestern cities. The intervention uses the relationships that permeate networks of LMSMT by&#xD;
      training well-positioned members to encourage a collective response to the epidemic and to&#xD;
      disseminate HIV testing and prevention messages and resources within the network. Thus, we&#xD;
      will (a) recruit 36 friendship networks of LMSMT in Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Indianapolis (N&#xD;
      â‰ˆ 432); (b) test them for HIV and recommend that they test regularly; (c) invite key members&#xD;
      of 18 randomly selected networks to a 4-session training to promote regular HIV testing and&#xD;
      prevention in their networks; (d) conduct chart reviews to verify regular testing and PrEP&#xD;
      visits and assess regular testing, PrEP visits, and risk behavior and mediators at 6, 12 and&#xD;
      18-month follow up.&#xD;
