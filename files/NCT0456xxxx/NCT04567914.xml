      We aimed in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the ultrasonographic measurements of the abdominal muscles thickness symmetry&#xD;
           in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and adolescent healthy&#xD;
           individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the effect of measured thickness and symmetry on pulmonary function test.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This cross-sectional,case-control clinical study included 40 patients diagnosed with AIS and&#xD;
      40 age and gender -matched healthy individuals. AIS group was evaluated for localization of&#xD;
      curvature and degree of curvature. Ultrasonographic measurements and were performed of&#xD;
      bilaterally abdominal muscle thickness in both groups. Spirometry evaluation was performed in&#xD;
      both groups. Intragroup and intergroup data were compared.&#xD;
