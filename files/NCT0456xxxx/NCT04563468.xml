      Treatment options for unilateral diaphragm paralysis are limited. Diaphragmatic plication via&#xD;
      mini thoracotomy is sometimes considered in the University Hospital Leuven if severe symptoms&#xD;
      persist for longer than 12 months after initial diagnosis. Preliminary data indicate that&#xD;
      daily inspiratory muscle strength and endurance training can lead to increased&#xD;
      nondiaphragmatic inspiratory muscle recruitment and help those with symptoms from&#xD;
      diaphragmatic paralysis. Randomized controlled trials comparing intervention groups with&#xD;
      improvements achieved by natural recovery in the first months after diagnosis are however so&#xD;
      far lacking. The objective of the current study is therefore to investigate the effects of&#xD;
      daily inspiratory muscle training in the first 6 months following diagnosis of unilateral&#xD;
      diaphragmatic paralysis. The investigators hypothesize that respiratory muscle training in&#xD;
      symptomatic patients with UDP (in comparison with a control group) will reduce symptoms of&#xD;
      exertional dyspnea (primary outcome) and will improve respiratory muscle function (at rest&#xD;
      and during exercise) and pulmonary function (sitting and supine).&#xD;

      1. RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND Diaphragmatic paralysis is an uncommon, yet underdiagnosed cause&#xD;
      of dyspnea. Although the diaphragm performs most of the work, normal ventilation also&#xD;
      requires the simultaneous contraction of other respiratory muscles (ie, scalene, parasternal&#xD;
      portion of the internal and external intercostal muscles, sternocleidomastoid, trapezius). An&#xD;
      increased effort in the struggle to breathe may fatigue the accessory muscles and lead to&#xD;
      ventilatory failure. It is thus far not clear whether specific training of the respiratory&#xD;
      muscle can improve or restore diaphragm function or accessory respiratory muscle function in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the etiology of the diaphragmatic paralysis, the prognosis of unilateral disease&#xD;
      usually is good. Patients with phrenic injuries may recover fully or partially. At times,&#xD;
      patients may also spontaneously recover from idiopathic disease. Patients who do not recover&#xD;
      from unilateral diaphragmatic dysfunction generally lead relatively normal lives. Many&#xD;
      patients however keep reporting symptoms of dyspnea that interfere with performance of daily&#xD;
      activities. In this group, dyspnea typically develops with exertion, leading to increased&#xD;
      ventilatory demands. Dyspnea can also be elicited by changes in posture (e.g. lying supine,&#xD;
      bending forward). Depending on the activity profile of the subjects this might have an impact&#xD;
      on quality of life. The investigators will therefore evaluate symptoms and recruitment of&#xD;
      respiratory muscles of these patients during exertion (i.e. while performing an exercise test&#xD;
      on a cycle ergometer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The morbidity of the unilateral paralysis is mainly based on the underlying pulmonary&#xD;
      functional status and the etiology of the paralysis. Most of the patients that are referred&#xD;
      to the University Hospital Leuven report symptoms of dyspnea during exertion or with changes&#xD;
      in posture. Diaphragmatic paralysis is more likely to affect the left hemidiaphragm.&#xD;
      Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is characterized by abnormalities of pulmonary and&#xD;
      respiratory muscle function. Patients develop restrictive ventilatory impairment, and the&#xD;
      vital capacity and total lung capacity frequently are below 70% of the predicted normal&#xD;
      values. Lung capacity is reduced further when the patient assumes the supine position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to bilateral disease, physicians can usually diagnose unilateral paralysis with&#xD;
      only radiographic studies. Because accessory muscle contraction may create the appearance of&#xD;
      diaphragmatic movement, fluoroscopy studies may be misleading the physician when diagnosing&#xD;
      bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. In fluoroscopic sniff testing, paradoxical elevation of&#xD;
      the paralyzed diaphragm is observed with inspiration and confirms diaphragmatic paralysis.&#xD;
      However, the sniff test is not very specific; 6% of normal persons exhibit paradoxical motion&#xD;
      on fluoroscopy. Computerized tomography may be indicated in certain patients to evaluate for&#xD;
      potential causes of diaphragmatic paralysis that are due to mediastinal pathology and&#xD;
      malignancy. MRI may be indicated in certain patients to determine the presence of pathologic&#xD;
      conditions involving the spinal column or nerve roots that are causing diaphragmatic&#xD;
      paralysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      M-mode ultrasonography is a relatively simple and accurate test for diagnosing paralysis of&#xD;
      the diaphragm in the adult population and it can be performed at the bedside. The paralyzed&#xD;
      side shows no active caudal movement of the diaphragm with inspiration and abnormal&#xD;
      paradoxical movement (ie, cranial movement on inspiration), particularly with the sniff test.&#xD;
      B-mode ultrasonography of diaphragm thickness in the zone of apposition of the diaphragm to&#xD;
      the rib cage can also provide a sensitive and specific noninvasive assessment of&#xD;
      diaphragmatic paralysis. Less than 20% thickening of the diaphragm muscle during inspiration&#xD;
      is diagnostic of diaphragmatic paralysis. Ultrasonography can also be used to serially&#xD;
      monitor patients with diaphragmatic paralysis for recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phrenic nerve conduction studies can be carried out with placement of an oesophageal&#xD;
      electrode to record diaphragmatic contractions and stimulation of the nerve in the neck&#xD;
      either with surface stimulation or with a monopolar needle electrode at the level of the&#xD;
      cricoid cartilage. Alternatively diaphragmatic electromyography may be carried out. The two&#xD;
      tests are complementary. Electromyography may reveal a neuropathic versus myopathic pattern,&#xD;
      depending on the etiology. This can be accomplished by stimulation of the phrenic nerve at&#xD;
      the neck. Phrenic nerve stimulation can be done with electrical (surface or needle&#xD;
      electrodes) and magnetic stimulation. Operator expertise is an important factor in testing.&#xD;
      Technical issues with electromyography include proper electrode placement to avoid&#xD;
      &quot;cross-talk&quot; from adjacent muscles and variable results due to variable subcutaneous fat&#xD;
      among individuals. Using intraesophageal EMG electrodes is an alternative technique to avoid&#xD;
      these issues. A method of unilateral magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerve with&#xD;
      concurrent assessment of diaphragm EMG and transdiaphragmatic pressures has also been&#xD;
      described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring the vital capacity in the upright and supine positions is the most important part&#xD;
      of the pulmonary function test. Diaphragmatic paralysis reduces the measured compliance of&#xD;
      the lungs and a restrictive pattern can develop. Normally, vital capacity in recumbency&#xD;
      decreases by 10%. In contrast, patients with unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis show a 15-30%&#xD;
      decrease in vital capacity in supine position. This decrease is from cephalad displacement of&#xD;
      abdominal contents.Pulmonary function test results, however, are not always consistent and do&#xD;
      not always correlate with the severity of dyspnea from diaphragmatic paralysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with diaphragmatic dysfunction and paralysis have a decrease in maximal inspiratory&#xD;
      pressures (Pi,max). These patients cannot generate high negative inspiratory pressures.&#xD;
      Therefore, the Pi,max in these patients is often reduced relative to normal values (Pi,max&#xD;
      &lt;70% predicted). Important to note is that decreased maximal pressures are the hallmark of&#xD;
      diaphragmatic paralysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transdiaphragmatic pressure is the criterion standard for diagnosis. Normal&#xD;
      transdiaphragmatic pressure is approximately 148 cm water in men and 122 cm water in women.&#xD;
      Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is associated with a maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure&#xD;
      of greater than 70 cm water, and thus does not significantly effect transdiaphragmatic&#xD;
      pressure generation during normal ventilatory behaviors, but can compromise higher-force,&#xD;
      nonventilatory, behaviors like coughing or sneezing and also exercise breathing. Twitch&#xD;
      transdiaphragmatic pressures after bilateral magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation are&#xD;
      frequently used as a non-volitional assessment to confirm the presence of diaphragm weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The functional limitations in individuals with respiratory disorders are not exclusively&#xD;
      related to dyspnea. For example, balance impairments and resulting risk of falling are&#xD;
      increasingly recognized issues in patients with COPD. Regarding the fact that postural&#xD;
      balance is especially impaired in COPD patients with inspiratory muscle weakness, it can be&#xD;
      hypothesized that diaphragm dysfunction plays an important role in the observed balance&#xD;
      impairments. This is supported by the fact that the diaphragm is not only the principal&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle, but also plays an important role in stabilizing the trunk during balance&#xD;
      tasks. However, it remains unknown whether patients with diaphragm paresis show balance&#xD;
      impairments, and whether these can be attributed to a dysfunction of the diaphragm.&#xD;
      Furthermore, Kaufman et al. who followed up 180 patients with diaphragmatic paralysis,&#xD;
      suggested that also low back pain might be associated with this disorder due to the fact that&#xD;
      the postural function of the diaphragm is often disturbed in patients with low back pain.&#xD;
      Also, individuals with low back pain show an increased diaphragm fatigability. However,&#xD;
      neither the relation between diaphragmatic paralysis and postural control, neither between&#xD;
      diaphragmatic paralysis and low back pain has been investigated yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options for UDP are limited. Diaphragmatic plication via mini thoracotomy is&#xD;
      sometimes considered in the University Hospital Leuven if severe symptoms persist for longer&#xD;
      than 12 months after initial diagnosis. Preliminary data indicate that daily inspiratory&#xD;
      muscle strength and endurance training can lead to increased nondiaphragmatic inspiratory&#xD;
      muscle recruitment and help those with symptoms from diaphragmatic paralysis. Randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials comparing intervention groups with improvements achieved by natural&#xD;
      recovery in the first months after diagnosis are however so far lacking. In addition there is&#xD;
      a lack of comparable data between healthy subjects and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the current study is therefore to investigate the effects of daily&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle training in the first 6 months following diagnosis of unilateral&#xD;
      diaphragmatic paralysis. A second objective is to compare (changes in) respiratory muscle&#xD;
      function and activation patterns between healthy control subjects and patients. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that respiratory muscle training in symptomatic patients with UDP&#xD;
      (in comparison with a control group) will reduce symptoms of exertional dyspnea (primary&#xD;
      outcome) and will improve respiratory muscle function (at rest and during exercise) and&#xD;
      pulmonary function (sitting and supine). Secondly, we hypothesize that the (changes in)&#xD;
      recruiting patterns of diaphragmatic and non-diaphragmatic muscles will differ between&#xD;
      healthy control subjects and patients both at baseline and in response to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate effects of IMT on intensity and quality of dyspnea perception in symptomatic&#xD;
           patients with unilateral diaphragm paralysis during exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify and distinguish mechanisms responsible for dyspnea reduction after the&#xD;
           intervention by exploring inter-relationships between the post-intervention change in&#xD;
           dyspnea and changes in relevant measures of respiratory muscle function at rest and&#xD;
           during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare changes in respiratory muscle recruitment patterns and respiratory neural&#xD;
           drive to the diaphragm, as well as scalene, sternocleidomastoid and parasternal&#xD;
           intercostal muscles in response to 6 months of inspiratory muscle strength- or endurance&#xD;
           training during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare differences in (changes in) respiratory muscle recruitment patterns and&#xD;
           respiratory neural drive to the diaphragm, as well as scalene, sternocleidomastoid and&#xD;
           parasternal intercostal muscles, and postural control between healthy controls and&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
