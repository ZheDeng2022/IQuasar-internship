  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) has a high incidence of mortality and significant&#xD;
      morbidity, with mortality exceeding 30% in the first two days.The initial injury is related&#xD;
      to increasing intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, and neuronal injuries associated with&#xD;
      the release of iron. Iron has been shown to increase the incidence of cerebral edema,&#xD;
      ischemia, and formation of hydrocephalus. Deferoxamine mesylate (DFO), a hydrophilic&#xD;
      chelator, creates a stable complex with free iron thus preventing the formation of iron&#xD;
      related free radicals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of clinical deferoxamine for the treatment&#xD;
      of aSAH for patients that are admitted to the hospital at the University of Michigan or&#xD;
      Peking University Health Science Center. Eligible participants will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 2 doses of Deferoxamine or placebo (saline). Information regarding the&#xD;
      patients will be collected and followed for up to 6 months post discharge.&#xD;

    <masking_description>All patients and investigators who will be directly involved in the care of these patients or in data analysis will be blinded to randomization status.This trial uses a Bayesian adaptive randomization protocol, where there are three groups that patients will be randomized into: placebo, DFO 32 mg/kg and DFO 48 mg/kg. The first 50 patients will be randomized evenly into each of these groups. The randomization ratio will be adjusted based on the design report after 50 subjects and then every 10 patients.</masking_description>

    <measure>Utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale (UW-mRS) at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months (after hospital discharge)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall a Bayesian, longitudinal model will be used, this will be adjusted for baseline expected 6 month mRS using the FRESH score. At baseline, the expected 6 month UW-mRS (based on prognostic variables such as age and Hunt Hess) will be entered as the first value for the patient. Therefore, patients with greater severity at baseline, who achieve excellent outcomes will contribute a larger treatment effect. Similarly, patients with greater severity who have disability, but perform better than expected can still contribute useful information.</description>

    <description>Montreal cognitive assessment is a rapid sensitive screening tool for assessment of impaired cognitive function. The main domains of MoCA scale include attention, executive functions, memory, language, attention, naming, orientation, and visual-spatial ability. The total score is 30 points. A score of 25 points or less indicated impaired cognitive function. For patients with less than 12 years of education, one point was added to the total score.</description>
