  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this online research study is to determine whether or not a gradual caffeine&#xD;
      reduction program developed at Johns Hopkins can help people reduce the caffeine use. The&#xD;
      investigators will provide materials to help guide caffeine reduction and ask questions to&#xD;
      track caffeine use over several weeks. The investigators will also assess how reducing&#xD;
      caffeine may benefit common caffeine-related problems such as anxiety, sleep disturbances,&#xD;
      and gastrointestinal distress. The study will also determine whether or not people like&#xD;
      participating in this caffeine reduction program in an online format.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is emerging evidence that some individuals have difficulty cutting down or eliminating&#xD;
      individual's caffeine consumption in spite of clinically significant problems exacerbated by&#xD;
      caffeine use. This study will evaluate whether a caffeine reduction program developed at&#xD;
      Johns Hopkins can help people reduce the caffeine use in an online format. Volunteers will&#xD;
      participate in an intervention study conducted entirely online, including video visits for&#xD;
      screening, instructions for caffeine reduction, and follow up. The study also involves&#xD;
      filling out online surveys sent via email and text message. During screening, participants&#xD;
      will be asked questions about participants' personal characteristics including demographic&#xD;
      information, weekly caffeine consumption, and general medical history. Participants who are&#xD;
      determined to be eligible after screening will complete a session during which participants&#xD;
      receive a digital copy of a caffeine reduction manual and instructions on how to gradually&#xD;
      cut down caffeine. After this, participants will complete weekly online surveys over six&#xD;
      weeks. Participants will complete two follow-up video visits at 7 and 14 weeks after&#xD;
      participants received the caffeine reduction instructions. The investigators will measure&#xD;
      caffeine consumption over time using the online surveys and interview questions during video&#xD;
      visits, and the investigators will also measure how various caffeine related problems may&#xD;
      improve during caffeine reduction, such as sleep problems, gastrointestinal issues, and&#xD;
      anxiety. During the end of study sessions, participants will answer questions related to&#xD;
      acceptability of the online format and report on participants' current caffeine use.&#xD;

    <measure>Treatment acceptability as assessed by treatment acceptability questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At 7 weeks post-intervention visit</time_frame>
    <description>At the 7 Weeks Follow-Up video visit, we will use an internally-developed standardized treatment acceptability questionnaire to determine as well as self-reported agreement with the items on the treatment acceptability survey (e.g., &quot;Overall, was the Guide to Caffeine Reduction and Cessation easy to use?&quot;; &quot;Overall, was the guide to Caffeine reduction and Cessation helpful?&quot;). Acceptability questions are scored from 0-3 where lower scores indicate less acceptability (e.g., 0=not at all easy, not at all helpful; 3 = very easy, very helpful).</description>

    <description>To determine to what extent participants are successfully able to reduce their caffeine consumption following the remote intervention, we will assess caffeine consumption as determined by the standardized caffeine assessments at 7-and 14-week post-treatment follow-ups and compare this with consumption at the screening and treatment televisits. Based on participant responses to the number, type, and amount of caffeinated beverages, caffeine consumption is calculated at each assessment in milligrams (mg).</description>

    <measure>Change in caffeine-related problems as assessed by past-7 days standardized items</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at the time of intervention visit (within 1-2 weeks of screening), at 7 weeks post-intervention visit, at 14 weeks post-intervention visit</time_frame>
    <description>To determine to what extent participants report improvement in common caffeine-related problems following the remote intervention, we have developed a standardized measure of the extent to which common problems related to excessive caffeine consumption bothered participants within the past 7 days, e.g., &quot;During the past 7 days, I have consumed caffeine in larger amounts or over a longer period than I intended.&quot; Participants rate the extent to which these problems bothered them on a scale from 0-3 where 0 = not at all a problem and 3 = major problem. Higher sum scores on the measure indicate greater caffeine-related problems.</description>

    <measure>Change in anxiety as assessed by the PROMIS-Anxiety-8a</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at the time of intervention visit (within 1-2 weeks of screening), at 7 weeks post-intervention visit, at 14 weeks post-intervention visit</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether caffeine reduction is accompanied by a reduction in day-to-day anxiety, we will utilize the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety 8a assessment. The questionnaire asks the extent to which anxiety-related items affected the participants over the past 7 days on a scale of 1 (never) to 5 (always). Higher scores reflect greater anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety as assessed by the GAD-7</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at the time of intervention visit (within 1-2 weeks of screening), at 7 weeks post-intervention visit, at 14 weeks post-intervention visit</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether caffeine reduction is accompanied by a reduction in day-to-day anxiety, we will utilize the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). The GAD-7 consists of items asking the participant to rate on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) the extent they have experienced anxiety related symptoms where higher scores indicate greater anxiety related symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sleep problems as assessed by the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance 8a</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at the time of intervention visit (within 1-2 weeks of screening), at 7 weeks post-intervention visit, at 14 weeks post-intervention visit</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether caffeine reduction is accompanied by a reduction in sleep problems, we will utilize the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance 8a assessment. The questionnaire asks the extent to which sleep-related items affected the participants over the past 7 days on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). Higher scores reflect greater sleep disturbance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sleep problems as assessed by the PSQI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at the time of intervention visit (within 1-2 weeks of screening), at 7 weeks post-intervention visit, at 14 weeks post-intervention visit</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether caffeine reduction is accompanied by a reduction in sleep problems, we will utilize the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which contains 19 self-rated items for different components where a score of 0 indicates no difficulty and a score of 3 indicates severe difficulty. Higher global scores indicate greater sleep difficulties.</description>
