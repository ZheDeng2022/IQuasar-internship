      To demonstrate that tibulizumab (LY3090106) treatment improves the mean unstimulated salivary&#xD;
      flow rate or the salivary gland total ultrasound score (TUS) in primary Sjogren's syndrome&#xD;
      patients at week 12 compared to the baseline visit.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-site, open-label study in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome. All&#xD;
      patients will receive tibulizumab (LY3090106) 300mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks for a total&#xD;
      of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Sjogren's syndrome was selected as a relevant patient population based on the&#xD;
      mechanism of action of the molecule and the current understanding of the pathogenesis of the&#xD;
      disease. An open-label design was chosen based on practical considerations regarding the&#xD;
      number of patients that could be recruited. Although open-label studies are subject to bias,&#xD;
      objective primary endpoints were intentionally chosen to minimize this concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to demonstrate that tibulizumab (LY3090106) treatment improves the&#xD;
      mean unstimulated salivary flow rate or the salivary gland total ultrasound score (TUS) in&#xD;
      primary Sjogren's syndrome patients at week 12 compared to the baseline visit.&#xD;

The EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) is a physician administered questionnaire containing 12 organ-specific domains designed to measure disease activity. The ESSDAI score is obtained by addition of the twelve domain scores. Each domain score is obtained by multiplying the activity level with the domain weight. The maximum theoretical ESSDAI score is 123 and the minimum score is 0. A higher score means more disease activity (worse outcome).</description>
