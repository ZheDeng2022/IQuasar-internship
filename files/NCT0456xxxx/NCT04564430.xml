      This study is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, clinical trial&#xD;
      with two parallel groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates the association between a single dose of the drug, Clonidine, and the&#xD;
      total amount of opioid administered under and 24 hours after surgery in children undergoing&#xD;
      orthopedic limb surgery with the use of tourniquet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that administration of clonidine to children undergoing limb&#xD;
      surgery with the use of inflatable tourniquets would reduce post-procedural pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pilot to obtain an effect size. Based on this the investigators will&#xD;
      calculate a sample size for the main trial enabling us to reach a power of 0.8 with a&#xD;
      significans level of 0.05.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric upper and lower limb surgery often requires fine tissue handling. The prevention of&#xD;
      blood flow to a limb allows surgical procedures to be performed with improved accuracy,&#xD;
      safety, and speed. Surgical tourniquets, compressing devices used to control venous and&#xD;
      arterial circulation to an extremity, enable the surgeons to work in a bloodless operative&#xD;
      field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tourniquet related complications comprise severe pain during and after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In infants and children, surgical procedures are performed under general anaesthesia (GA),&#xD;
      comprising standard analgesics and anesthesia maintenance drugs. If an inflatable tourniquet&#xD;
      is used, supplementary opioid analgesics are often required to relieve postoperative pain.&#xD;
      This clinical observation is in accordance with previously reported data. In adult patients,&#xD;
      surgical extremity procedures requiring tourniquets are well known to be painful. As a&#xD;
      consequence, infants and children are subjected to prolonged stays in the recovery&#xD;
      department. Mobilization and referral to a more child friendly environment might be delayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many interventions and different medications have been tried in order to improve&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia in pediatric patients. Amongst these Clonidine, primarily an alpha-2&#xD;
      adrenoceptor agonist. Clonidine stimulates alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the brain stem, thus&#xD;
      activating inhibitory neurons, resulting in reduced sympathetic outflow from the CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In several studies' clonidine administered orally or rectally before anesthesia has shown to&#xD;
      reduce opioid use and diminish level of pain. Additionally, clonidine reduces the occurrence&#xD;
      of postoperative agitation. As an adjuvant to central or peripheral nerve blocks, clonidine&#xD;
      effectively prolongs analgesia. The efficacy of clonidine has also been investigated in&#xD;
      clinical studies with pediatric ADHD patients Tourette's syndrome and stuttering. The&#xD;
      efficacy of Clonidine in these conditions has not been demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clonidine is a taste- and smell less fluid, completely opaque. Although clonidine has been&#xD;
      widely studied in the pediatric population, the main outcome of investigations has been&#xD;
      emergence delirium. In existing literature, the means of administration vary from&#xD;
      intravenous, rectal, epidural or oral dosing. Intravenous single-bolus dosages range from 1.5&#xD;
      - 4 mcg/kg. One recent study included almost 400 patients and administered 3mcg/kg bodyweight&#xD;
      without the occurrence of any severe events. Based on these results the investigators chose&#xD;
      to administer 3mcg/kg bodyweight as a single bolus in our current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outcomes are objective measures (mg/kg bodyweight, time endurance) or validated&#xD;
      evaluation scales (FLACC/VAS score, PAED scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphine is widely used for postoperative pain relief, the intravenous administration being&#xD;
      the most potent. However, morphine is known to have several side effects (prolonged sedation,&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting, refusal of oral intake and concomitant dehydration) and may be dangerous&#xD;
      for certain children, who experience serious respiratory depression. Hence, a reduction in&#xD;
      total dose is crucial, especially after referral to the pediatric ward, where means of&#xD;
      monitoring are reduced to intermittent observation and assessment of vital parameters (oxygen&#xD;
      saturation by pulse oxymetri, heart rate and blood pressure) is only possible sporadically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same is true for pain and the assessment of pain using either FLACC or VAS scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time-at-recovery should be held at a minimum of duration due to high turn-over in our&#xD;
      operating facilities. Any unnecessary prolongation of recovery-time should hence be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of both primary and secondary outcomes are part of standard care and documentation&#xD;
      of the conductance of anesthesia, recovery and post-recovery treatment at the pediatric ward.&#xD;
      Hence, this information is readily available but will be registered in source-data sheets.&#xD;
      After the individual participant has completed the study, the total amount of morphine&#xD;
      administered at the pediatric ward from TREC-END to T24 will be registered by the study&#xD;
      investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to any kind of scheduled surgery, patients are seen at the outpatient's clinics at the&#xD;
      Department of Orthopedic Surgery. If the patient is less than 15 years of age and is planned&#xD;
      for extremity surgery with the use of surgical tourniquet, the surgeon will hand out parental&#xD;
      information material. Further, he/she will inquire, whether parents will give their accept to&#xD;
      receive a phone call 1-3 days prior to the date of surgery. If parents approve, study&#xD;
      investigators will contact the parents and inform them about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If parents agree to study participation, a written consent form will be presented on the day&#xD;
      of surgery by one of the study investigators for the parents to sign before induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia. Electronic patient records will not be accessed before written consent to study&#xD;
      participation has been granted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of inclusion- and exclusion criteria are readily available in every anamnesis form filled&#xD;
      out in the electronic patient data instrument at Odense University Hospital. Since inclusion&#xD;
      criteria comprise 'scheduled procedures', female study participants at fertile ages will&#xD;
      hence not be pregnant, since pregnancy is a contraindication against elective/non-urgent&#xD;
      surgery with concomitant GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On surgery day, children will be prepared according to departmental standard. This includes&#xD;
      fasting for meals 6 hours and for watery drinks 1 hour prior to anaesthesia induction and&#xD;
      premedication with sedatives at the discretion of the anaesthetist in charge. In order to&#xD;
      reduce pre-induction anxiety, parental presence will be allowed and encouraged. Choice of&#xD;
      inductional technique (mask or intravenous), choice of airway management device (oral tube&#xD;
      (portex (Smiths Medical International Ltd. Bound, Kent, CT21 6JL, UK) or Ruesch (Teleflex&#xD;
      Medical, Westmeath, Ireland)) or laryngeal mask (AmbuR AuraStraightTM, Ambu A/S, Ballerup,&#xD;
      Denmark) and means of anaesthesia maintenance are according to anaesthetists' preference.&#xD;
      After induction, children will receive one i.v. line (BD VenflonTM Pro, Becton Dickinson&#xD;
      Infusion Therapy AB, Helsingborg, Sweden) and a bolus of fentanyl (Fentanyl B.Braun; B.Braun&#xD;
      Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Tyskland) 3mcg/kg. Maintenance fluid (Ringer's Acetate, Fresenius&#xD;
      Kabi AB, Uppsala, Sweden) will be infused at a rate of 10ml/kg the first hour and then&#xD;
      reduced to 5ml/kg/h. Monitoring will comprise electrocardiogram (ecg), non-invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure (NIBP), puls oxymetri, esohageal temperature (IntelliVue MP70; ViCare Medical,&#xD;
      Birker√∏d, Denmark). Children will be mechanically ventilated by pressure controlled&#xD;
      ventilation (Siesta I TS, DAMECA, Denmark) aiming at end tidal carbon dioxide (CO2) of&#xD;
      4.5-5.5kPa. Flow of inspiratory oxygen FiO2 will be set at 45%. Anaesthesia depth will be&#xD;
      clinically observed and adjusted as needed. All children will receive paracetamol i.v.&#xD;
      (Para15mg/kg after induction. As it is not departmental standard, children will not receive&#xD;
      ondansetron or steroid for prophylaxis of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tourniquet will be positioned, and inflation pressure applied according to surgeons' choice.&#xD;
      At the time of tourniquet insufflation, children will receive either an intravenous bolus of&#xD;
      Catapressan (CatapresR Ampoules 150 micrograms in 1ml, Solution for injection, Boehringer&#xD;
      Ingelheim Ltd., Berkshire, UK)(3mcg/kg) or an equal quantity of IV saline (Natriumklorid&#xD;
      B.Braun 9mg/ml, B.Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Tyskland). Fentanyl will be supplemented by&#xD;
      the anaesthetist as needed according to clinical judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, children will be awake extubated and transferred to recovery. In recovery,&#xD;
      children will be observed and monitored as per departmental standard comprising pulsoxymetri&#xD;
      and pain assessment using the FLACC score (&lt;6yrs) and VAS score (&gt;6 yrs). Presence of nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting will be registered and treated as per departmental standard. Children will be&#xD;
      transferred to the pediatric ward when appropriate, that is in compliance with standards. On&#xD;
      the 1st postoperative day the total consumption of opioids 24 hours after transferral to&#xD;
      recovery will be summed up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-anaesthetic data collection: vital parameters (pulse, mean arteria pressure in mmHg,&#xD;
      oxygen saturation) will be recorded every 5 minutes. Total amounts in mg/kg of Propofol&#xD;
      (intravenous maintenance) or end-tidal sevoflurane/desflurane recorded at time of incision-&#xD;
      time of tourniquet inflation and desuflation. Level of tourniquet pressure and total time of&#xD;
      insufflation (total-tourniquet-time) will be recorded in minutes. Total amounts of fentanyl&#xD;
      (mcg/kg) and infused fluid (ml/kg) will be registered. Adverse events (desaturation &lt;90%,&#xD;
      bradycardia and hypotension according to European Pediatric Life Support (EPLS) reference&#xD;
      values for age) will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recovery: FLACC/VAS score will be recorded at arrival and discharge. If pain is present&#xD;
      during recovery, scores will be registered before and after intervention. Total amount of&#xD;
      analgesics will be registered. Occurrence of PONV will be registered as well as interventions&#xD;
      undertaken against. Occurrence of emergency delirium will be registered. Time-to-discharge&#xD;
      will be registered (in minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be transferred to the pediatric ward when appropriate, that is in compliance&#xD;
      with standards. On the 1st postoperative day the total consumption of opioids 24 hours after&#xD;
      transferral to recovery will be summed up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators chose the parallel-group design for the CLOTCH-Study. In accordance with&#xD;
      ICH-GCP recommendations on statistical principles for clinical trials (E9), the primary&#xD;
      analyses will be differences in primary and secondary outcomes adjusted for stratification&#xD;
      variables (i.e. means of anaesthesia maintenance (TIVA or Inhalational), tourniquet-time and&#xD;
      tourniquet pressure level, age groups &lt;1year, 1-6years, &gt;6years). The investigators will&#xD;
      assess and report all outcomes as &quot;intention-to-treat&quot; analysis including all randomised&#xD;
      children meeting the inclusion criteria and not fulfilling the exclusion criteria with a&#xD;
      standing consent to participate. Complete case analysis will be carried out if the overall&#xD;
      level of missing data is less than 5%. However, if exceeding the limit of 5% missing data and&#xD;
      if Littles' test is statistically significant, multiple imputation will be used and&#xD;
      considered the primary result of the trial to reduce bias from complete case analysis.&#xD;
      Little's test tests the null hypothesis that the missing data is Missing Completely At Random&#xD;
      (MCAR). A p-value of less than 0.05 is usually interpreted as being that the missing data is&#xD;
      not MCAR (i.e. is either Missing At Random or non-ignorable). The investigators will present&#xD;
      &quot;worst-case&quot; and &quot;best-case&quot; scenarios. p &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant. For each group, all children will be analysed for the primary outcome. For each&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcome, the results and estimated effect sizes with 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval will be provided. The investigators will exclude patients with major protocol&#xD;
      violations defined as failure to receive the total drug dose. The investigators will carry&#xD;
      out statistical analyses before revealing the code of allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial offers benefits for the population, which the minor study participant represents.&#xD;
      These comprise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improved strategies for treatment of pain after use of surgical tourniquets for&#xD;
           extremity surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced anxiety and discomfort postoperatively due to reduced pain levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accelerated mobilization postoperatively - a major factor in order to prevent immobility&#xD;
           related complications (pulmonary infections, obstipation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced-time-to-oral-intake, which is extremely important in all age groups, but crucial&#xD;
           for infants, who have a high metabolism and hence are at high risk of complications due&#xD;
           to anaerobic energy production.&#xD;
