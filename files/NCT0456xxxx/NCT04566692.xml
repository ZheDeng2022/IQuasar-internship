    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether biweekly (every 2 weeks) administration of&#xD;
      Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 20% Caprylate/Chromatography Purified (IGSC 20%)&#xD;
      produces a steady-state area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of total&#xD;
      Immunoglobulin G (IgG) that is non-inferior to that produced by weekly administration of IGSC&#xD;
      20% in treatment-experienced participants with primary immunodeficiency (PI).&#xD;

    <description>Treatment-experienced participants will receive IGSC 20% at 2 different dosing frequencies using a subcutaneous (SC) infusion pump during 2 treatment periods (16 weeks per treatment period). In treatment period 1, treatment-experienced participants will receive 16 weekly IGSC 20% doses from Week 0 to Week 15. For participants entering study on intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), IGSC 20% will be dosed at 1.37 times the equivalent weekly dose and participants entering on subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) will receive the same milligram/kilogram (mg/kg) equivalent weekly dose as given prior to entry, without using a dose adjustment factor (DAF). In treatment period 2, treatment-experienced participants will receive biweekly IGSC 20 % (i.e, IGSC 20% every 2 weeks) for a total of 9 doses, with the first IGSC 20% dose administered at Week 16 and the final dose given at Week 32.</description>
