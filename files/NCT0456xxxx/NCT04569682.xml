    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare the outcomes of transrenal artery perfusion&#xD;
      versus transrenal vein perfusion using LifePort for deceased donor kidney transplantation.&#xD;
      Patients registered in the National Dialysis and Transplant Registry awaiting deceased donor&#xD;
      kidney transplantation were included. Delayed graft function (DGF) or primary nonfunction&#xD;
      (PNF) may occur after deceased donor kidney transplantation. Compared with static cold&#xD;
      storage, the application of LifePort can significantly reduce the incidence of DGF and PNF in&#xD;
      deceased donor kidney transplantation. Transrenal artery perfusion is currently the&#xD;
      mainstream but confronts multiple renal arteries, resulted in prolonged cold ischemia time.&#xD;
      Transrenal vein perfusion is expected to be a solution. However, whether the clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of transrenal vein perfusion is inferior to transrenal artery perfusion remains&#xD;
      unknown. In this study, values of urine volume and creatinine, incidence and duration of DGF,&#xD;
      and incidence of PNF within 1 week after surgery are recorded and compared between the&#xD;
      transrenal artery perfusion group and the transrenal vein perfusion group. Monthly eGFR and&#xD;
      creatinine values, the incidence of acute rejection within 1 year after transplantation and&#xD;
      1-year graft and patient survival are also recorded and compared.&#xD;
