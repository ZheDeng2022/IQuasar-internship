      Teen participants (ages 13-17) will be randomly assigned to either an experimental (the&#xD;
      Happify Teens digital platform), or a waitlist control group. The study includes an 8-week&#xD;
      intervention period and a 1-month follow up period.&#xD;

      Teen participants (ages 13-17) will be randomly assigned to either the experimental group in&#xD;
      which participants receive access to Happify Teens, a digital platform rooted in several&#xD;
      therapeutic traditions that aims to improve wellbeing, or a waitlist control group. Both&#xD;
      group conditions last 8 weeks. Participants assigned to the Happify Teens platform will have&#xD;
      full access to the intervention, with featured tracks that focus on dealing with stress,&#xD;
      worries and building skills for greater happiness. Participants assigned to the waitlist&#xD;
      (control) condition will not have access to the Happify Teens platform for the full study&#xD;
      period (12 weeks total). Participants in the waitlist control will receive access to Happify&#xD;
      Teens after the full study period is complete (12 weeks). Perceived stress, rumination, and&#xD;
      optimism will be assessed via self-report at baseline, end of the 8-week intervention, and at&#xD;
      1 month post intervention.&#xD;
