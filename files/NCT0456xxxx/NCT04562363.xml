  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research is aimed at identifying factors of herniation after median laparotomy and&#xD;
      developing surgical methods for preventing postoperative ventral hernias and eventrations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the first stage, an analysis of the prevalence of postoperative ventral hernias in&#xD;
      patients after median laparotomies in urgent surgery will be performed, with the&#xD;
      identification of factors contributing to the development of postoperative ventral hernias.&#xD;
      At the next stage, the investigators will search for the most reliable methods of suturing&#xD;
      the white line of the abdomen, taking into account the risk of hernia formation, with their&#xD;
      implementation in patients operated in an emergency through median laparotomic access in&#xD;
      comparison with traditionally used methods. In conclusion, an algorithm will be developed for&#xD;
      selecting the method of surgical prevention of postoperative ventral hernias, taking into&#xD;
      account the risk of their development.&#xD;

        The prospective study included 700 patients, including those operated through a midline&#xD;
        laparotomic approach to identify factors of herniation, and those who are planned to have a&#xD;
        midline laparotomy in order to choose a rational method of suturing a laparotomic wound,&#xD;
        taking into account the risk of incisional hernia formation. Taking into account the degree&#xD;
        of risk of postoperative ventral hernia development and the choice of the method of its&#xD;
        prevention, the patients were divided into 4 groups.&#xD;
