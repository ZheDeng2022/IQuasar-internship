  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to enhance AN university students' behavioral health by supporting their&#xD;
      cultural identity development. While the connection between cultural identity and behavioral&#xD;
      health is becoming clearer, comparably less research has explored methods of enhancing&#xD;
      identity development. Consequently, the investigators will pilot a cultural identity&#xD;
      development program for AN students at the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA). This&#xD;
      intervention is based on extant scientific literature, local findings from focus group with&#xD;
      AN students, and traditional wisdom from AN Elders. The eight-week Elder-facilitated program&#xD;
      incorporates storytelling, experiential learning, connection, exploration, and sharing of&#xD;
      identity, cultural strengths, life paths, and rootedness in who they are in order to remain&#xD;
      grounded when they face changes and challenges. Approximately 40 to 50 AN university students&#xD;
      will be recruited for the intervention. Participants will be randomized, with half the&#xD;
      participants receiving the intervention in the Fall 2020 semester and half the students&#xD;
      receiving the intervention in the Spring 2021 semester. We hypothesize that engaging in this&#xD;
      intervention will strengthen AN students' cultural identities, strengths, and sense of&#xD;
      community; improve their behavioral health, as evidenced in higher self-reported wellbeing,&#xD;
      and lower substance use, depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation symptoms; and support&#xD;
      their academic persistence and achievement. Outcomes will be tested via mixed design analyses&#xD;
      of covariance. Moreover, program feasibility will be examined through a process evaluation,&#xD;
      which will entail thematic analyses of six focus groups with program participants (n=40-50)&#xD;
      and with the Elders who facilitated the program (n=5).&#xD;
