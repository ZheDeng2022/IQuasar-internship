    <textblock>
      This pilot-feasibility study of a cluster parallel randomized design comparing CBT-i against&#xD;
      usual care (UC) was performed at two primary health care centers in Majorca, Spain. Patients&#xD;
      were included if they were 18 to 65 years-old; had diagnoses of chronic insomnia according to&#xD;
      the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI more than 8) and had insomnia longer than 3 months; and did&#xD;
      or did not use a hypnotic medication. 25 GPs and nurses and 32 patients were randomly&#xD;
      allocated to two groups: The outcome of the trial was improving the quality of sleep. Other&#xD;
      primary outcomes on feasibility and applicability of the intervention were collected through&#xD;
      nominal groups. Description of usual care was described through previous studies. Moreover we&#xD;
      assessed recruitment process, compliance with the intervention sessions, and patient's&#xD;
      retention.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this pilot-feasibility study were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To design and adapt a brief CBT-i intervention to be provided by PCPs for the treatment&#xD;
           of chronic insomnia in individuals who are 18 to 65 years-old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To define usual care (UC) for the treatment of chronic insomnia provided by PCPs as a&#xD;
           comparative intervention (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the training activities for the CBT-i intervention by determining GPs' and&#xD;
           nurses' satisfaction with the content and applicability of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the acceptability of the intervention by GPs and nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess PCPs and patient recruitment, follow-up, and adherence to the intervention The&#xD;
           secondary objective was to assess the quality of sleep in patients after 3 months of the&#xD;
           CBT-i.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Design This pilot-feasibility study of a cluster parallel randomized design comparing&#xD;
      CBT-I against usual care (UC) was performed from September 2014 to April 2015 at two primary&#xD;
      health care centers of Majorca (Spain) with 56,000 registered inhabitants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of information and follow up Intervention The CBT-i intervention was developed by&#xD;
      two family physicians (IT and CV) and two psychologists (ET and MRP-P). First, a review of&#xD;
      the literature on the use of CBT-i was performed, with a focus on interventions applied in&#xD;
      primary care. After the literature review, the CBT-i created by Morin [24] was adapted to our&#xD;
      setting, in which there were fewer sessions and shorter sessions. The CBT-i included sleep&#xD;
      hygiene counseling, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, relaxation techniques, and&#xD;
      benzodiazepine therapy or withdrawal (when needed). To conduct the intervention, guidelines&#xD;
      for GPs and nurses and graphic and written materials for patients (sleep diary, registry of&#xD;
      behavior habits, and cognitive problems) were developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care The usual treatment for persistent insomnia in a primary care setting was&#xD;
      previously described in two cross-sectional studies performed by general practitioners and&#xD;
      family nurses of the Primary Care Majorca Department during 2011 and 2015&#xD;

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a 19-items self reported questionnaire that assesses 7 clinical components of sleep quality. Each item is rated on 0 to 3 point scale in which 0 is equal to not in the past month and 3 is equal to 3 or more times a week, with a global score range from 0 to 21. A cut off score of 5 has shown to discriminate between good and bad sleepers.</description>
