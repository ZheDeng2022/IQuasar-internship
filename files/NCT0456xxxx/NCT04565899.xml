  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to improve the quality of alcohol-related care for those with unhealthy alcohol use,&#xD;
      the current research will use an evidence-based implementation strategy, practice&#xD;
      facilitation, at one VA primary care site to pilot test whether practice facilitation has the&#xD;
      potential to improve the quality of primary care-based alcohol-related care . It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that primary care providers who take part in the practice facilitation&#xD;
      intervention will provide higher quality substance use care to Veterans with unhealthy&#xD;
      alcohol use compared to care pre-practice facilitation (e.g., administer evidence-based brief&#xD;
      counseling interventions at higher rates, prescribe alcohol use disorder pharmacotherapy at&#xD;
      higher rates, increase referrals to specialty substance use disorder clinics).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use is a significant risk factor of disability and death for U.S. adults and one out&#xD;
      of every six Veterans seen in primary care report unhealthy alcohol use. Based on substantial&#xD;
      evidence from randomized controlled trials and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force,&#xD;
      VA/DoD clinical guidelines stipulate that all Veterans screening positive for unhealthy&#xD;
      alcohol use should receive evidence-based alcohol care in primary care, including brief&#xD;
      counseling interventions (BI) and additional treatment (e.g., pharmacotherapy) for those with&#xD;
      alcohol use disorders (AUD). The VA was a pioneer in implementing alcohol screening and BI in&#xD;
      primary care, yet substantial implementation gaps remain. In order to improve the quality and&#xD;
      fidelity of alcohol-related care, the current research proposes to use an evidence-based&#xD;
      implementation strategy, practice facilitation, at one VA to pilot test whether practice&#xD;
      facilitation has the potential to improve quality of primary care-based alcohol-related care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will first conduct qualitative interviews assessing Veteran and clinical&#xD;
      stakeholders to understand barriers and facilitators to high-quality alcohol care. Results&#xD;
      from qualitative interviews will be used to refine and hone the practice facilitation&#xD;
      intervention. Clinical stakeholders will then be recruited to participate in focus groups in&#xD;
      order to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the proposed practice facilitation&#xD;
      intervention prior to testing it. Last, a pilot test of the practice facilitation&#xD;
      intervention will be conducted within one VA primary care clinic to understand whether&#xD;
      practice facilitation improves the quality of primary care-based alcohol-related care.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reach of alcohol-related care via electronic health record change</measure>
    <time_frame>3- and 6-months post implementation intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Reach outcomes will be expressed as a rate, with the denominator (for all outcomes) defined as all Veterans with a visit to the primary care site during active implementation of the practice facilitation pilot test. The numerator for each Reach outcome is as follows: the number of Veterans who screened positive for unhealthy alcohol use (AUDIT-C &gt;= 5) AND had any documented brief intervention, specialty addictions treatment (inpatient and outpatient clinic visits for substance use disorder treatment encounters with an accompanying AUD diagnosis), or pharmacotherapy for AUD (any filled prescription for FDA-approved medications: acamprosate, disulfiram, or oral/injectable naltrexone) in the 30 days following a positive screen. Rates at the start of active implementation and at 3- and 6-months post Active Implementation will be calculated to examine change in Reach outcomes over time.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adoption of alcohol-related care via electronic health record change</measure>
    <time_frame>3- and 6-months post implementation intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Adoption outcomes will be identified as the percentage of providers from the primary care clinic who deliver alcohol-related care when a Veteran screens positive for unhealthy alcohol use (e.g., delivery of brief interventions, consults to specialty addictions treatment, providing pharmacotherapy for AUDs). Rates of alcohol-related care at the start of active implementation and at 3- and 6-months post active implementation will be used to measure whether adoption rates of alcohol-related care increased over time.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adoption of alcohol related care via self-report change</measure>
    <time_frame>3- and 6-months post implementation intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Brief self-report questions to determine whether providers have adopted the suggested evidence-based components of alcohol-related care (e.g., shared decision making, patient-centered discussions, setting goals with patients) will be administered at the start of the active implementation phase, at the end of the active implementation phase, and 3- and 6-months post practice facilitation.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maintenance of alcohol-related care via electronic health record</measure>

    <description>Reach and Adoption outcomes using electronic health record data will be assessed again at 12-months post active implementation to examine whether high-quality alcohol care was sustained after practice facilitation.</description>
