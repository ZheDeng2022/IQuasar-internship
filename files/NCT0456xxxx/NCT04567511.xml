      This is a single arm, phase 4, prospective, open-label, United States single-center study to&#xD;
      determine the hemostatic characteristics of Hemlibra (emicizumab) as measured by coagulation&#xD;
      laboratory parameters in the mild hemophilia A male patient population with endogenous&#xD;
      altered FVIII (baseline FVIII activity of &gt;5% to 30%). The safety and hemostatic efficacy of&#xD;
      Hemlibra (emicizumab) in this patient population will be investigated. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will assess changes in joint health and quality of life in treated patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, phase 4, prospective, open-label, United States single-center study to&#xD;
      develop laboratory data and assess the clinical hemostatic efficacy and safety of Hemlibra&#xD;
      (emicizumab) for hemostatic control of mild hemophilia A patients (baseline FVIII activity,&#xD;
      &gt;5 to 30%). Males aged ≥5 years to ≤45 years without inhibitors are eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will assess changes in quality of life and joint health in treated&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 30-40 patients will be enrolled. As much as possible, the patient population&#xD;
      will be selected to provide a variety of FVIII activity levels and F8 genetic defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carrier females are not eligible for the study as the goal is to examine the effect of&#xD;
      altered FVIII on Hemlibra (emicizumab) binding; carrier females with FVIII levels in the mild&#xD;
      range of deficiency have one altered and one normal F8 gene that results in a mixture of both&#xD;
      normal and altered FVIII proteins thereby complicating the interpretation of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a FVIII inhibitor (or a history of a FVIII inhibitor) are not eligible for this&#xD;
      study; if a subject develops a FVIII inhibitor during the study, they will be withdrawn from&#xD;
      the study and offered the current standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients &lt;5 years of age will be excluded from the study due to 1) the number of blood draws&#xD;
      and the quantity of blood required; and 2) likelihood of reaching a minimum weight to utilize&#xD;
      Stimate (~20 kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with risk factors for thrombosis or TMA will be excluded from the study. Patients&#xD;
      &gt;45 years of age, &gt;30 BMI, with a history of CVD, or &gt;20% risk of CVD over a 10-year period&#xD;
      using the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimator will also be excluded&#xD;
      to minimize potential adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with any number of FVIII exposure days are eligible for enrollment, as are&#xD;
      previously untreated patients (PUPs). Although expected to be an uncommon occurrence, PUPs&#xD;
      may be at risk of developing FVIII inhibitors while enrolled in the study due to exogenous&#xD;
      FVIII exposure if required; as such they will be tested (bovine chromogenic modified&#xD;
      inhibitor assay) after FVIII exposure per IHTC standard guidelines (after an episode of&#xD;
      intensive treatment, between 3-5 EDs and then at 10 ED, etc.) Should a FVIII inhibitor&#xD;
      develop in a PUP while on study, they will be removed from the study and offered the current&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure no other bleeding disorders are present that might confound responses or lead to&#xD;
      the development of a bleeding event unrelated to the underlying diagnosis of mild hemophilia&#xD;
      A, a VWD panel and blood group will be obtained during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemlibra (emicizumab) will be administered as weekly prophylaxis using the FDA-approved&#xD;
      weekly dosing regimen following the enrollment/screening visit (first study visit) and the&#xD;
      administration of the 4 weekly loading doses (second study visit). A choice of other approved&#xD;
      dosing regimens (Q2W or Q4W) will not be offered as the primary regimen to limit variability&#xD;
      in Cmin/Cmax exposure levels. The weekly prophylaxis regimen was selected to be the easiest&#xD;
      for mild hemophilia A patients to remember as they are rarely on FVIII prophylaxis and&#xD;
      infrequently need to administer on-demand hemostatic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding events will be recorded and treated with locally available hemostatic agents (eg,&#xD;
      Stimate [DDAVP/desmopressin acetate], pdFVIII, rFVIII, etc) as required. If FVIII is required&#xD;
      for treatment of a bleeding event, the dose expected to achieve hemostasis will be utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollment period is 9 months; with a total study period of 35 months. The study&#xD;
      comprises 3 parts following screening. Subjects will initially be enrolled for loading dose&#xD;
      administration and collection of baseline laboratory data (1 month) and Part A (12 months),&#xD;
      with the option of enrolling in part B (12 months) upon successful completion of Part A and&#xD;
      approval of the Study Investigator. Up to a 1-month window is provided between screening and&#xD;
      administration of the first loading dose, depending on the return of required laboratory&#xD;
      testing data and subject availability. When subjects complete the study they will be&#xD;
      requested to meet with their IHTC hemophilia physician to resume their previous therapeutic&#xD;
      regimen or be offered the current standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loading dose administration (month 1 ±2 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 1-month (±2 days) period during which the 4 weekly loading doses of Hemlibra&#xD;
      (emicizumab) will be administered. Additionally, baseline laboratory data, banked plasma&#xD;
      samples, MSKUS imaging and quality of life questionnaires will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A [months 2-13 (±2 weeks)]:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A is a 12-month study to collect laboratory data to determine the impact of Hemlibra&#xD;
      (emicizumab) on laboratory coagulation parameters including thrombin generation in patients&#xD;
      with circulating levels of endogenous altered FVIII (&gt;5% to 30% baseline FVIII activity).&#xD;
      Laboratory data will be collected at month 4 (±2 weeks), month 7 (±2 weeks) and month 13 (±2&#xD;
      weeks). Additional data, including bleeding events, bleed treatment, intercurrent procedures,&#xD;
      quality of life (Haemo-QoL and CATCH questionnaires if &lt;17 years of age; Haem-A-QoL and CATCH&#xD;
      questionnaires if ≥17 years of age) and joint health (MSKUS) will be collected at baseline&#xD;
      and 12 months (±2 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Stimate/DDAVP challenge may occur at either the 4-month (±2 weeks) or 7-month (±2 weeks)&#xD;
      study visit to investigate the hemostatic characteristics of Hemlibra (emicizumab) in the&#xD;
      presence of elevated levels of altered FVIII using coagulation laboratory assays. The&#xD;
      Stimate/DDAVP challenge will not be performed if the patient has a documented history of lack&#xD;
      of response as defined by an increase of FVIII &lt; 2 times baseline level. The Stimate/DDAVP&#xD;
      challenge may be delayed to a later study visit due to recent treatment (within the previous&#xD;
      4 days) with a FVIII concentrate or Stimate (DDAVP/desmopressin acetate) or for convenience&#xD;
      (at the discretion of the Study Investigator). The Stimate/DDAVP challenge may also be&#xD;
      delayed or its route of administration altered if a subject weighs ≥10kg to &lt;20kg; a&#xD;
      weight-based subcutaneous dose of DDAVP/desmopressin acetate may be administered for subjects&#xD;
      &lt;20 kg at the discretion of the Study Investigator). The Stimate/DDAVP challenge may be&#xD;
      delayed to a later study visit if the intranasal route of administration is compromised and&#xD;
      subcutaneous administration of DDAVP/desmopressin acetate is not planned. See Section 3.1.9&#xD;
      for full details on the Stimate/DDAVP challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B [months 14-25 (±2 weeks)]:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon successful completion of Part A, subjects may continue Hemlibra (emicizumab) treatment&#xD;
      by enrolling in Part B if approved by the Study Investigator and per patient desire to&#xD;
      continue treatment. The goal of Part B is to acquire additional data on bleeding events,&#xD;
      bleed treatment, intercurrent procedures, changes in quality of life (Haemo-QoL and CATCH&#xD;
      questionnaires if &lt;17 years of age; Haem-A-QoL and CATCH questionnaires if ≥17 years of age)&#xD;
      and joint health (MSKUS). This extended collection period is desired due to the infrequent&#xD;
      and variable ABR in individuals with mild hemophilia A. Subjects will receive Hemlibra&#xD;
      (emicizumab treatment in Part B for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is seeking to address the following knowledge gaps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is Hemlibra (emicizumab)-conferred hemostatic coverage additive to the activity of the&#xD;
           endogenous altered FVIII protein in mild hemophilia A patients or is there evidence that&#xD;
           endogenous altered FVIII protein is competitive with Hemlibra (emicizumab)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do specific FVIII mutations confer more or less additive or competitive effect? In&#xD;
           silico simulations of the altered protein (based upon the patient's genetic alteration)&#xD;
           may be investigated to predict the protein's in vivo function and interaction with&#xD;
           Hemlibra (emicizumab) binding (secondary exploratory goal)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the hemostatic contribution of Hemlibra (emicizumab) in the presence of maximal&#xD;
           endogenous altered FVIII protein release (Stimate/DDAVP challenge with coagulation&#xD;
           laboratory assays)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are there patients with specific genetic mutations who would benefit from Hemlibra&#xD;
           (emicizumab) usage, or can a sub-population of patients of mild hemophilia be identified&#xD;
           for whom Hemlibra (emicizumab) would not represent optimal therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is weekly Hemlibra (emicizumab) safe to administer in patients with mild hemophilia A&#xD;
           and does it reduce the incidence of bleeding events or the need for alternate hemostatic&#xD;
           agents, including during/following surgeries and procedures?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does weekly prophylactic Hemlibra (emicizumab) result in an increase in QoL and/or&#xD;
           activity in mild hemophilia A patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does weekly prophylactic Hemlibra (emicizumab) result in an improvement in joint health&#xD;
           (ie, the control of progression, stabilization or regression of joint damage) using 6&#xD;
           joint point of care musculoskeletal&#xD;
