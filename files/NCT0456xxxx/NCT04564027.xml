  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is investigating efficacy, safety and tolerability of DNA-damage Response Agents&#xD;
      (or Combinations), in participants with advanced/metastatic solid malignancies whose tumours&#xD;
      contain molecular alterations&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current module of the study will consist of 2 cohorts as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A (Advanced Solid Tumours [AST]): A total of ~25 molecularly eligible and centrally&#xD;
      confirmed participants will be enrolled into this cohort (ensuring at least 60% of&#xD;
      participants with ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) Immunohistochemistry [IHC] ≤ 5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B (Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [mCRPC]): A total of ~27&#xD;
      molecularly eligible and centrally confirmed participants will be enrolled into Cohort B&#xD;
      (ensuring at least 60% of participants with ATM IHC ≤ 5%). Unfavourable circulating tumour&#xD;
      cells (CTC) count requirement may be introduced for all participants to ensure an adequate&#xD;
      (approximately ≥ 50%) number of participants with CTC count ≥ 5/7.5 mL blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening will have 2 parts, Part 1 and Part 2, which apply for both Cohort A and Cohort&#xD;
      B.&#xD;
