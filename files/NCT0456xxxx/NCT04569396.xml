      The study is based on data from morbidly obese patients who fulfilled the criteria for&#xD;
      bariatric surgery during 2016-2018 at the Department of Surgery, University Hospital Ostrava,&#xD;
      Czech Republic. Patients with age above 18 years, BMI &gt; 35-40 kg/m2, and associated with at&#xD;
      least one of the complications including hypertension, diabetes, and failure of the current&#xD;
      therapies to relieve the symptoms were included in the study. Patients included in the&#xD;
      current study do not have a history of excessive alcohol consumption, use of hepatotoxic&#xD;
      drugs, infectious liver diseases (i.e. hepatitis A, B, C), and genetic hemochromatosis. A&#xD;
      total of 72 patients including n = 26 during 2016, n = 26 during 2017, and n = 20 during 2018&#xD;
      who qualified for bariatric surgeries were included in this observational study. Data related&#xD;
      to patients' gender, age (years), weight (kg), height (cm), and associated co-morbidities&#xD;
      like diabetes and hypertension were recorded before surgery. BMI (kg/m2), biochemical&#xD;
      parameters including triglycerides profile (mmol/L), platelet count (number/L), Gamma&#xD;
      glutamyl-transferase (international units - IU/L), albumin concentration (g/L), Alanine&#xD;
      amino-transferases (units/L), Aspartate aminotransferases (international units - IU/L), were&#xD;
      evaluated following standard procedures. Platelet count, triglycerides, and enzymes were&#xD;
      determined using standard procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biochemical results were compared to the corresponding paired values before surgery and&#xD;
      after surgery. The current study was designed to prospectively investigate the effect of&#xD;
      bariatric surgeries among non-alcoholic obese individuals from 2016-2018 and one year follow&#xD;
      up on liver biochemistry, BMI, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis score,&#xD;
      Fibrosis 4 (FIB 4) Index, and Fatty Liver Index (FLI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and median&#xD;
      (interquartile range) in case of normal and non-normal distribution, respectively. The&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normal distribution. The within-patient changes in&#xD;
      clinical parameters (continuous or ordinal variables) from baseline to 1-year after bariatric&#xD;
      surgery were compared using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests for ordinal&#xD;
      variables and continuous variables when the change was not normal or using the paired&#xD;
      Student's t-test otherwise. The statistical testing was done at the two-tailed α level of&#xD;
      0.05. The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism Version 8.0.2 (GraphPad Software, Inc.,&#xD;
      USA).&#xD;
