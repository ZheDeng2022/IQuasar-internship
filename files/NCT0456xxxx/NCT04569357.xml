      Purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • evaluate the efficacy and safety of Prospecta in the treatment of attention&#xD;
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design: a multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll children of either age from 7 to 12 years old with diagnosis of&#xD;
      attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) verified by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&#xD;
      of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, American Psychiatric Association&quot; [DSM-V]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing patient information sheet and informed consent form by the subject's&#xD;
      parent/adoptive parent collection of complaints, medical examination of the children, filling&#xD;
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-Rating Scale-V [ADHD-RS-V]) scale by the&#xD;
      parent/adoptive parent will be performed, concomitant therapy will be recorded and laboratory&#xD;
      tests will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll children with total score ADHD-RS-V ≥ 22. If the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      were met and there were no exclusion criteria (Day 1), the patient will be randomized to one&#xD;
      of the two groups: group 1 will receive Prospecta at 2 tablets twice daily; group 2 will&#xD;
      receive Placebo using the study drug dosing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period will be 8 weeks, the key examination stages (collection of complaints,&#xD;
      recording objective examination findings, repeated filling ADHD-RS-V by parent/adoptive&#xD;
      parent) will be made at Visit 1 (Day 1), further in 4 weeks (visit 2) and in 8 weeks (visit&#xD;
      3). Each visit to the research center will be made by the subject accompanied by his/her&#xD;
      parent/adoptive parent. Two weeks later (visit 1.1, week 2±3 days) after randomization and&#xD;
      initiation of the study therapy and between visits 2 and 3 (visits 2.2, week 6±3 days) the&#xD;
      investigator will examine the patient's clinical status (during phone calls). Based on&#xD;
      complaints, monitoring of the prescribed therapy therapeutic safety will be assessed. At&#xD;
      visit 2 (week 4±3 days) and visit 3 (week 8±3 days) the investigator will collect complaints,&#xD;
      record objective examination findings, monitor repeated ADHD-RS-V filling by parent/adoptive&#xD;
      parent, the prescribed and concomitant therapy, evaluate therapeutic safety and compliance.&#xD;
      In addition at Visit 3 the investigator will complete the Clinical Global Impression Efficacy&#xD;
      Index [CGI-EI] scale and collect samples for laboratory testing. The study treatments will be&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total length of the observation period is 8 weeks. During the study the treatment for&#xD;
      underlying conditions will be allowed with the exception of the drugs indicated in the&#xD;
      section &quot;Prohibited concomitant therapy&quot;.&#xD;

ADHD-RS-V will evaluate 18 symptoms presented as brief characteristics of peculiarities in behaviour and emotional response of children in various situations (at home).</description>
