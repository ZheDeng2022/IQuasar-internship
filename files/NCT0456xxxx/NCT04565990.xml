      The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term safety of selexipag while providing&#xD;
      continued selexipag treatment for participants who were previously enrolled in an&#xD;
      Actelion-sponsored study with selexipag and who derived benefit from selexipag in indications&#xD;
      for which a positive benefit-risk has been established.&#xD;
