    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter exclusion of atrial&#xD;
      septal aneurysm (ASA) via transseptal perforation in patients with ASA.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial septal aneurysm (ASA) has been considered a potential cardiac source of embolism, and&#xD;
      its prevalence is about 1%. In adult patients with stroke and normal carotid arteries, ASA is&#xD;
      an important predictor of recurrent stroke. The most common abnormalities associated are&#xD;
      interatrial shunts, that is, a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or an atrial septal defect (ASD).&#xD;
      For large ASA with interatrial shunt, it is difficult to cover ASA with conventional devices,&#xD;
      which might result in unstability of occluders and related complications . For isolated ASA&#xD;
      with high risk, thrombus and emboli have been reported and anticoagulation has been used&#xD;
      empirically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the left atrial septal pouch can be considered as a special subtype of atrial&#xD;
      septal aneurysm, in which thrombus might arise from the cavity of the pouch. Pervious&#xD;
      researches have noted that left atrial septal pouch was a site of origin of thrombus&#xD;
      formation and a source of embolism, and it was associated with cryptogenic stroke. For&#xD;
      patients with ASA, we hypothesizes that transcatheter reconstruction of atrial septum might&#xD;
      be achieved with PFO occluder through transseptal perforation. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter exclusion of ASA via transseptal&#xD;
      perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll subjects with ASA (including left atrial septal pouch), and enrollment&#xD;
      will be divided into three phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: large ASA patients with interatrial communication (ASD or PFO). A maximum of 30&#xD;
      patients is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: ASA patients with intact septum and high risk of cryptogenic stroke. A maximum of 20&#xD;
      patients is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: left atrial septal pouch with high risk of cryptogenic stroke. A maximum of 20&#xD;
      patients is reached.&#xD;
