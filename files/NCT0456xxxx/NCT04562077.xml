      role of surgery in treatment of recurrent brain glioma prognostic factors and outcome&#xD;
      measures Role of surgery : In patients with Grade I gliomas, such as pilocytic astrocytomas,&#xD;
      resection is potentially curative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For more diffuse invasive gliomas (Grade II or higher), initial management typically includes&#xD;
      maximal safe resection when possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing evidence supports an association between extent of resection and prolonged&#xD;
      progression-free and overall survival for patients with diffuse gliomas of all types and&#xD;
      grades Many studies reported that more that 90%of patients with glioma showed recurrence at&#xD;
      the orginal tumor location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review the outcomes of re-operation in treatment of recurrent brain gliomas To determine the&#xD;
      prognostic factors which can predict which patient would benefit from multiple surgery .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trail to Improve the outcome of these patients and decrease rate of complications&#xD;

    <description>A standard way of measuring the ability of cancer patients to perform ordinary tasks. The Karnofsky Performance Status scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score means the patient is better able to carry out daily activities. Karnofsky Performance Status may be used to determine a patient's prognosis, to measure changes in a patient's ability to function, or to decide if a patient could be included in a clinical trial. Also called KPS.</description>

        All cases that fullfill the selection criteria that will be admitted in the department of&#xD;
        neurosurgery Assuit university hospital 01/11/2020 to 30/10/2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sample size was calculated using Epi- Info7. The previous study reported that, percentage&#xD;
        of complications after re-operation in recurrent glioma was 65%. Based on this percentage&#xD;
        and with a confidence limits of 10% and a confidence level of 80%, the minimum sample&#xD;
        needed for the study was estimated to be 20 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients whose follow-ups will be lost because of death or any other cause will be excluded&#xD;
        from this study (expected to be 25%). Additionally, the competence of follow-up will be&#xD;
        approved by imaging and medical records.&#xD;
