  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of crystal methamphetamine (MA) leads to changes in sexual risk behavior, adherence to&#xD;
      HIV prevention tools, immune response to infection, and tissue inflammation that collectively&#xD;
      increase risk for HIV transmission among MA-using men who have sex with men (MSM), their&#xD;
      sexual partners, and their networks. Contingency Management (CM) offers a behavioral&#xD;
      modification tool helpful for reducing frequency of MA use, but the effects of CM on the&#xD;
      behavioral and biological factors that promote HIV transmission in MSM networks have only&#xD;
      been partially evaluated. The intersection of substance use, sexual risk behavior, and HIV&#xD;
      transmission in MSM networks presents a critical problem for contemporary HIV prevention as&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected MSM who use MA have a 16%-33% greater risk for HIV infection, while only&#xD;
      approximately 50% of HIV-infected MA-using MSM achieve and maintain an undetectable viral&#xD;
      load. The investigators propose to compare two different CM models to integrate substance use&#xD;
      treatment with HIV prevention among MA-using MSM: 1) Traditional CM targeted to MA abstinence&#xD;
      and 2) Allternative CM based on ARV adherence.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intersection of substance use, sexual behavior, and HIV transmission in the social and&#xD;
      sexual networks of crystal methamphetamine (MA)-using men who have sex with men (MSM)&#xD;
      presents a critical public health problem. MA use increases risk for HIV acquisition and&#xD;
      transmission in an interwoven series of behavioral, biological, and social mechanisms.&#xD;
      Behaviorally, MA use stimulates pleasure-seeking behavior, increasing the likelihood of&#xD;
      high-risk sexual contacts and impairing adherence to tools like condoms, pre-exposure&#xD;
      prophylaxis (PrEP), and Treatment as Prevention (TasP). Biologically, MA affects immunologic&#xD;
      factors associated with HIV-1 transmission, including viral replication, inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine production, T-cell activation, and recruitment of CD4+ T-cells to rectal mucosa.&#xD;
      Socially, MA use negatively impacts the perceptions of interpersonal commitment and social&#xD;
      cohesion central to community norms of HIV prevention, while elevating the incidence of&#xD;
      untreated HIV/STIs in the population and increasing risks of exposure for sexual network&#xD;
      contacts. Efforts to address these problems have typically prioritized either reducing MA use&#xD;
      or controlling HIV transmission, without targeting the overlapping space between the two&#xD;
      problems and exploring how individual-level interventions targeted to high-risk networks can&#xD;
      transform community-scale outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contingency Management (CM) has been shown to control MA use among habitual users. Adapting&#xD;
      principles of behavioral economics, CM addresses the prioritization of short-term rewards and&#xD;
      the devaluation of long-term risks commonly seen with MA use. While behavioral approaches&#xD;
      like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy have been evaluated as strategies to manage stimulant&#xD;
      abuse, these methods have not shown independent benefit in modifying patterns of drug use,&#xD;
      presumably because they do not intervene in the cognitive risk-reward feedback loop that&#xD;
      underlies stimulant abuse and that is replaced by CM incentives. Analysis of previous&#xD;
      clinical trial data suggests that the small financial incentives provided in exchange for&#xD;
      stimulant-free urine may substitute for the short-term feedback loops that structure the&#xD;
      cognitive processes of habitual MA users, and serve as an essential component in CM's&#xD;
      success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential indirect effects of CM on HIV transmission have been evaluated in several&#xD;
      studies. In conjunction with reduced MA use, MSM often report a corresponding reduction in&#xD;
      frequency of condomless intercourse. However, efforts to implement CM as a harm reduction&#xD;
      strategy in sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics have been unsuccessful, leading to&#xD;
      questions about how it can be applied to real world settings. In these contexts, incremental&#xD;
      improvements among individual MA users are often insufficient in modifying problems like&#xD;
      frequency of condomless intercourse, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and&#xD;
      network-level patterns of HIV and STI transmission. The goal of the current research is to&#xD;
      use CM as a platform to integrate HIV prevention with substance use treatment among MA-using&#xD;
      MSM to transform population-level patterns of HIV transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims Aim 1. To assess the logistics, feasibility, and acceptability of a&#xD;
      point-of-care urine assay to assess short-term adherence to Tenofovir (TFV)-based&#xD;
      antiretrovirals (ARVs) or PrEP regimens among MA-using MSM. The investigators plan to enroll&#xD;
      10 HIV-infected and 10 HIV-uninfected MSM with recent use of MA and a tenofovir-based HIV&#xD;
      treatment or prevention regimen. Participants will be randomly assigned to traditional CM&#xD;
      (Arm A) or ARV-based CM (Arm B) and asked to attend monitoring visits three times per week&#xD;
      over a 30-day period. Each visit will include urine monitoring for recent MA use and ART&#xD;
      adherence (in both Arms). At each visit where a participant's urine either does not contain&#xD;
      MA (Arm A) or does contain tenofovir (Arm B), they will receive a small financial incentive.&#xD;
      Incentives will gradually increase with each successful urine test, or they will reset to&#xD;
      zero if the participant fails the urine screen or misses a visit. Aim 1 outcomes will assess&#xD;
      participant retention, satisfaction and acceptability of the CM format for supporting ARV&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To collect preliminary data on the effect of ARV-based CM in promoting ARV adherence.&#xD;
      To design an R01 trial of CM to support ARV adherence, the investigators plan to collect&#xD;
      preliminary effect estimates for the two CM platforms in promoting: i) MA abstinence; ii) ARV&#xD;
      adherence, and iii) Reductions in high-risk sexual behavior. Findings will be used to project&#xD;
      sample size and refine monitoring procedures in the larger trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Recruitment and Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit active MA users from community venues. Potential subjects will&#xD;
      be recruited by a team of experienced, community-based researchers. To avoid withholding an&#xD;
      effective CM therapy intervention from individuals trying to limit their use, for this pilot&#xD;
      study the investigators will only enroll MSM who are not currently seeking substance use&#xD;
      treatment. Enrollment will be limited to individuals who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify as male or transgender;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Report condomless anal intercourse with a male or transgender partner in the prior 6&#xD;
           months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Report current MA use (at least once per week) with MA present in urine at screening;&#xD;
           and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Are currently taking Truvada for PrEP (if HIV-uninfected) or a Tenofovir-based ART&#xD;
           regimen (if HIV-infected).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Potential participants will undergo preliminary screening by the study recruiter using&#xD;
           an IRB-approved screening script. Eligible participants will be scheduled for an&#xD;
           Enrollment visit at the UCLA Vine Street Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the Enrollment visit, all participants will be asked to provide informed consent&#xD;
           prior to the initiation of any study procedures. Upon providing consent, participants&#xD;
           will be assessed for eligibility by a study physician and asked to provide a urine&#xD;
           sample to test for presence of methamphetamine metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Eligible subjects participants will be asked to complete the following Enrollment visit&#xD;
           procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) Behavioral Survey: All participants will be asked to complete a computer-assisted&#xD;
           self-administered (CASI) survey assessing their demographic characteristics, substance&#xD;
           use practices, current use of PrEP (if HIV-uninfected) or antiretroviral therapy (if&#xD;
           HIV-infected), sexual practices, characteristics of recent partners, and social and&#xD;
           sexual network composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii) HIV Testing: Study counselors will provide HIV risk reduction counseling using the&#xD;
           CDC RESPECT-2 model and test for HIV with a 5th Generation HIV-1/2 Ab assay. Positive&#xD;
           results will be confirmed by HIV-1 PCR testing for viral load quantification. Referrals&#xD;
           to prevention and treatment services will be provided as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii) STI Testing: Participants will undergo syphilis testing by rapid plasma reagin&#xD;
           (RPR) with T palladium particle agglutination (TPPA) assay confirmation and serial&#xD;
           dilution of positive titers. Participants will be asked to provide urine, rectal and&#xD;
           pharyngeal swabs for gonorrhea and chlamydia (GC/CT) testing. Participants with an STI&#xD;
           will receive appropriate antibiotic treatment and partner notification counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iv) Urine Toxicology Screen: Urine samples will be tested for stimulants and other drugs&#xD;
           of abuse using a point-of-care liquid chromatography (LC) assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the Enrollment visit, participants will be randomly assigned to a CM program with&#xD;
           incentives based either on MA abstinence or TFV adherence and with monitoring visits&#xD;
           either twice per week or three times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. Contingency Management Visits. Eligible participants will be counseled on CM&#xD;
           procedures at the Enrollment visit. Participants will be asked to return to the site&#xD;
           either two or three times per week (T-Th or M-W-F) for 4 weeks. At each visit,&#xD;
           participants will meet with a counselor to discuss their use of PrEP/ART, MA, and sexual&#xD;
           risk behavior. Participants will be asked to provide a urine sample for point of care&#xD;
           testing to detect presence of: a) Methamphetamine (MA); and b) Tenofovir (TFV). Verified&#xD;
           MA abstinence (Arm A) OR TFV use (Arm B) for the prior 3-day period will be rewarded&#xD;
           with an escalating series of incentives.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If a participant fails urine testing, their incentive schedule resets to the Baseline&#xD;
           value.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following Enrollment, all participants will be asked to return for Contingency&#xD;
           Management visits two or three times per week for four weeks. Each visit will include&#xD;
           the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) Behavioral Assessment: Participants will complete a brief, 12-item CASI survey&#xD;
           assessing recent MA use, PrEP/ART adherence, and frequency of CAI with&#xD;
           serodiscordant/unknown status partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii) Counseling: After completing the survey, study counselors will conduct a brief&#xD;
           check-in session using motivational interviewing techniques to encourage MA abstinence,&#xD;
           ARV adherence, and condom use.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii) Urine Toxicology Screening: Urine samples will be tested for presence of MA&#xD;
           metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iv) Tenofovir Screening: Urine samples will be tested at point-of-care for presence of&#xD;
           Tenofovir metabolites using an experimental assay developed by Alere with Dr. Gandhi&#xD;
           (UCSF). Similar to urine toxicology screening, this point-of-care LC assay can be&#xD;
           performed in 15 minutes without specialized training and detects presence of both TDF&#xD;
           and TAF metabolites indicating Tenofovir use in the prior 3-day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c. Final Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the Final visit, participants will be asked to complete the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) Behavioral Assessment: Participants will be asked to complete a CASI survey similar&#xD;
           to the enrollment instrument, with attention to changes in sexual behavior, substance&#xD;
           use practices, and network composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii) Biological Assessment: Participants will undergo repeat testing for HIV (including&#xD;
           viral load, if HIV-infected) and STIs, as well as urine screening for MA and Tenofovir&#xD;
           metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii) Assessment of Study Procedures: Participants will be asked to complete a structured&#xD;
           survey evaluating their satisfaction with and specific study procedures (e.g., frequency&#xD;
           of visits, length of visits, individual counseling, incentive structures, and perceived&#xD;
           impact on ARV adherence, MA use, and sexual risk behavior).&#xD;
