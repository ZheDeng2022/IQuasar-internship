  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the imaging performance of Spectrally Encoded Confocal&#xD;
      Microscopy (SECM) for imaging human skin and skin diseases.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SECM provides an order of magnitude faster imaging speed than conventional confocal&#xD;
      microscopy devices. The investigators have previously utilized the SECM technology for&#xD;
      imaging large area of human esophagus in vivo. They have also developed endoscopic capsule&#xD;
      devices which have been used to safely image over 60 human subjects, healthy volunteers and&#xD;
      subjects with eosinophilic esophagitis, using SECM technology, rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When used for skin imaging, SECM can provide real-time three-dimensional confocal imaging and&#xD;
      significantly reduce the imaging time. While SECM has been successfully used for imaging&#xD;
      human esophagus in vivo, its utility in skin imaging needs to be tested in a new pilot study.&#xD;
      The investigators will be taking images with a dermatoscope as well. This will the control to&#xD;
      compare the experimental images to, as the dermatoscope is the standard of care diagnostic&#xD;
      tool for dermatologists.&#xD;

    <description>The SECM skin imaging procedure will be very similar to that by the FDA approved RCM devices. First, the skin lesion (such as a mole) will be identified on a forearm of the subject. The lesion will be imaged first with a dermatoscope, and then with the SECM device. A dermatoscope is a hand-held device used for the visual observation of the epidermis. It is a superior surface contact microscope used to examine skin lesions.</description>

    <description>Consented Participants will be asked to allow their forearm to be imaged by the dermatoscope on the same skin/lesions as a control comparison. We will be trying to image pigmented skin/lesions present on the forearm. This will be followed by imaging using the SECM Skin imaging device</description>
