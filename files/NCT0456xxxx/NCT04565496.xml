      This is a phase 2, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm study in patients with high-risk&#xD;
      PCa diagnosed with prostate biopsy and undergoing RP and ePLND. Pembrolizumab will be&#xD;
      administered at the dose of 200 mg intravenously, every 3 weeks, for a total of 3 cycles&#xD;
      prior to RP and ePLND. Local, nodal and systemic staging with prostate mpMRI, abdominal and&#xD;
      chest CT, PSMA-PET/CT and bone scans will be performed before the administration of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. Surgery will be planned at the time of study inclusion to be done within 3&#xD;
      weeks of the last dose of study drug (screening: 3 weeks; cycle 1 followed by 3 weeks; cycle&#xD;
      2 followed by 3 weeks; cycle 3 followed by 3 weeks to surgery = 12 weeks from inclusion to&#xD;
      surgery). Patients will receive 3 cycles of pembrolizumab at 200mg 3 weekly prior to RP and&#xD;
      ePLND. Surgery will take place within 3 weeks after the last dose of the study drug. After&#xD;
      surgery, patients with the evidence of aggressive disease features (namely, pathologic grade&#xD;
      group 4-5; pT3b-4 and/or LNI) will be managed according to local guidelines (adjuvant&#xD;
      radiotherapy with or without ADT will be allowed). Further Anti PD-1 therapy will not be&#xD;
      given post-operatively. PD-L1 status will be retrospectively assessed on both tumour cells&#xD;
      and immune cells in tissue specimens from for all patients enrolled in the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm study in patients with high-risk&#xD;
      PCa diagnosed with prostate biopsy and undergoing RP and ePLND. Screening assessments should&#xD;
      be performed no more than 3 weeks prior to the start of study treatment. Local, nodal and&#xD;
      systemic staging with prostate mpMRI, abdominal and chest CT, PSMA-PET/CT and bone scans will&#xD;
      be performed before the administration of pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab will be administered&#xD;
      at the dose of 200 mg intravenously, every 3 weeks, for a total of 3 cycles prior to RP and&#xD;
      ePLND. Following the screening assessment, subsequent assessments will be carried out after&#xD;
      the 3 administrations of the study drug prior to RP and ePLND. If an unscheduled assessment&#xD;
      is performed and the patient has not progressed, the results should be reported at the next&#xD;
      scheduled visit. After the last cycle of pembrolizumab, mpMRI and PSMA-PET/CT scan will be&#xD;
      performed to re-stage the tumour. Progressive disease will be defined as an increase of 20%&#xD;
      in the maximum diameter of the index lesion at multiparametric MRI or as the onset of nodal&#xD;
      or distant metastases at imaging or onset of symptoms and skeletal related events. In the&#xD;
      case of symptomatic disease progression (i.e., de novo onset of symptomatic distant&#xD;
      metastases), the patient will not complete the 3 cycles of pembrolizumab and will be&#xD;
      considered for immediate imaging (i.e., bone scan, mpMRI and PSMA-PET/CT scan) to re-stage&#xD;
      the tumour and for treatment according to clinical guidelines. After RP, patients will be&#xD;
      managed according to clinical guidelines. PDL-1 status will be assessed on all samples of&#xD;
      patients enrolled on the study. Tissue and blood samples will be collected before and after&#xD;
      the administration of pembrolizumab. The presence of biomarkers predictive of radiological&#xD;
      and pathological response to neoadjuvant administration of pembrolizumab will be assessed.&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored carefully for the development of adverse events and will be&#xD;
      monitored for clinical evidence of disease progression according to usual standards of&#xD;
      clinical practice. Adverse events will be evaluated according to criteria outlined in the NCI&#xD;
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03. There will be no&#xD;
      intrapatient dose escalation in this study. For individual patients that experience&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicities, no criteria for dose modification of pembrolizumab will be applied,&#xD;
      but only criteria for dose delays as detailed in the protocol. Patients will be treated with&#xD;
      a maximum of 3 cycles of therapy until surgery (i.e. RP and ePLND), provided that no&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicities will occur throughout the treatment course for each individual&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;

             guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The participant should be affected by high-risk PCa defined as PSA ≥20 ng/ml and/or&#xD;

             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;

             investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last&#xD;
             dose of the previous investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment&#xD;
             within the past 3 years. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin,&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast carcinoma,&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

             pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Note: No HIV testing is&#xD;
             required unless mandated by local health authority.&#xD;

         13. Has a known history of hepatitis infection (defined as having a positive hepatitis B&#xD;
             surface antigen [HBsAg] test at screening) or hepatitis C. Patients with past&#xD;
             hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or resolved HBV infection (defined as having a&#xD;
             negative HBsAg test and a positive antibody to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc]&#xD;
             antibody test) are eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody&#xD;
             are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is negative for HCV RNA.&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
