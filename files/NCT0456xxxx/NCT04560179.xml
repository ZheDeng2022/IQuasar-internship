    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, phase 1, inter-patient dose escalation feasibility trial seeking&#xD;
      establish preliminary tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic data for up to 4 different&#xD;
      doses of inhaled tobramycin administered to very preterm infants with BPD who are receiving&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation and have a pathogenic Gram-negative organism detected by&#xD;
      tracheal aspirate culture.&#xD;

    <description>The phase 1 trial will last up to 14 days, with each infant receiving a specified dose of tobramycin solution for inhalation every 12 hours, administered via vibrating mesh nebulizer. The drug dosage (78mg, 150mg, 216mg, or 300mg) will be determined as per the inter-patient dose escalation 3+3 design protocol. During the trial, each infant will undergo blood and tracheal aspirate sampling and respiratory mechanics measurements at pre-specified time points to assess dose safety and potential efficacy. Clinical data will also be recorded daily throughout the trial.</description>
