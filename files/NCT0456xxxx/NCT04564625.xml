    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is an essential hormone involved in bone metabolism, bone mineral density&#xD;
      maintenance, and bone health. Vitamin D deficiency is putatively linked to poor pediatric&#xD;
      orthopedic outcomes [1]. Further, the risk of low vitamin D associated fractures may be&#xD;
      greater in minority pediatric populations [2]. In adults, utility of vitamin D alleles as a&#xD;
      biomarker for bone density and fracture risk has been debated for over 10 years [3-5]. Peak&#xD;
      bone density is achieved at 25 years old; however, most orthopedic trauma patients less than&#xD;
      25 years of age present with substantial vitamin D deficiencies.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Background Vitamin D is an essential hormone involved in bone&#xD;
           metabolism, bone mineral density maintenance, and bone health. Vitamin D deficiency is&#xD;
           putatively linked to poor pediatric orthopedic outcomes [1]. Further, the risk of low&#xD;
           vitamin D associated fractures may be greater in minority pediatric populations [2]. In&#xD;
           adults, utility of vitamin D alleles as a biomarker for bone density and fracture risk&#xD;
           has been debated for over 10 years [3-5]. Peak bone density is achieved at 25 years old;&#xD;
           however, most orthopedic trauma patients less than 25 years of age present with&#xD;
           substantial vitamin D deficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Aim(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Identify the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in young trauma patients with&#xD;
                fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Describe the merits of vitamin D supplementation in healing and long-term outcomes&#xD;
                ≤25 year old trauma patients with fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3. Rationale for the study Occurrence of stress and low energy mechanism fractures&#xD;
           within a population at peak bone density is troubling and suggestive of underlying&#xD;
           pathology. Understanding how to combat vitamin D deficiency, and improve outcomes, is&#xD;
           essential in the development of comprehensive and preventative trauma care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4. Hypothesis 1.4.1. Primary Hypothesis Patients aged ≤25yrs old with fractures will&#xD;
           have low vitamin-D levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OBJECTIVES AND STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES 2.1. Study Objectives 2.1.1. Primary Objective&#xD;
           Determine the frequency of vitamin D deficiency in fracture patients aged less than 25&#xD;
           years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.2. Secondary Objective Report the long-term (one year) outcomes for fracture healing&#xD;
           relative to baseline and therapeutic vitamin D levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Study Outcome Measures 2.2.1. Primary Outcome Vitamin D levels at the time of the&#xD;
           index injury through one year post-operative follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.2. Secondary Outcomes Patient demographics (age, sex, ethnicity), injury&#xD;
           characteristics, lab values, rate of nonunion (i.e., failure of a fractured bone to&#xD;
           heal), admit information, discharge disposition, payer type, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY DESIGN All patients between 18 and 25 years treated for fractures at Methodist&#xD;
           Dallas Medical Center (MDMC) with an index admission vitamin D assessment will be&#xD;
           enrolled. This study will consider any patients with an index admission occurring&#xD;
           between February 2016 and February 2020. No changes to care or intervention will occur&#xD;
           and this study will be conducted completely via chart review. The aim is to identify 100&#xD;
           subjects with a one-year follow-up appointment for their injury to determine the rate of&#xD;
           nonunion and vitamin D levels. As patients receive vitamin D supplementation as standard&#xD;
           of care if index values are low, impact will be assessed through relative deficiency and&#xD;
           clinical outcomes. Data collected from subjects without need for supplementation may be&#xD;
           used to generate a threshold. Patient demographics will be considered as practice&#xD;
           suggests minority patients may be disproportionally affected. The plan to complete the&#xD;
           data collection and analysis by February 2021.&#xD;
