  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of 1068nm NIR trans-cranial&#xD;
      phototherapy upon the cognitive function of healthy individuals between the age of 45 years&#xD;
      and 80 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interested participants will be sent a participant information bundle consisting of the&#xD;
      participant information sheet, consent document, and data collection sheets. One week after&#xD;
      receiving these documents, they will be contacted by a member of the research team to&#xD;
      ascertain if they wish to participate. If the individual wishes to participate in the trial,&#xD;
      an appointment at a mutually convenient time will be made for the volunteer to be seen. The&#xD;
      initial screening interview will be conducted by a trained research assistant. At this&#xD;
      appointment, the research assistant will explain the details of the trial and offer an&#xD;
      opportunity for the volunteer to ask questions. The consent document will then be completed&#xD;
      by the volunteer and countersigned by the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The volunteer will have several days to decide whether they wish to participate in the&#xD;
           trial as they will have received the information pack in the mail previously. The&#xD;
           volunteer would have the option of speaking to the Investigator directly before&#xD;
           enrolling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The volunteer will have an opportunity to ask questions and have any points of concern&#xD;
           clarified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Informed consent will be obtained from the volunteer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The volunteer will be interviewed and a detailed history is taken. Baseline information&#xD;
           regarding the volunteer's circumstance will be gathered, including confirming the MMSE&#xD;
           score is &gt;28 (a score of &lt;28 is an exclusion criterion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The volunteer will be allocated a number and will we offered a choice of appointment&#xD;
           times and will be seen on three separate occasions for assessment of their executive&#xD;
           function and memory. Three tests are necessary to average the day-to-day variation&#xD;
           present in cognitive functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Testing will be rescheduled if the volunteer has a minor intercurrent illness eg. Flu,&#xD;
           minor viral infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. After the third ANAM assessment the volunteer will proceed to receive the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Intervention procedure: Once allocated to either active or placebo group everyone will&#xD;
           be given a trans-cranial intervention device to take home with them. They will be shown&#xD;
           how to use the device, which should be used for 6 minutes twice daily every day of the&#xD;
           week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Telephone contact will be made by a researcher with the participant every 2 weeks&#xD;
           throughout the intervention period to make the following verbal observations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. has there been any change in the health of the participant? b. Are there any problems with&#xD;
      the device? j. After 56 days of twice-daily intervention, the participant will be scheduled&#xD;
      for re-assessment on three separate days. They will continue with the use of the NIR helmet&#xD;
      device until the last assessment is completed.&#xD;

    <masking_description>NIR light is invisible to the human eye, therefore the placebo units will operate in an identical manner to that of the active units.&#xD;
The active and placebo helmets will look identical and their external operation will appear identical, each device will be marked with a code by the manufacturer, there will be no way to identify a device from active or placebo.</masking_description>

The average optical power output of the combined arrays is circa 3.8 Watts, 12mw/sq. cm. The total energy to be delivered to the cranium is 1368J (3.8 x 360) per treatment session.</description>
