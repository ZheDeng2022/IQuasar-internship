  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate sustained clinical remission (for the&#xD;
      definition see below) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving long-term (&gt; 2&#xD;
      years) scheduled treatment with infliximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify predictors of sustained clinical remission during long-term infliximab&#xD;
           scheduled treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify predictors of loose of response during infliximab scheduled maintenance&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify predictors for maintaining clinical remission in patients who discontinue&#xD;
           infliximab because of long-lasting steroid-free clinical remission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate percentage of surgery during and after treatment (total follow-up)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate safety of long-term infliximab scheduled treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      List the clinical hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infliximab is indicated and recommended in moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
      patients who not tolerate or are not responsive to conventional therapies. Most of randomized&#xD;
      clinical trials about the use of infliximab in inflammatory bowel diseases are limited to 52&#xD;
      weeks and very few data come from some observational studies about results of prolonged (over&#xD;
      one year) treatment with infliximab. No validated predictors of sustained clinical remission&#xD;
      or loss of response are available so far. Moreover, few data are available about the&#xD;
      hypothetical reduction of IBD related surgery in the &quot;biological era&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposal we suggest the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  infliximab scheduled treatment may be efficacious in maintain long-term clinical&#xD;
           remission;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  among clinical, laboratory and endoscopic data some predictors of sustained clinical&#xD;
           remission during infliximab long-term scheduled treatment may be found;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  among clinical, laboratory and endoscopic data some predictors of loss of response&#xD;
           during infliximab long-term scheduled treatment may be found;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  among clinical, laboratory and endoscopic data some predictors of sustained clinical&#xD;
           remission after infliximab discontinuation because of long-lasting (&gt; 6 months)&#xD;
           steroid-free clinical remission may be found;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maintenance of remission with infliximab may reduce rates of surgery over time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  long-term scheduled treatment with infliximab may be safe and well tolerated. Results&#xD;
           from this study may really help clinicians to make practical decisions in these&#xD;
           particular clinical settings.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective observational &quot;real life&quot; single-centre study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical records of all IBD patients who continued maintenance treatment with infliximab being&#xD;
      in clinical remission after one year of scheduled therapy (standard induction and maintenance&#xD;
      dose) will be considered eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic, clinical, laboratory and endoscopic data and adverse events will be reported in&#xD;
      a database. In particular, data available for each patient will concern:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sex,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  smoker status,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Montreal classification,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  disease duration,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  activity of disease,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  previous surgery,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  concomitant arthritis,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  concomitant corticosteroids,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  previous or concomitant immunosuppressives,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  eventual infliximab dose escalation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  total number of infliximab infusions,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reason of eventual infliximab discontinuation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  time on infliximab therapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  total follow-up since the first infliximab infusion,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IBD related surgeries,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  endoscopic data within the first year and beyond up to infliximab discontinuation time,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  laboratory data (C-reactive protein and hemoglobin levels),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical remission will be evaluated using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) in Crohn's&#xD;
      patients (HBI ≤ 4) and the partial Mayo score in UC patients (&lt;2 with rectal bleeding&#xD;
      subscore = 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sustained clinical remission will be defined as a HBI ≤ 4 or partial Mayo score &lt; 2 (with&#xD;
      rectal bleeding = 0) after 54 weeks from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline of the study all patients should have already received one year of infliximab&#xD;
      scheduled treatment and should be in clinical remission (as defined above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint will be evaluated at week 54 from baseline (after 2 overall years of&#xD;
      treatment) and then every year during the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be evaluated considering all available data at the end of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      232 IBD (131 CD, 101 UC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All IBD patients treated for at least one year with infliximab because of active luminal&#xD;
      Crohn's disease and active ulcerative colitis will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infliximab administration has been done according to SPC. Due to retrospective and&#xD;
      observational pattern of the study, clinical management of patients depended on practice in&#xD;
      our IBD unit. In particular, patients were clinically evaluated by visits at every infusion&#xD;
      of infliximab. Also laboratory tests were periodically repeated (every two months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No therapeutic changes were made in consideration of the present study. The indications to&#xD;
      start infliximab treatment corresponded to those reported in international guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin&#xD;
      in the Declaration of Helsinki and will be consistent with International Conference on&#xD;
      Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), Good Epidemiological Practices(GEP) and&#xD;
      applicable regulatory requirements taking into account that this is an observational,&#xD;
      non-interventional trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be described using medians with interquartile range (IQR) for continuous data and&#xD;
      percentages for discrete data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kaplan-Maier survival curves will be performed to reveal the variables that may influence&#xD;
      primary and secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare hazard rates in populations defined by one variate at a time, Cox proportional&#xD;
      hazard analysis will, then, be performed with the aim to identify predictors of maintenance&#xD;
      of remission while on IFX treatment and after IFX discontinuation, and predictors of loss of&#xD;
      response during scheduled maintenance therapy with IFX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal variables used for the statistical evaluation will include: sex, age at diagnosis,&#xD;
      disease duration, smoking status, previous surgery, disease location, disease extension,&#xD;
      concomitant arthritis, endoscopic activity (mucosal healing), CRP and hemoglobin levels,&#xD;
      previous immunomodulators, concomitant immunomodulators, need for dose escalation.&#xD;

    <description>Adverse events (AE) will be retrospectively reported in the database following this definition of terms.&#xD;
Per the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), an AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to this medicinal product.&#xD;
Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening; requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing inpatients' hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; and/or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; is a cancer; is associated with an overdose; is another Important Medical Event.</description>
