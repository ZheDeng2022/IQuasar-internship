      This study is a first-in-human (FIH), single-dose, open-label, phase 1 study designed to&#xD;
      assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), distribution, and radiation dosimetry of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Must be diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) with liver metastasis and eligible and&#xD;
             scheduled for resection of liver metastases as part of their standard of care&#xD;
             treatment plan. The planned surgery must occur greater than 14 days after the day of&#xD;
             imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must consent to provide the sponsor with tumor tissue samples from their&#xD;
             resected liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Easter Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are post menopausal, surgically sterile, or agree to practice&#xD;
             effective methods of contraception from the time of signing the informed consent form&#xD;
             through 60 days after the dose of [68Ga]MLN6907 or agree to practice true abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients who agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire&#xD;
             study treatment period and through 4 months after the dose of [68Ga]MLN6907 or agree&#xD;
             to practice true abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study-related&#xD;
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may&#xD;
             be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any serious medical or psychiatric illness, condition, or personal circumstance,&#xD;

             judgment of the investigator or project clinician, might potentially interfere with&#xD;
             the procedures required in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Involvement in an investigative radioactive or other research procedure within 4 weeks&#xD;

             infection (viral, bacterial, or fungal) within 14 days before administration of&#xD;
             [68Ga]MLN6907 or evidence of active infection during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life-threatening illness unrelated to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant central nervous system (CNS) metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known inflammatory bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hepatitis B surface antigen-positive or known or suspected active hepatitis C&#xD;
             infection (testing not required).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any hypersensitivity to any component of [68Ga]MLN6907.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic cardiac disease, including ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery&#xD;
             disease, or arrhythmias, if this would, in the opinion of the investigator or project&#xD;
             clinician, interfere with assessment of efficacy or safety of [68Ga]MLN6907.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Admission or evidence of addictive disorders (eg, illicit drug use, drug abuse, or&#xD;
             alcohol abuse) that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
