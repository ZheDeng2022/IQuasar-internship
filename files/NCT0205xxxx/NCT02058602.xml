  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study to characterise the lung function, airway morphometry, pharyngometry&#xD;
      and inhalation profiles in patients with mild to severe Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)&#xD;
      over a period of up to 6 months. Inhalation profiles will be recorded from patients with IPF&#xD;
      as they inhale during tidal breathing, and following two sets of instructions (maximal effort&#xD;
      and 'long, steady and deep' inhalation), across a range of airflow resistances that reflect&#xD;
      those of typical inhalers used to deliver medication to the lungs. Mouth and throat&#xD;
      dimensions will be measured using an acoustic reflectance Pharyngometer. Measurements of lung&#xD;
      function will be made using conventional sprirometry, plethysmography and diffusion, whilst&#xD;
      Low Dose High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) will be used to scan the airways at two&#xD;
      lung volumes; functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity (TLC). Data from&#xD;
      HRCT will be used to reconstruct airway morphometry, and model inhaled particle deposition&#xD;
      within the lung. Overall, the study allows a further understanding of the IPF patient&#xD;
      population, using the data to assist in the development of new inhaled products for this&#xD;
      disease. Following up the patients with additional HRCT scans at 3 and 6 months will enable&#xD;
      the sensitivity of CT based criteria of disease progression to be compared with lung function&#xD;
      criteria. No investigational product will be used in this study.&#xD;
