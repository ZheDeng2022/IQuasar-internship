  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In modern anesthesia practice, the application of cricoid pressure during intubation is not&#xD;
      infrequently used with the goal of preventing gastric-to-pulmonary aspiration. The evidence&#xD;
      to support this practice is very scarce, and there have recently been many reports in the&#xD;
      literature questioning the safety of cricoid pressure during intubation. Therefore, the goal&#xD;
      of this study will be to randomize those at risk for microaspiration to receive cricoid&#xD;
      pressure versus no cricoid pressure during intubation. We will specifically exclude those&#xD;
      patients thought to be at the highest risk of aspiration (it is considered standard of care&#xD;
      to perform cricoid pressure during intubation of this population). We will include those&#xD;
      patients with some risk factors for aspiration (it is not considered standard of care to&#xD;
      apply cricoid pressure during intubation of this population).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gastric-to-pulmonary aspiration during induction of anesthesia remains a significant risk in&#xD;
      the modern practice of anesthesia.(1) Macroaspiration (grossly visible aspiration) has been&#xD;
      clearly associated with severe pulmonary injury.(1-4) More recently, microaspiration&#xD;
      (aspiration without grossly visible gastric material) has also been associated with&#xD;
      significant morbidity.(2) Specifically, microaspiration has been associated with acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)(5), ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP)(6) and acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure due to bronchoconstriction and ventilation-perfusion mismatching. Pepsin&#xD;
      A has been shown to be a very specific biochemical marker for gastric-to-pulmonary&#xD;
      aspiration.(7) In our previous studies, we demonstrated the rate of microaspiration in normal&#xD;
      elective surgical patients without risk factors for aspiration was 4% as detected by the&#xD;
      ELISA assay for pepsin A.(8) This compared with a rate of 12.5% in patients with risk factors&#xD;
      for microaspiration including obesity, GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and diabetes.&#xD;
      One proposed technique to prevent gastric-to-pulmonary aspiration is cricoid pressure.&#xD;
      Recently, there has been growing evidence which calls into question the effectiveness of&#xD;
      cricoid pressure. Radiologic studies by Smith et al yield indirect evidence to suggest that&#xD;
      cricoid pressure may not reliably occlude the esophagus.(9,10) Currently, cricoid pressure&#xD;
      for patients with risk factors for microaspiration (obesity, GERD and diabetes) is used&#xD;
      commonly but inconsistently.(11) By using the same sampling and analysis techniques employed&#xD;
      in our previous microaspiration studies, the currently proposed study will provide a very&#xD;
      sensitive and specific assessment of the effectiveness of cricoid pressure to prevent&#xD;
      aspiration during elective induction of anesthesia and intubation. Our proposed study would&#xD;
      enroll patients with risk factors for microaspiration who are scheduled to undergo high-risk&#xD;
      (for pulmonary complications) elective surgery requiring endotracheal intubation. We will&#xD;
      exclude those with risk factors for macroaspiration (including bowel obstruction, non-fasting&#xD;
      status and esophageal pathology associated with increased risk for macroaspiration such as&#xD;
      achalasia and hiatal hernia), because cricoid pressure remains the standard of care for those&#xD;
      at risk for macroaspiration at our institution. Those patients enrolled will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive cricoid pressure versus no cricoid pressure. Immediately following elective&#xD;
      intubation, a sample of tracheal secretions from each patient will be obtained and the pepsin&#xD;
      A concentration determined. The primary outcome will be the rate of microaspiration&#xD;
      determined by the presence of pepsin A in the trachea. Secondary outcomes of interest will be&#xD;
      rates of postoperative pulmonary complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome&#xD;
      (ARDS) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The findings of this study will provide the&#xD;
      most direct evidence yet regarding the effectiveness of cricoid pressure for the prevention&#xD;
      of gastric-to-pulmonary aspiration during induction of anesthesia and endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation. Ultimately, the findings of this study will improve patient safety by providing&#xD;
      accurate prospective evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of cricoid pressure in&#xD;
      this setting, and will further explore the clinical significance of microaspiration.&#xD;
