  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of Crohn Disease (CD) is unknown, but there is evidence show that the&#xD;
      inadequate immune response or overreaction of the immune system against food antigens or&#xD;
      components of the commensal flora involve it. Corticosteroid therapy is effective for adult&#xD;
      patients with CD, but it has side effects and can't promote mucosal healing. In recent years,&#xD;
      Enteral nutrition (EN) is becoming primary therapy in induction and maintenance remission of&#xD;
      CD, especially in children. But the mechanism of EN in induction and maintenance remission of&#xD;
      CD is still unclear, and parts of patient have good clinical response to EN therapy while&#xD;
      other don't. So we design the study to explore whether EN treats CD by effecting intestinal&#xD;
      flora and whether the intestinal flora of patient with CD relates with clinical response.&#xD;
