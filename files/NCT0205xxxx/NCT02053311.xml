    <textblock>
      The main object of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III&#xD;
      trial is to assess impact of maintenance of orteronel on disease progression and hence on&#xD;
      quality of life of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer pretreated&#xD;
      with novel hormonal agents who have non-progressive disease after chemotherapy with a taxane.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      One in six men will be diagnosed with cancer of the prostate during his lifetime.&#xD;
      Accordingly, prostate cancer is the most common cancer amongst men in the western world. In&#xD;
      Switzerland approx. 5'400 men are diagnosed with the disease and 1'300 die of prostate cancer&#xD;
      every year. Prostate cancer represents 30% of all cancer diagnoses in men. Despite earlier&#xD;
      detection and new treatments the life time risk to die of prostate cancer has remained stable&#xD;
      at 3% since 1980.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (with progression on antihormonal therapy)&#xD;
      the primary standard therapy for a long time consisted of chemotherapy with docetaxel. It was&#xD;
      recently shown that treatment with the novel androgen synthesis blocker, abiraterone (Zytiga)&#xD;
      before chemotherapy can prolong survival. Abiraterone belongs to a group of agents that very&#xD;
      effectively inhibits the androgen synthesis via blockade of the key enzyme cytochrome&#xD;
      P-450c17 (CYP17).Similar results have been reported for the new androgen antagonist&#xD;
      enzalutamide (Xtandi). Today, therefore, many patients with metastatic castration-resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer (mCRPC) first receive therapy with abiraterone or enzalutamide. After this,&#xD;
      chemotherapy with docetaxel (Taxotere) or cabazitaxel (Jevtana) is usually administered if&#xD;
      there is any further progression of the disease. After the end of chemotherapy, the patient&#xD;
      is regularly checked and, in the event of disease progression, further treatments may be&#xD;
      given. These could consist of renewed hormonal therapy or chemotherapy with cabazitaxel.&#xD;
      Besides abiraterone, the medicine orteronel also acts by blocking testosterone production via&#xD;
      the key enzyme CYP17. By selectively inhibiting the extragonadal synthesis of androgens in&#xD;
      either the adrenal cortex or in prostate tumor cells, orteronel, a selective non-steroidal&#xD;
      CYP17 inhibitor, may represent a new therapeutic option for patients with CRPC. Initial&#xD;
      results have shown that orteronel effectively inhibits testosterone synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since various new options are available for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
      at present, this raises the question as to the order in which these treatments should best be&#xD;
      given. Initial results show that cross-resistance could develop between the new kinds of&#xD;
      hormone therapy abiraterone and enzalutamide. There is evidence to suggest that any&#xD;
      resistance to hormone treatments could be reversible as a result of prior treatment with&#xD;
      chemotherapy. This study is designed to investigate this approach. It is also intended to&#xD;
      investigate whether early use of the well-tolerated testosterone synthesis blocker orteronel&#xD;
      in patients with mCRPC leads to an increase in the time to the progression of disease. Trials&#xD;
      examining other advanced malignant diseases such as lung cancer have shown that initiating an&#xD;
      effective treatment earlier in the disease course at the end of a first-line chemotherapy (so&#xD;
      called switch maintenance therapy) is beneficial in terms of progression free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      but also overall survival (OS). This may also hold true for early administration of&#xD;
      antihormonal agents in patients with mCRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have already received a novel hormonal therapy followed by chemotherapy with a&#xD;
      taxane and have experienced a stabilization of disease on this regimen are included in the&#xD;
      study. It is also intended to test whether this treatment has a positive influence on the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this trial is to test the hypothesis that using orteronel treatment immediately&#xD;
      after cessation of chemotherapy with a taxane can prolong event-free survival (EFS),&#xD;
      consequently maintains a good quality of life (QL) and could eventually also improve overall&#xD;
      survival for the group of patients pretreated with novel hormonal agents.&#xD;
