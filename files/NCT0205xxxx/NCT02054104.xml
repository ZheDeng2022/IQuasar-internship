  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During recent years, cancer-testis (CT) antigens (CTA), particularly those encoded by genes&#xD;
      on the X chromosome (CT-X genes), have emerged as attractive targets for cancer&#xD;
      immunotherapy. Whereas malignancies of diverse histologies express a variety of CTAs, immune&#xD;
      responses to these proteins appear uncommon in cancer patients, possibly due to low-level,&#xD;
      heterogeneous antigen expression, as well as immunosuppressive regulatory T cells present&#xD;
      within tumor sites and systemic circulation of these individuals. Conceivably, vaccination of&#xD;
      cancer patients with tumor cells expressing high levels of CTAs in combination with regimens&#xD;
      that deplete or inhibit T regulatory cells will induce broad immunity to these antigens. In&#xD;
      order to examine this issue, patients with primary lung and esophageal cancers, pleural&#xD;
      mesotheliomas, thoracic sarcomas, thymic neoplasms and mediastinal germ cell tumors, as well&#xD;
      as sarcomas, melanomas, germ cell tumors, or epithelial malignancies metastatic to lungs,&#xD;
      pleura or mediastinum with no evidence of disease (NED) or minimal residual disease (MRD)&#xD;
      following standard multidisciplinary therapy will be vaccinated with H1299 tumor cell lysates&#xD;
      with Iscomatrix adjuvant. Vaccines will be administered with or without metronomic oral&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide (50 mg PO BID x 7d q 14d), and celecoxib (400 mg PO BID). Serologic&#xD;
      responses to a variety of recombinant CTAs as well as immunologic responses to autologous&#xD;
      tumor or epigenetically modified autologous EBVtransformed lymphocytes will be assessed&#xD;
      before and after a six month vaccination period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To assess the frequency of immunologic responses to CTAs in patients with thoracic&#xD;
      malignancies following vaccinations with H1299 cell lysate/Iscomatrix(TM) vaccines alone in&#xD;
      comparison to patients with thoracic malignancies following vaccinations with H1299 cell&#xD;
      lysate/Iscomatrix vaccines in combination with metronomic cyclophosphamide and celecoxib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine if oral metronomic cyclophosphamide and celecoxib therapy diminishes the&#xD;
           number and percentage of T regulatory cells and diminishes activity of these cells in&#xD;
           patients with thoracic malignancies are at risk of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine if H1299 cell lysate/Iscomatrix(TM) vaccination enhances immunologic response&#xD;
           to autologous tumor or epigenetically modified autologous EBV-transformed lymphocytes (B&#xD;
           cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically or cytologically proven small cell or non-small cell lung&#xD;
           cancer (SCLC;NSCLC), esophageal cancer (EsC), malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) ,&#xD;
           thymic or mediastinal germ cell tumors, thoracic sarcomas, or melanomas, sarcomas, or&#xD;
           epithelial malignancies metastatic to lungs, pleura or mediastinum who have no clinical&#xD;
           evidence of active disease (NED), or minimal residual disease (MRD) not readily&#xD;
           accessible by non-invasive biopsy or resection/radiation following standard therapy&#xD;
           completed within the past 26 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status of 0 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow, kidney, liver, lung and cardiac function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may not be on systemic immunosuppressive medications at time vaccinations&#xD;
           commence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following recovery from surgery, chemotherapy, or chemo/XRT, patients with NED or MRD&#xD;
           will be vaccinated via IM injection with H1299 cell lysates and Iscomatrix(TM) adjuvant&#xD;
           monthly for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccines will be administered with or without with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
           celecoxib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic toxicities and immunologic response to therapy will be recorded. Pre and post&#xD;
           vaccination serologic and cell mediated responses to a standard panel of CT antigens as&#xD;
           well as autologous tumor cells (if available) and EBV-transformed lymphocytes will be&#xD;
           assessed before and after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Numbers/percentages and function of T regulatory cells in peripheral blood will be&#xD;
           assessed before, during, and after vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be followed in the clinic with routine staging scans until disease&#xD;
           recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The trial will randomize 28 evaluable patients per arm to either receive vaccine alone&#xD;
           or vaccine plus chemotherapy in order to have 80% power to determine if the frequency of&#xD;
           immune responses on the combination arm exceeds that of the vaccine alone arm, if the&#xD;
           expected frequencies of immune responses on the two arms were 20% and 50%, using a&#xD;
           one-sided 0.10 alpha level Fisher s exact test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 60 patients will be accrued to this trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are initially rendered NED or have MRD following standard therapy but&#xD;
             exhibit disease progression prior to initiation of vaccination will be excluded from&#xD;
