  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracerebral hemorrhage is bleeding into the brain and is a major cause of stroke and other&#xD;
      complications. Brain injury from intracerebral hemorrhage occurs in two phases. The early&#xD;
      phase involves the mechanical compression of brain tissue by the expanding hematoma. In a&#xD;
      later phase, brain swelling develops causing further compression that may lead to brain&#xD;
      herniation and death. This study investigates the neuroprotective role of haptoglobin, in&#xD;
      minimizing the development of brain swelling following intracerebral hemorrhage.&#xD;

      Intracerebral hemorrhage is bleeding into the brain parenchyma. It is a major cause of&#xD;
      stroke, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Brain injury from&#xD;
      intracerebral hemorrhage occurs in two phases. The early phase involves the mechanical&#xD;
      compression of brain tissue by the expanding hematoma. In a later phase, brain edema,&#xD;
      especially perihematomal edema, develops causing further compression that may lead to brain&#xD;
      herniation and death. Several factors are implicated in the development of brain edema,&#xD;
      including inflammation resulting from the oxidative stress caused by iron-rich hemoglobin&#xD;
      released from lysed erythrocytes in brain tissue. This study investigates the neuroprotective&#xD;
      role of an acute phase reactant, haptoglobin, in minimizing the development of perihematomal&#xD;
      edema following intracerebral hemorrhage. This protein protects brain tissue from hemoglobin&#xD;
      degradation products by forming haptoglobin-hemoglobin complexes that are subsequently&#xD;
      cleared by the spleen. Notably, different alleles of haptoglobin exist in humans, with&#xD;
      varying affinities for hemoglobin. Investigating the association between the different&#xD;
      alleles and the degree of perihematomal edema formation is the primary goal of this study.&#xD;
      The investigators will also look at a marker of inflammation, matrix metalloproteinases, and&#xD;
      analyze its level of expression in subjects with different alleles of haptoglobin.&#xD;
