      Abstract The administration of an antibiotic preoperatively is an important intervention that&#xD;
      helps to reduce the risk of post-operative health-care associated infections (HCAI). These&#xD;
      include urinary tract, surgical site and blood stream infection. Based on the current&#xD;
      Surgical Infection Prevention Project, (SCIP) recommendations, the choice of the antibiotic&#xD;
      is based on the nature and site of the surgery and the presence of a β-lactam allergy (Table&#xD;
      1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the antibiotic treatment for preventing surgical infections is administered as a&#xD;
      single bolus an hour before surgery, and every four hours after the initial dose. This&#xD;
      presents a concentration profile that has a high concentration after the bolus, but decays as&#xD;
      the kidneys remove the antibiotics. In this present study, investigators would like to&#xD;
      compare this traditional method of delivery to a constant infusion model that would sustain a&#xD;
      constant level of antibiotics that is defined by the difference between the rate of infusion&#xD;
      and rate of clearance.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The current incidence of post-operative surgical infections varies between 6% for patients&#xD;
      undergoing non-cardiac surgery to greater than 30% in high-risk surgery. 1 The administration&#xD;
      of an antibiotic preoperatively is an important intervention that helps to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      post-operative health-care associated infections (HCAI). These include urinary tract,&#xD;
      surgical site and blood stream infection. Based on the current Surgical Infection Prevention&#xD;
      Project, (SCIP) recommendations, the choice of the antibiotic is based on the nature and site&#xD;
      of the surgery and the presence of a β-lactam allergy (Table 2). The antibiotic of choice for&#xD;
      perioperative prophylaxis remains first and second generation cephalosporin. These drugs have&#xD;
      a broad range of antimicrobial activity against common skin pathogens and have an excellent&#xD;
      safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on current recommendations, the cephalosporin is administered 1 hour prior to&#xD;
      incision.1 Timing is critical, as both early and late administration of the antibiotic is&#xD;
      associated with an increase risk of HCAI. Additional doses of the cephalosporin are&#xD;
      administered at pre-set intervals based on the duration of the surgery in an attempt to&#xD;
      maintain antibiotic concentrations at a desired level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics can be classified into two broad classes, based on their bacterial killing&#xD;
      characteristics. Antibiotics with concentration-dependent killing characteristics require a&#xD;
      high ratio between the peak concentration and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of&#xD;
      the pathogen, during the dosing interval. Therefore large infrequent doses of these&#xD;
      antibiotics will result in optimal antibacterial activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast β-lactam antibiotics, like cephalosporins, demonstrate time-dependent&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics. This means that effective microbiological activity only occurs if the&#xD;
      unbound (or free) plasma concentration of the drug is above the MIC for a specified time&#xD;
      period. In infection models, bacteriostatic and bacteriocidical activity occurs when&#xD;
      antibiotic concentrations are maintained above the MIC for 35-40% and 60-70% of the dosing&#xD;
      interval respectively. However, in surgical prophylaxis, it is preferred that antibiotic&#xD;
      concentrations are maintained above the MIC of the likely pathogen/s for the entire duration&#xD;
      of the procedure. Therefore more frequent dosing or use of extended or continuous infusion of&#xD;
      these drugs will better maintain the pharmacokinetic goals. Recent studies have shown that&#xD;
      plasma levels of β-lactam antibiotics fall below the MIC 1-2 hours after the initial bolus&#xD;
      dose in both normal and obese patients.2, 3 Even with appropriate re-dosing of the β-lactam&#xD;
      antibiotic, there are times when the plasma concentration of the drug is below the MIC. The&#xD;
      combination of sub-MIC plasma drug level and high bacteremic load can potentially increase&#xD;
      the risk of developing a post-operative HCAI. It follows that to effectively prevent&#xD;
      microbiological activity in the perioperative period the β-lactam antibiotic must remain&#xD;
      above the MIC during the entire operative period. This is of particular importance in&#xD;
      patients undergoing major abdominal surgery where the risk of perioperative surgical site&#xD;
      infection (including superficial, deep and organ specific infection) is 13.1%. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics of bolus and continuous cefazolin infusion&#xD;
      during major abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be Tested Hypothesis A continuous infusion of cefazolin maintains the unbound&#xD;
      plasma concentration above Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) for the duration of the&#xD;
      operative procedure better than the traditional bolus administration at every four hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Compare the pharmacokinetics of a bolus versus continuous cefazolin (Ansef) infusion in&#xD;
      major surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Preliminary studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 studies in the abdominal surgery population. The study by Troconiz et al studies&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of a bolus dose of cefoxitin.3 The study by Suffoleta studied a&#xD;
      postoperative continuous infusion in the postoperative colorectal group.4&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Experimental design and methods (including data analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent for the study will be obtained in the PETC (Pre-anesthesia Clinic) prior to&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction and maintenance of anesthesia will be at the discretion of the attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. Intraoperative analgesia will be provided at the discretion of the&#xD;
      attending anesthesiologist and may include intravenous narcotics and/or intrathecal morphine.&#xD;
