    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests that vitamin D may be directly or indirectly a co-factor for the efficacy&#xD;
      of Hepatitis C virus, (HCV), antiviral therapies. The level of vitamin D necessary for&#xD;
      optimum immune function is ill defined and many of those with HCV infection in Scotland are&#xD;
      below these levels. Vitamin D is a cheap and safe medication, so its addition to anti-viral&#xD;
      therapy should be highly cost-effective even if only a modest increase in SVR was achieved.&#xD;
      Given the Scottish HCV epidemic, the world leading government response to it and the&#xD;
      nationally low vitamin D levels, Scotland is perfectly placed to answer this question.&#xD;
      Therefore the investigators hypothesize that vitamin D supplementation will improve SVR and&#xD;
      propose a randomised controlled trial to test this hypothesis. The anticipated end of study&#xD;
      date for this study is April 2015&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C is a major health problem for Scotland with greater than 1% of the population&#xD;
      infected; the Scottish Government has recognised this and mounted the Hepatitis C action&#xD;
      plan, recognised as the world leading public health response to the epidemic. The key aim of&#xD;
      this is to expand treatment access and numbers of patients cured of HCV infection to prevent&#xD;
      patients developing the complications of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The success of treatment for HCV depends on genotype and is measured by the Sustained Viral&#xD;
      Response (SVR). The SVR is the absence of virus 24 weeks after end of treatment and has been&#xD;
      shown to be a cure of infection. The FDA has recently suggested SVR can be assessed at 12&#xD;
      weeks, in clinical trials. Scotland has an equal mix of genotype 1 &amp; 3 HCV infection&#xD;
      accounting for greater than 95% of those infected. Treatment involves Pegylated Interferon&#xD;
      injections weekly and Ribavirin twice daily for 6 months for HCV genotype 3 infection, with&#xD;
      an SVR of 70%. For genotype 1 infection treatment is with the above dual therapy with the&#xD;
      addition of a protease inhibitor, for treatment duration of 6-12 months leading to SVR rates&#xD;
      of 65-70%. There are an increasing number of new pharmacological products in advanced&#xD;
      development that will be available for clinicians to use but these, as well as increasing&#xD;
      efficacy, will increase cost. So it requires clinicians to make treatment as effective as&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D has traditionally been associated with bone health, with definite deficiency&#xD;
      causing osteomalacia and making a contribution to osteoporosis. The traditional, currently&#xD;
      used normal ranges for Vitamin D are based on prevention of bone diseases. Recently and&#xD;
      controversially it has been suggested that low normal levels of vitamin D are associated with&#xD;
      multiple other disease states, including cancer, infection and cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      Additionally it has been suggested that many of the normal population in Scotland are vitamin&#xD;
      D deficient. Other studies have shown that drug users, a high risk group for HCV infection&#xD;
      have similarly deficient levels of vitamin D. Studies have suggested that up to 92% of those&#xD;
      with chronic liver disease have vitamin D levels below that deemed acceptable physiologically&#xD;
      to maintain health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some data is now available to support the role of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment&#xD;
      of hepatitis C and improving SVR rates. Several observational studies have found an&#xD;
      association between low vitamin D levels and reduced SVR rates, and additionally one study&#xD;
      has shown an association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in vitamin D binding&#xD;
      protein and treatment response. A small Israeli trial of vitamin D supplementation in HCV&#xD;
      treatment has shown increased SVRs in those supplemented, but the study had a number of flaws&#xD;
      including a failure of randomisation(13). Additionally there have been an abstract and a&#xD;
      letter report of improved outcome with a vitamin D intervention . Biological mechanisms of&#xD;
      interaction between vitamin D and the immune system have been explored. It has been shown&#xD;
      that Vitamin D plays a role in the regulation of innate immunity, macrophage function, and&#xD;
      cell mediated immunity Vitamin D receptors (VDR) are also expressed on many effector cells of&#xD;
      the immune system; activated T and B cells, macrophages and monocytes which act to increase&#xD;
      to enhance phagocytic action and interferon activity , it has also been suggested vitamin D&#xD;
      has a direct effect on HCV. These give a biological basis for the effect of vitamin D on the&#xD;
      success of antiviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised controlled trial, to be successful, requires recruitment and retention of&#xD;
      subjects in the trial. HCV infection is associated with chaotic lifestyles which might impair&#xD;
      the rate of recruitment and retention, although the Scottish HCV clinical database audit&#xD;
      clearly shows that, with all comers, routine HCV care in Scotland matches the results from&#xD;
      the randomised clinical trials. This pilot study will also help determine the recruitment and&#xD;
      retention rates for a larger trial in this population.&#xD;
