  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research trial that seeks to break up the total radiation dose into multiple&#xD;
      smaller radiation treatments, termed fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (FSRS) which may&#xD;
      make the treatment feasible. Fractionated sterotatcic radiation, the risks of FSRS, and&#xD;
      possible costs will be described later in this document. This clinical trial is for people&#xD;
      who have had no prior whole brain radiation.&#xD;

    <description>The proportion patients experiencing DLT at each dose; toxicities will be tabulated by category and grade. The dose-toxicity function, describing the probability of DLT at each dose, will be estimated using logistic regression, along with likelihood ratio profile confidence intervals.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Local control of disease</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The probability of local control at each dose, will be estimated using logistic regression, along with likelihood ratio profile confidence intervals. Local control is defined as stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) in the target lesion, per RECIST v1.1. Complete Response (CR): the disappearance of a target lesion. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.&#xD;
2. Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Regional intracranial failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of patients having local failure (progressive disease (PD)) within the target lesion. Per RECIST v1.1: Progressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).</description>

    <measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Brain (FACT-Br)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 30 days post treatment, 8 -12 weeks post treatment, and at time of each follow-up; Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Brain (FACT-Br) is a 50 item, self-administered questionnaire used to assess Quality of Life, including, Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, and Functional Well-Being. The assessment takes 10-15 minutes to completed and is scored using a 5 point Likert-type scale. Scores range from 0-250, with higher scores indicating better Quality of Life.</description>
