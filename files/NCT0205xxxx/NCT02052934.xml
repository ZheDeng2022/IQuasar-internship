      A Phase 1 dose escalating study of ETEC candidate vaccine to determine safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a multi-dose regimen in healthy adult volunteers. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). The primary objectives&#xD;
      assess the safety and tolerability of dmLT vaccine when administered in three doses&#xD;
      sublingually over a range of dosages in healthy adult subjects. The secondary objectives&#xD;
      assess long-term safety follow-up from immunization through Month 7 post vaccination,&#xD;
      following three SL doses of dmLT vaccine over a range of dosages and comparing with three&#xD;
      doses of a comparable dosage of oral vaccine. The study subject population is 52 healthy&#xD;
      adult male and female subjects, ages 18 to 45. Subject participation duration is&#xD;
      approximately 8 months with study duration of approximately 1.5-2 years, including 6-7 months&#xD;
      of follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the public health burden of Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) on travelers,&#xD;
      deployed soldiers and, most significantly, young children in the developing world, there is&#xD;
      no licensed vaccine against ETEC enteritis.This is a Phase 1 study in healthy adults to&#xD;
      determine the safety and immunogenicity of an ETEC candidate vaccine, attenuated recombinant&#xD;
      dmLT from ETEC, administered by the SL (Sublingual) or Oral Immunization. The study subject&#xD;
      population is 52 healthy adult male and female subjects, ages 18 to 45. Subject participation&#xD;
      duration is approximately 8 months with study duration of approximately 1.5-2 years,&#xD;
      including 6-7 months of follow-up. Potential risks include subjects could develop varying&#xD;
      degrees of diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms (such as nausea, abdominal pain or&#xD;
      cramping, gas, and decreased appetite). Blood drawing may be associated with pain and&#xD;
      bruising at the site and rarely, with fainting or seizure. There is no direct benefit to&#xD;
      subjects from participating in this study but the potential benefits to children and adults&#xD;
      who may receive a future beneficial vaccine based on the results of this trial justify the&#xD;
      more than minimal risk of the subjects who will participate in this trial. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of dmLT vaccine when administered in three&#xD;
      doses sublingually over a range of dosages in healthy adult subjects. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to assess long-term safety follow-up from immunization through Month 7 post&#xD;
      vaccination, and following three SL doses of dmLT vaccine over a range of dosages and&#xD;
      comparing with three doses of a comparable dosage of oral vaccine.&#xD;
