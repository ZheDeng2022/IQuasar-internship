    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to assess NCF after early HA-PCI concomitant to the&#xD;
      second cycle of CHT and to tRT for patients with LD SCLC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 15% of all lung cancers are small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is a high-grade,&#xD;
      neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung. Limited disease (LD) SCLC is confined to the hemithorax&#xD;
      of origin, the mediastinum, or the supraclavicular nodes, which can be encompassed within a&#xD;
      tolerable radiation therapy port. About 30% of all SCLC are LD at diagnosis. The median&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) in LD SCLC is approximately 20 months, with an expected 5-year survival&#xD;
      of less than 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCLC is characterized by rapid growth and early dissemination. The standard treatment of LD&#xD;
      SCLC involves multimodality therapy with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy (tRT) and&#xD;
      chemotherapy (CHT) with cisplatin and etoposide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrence in the brain is usually the primary site of treatment failure in SCLC and is&#xD;
      associated with significant morbidity; and consequently often the cause of death. Occult&#xD;
      early dissemination of SCLC has frequently occurred prior to the time of diagnosis. In&#xD;
      patients with brain metastasis two randomized trials showed an overall 5-year rate of brain&#xD;
      metastasis of 59% without prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) compared to 43% with PCI.&#xD;
      However the rate of brain metastasis with PCI is still very high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 50% of patients with SCLC will develop brain metastases some time during the course of&#xD;
      their disease. Therefore PCI is recommended in case of good response to CHT and tRT. PCI has&#xD;
      shown to improve overall survival in patients with LD who have achieved a complete or partial&#xD;
      remission after initial chemoradiotherapy. CHT might achieve insufficient drug levels in the&#xD;
      brain. Therefore, an up-front PCI could treat occult brain metastases at a preclinical state&#xD;
      and may increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier for CHT products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When evaluating PCI it is important to weigh the reduced incidence of brain metastases&#xD;
      against the potential risk of deficits resulting from the treatment itself, including&#xD;
      deteriorations in neurocognitive functions (NCF) or quality of life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A possibility to reduce long-term neurocognitive effects due to PCI is the sparing of the&#xD;
      hippocampus. Recent technological advancements in radiation oncology delivery enable the&#xD;
      avoidance of the hippocampus. A PCI with hippocampus avoidance (HA-PCI) can reduce memory&#xD;
      loss due to radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective neurocognitive testing has been increasingly used in trials for patients with CNS&#xD;
      tumors and in patients with brain metastases in order to determine the risks versus benefits&#xD;
      of different treatment approaches. For this trial, the choice for NCF assessments follows the&#xD;
      recommendation provided by Meyers and Brown (2006). This neurocognitive battery for the use&#xD;
      in multinational drug trials with neurocognitive endpoints consists of four standardized&#xD;
      psychometric instruments, i.e. the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, the Controlled Oral Word&#xD;
      Association Test (COWAT) and the Trail Making Part A and Part B (TMT A/B). These tests have&#xD;
      been shown to be sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of cancer treatment in clinical trials&#xD;
      and cover several cognitive functions (memory, verbal fluency, visual-motor speed, executive&#xD;
      function). In addition, published normative data are available that take into account age,&#xD;
      and where appropriate, education and sex. To minimize the effects of repeated administration&#xD;
      alternate forms can be used and test administration is highly standardized. The same battery&#xD;
      of tests has been used in trials conducted by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)&#xD;
      (e.g. Wolfson 2011), and one or several of these three tests were applied in most of the&#xD;
      studies mentioned above. Using the same tests across trials is important in order to be able&#xD;
      to compare results of different trials. It has been shown that performing a cognitive test&#xD;
      battery consisting of five cognitive tests (and a QoL assessment) in a multi-site trial and&#xD;
      cooperative group setting (i.e. a RTOG trial) in patients with brain metastases is feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NCF can be affected by a number of factors such as the volume of brain metastases, disease&#xD;
      progression, other treatments (e.g. surgery, chemo- or endocrine therapy), medications and&#xD;
      psychological factors such as anxiety and distress. These factors should be considered when&#xD;
      evaluating the actual neurocognitive effect of concomitant CHT, tRT and PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for performing the trial PCI is part of the standard treatment of LD SCLC as the&#xD;
      rate of developing brain metastases is very high and PCI has shown to increase overall&#xD;
      survival. PCI is given to patients presenting a good response to CHT and tRT. However the&#xD;
      overall 5-year rate of brain metastasis with PCI is still very high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As long as safety data are lacking on PCI administered concurrently with CHT and tRT, PCI is&#xD;
      given after the end of CHT in the clinical practice. Therefore the aim of this phase II trial&#xD;
      is to evaluate to what extent early HA-PCI given concomitant to CHT and tRT impairs NCF and&#xD;
      whether this neurotoxicity can be considered acceptable to evaluate this question in a phase&#xD;
      III trial.&#xD;
