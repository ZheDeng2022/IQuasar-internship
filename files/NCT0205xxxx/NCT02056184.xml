  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether therapy modifications (including addition&#xD;
      of ultrasound-guided treatment change) can change imaging results in patients with early&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis in a stable clinical disease activity state.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. It is a condition&#xD;
      where the body's joints become swollen and damaged. Currently, the approach used to manage&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis is the so-called 'Treat to Target' approach. The aim of this approach to&#xD;
      treatment is to achieve the absence of signs and symptoms, or best possible state of low&#xD;
      disease activity. It requires the use of frequent routine clinical assessments to help&#xD;
      determine what treatment to use. Ultrasound imaging (using sound waves to take images of the&#xD;
      joints and surrounding tissues) has been shown to be better than standard clinical&#xD;
      measurements in detecting disease activity. Doctors are already using ultrasound imaging as&#xD;
      part of their decisionmaking, in terms of diagnosis and altering treatments, but it is has&#xD;
      not been clearly shown if this is associated with a better control of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly put into 1 of 2 treatment groups (standard treatment group or&#xD;
      the imaging group). All patients will also undergo the ultrasound assessment. In the standard&#xD;
      treatment arm, the doctor will not know the ultrasound result and will base treatment on the&#xD;
      routine disease activity score alone. In the imaging group, doctors will use routine clinical&#xD;
      disease activity score plus the ultrasound result to make decisions on which treatment is&#xD;
      given and treatment will be increased if necessary. However, for patients in the imaging&#xD;
      group, even if their rheumatoid arthritis remains stable as judged by the disease activity&#xD;
      score, treatment will be increased based on signs of active disease on the ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 2 years. During the study participants will be required to attend&#xD;
      8 clinic visits. Approximately 400 patients from a number of countries in Europe and Japan&#xD;
      are expected to take part in the study.&#xD;
