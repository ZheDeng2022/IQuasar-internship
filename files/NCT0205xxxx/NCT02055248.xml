  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Moebius syndrome limits the ability to make facial expressions like smile, frown or blink -&#xD;
      and move the eyes laterally. It can also cause speech, swallowing or breathing difficulties&#xD;
      and affect parts of the body, such as the limbs, jaw, muscles, or the heart. Some individuals&#xD;
      with Moebius can have intellectual impairment or behavior problems. Researchers want to study&#xD;
      the clinical features of individuals with Moebius or related disorders and explore the&#xD;
      genetic and/or environmental causes of these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn more about the genetics and clinical characteristics of Moebius syndrome and other&#xD;
      Congenital Facial Weakness disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People ages 2 to 80 years with congenital facial weakness, isolated or combined with other&#xD;
      congenital anomalies, and their family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with Moebius syndrome or other congenital facial weakness disorder will be&#xD;
           evaluated at the NIH Clinical Research Center over 3 to 5 days and undergo the following&#xD;
           procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and family history and physical examination, including body measurements and&#xD;
           vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood or saliva will be collected for genetic tests and to evaluate liver, kidney, heart&#xD;
           and hormonal&#xD;
&#xD;
      functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination, including having a video taken of their eyes moving.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hearing evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Speech and language assessment, including swallowing studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dental exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detailed neurological evaluation, including electromyogram/nerve conduction and blink&#xD;
           reflex study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rehabilitation medicine evaluation, including muscle and tongue strength testing and&#xD;
           assessment of balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurocognitive and behavioral testing and questionnaires to assess quality of life and&#xD;
           copying mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging studies of their head, by magnetic resonance and diffusion tensor imaging&#xD;
           -MRI/DTI. Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      will lie on a table that slides into a metal cylinder that takes images of internal body&#xD;
      structures using&#xD;
&#xD;
      magnets. Child participants may be sedated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some adults may have additional X-rays of their head or limbs, if there are abnormal&#xD;
           findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical photographs of the face and affected body parts may be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other specialized tests or consultations, as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants can choose to have a skin biopsy taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A follow-up visit will be offered to participants for review of genetic test findings&#xD;
           and possibly additional clinical tests, as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family members of the patients will have a medical and family history and physical&#xD;
      examination. Blood or saliva will be obtained for genetic studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a natural history study with a cross-sectional design of Moebius syndrome (MIM&#xD;
      157900), a heterogeneous developmental disorder defined as a congenital, non-progressive&#xD;
      facial weakness with limited abduction of one or both eyes, often associated with additional&#xD;
      features such as other cranial nerve dysfunction, craniofacial, skeletal and limb&#xD;
      deformities, as well as intellectual or behavioral impairments. In this study we will attempt&#xD;
      to characterize the clinical phenotype of Moebius and associated congenital facial weakness&#xD;
      syndromes, collect thorough information on possible prenatal environmental exposures and use&#xD;
      genetic studies, including whole exome sequencing, on DNA from patients and family members of&#xD;
      patients to identify disease-causing genes. We will also conduct brain magnetic resonance-&#xD;
      and diffusion tensor imaging- studies in these patients in order to explore brainstem and&#xD;
      cranial nerve structure and associated white matter tract anomalies. Through this combined&#xD;
      clinical, molecular and imaging approach, we anticipate that phenotype-genotype correlations&#xD;
      will be revealed. These results will lead to new insights into the clinical definition of&#xD;
      these conditions, molecular pathways, and potential networks involved in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      facial weakness and associated multisystem dysmorphogenesis. Our population will consist of&#xD;
      patients, ages 2 to 80 years, inclusive of any gender, race, or ethnic group, with congenital&#xD;
      facial palsy, isolated or combined with other congenital anomalies, and their families. We&#xD;
      will continue to recruit approximately 24 probands each year, ages 2 to 80 years, inclusive&#xD;
      of any gender, race, or ethnic group, and their parents and unaffected family members for a&#xD;
      total of 72 patients/families. In most cases, patients will be referred through the Moebius&#xD;
      Syndrome Foundation, a patient organization with a current membership of 2000 people in its&#xD;
      database, 1400 of whom have been diagnosed with Moebius syndrome. Outcome measures will&#xD;
      include the results from a battery of clinical evaluations, including ophthalmology,&#xD;
      audiology, neurology, psychiatry, and rehabilitative medicine. Patients will also undergo&#xD;
      neurocognitive and autism screening assessments, electromyography/nerve conduction, and blink&#xD;
      reflex studies. Imaging and genetic studies will provide the most robust data for analysis in&#xD;
      this study. A skin biopsy may be performed on some patients in order to culture fibroblasts&#xD;
      for additional biochemical, cell biological, and molecular analyses.&#xD;

    <description>Employ genetic studies, including comparative genomic hybridization, candidate gene testing and/or whole exome and genome sequencing to study the molecular bases underlying these syndromes. Our hypothesis is that disease-causing mutations will be present in the proteincoding regions of the genome, as germline or somatic mutations.
