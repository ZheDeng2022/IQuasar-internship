      The purpose of this project is to compare the effectiveness of Johrei therapy (JT) and&#xD;
      Cognitive-behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) in the treatment of sleep disturbances in&#xD;
      survivors of critical illness. Subjects will be recruited following discharge from the&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and followed for 6 weeks. All subjects will undergo objective&#xD;
      measurements of sleep quality and duration at baseline and at 6 weeks. Objective measurements&#xD;
      will be made by portable (home-based) sleep studies and will wear a watch that measures&#xD;
      sleep. Subjective measurements will be performed by sleep questionnaires: PSQI, Epworth&#xD;
      sleepiness scale, sleep log, and Stanford Sleepiness Scale which will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline, 2 and 6 weeks. A blood draw and urine collection will be done at both baseline and&#xD;
      6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central purpose of this proposal is to perform a comparative-effectiveness study of a&#xD;
      complementary and alternative approach (Johrei therapy) and CBT-I in the treatment of sleep&#xD;
      disturbances in survivors of critical illness. The investigators hypothesize that, in&#xD;
      survivors of critical illness, Johrei therapy is superior or comparable to CBT-I in improving&#xD;
      sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI] and sleep efficiency [measured by&#xD;
      polysomnography]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective is to compare the effect of Johrei therapy and CBT-I on systemic&#xD;
      markers of inflammation and urinary biomarkers of sleep and stress. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that, in survivors of critical illness, Johrei therapy is superior or comparable&#xD;
      to CBT-I in reducing systemic markers of inflammation and urinary biomarkers of sleep and&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tertiary objective is to determine whether the presence of insomnia or other sleep&#xD;
      characteristics is associated with hospital readmissions within 30-days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of critical illness are known to have poor quality of life. Specifically,&#xD;
      post-discharge insomnia symptoms were common and significantly associated with physical&#xD;
      quality of life impairment among six-month acute lung injury (ALI) survivors, even after&#xD;
      adjustment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms. Further studies&#xD;
      are needed to validate these results and to characterize sleep disturbance after ALI using&#xD;
      sleep-specific metrics. Chronic insomnia impacts 1 in 10 adults and is linked to accidents,&#xD;
      decreased quality of life, diminished work productivity, and increased long-term risk for&#xD;
      medical and psychiatric diseases such as diabetes and depression. Insomnia and inadequate&#xD;
      sleep is an under-recognized problem that ails the investigators society and nearly 8000&#xD;
      preventable deaths per year are attributed to fatigue-related motor vehicle crashes as&#xD;
      compared to 13,000 attributable to drunken driving. In a National Gallup poll, it was&#xD;
      estimated that nearly 70% of US residents do not get adequate sleep. Inadequate sleep has&#xD;
      also been suggested to play a role in the causation and perpetuation of psychiatric disorders&#xD;
      and has recently been labeled a carcinogen. Methods to improve sleep and vitality may&#xD;
      decrease the effects of inadequate sleep and prevent diseases and deaths due to accidents.&#xD;
      Moreover, sleep, or lack thereof, may be a reflection of global stress, disease severity,&#xD;
      reveals much about patients' overall well-being and could be associated with hospital&#xD;
      readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is currently considered the gold-standard&#xD;
      treatment for insomnia. Recent National Institutes of Health consensus statements and the&#xD;
      American Academy of Sleep Medicine's Practice Parameters recommend that cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) be considered the first line treatment for chronic primary&#xD;
      insomnia. Growing research also supports the extension of CBT-I for patients with persistent&#xD;
      insomnia occurring within the context of medical and psychiatric co-morbidity. Sedative&#xD;
      medications for insomnia may be associated with adverse side effects and have even been&#xD;
      associated with all-cause mortality. Consequently, other non-pharmacological approaches have&#xD;
      been gaining ground as therapeutic approaches for insomnia. Specifically, complementary and&#xD;
      alternative forms of therapy such as yoga, mindful meditation, tai chi, Reikei and Johrei&#xD;
      therapy have been used to promote sleep quality. Similar to Reikei, Johrei is a&#xD;
      nondenominational spiritual practice and complementary and alternative medical therapy that&#xD;
      channels the purification energy to a human body through the palm of its practitioner. Such&#xD;
      an complementary and alternative treatment has previously been suggested to improve&#xD;
      well-being and vitality in human studies. We know that well-being and vitality are&#xD;
      facilitated by sleep and that sleep deprivation is associated with reduced well-being and&#xD;
      vitality. Moreover, recently we showed that Johrei therapy improves sleep in a murine sleep&#xD;
      deprivation model. Whether Johrei therapy achieves an improved sense of well-being through&#xD;
      facilitation of sleep in survivors of critical illness is unknown. Specifically, whether or&#xD;
      not Johrei therapy is comparable to CBT-I in the management of sleep problems in the&#xD;
      survivors of critical illness is largely unknown. The proposed study will address this&#xD;
      knowledge gap. If Johrei treatment can improve sleep in survivors of critical illness,&#xD;
      patients with reduced vitality due to insufficient sleep (majority of US population),&#xD;
      insomnia, and disrupted sleep (sleep apnea) may also benefit from such treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insomnia subjects, but not good sleepers, show high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines that&#xD;
      are associated with increased risk for heart disease and even mortality. Whether the&#xD;
      improvement of sleep through CBT-I or Johrei therapy is mediated by reduction in stress and&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokine levels is unknown. The investigators study will address this&#xD;
      knowledge gap by measuring circulating levels of cytokines in patients receiving Johrei&#xD;
      therapy or CBT-I. Also, recent studies have shown that urinary levels of neurotransmitters&#xD;
      may be increased (catecholamines such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, Æ”-amino butyric acid&#xD;
      (GABA)) or decreased (Taurine) in subjects with sleep disturbances. Whether or not CBT-I or&#xD;
      other practices aimed at promoting sleep can normalize urinary changes in neurotransmitters&#xD;
      is largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. JT arm: Johrei treatment will be administered to subjects at the University of Arizona or&#xD;
      at the patient's residence for 3 sessions per week lasting 30 minutes each. Two of these&#xD;
      sessions will be combined on one day with a 1 hour interval to yield two visits per week. A&#xD;
      total of 18 sessions will be administered over the 6 weeks of participation. Therapy will be&#xD;
      administered by a senior Johrei administrator who received his training from Reimei Kyokai in&#xD;
      Kyoto, Japan. The Johrei will be administered as per all of the principles of Johrei. Before&#xD;
      each therapy, the therapist will wash his hands and pray for 1 minute while facing the&#xD;
      subject at a distance. The Johrei therapy will be administered without requiring physical&#xD;
      contact by the placement of the therapist's hands in proximity of the subject (20 cms).&#xD;
      Johrei therapy is a complementary and alternative form of therapy that originated in Japan,&#xD;
      like Reiki therapy. Johrei therapy is a non-invasive bio-energy healing practice that is&#xD;
      delivered by the outstretched hand of a Johrei practitioner&#xD;
      (http://www.johrei-institute.org/aboutus.htm). Similar to Reiki, Johrei is a&#xD;
      nondenominational spiritual practice and complementary and alternative medical therapy that&#xD;
      channels the purification energy to a human body through the palm of its practitioner but&#xD;
      without requiring physical touch. Such a complementary and alternative treatment has&#xD;
      previously been suggested to improve well-being and vitality in human studies. We know that&#xD;
      well-being and vitality are facilitated by sleep and that sleep deprivation is associated&#xD;
      with reduced well-being and vitality. Moreover, recently we showed that Johrei therapy&#xD;
      improves sleep in a murine sleep deprivation model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. CBT-I arm: Cognitive Behavioral therapy for Insomnia will be administered by a licensed&#xD;
      and trained clinical psychologist after completion of initial assessment of the nature of the&#xD;
      subjects sleep problems via a HIPAA-compliant encrypted Vsee app in the subject's iPAD.&#xD;
      Weekly therapy will be administered in a manner that is tailored to suit the subject's need.&#xD;
      A total of 6 sessions with an option of two additional sessions will be administered to help&#xD;
      promote sleep. The administrator will go over techniques such as sleep restriction therapy,&#xD;
      stimulus control instructions, and sleep hygiene education. Also, in order to prevent&#xD;
      relapse, education will be provided regarding the extent to which they comprehend the&#xD;
      patient's individual circumstances and critically reviewing the rules for good sleep, which&#xD;
      in many instances need to be customized to each subject. All conversations and sessions with&#xD;
      patients will take place in a manner designed to ensure privacy. For ensuring fidelity of the&#xD;
      CBT-I sessions, 20% of the sessions will be video recorded at random for later review by&#xD;
      clinical psychologist.&#xD;
