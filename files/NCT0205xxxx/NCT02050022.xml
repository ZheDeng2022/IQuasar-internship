      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive disease that is characterized&#xD;
      by loss of lung function, leading to breathlessness, poor quality of life, loss in&#xD;
      productivity, and increased mortality. The World Health Organization estimates that COPD will&#xD;
      be the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020, accounting for more than 7 million&#xD;
      deaths annually. COPD patients frequently experience 'lung attacks', during which&#xD;
      breathlessness, coughing, and sputum production dramatically increase, leading to urgent&#xD;
      office visits, emergency admissions and hospitalizations. Lung attacks reduce patient quality&#xD;
      of life and cost the Canadian health care system nearly $4 billion dollars each year in&#xD;
      direct and indirect costs. Lung attacks can be effectively managed if they are identified and&#xD;
      treated early, but symptoms of a lung attack often overlap with those of other common&#xD;
      conditions such as heart failure, pneumonia and even influenza. Because there are no tests&#xD;
      that can separate lung attacks from these conditions, doctors struggle to accurately diagnose&#xD;
      lung attacks at an early stage when drugs are most effective. This can lead to a delayed or&#xD;
      even incorrect diagnosis and inappropriate treatment. This research will address this&#xD;
      critical need. Our goal is to improve COPD patient care by developing new blood tests that&#xD;
      will help identify patients who are in the early stages of a lung attack. Doctors will be&#xD;
      able to use these tests to treat lung attacks at earlier stages than is currently possible.&#xD;
      These blood tests will enable doctors to personalize management of COPD to meet the needs of&#xD;
      the individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: New biomarker blood tests can be used to better identify and manage patients with&#xD;
      COPD.&#xD;

      An acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is defined as an acute event characterized by a&#xD;
      worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variations&#xD;
      and leads to a change in medication (in most cases to antibiotics and/or oral&#xD;
      corticosteroids). In most cases of AECOPD, patients experience a gradual crescendo-like&#xD;
      increase in shortness of breath, cough and purulent sputum production over days to weeks. At&#xD;
      their peak, patients may experience extreme shortness of breath (sometimes described as&#xD;
      &quot;breathless paralysis&quot;) and uncontrollable paroxysms of cough and purulent sputum production.&#xD;
      AECOPDs are complex physiological events. In 70-80% of cases, AECOPDs are precipitated by&#xD;
      bacterial or viral respiratory tract infections. However, most patients who develop acute&#xD;
      symptoms (e.g., runny nose, cough or fever) do not progress to AECOPDs and experience&#xD;
      spontaneous resolution of their symptoms. Furthermore, many patients with COPD who do harbour&#xD;
      pathogenic organisms in their airways do not develop AECOPD symptoms. Thus, other factors,&#xD;
      including the host inflammatory response, likely play a role in the pathogenesis of AECOPDs.&#xD;
      Prompt recognition and treatment of AECOPD during this prodromal period can abrogate full&#xD;
      blown attacks. Thus by identifying and treating AECOPDs early on (in physicians' offices),&#xD;
      emergency visits, hospitalizations, and even deaths can be significantly reduced. However,&#xD;
      this is not easy as symptoms of AECOPD (especially early in their course) are non-specific&#xD;
      and can easily be confused with other ailments such as heart failure, allergies, or even&#xD;
      upper respiratory tract infections. Since there are no biochemical tests that clinicians can&#xD;
      order to objectively confirm AECOPD, AECOPD can be missed entirely or misdiagnosed, leading&#xD;
      to delayed treatments or in some cases to the wrong treatment, which may result in&#xD;
      devastating consequences including respiratory failure, hospitalizations or even death. Once&#xD;
      patients are in the full blown attack stage of AECOPD, treatments are only modestly helpful&#xD;
      in relieving symptoms and hospitalization is often required to resolve them. The median&#xD;
      duration of hospitalization for AECOPD in Canada is 10 days, followed by an average of 3&#xD;
      months of convalescence. Unfortunately, in most cases, full recovery is never achieved and&#xD;
      patients continue to experience rapid decline in lung and physical function (compared to&#xD;
      patients not hospitalized for AECOPD). The 3 year mortality rate following hospitalization is&#xD;
      50%, and hospitalizations and emergency visits are avoidable with earlier detection,&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of AECOPD. Indeed, COPD is the leading cause of preventable&#xD;
      hospitalization in Canada. However, without a simple blood test that primary care physicians&#xD;
      (PCPs) can order in their offices, earlier diagnosis will not be feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to identify blood biomarkers that can diagnose AECOPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent, blood samples will be collected from patients who are admitted&#xD;
      for an exacerbation at day 1, 3 and 7 of their hospitalization and then at 30 days and 90&#xD;
      days post-hospitalization. Sputum samples will also be collected on the day of admission for&#xD;
      AECOPD etiologic phenotyping. All patients receive standard anti-exacerbation care in&#xD;
      hospital, including systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics and are followed both in and out&#xD;
      of hospital by a transition team consisting of a nurse, physiotherapist and respiratory&#xD;
      therapist with special expertise in COPD care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent of non-exacerbating patients, a blood sample will be collected&#xD;
      which will be used as a comparison to the exacerbating patient samples.&#xD;
