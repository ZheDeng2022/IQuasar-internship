  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The stapled transanal rectal resection (STARR) has recently been recommended for patients&#xD;
      with obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) caused by rectocele and rectal wall&#xD;
      intussusception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of STARR is to correct the mechanical outlet obstruction using a stapler device for&#xD;
      endorectal resection of the distal rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique significantly improves constipation. However, there are several reports of&#xD;
      new-onset faecal incontinence after STARR and urgency has been identified as the major&#xD;
      side-effect of this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although this technique has become an important surgical option in the treatment of&#xD;
      obstructive defaecation syndrome, its impact on continence can be problematic and objective&#xD;
      data about parameters that predict its result are not yet available One study evaluated the&#xD;
      anal function after surgery in 30 patients. In this study, urgency or incontinence was&#xD;
      complained by 26% of patients. No sonographically demonstrable sphincter fragmentations were&#xD;
      noticed in the endoanal exam performed at the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No significant difference was observed in anorectal manometry. Even if data are not&#xD;
      statistically significant, resting and squeezing pressures are lower in those patients not&#xD;
      satisfied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, anal canal pressure measurements using ano-rectal manometry are the most common&#xD;
      means of assessment of sphincter function. Some studies have been looking at the concept of&#xD;
      distending sphincter regions as a better measure of its performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The functional lumen imaging probe (FLIP) is a novel technique which has the ability to&#xD;
      provide real-time images of the function of human gastrointestinal sphincter during&#xD;
      distension. This distensibility technique provides an important new way of studying the anal&#xD;
      canal and hence may have a role in testing sphincter competence in patients with disorders&#xD;
      after STARR procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-eight patients will be enrolled in this study over a period of 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative assessment will include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the Wexner Incontinence Score and the Faecal Incontinence Quality-of-Life Index (FIQL)&#xD;
           to rate anal incontinence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  video defecography, anorectal manometry, anal ultrasound (AUS) and measure of anal&#xD;
           sphincter distensibility using endoFLIP Follow-up evaluation will scheduled for 3 months&#xD;
           after surgery, and will include symptom evaluation (using the same standard&#xD;
           questionnaires for incontinence), clinical examination and investigation using anal&#xD;
           ultrasound and endoFLIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If we demonstrate that this surgical technique can cause anal lesions with decreased&#xD;
      sphincter competence, this may lead to a modification of the surgical technique especially in&#xD;
      patients at risk of developing postoperative anal incontinence.&#xD;
