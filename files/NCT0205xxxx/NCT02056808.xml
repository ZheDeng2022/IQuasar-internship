        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be males of any ethnic origin with a genetic diagnosis of DMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children between 5 and 11 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A parent/legal guardian must date and sign a written consent on behalf of the patient,&#xD;
             according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and local regulations.&#xD;
             This person must understand the contents of the consent, requirements of the study and&#xD;
             have had an opportunity to review questions with a medically trained member of the&#xD;
             site study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is willing to give verbal or written age appropriate assent to&#xD;
             participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For safety reasons, the patient's parent/legal guardian must have a good understanding&#xD;
             of the English language, as this is the only language the consent/assent forms are&#xD;
             written in, and understand the requirements for reporting of any adverse event to the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrollment or participation in any therapeutic clinical trial within the prior 3&#xD;
             months or 5 times the half-life (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Initiation or change (other than dose modifications for body weight) of systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroid therapy within 2 months prior to the start of dose administration or&#xD;
             discontinuation of corticosteroids within 30 days prior to the start of dose&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to the excipients of the study drug or a previous history of&#xD;
             drug allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of the following therapies is prohibited during the study and for at least 5&#xD;
             half-lives prior to the start of dose administration: Inducers of cytochrome P450&#xD;
             CYP1A2 (eg, carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, rifampin, omeprazole, and&#xD;
             barbiturates), and moderate and strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g., fluvoxamine,&#xD;
             ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, mexiletine; propafenone, zileuton). Substrates of CYP1A2 with&#xD;
             narrow therapeutic windows (e.g., tacrine, theophylline, methadone, mexiletine).&#xD;
             Nicotine, including exposure to daily passive smoking to minimize cytochrome P450 CYP&#xD;
             1A induction. Chargrilled food, cruciferous vegetables, caffeine, tea, and any&#xD;
             xanthine containing foods, and drinks are prohibited from 36 hours prior to check-in&#xD;
             until final discharge from study. Herbal supplements and homeopathic preparations&#xD;
             (unless approved by medical monitor).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Need for mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non ambulatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant acute illness within 4 weeks of the start of dose&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any co-morbidity that, in the opinion of the Investigator, increases the risk of&#xD;
             participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic cardiomyopathy that in the opinion of the Investigator prohibits&#xD;
             participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormality in the 12-lead ECG that, in the opinion of the Investigator, increases the&#xD;
             risk of participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant medical condition, other than DMD that in the opinion of&#xD;
             the Investigator may increase the risk of participating in the study or interfere with&#xD;
             the interpretation of safety or efficacy evaluations (e.g., concomitant illness,&#xD;
             psychiatric condition or behavioral disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to daily passive smoking (including parent/legal guardian, siblings) so as to&#xD;
             minimize environmental factors causing cytochrome P450 CYP 1A induction. For&#xD;
             information SMT C1100 is metabolized by cytochrome P450 CYP 1A.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Excessive exercise (Investigator opinion).&#xD;
