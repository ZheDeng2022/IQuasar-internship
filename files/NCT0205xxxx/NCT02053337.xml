  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ALLEVYN◊ Life and Mepilex™ Border are both layered foam dressings with a silicone adhesive&#xD;
      wound contact layer. Both are indicated for the same uses; however ALLEVYN◊ Life has a number&#xD;
      of attributes designed to meet a range of characteristics associated with principles of&#xD;
      wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim for this evaluation is to assess, in a clinical setting and against a number of&#xD;
      identified criteria, the performance of the ALLEVYN◊ Life dressing compared to Mepilex™&#xD;
      Border in terms of characteristics of the attributes of wellbeing.&#xD;

    <measure>Subjective rating of the impact of the dressing performance and characteristics on patient wellbeing (referred to as patient wellbeing score)</measure>
    <time_frame>After (up to) 10 days of dressing wear</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome, a subjective patient wellbeing/preference score, is calculated using a combination of responses from 8 individual questions on a patient questionnaire and 2 further dressing retention related measures at the end of treatment with each dressing (up to maximum of 10 days). Individual patient questions relate to the effect of specific dressing performance /characteristics on patient wellbeing (each on a 0-10 scale: 0 = most negative response, 10 = most positive response).</description>
