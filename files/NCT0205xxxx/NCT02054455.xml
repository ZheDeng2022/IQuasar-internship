      The aim of the study is to evaluate the potential protective effect of Lactobacillus&#xD;
      paracasei subspecies paracasei F19 administration on bowel symptom onset in patients with&#xD;
      gastro-esophageal reflux disease at long-term PPI treatment.&#xD;

      Population and study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the approval of the Local Ethical Committee and informed consent of patients, we will&#xD;
      consecutively enrol, according to the calculated power of the study, 80 outpatients, among&#xD;
      those referred to the Institutional centers on account of recent onset of typical reflux&#xD;
      symptoms (heartburn and regurgitation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will be: age &lt;18 or &gt;70 yrs; pregnancy or breast-feeding; evidence of&#xD;
      major concomitant diseases (i.e., tumors, cardiovascular disorders and hepatic and/or renal&#xD;
      failure); use of PPIs or H2-antagonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or&#xD;
      antibiotics in the previous 3 months; presence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection;&#xD;
      erosive esophagitis; presence of bowel symptoms such as bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain,&#xD;
      diarrhea and constipation in the last 6 months or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) according to&#xD;
      Rome III criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo upper endoscopy. Patients who will fulfill the entry criteria will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients will be treated with pantoprazole 40 mg die for 6 months and they will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to 4 arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the first arm will receive placebo for 3 days/week for 6 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the second arm will receive LP-F19 in a dose of 25x109 live bacterial cells for 3&#xD;
           days/week for 6 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the third arm will receive LP-F19 in a dose of 25x109 live bacterial cells for 3&#xD;
           days/week for the first three months and placebo 3 days/week for the following three&#xD;
           months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the fourth arm will receive placebo 3 days/week for the first three months and LP-F19 in&#xD;
           a dose of 25x109 live bacterial cells for 3 days/week for the following three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo will consist of a preparation similar to that of probiotic but with no added&#xD;
      microorganisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to treatment Will be evaluated based on self-reporting by the patients and count of&#xD;
      returned sackets during monthly control visits. Patients who will take at least 90% of the&#xD;
      drugs (pantoprazole, LP-F19 and placebo) for at least 90% of the scheduled time will be&#xD;
      considered compliant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting therapy (i.e. baseline evaluation) and every 4 weeks, each patient will fill&#xD;
      up a structured questionnaire for symptom assessment, concerning heartburn and regurgitation,&#xD;
      as well as, bowel symptoms, including bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence and bowel habit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom and bowel habit assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and every 4 weeks after the beginning of the therapy, each patient will fill up a&#xD;
      structured questionnaire, focusing on the presence of heartburn, regurgitation, bloating,&#xD;
      flatulence, abdominal pain, diarrhea and constipation, with the help of a physician&#xD;
      interviewer. The questionnaire, according to a Likert scale, will assess frequency (0 =&#xD;
      never, 1 = &lt; 1 episode/week; 2 = &lt; 3 episodes/week; 3 = &gt; 3 episodes/week; 4 = daily&#xD;
      episodes) and severity (0 = absent, 1 = mild i.e. not interfering with the daily activities,&#xD;
      2 = moderate i.e. limiting the daily activities, and 3 = severe i.e. hampering the daily&#xD;
      activities) of each symptom during the previous 6 months, at baseline and during the last&#xD;
      month at every 4-week checkpoints. According to an arbitrary index, symptoms will be&#xD;
      considered significant when interfering with daily activities (i.e., mean total score,&#xD;
      frequency plus severity, ≥ 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will record their bowel habit on validated diary cards, including every single stool&#xD;
      and stool consistency. Stool consistency will be deﬁned according to the Bristol Stool Form&#xD;
      Scale (BSFS). Diary cards will be returned every four weeks.&#xD;
