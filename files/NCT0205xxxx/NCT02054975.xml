  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial of lower vs. higher dose vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation in D-deficient asthmatic children, to determine necessary sample sizes for&#xD;
      outcome measures in a larger multisite study, and to examine possible relationships and&#xD;
      effect sizes between various biological markers that may be important to the pathophysiology&#xD;
      of childhood asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate effect sizes for relationships between serum 25OH-vitD and omega-fatty acid&#xD;
           (FA) biomarkers, before and after supplementation with lower or higher dose vitamin D,&#xD;
           on immune function, and asthma severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Characterize changes in innate and adaptive immune function and inflammatory responses&#xD;
           in asthmatic D-deficient youth at baseline and after vitD supplements, by dietary&#xD;
           O6:O3FA status and vitD dose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated up to 120 youth meeting eligibility criteria will be screened for vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency, and if found deficient, will be offered enrollment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible children who assent and whose parent/guardian consent to participate will be&#xD;
      randomized to low dose vs. higher dose vitamin D to take across a 3-month period of time.&#xD;
      Blood, questionnaires, and pulmonary function tests will be obtained at baseline and end of&#xD;
      study. Weekly phone calls will check on any questions or concerns the participant or their&#xD;
      family may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim I: Evaluate effect sizes for relationships between omega-FA and vitD biomarkers, pre- and&#xD;
      post- low and higher dose vitamin D supplementation, in diet, immune function, and asthma&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim II: Characterize changes in innate and adaptive immune function and inflammatory&#xD;
      responses in asthmatic D-deficient youth at baseline and after vitD supplements, by O6:O3FA&#xD;
      status and vitD dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory: Compute effect sizes/odds ratios for differences in pulmonary function,&#xD;
      self-reported asthma severity, depressive symptoms, hospitalization/ED visits, and medication&#xD;
      changes based on treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect sizes will be calculated for all continuous outcome variables by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect Size (ES) = Average of the post-test scores - Average of the pre-test scores Average&#xD;
      standard deviation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Odds ratios for the categorical asthma severity variable will be computed through logistic&#xD;
      regression by treatment group with no covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examine differences in pulmonary function tests, self-reported asthma severity, depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, hospitalization/ED visits, and medication changes based on treatment group. Omega&#xD;
      fatty acid intake and allergic status will be included as potentially mediating variables.&#xD;
