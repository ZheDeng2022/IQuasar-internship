  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to test the safety and anti-cancer activity of the combination of&#xD;
      an investigational drug called orteronel, with a drug called itraconazole in the treatment of&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orteronel is an investigational drug known as a 17,20-lyase enzyme inhibitor, meaning that it&#xD;
      blocks the formation of male sex hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Itraconazole is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of&#xD;
      various fungal infections such as fingernail/toenail infections and other more serious fungal&#xD;
      infections. While it has shown evidence of activity against prostate cancer in prior studies,&#xD;
      it is not approved for use in cancer. The FDA is allowing the use of orteronel and&#xD;
      itraconazole in this research study. In addition to its antifungal properties, itraconazole&#xD;
      was discovered to function to block angiogenesis (blood vessel formation to tumors) to block&#xD;
      a cellular pathway thought to be important in prostate cancer known as the Hedgehog pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that blocking male sex hormone production with orteronel will&#xD;
      increase reliance on the Hedgehog pathway in prostate cancer cells which can then be blocked&#xD;
      with itraconazole and that the combination of these two drugs will be more effective than&#xD;
      either alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hedgehog (Hh) pathway signaling may be important in prostate cancer progression and this&#xD;
      pathway is upregulated in the castration-resistant state. More potent (maximal) castration&#xD;
      achievable by CYP17 inhibition, using orteronel, may further upregulate Hh pathway&#xD;
      activation. Itraconazole administered at high doses (600 mg/day) may function as a modest Hh&#xD;
      inhibitor. In a pilot phase II trial, investigators have shown that single-agent high-dose&#xD;
      itraconazole produced PSA reductions in 29% of men with metastatic castration-resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer (CRPC), reduced circulating tumor cell counts in 62% of patients with&#xD;
      unfavorable baseline counts, and prolonged progression-free survival compared to historical&#xD;
      data. Moreover, clinical responses to itraconazole appeared to correlate with Hh pathway&#xD;
      suppression, as measured by GLI1 mRNA analysis from serial skin biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose to evaluate the potent CYP17/lyase inhibitor, orteronel, in combination&#xD;
      with itraconazole at escalating dose levels (100 mg BID, 200 mg BID, 300 mg BID) in men with&#xD;
      non-metastatic or metastatic CRPC by conducting an open-label phase Ib/II trial. Importantly,&#xD;
      unlike the related compound, ketoconazole, itraconazole very rarely results in adrenal&#xD;
      suppression. Side effects previously seen at the highest dose of itraconazole (600 mg/day)&#xD;
      were mild and included nausea, rash, diarrhea, vomiting, hypokalemia, edema, headache,&#xD;
      hypertension, fever, pruritis, and abnormal liver function tests. Of note, orteronel will be&#xD;
      given without concurrent prednisone in this trial. This is because the combination of&#xD;
      itraconazole and corticosteroids can lead to Cushing's syndrome (hypercortisolism) by&#xD;
      impairing corticosteroid metabolism through CYP3A4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study provides an opportunity to evaluate a steroid-free orteronel&#xD;
      combination regimen. If this combination is safe and tolerable, subsequent studies would aim&#xD;
      to compare the clinical efficacy of orteronel-itraconazole versus orteronel alone using a&#xD;
      randomized phase II trial design.&#xD;

    <description>This is a dose escalation phase I trial where 3 subjects will be enrolled at each dose level. If no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are seen at a dose level, the study moves to the next dose level. If 1 DLT is seen, 3 additional subjects must be enrolled at the current dose level. If 2-3 DLTs are seen, we will stop accrual to that particular dose level, and the previous dose level becomes the maximum tolerated dose.</description>
