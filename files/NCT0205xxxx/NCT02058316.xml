      Background Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) remains an important cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality among patients with hemato-oncological malignancies. Due to the crude mortality of&#xD;
      &gt;90% in absence of adequate treatment, timely diagnosis and early start of antifungal therapy&#xD;
      are key factors in the successful treatment of IPA. Various studies have shown that early&#xD;
      initiation of antifungal therapy may improve IPA survival to above 70%. Diagnosis of IPA,&#xD;
      however, remains difficult as clinical signs and symptoms as well as radiological findings&#xD;
      are often unspecific and conventional culture methods lack sensitivity. In recent years&#xD;
      antigen testing has therefore become one of the cornerstones of IPA diagnostics.&#xD;
      Brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) Galactomannan (GM) testing is currently the most promising&#xD;
      approach for early detection of pulmonary infections by this fungus. However, limitations of&#xD;
      GM detection are assay turn-around time, which varies widely between centers (less than a day&#xD;
      to several days), and the need for appropriately equipped laboratories that routinely test&#xD;
      for this antigen. These limitations are overcome by the Aspergillus Lateral-Flow Device&#xD;
      (LFD), a novel point-of-care (POC) test for IPA diagnosis developed by Dr Thornton at the&#xD;
      University of Exeter, UK. This simple, rapid (15 min), single-use test can be performed in&#xD;
      rudimentary facilities using BAL specimens. In a retrospective single centre study we have&#xD;
      recently evaluated the LFD test in 39 BAL samples from hematologic malignancy patients and&#xD;
      solid organ transplant recipients. Sensitivities and specificities of BAL LFD tests for&#xD;
      probable IPA were 100% and 81%, respectively. Galactomannan levels in cases with negative LFD&#xD;
      were significantly lower than in patients with positive LFD (P &lt;0.0001). We concluded that&#xD;
      the LFD test of BAL specimens is performed easily and provides accurate and rapidly available&#xD;
      results. Therefore, this new point-of-care test may be a very promising diagnostic approach&#xD;
      for detecting IPA in BAL specimens from haematological malignancy and SOT patients. For&#xD;
      routine clinical use, however, multicenter studies with larger sample sizes also from other&#xD;
      patient collectives are necessary. In this multicenter study we will evaluate the LFD test in&#xD;
      BAL samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives Primary Objectives To evaluate the Lateral Flow Device test, a rapid (15&#xD;
      min), point-of-care test for IPA diagnosis using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids from&#xD;
      patients at risk for IPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective To evaluate the potential of BAL Lateral Flow Device test for prognosis&#xD;
      in patients with IPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a prospective multi-center study conducted in three centers in Austria&#xD;
      (Graz, Vienna and Innsbruck) and one centre in Germany (Mannheim). In order to meet the&#xD;
      objectives an estimated number of 300 BAL samples from patients at risk for IPA (50 to 100&#xD;
      per centre) will be included in the study cohort. The Lateral Flow Device test will be&#xD;
      performed prospectively in BAL samples from the patients and results will be compared to GM&#xD;
      results, PCR findings, clinical/radiological findings as well as conventional culture&#xD;
      results. In addition, retrospective testing of BAL samples that were previously routinely&#xD;
      tested for GM will be performed in up to three participating centers (Graz, Innsbruck and&#xD;
      Mannheim) to ensure to reach the proposed number of 300 BAL samples. The treating clinicians&#xD;
      will not be informed about BAL Lateral Flow Device test results and the test will therefore&#xD;
      have no impact on patient management / treatment decisions.&#xD;

      Project Outlook Sensitive and specific biomarkers for early diagnosis of IPA are urgently&#xD;
      needed to improve survival. In this multicenter study we will evaluate the potential of the&#xD;
      novel Lateral Flow Device test for early, bedside diagnosis of IPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A successful implementation of the studies hypothesis requires a solid background in the&#xD;
      field of IPA. Considering this I am confident that my professional experience combined with&#xD;
      the technical and scientific expertise at my host institute and the associated laboratories&#xD;
      generates a highly competitive and promising setting. The success of the proposed research&#xD;
      will vitally depend on collaborations. Over the last four years I have worked extensively in&#xD;
      the field of IPA among patients with hemato-oncological malignancies, which allowed me to&#xD;
      establish the necessary contacts and cooperations that are vital for the project's success.&#xD;
      The major strength of this multi-center study is therefore the cooperation with three major&#xD;
      centers for IPA diagnosis under the leadership of three outstanding experts (Prof.&#xD;
      Lass-Flörl, Prof. Buchheidt and Prof. Willinger) who have published extensively in the field&#xD;
      of IPA diagnosis over recent years/decades. I am certain that our results will have&#xD;
      far-reaching implementations for the whole field of IPA. Clearly, they will significantly&#xD;
      advance our understanding of the clinical performance of the novel point of care&#xD;
      applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is expected to have a big impact on patient care. Establishment of the Lateral&#xD;
      Flow Device test may lead to rapidly, frankly on the bedside, available test results and may&#xD;
      therefore enable earlier initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy which may help to save&#xD;
      lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality among&#xD;
           patients with haemato-oncological malignancies (1-3). Invasive mould infections (IMI),&#xD;
           in particular invasive aspergillosis (IA) are the leading cause of IFI among these&#xD;
           patients, followed by invasive Candida infections (2, 4). Due to the crude mortality of&#xD;
           80-90% in absence of adequate treatment, timely diagnosis and early start of antifungal&#xD;
           therapy are key factors in the successful treatment of IFI. Various studies have shown&#xD;
           that early initiation of antifungal therapy may improve IFI survival to above 80% (5,&#xD;
           6). Clinical signs and symptoms of IFI as well as radiological findings, however, are&#xD;
           often unspecific. The inability to consistently make an early and convincing diagnosis&#xD;
           remains, therefore, one central problem. The European Organization for Research and&#xD;
           Treatment of Cancer Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group (EORTC) and the Mycoses&#xD;
           Study Group of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (MSG) had some&#xD;
           success in tackling this problem by establishing consensus definitions for opportunistic&#xD;
           IFI (7). However, definitions in EORTC/MSG guidelines were based not only on review of&#xD;
           the literature, but also expert opinion and subsequent international consensus. The main&#xD;
           reason was that studies evaluating details of the definitions were in part simply not&#xD;
           available. In a recent cohort study our working group proposed some modifications to the&#xD;
           criteria (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
           When using EORTC/MSG criteria the prevalence of IFI strongly depends on mycological&#xD;
           evidence which is not easy to get. Culture-based diagnostic approaches do not only&#xD;
           require invasive diagnostic procedures, which are often hindered by the severe medical&#xD;
           condition in patients at risk for IFI, but do also, in fact, frequently result falsely&#xD;
           negative. Antigen testing with rapidly available test results has therefore become&#xD;
           increasingly important to produce a realistic picture of the burden of IFI and enable&#xD;
           early diagnosis and treatment in patients with IFI (1). Antigen testing may not only&#xD;
           facilitate early diagnosis but may also prevent overtreatment which has become frequent.&#xD;
           A recent study by Azoulay and colleagues who evaluated antifungal therapy on one day in&#xD;
           multiple French hospitals confirmed that in fact most of the patients that received&#xD;
           antifungals did in fact not have IFI (9). Overtreatment may not only increase costs&#xD;
           significantly (daily costs for most antifungals 600-1000€) but may also lead to&#xD;
           development of resistance (10). The use of highly sensitive and specific rapidly&#xD;
           available antigen tests/ biomarkers may guide the clinician to initiate antifungal&#xD;
           therapy only in patients that benefit from treatment as they really have IFI. Last but&#xD;
           not least antigen testing may be also useful for early response assessment, therapy&#xD;
           monitoring and treatment stratification including the decision when to stop antifungal&#xD;
           therapy in patients with IA (11-12).&#xD;
&#xD;
           One of the major limitations of the GM test is that time to results varies between&#xD;
           centres (between less than a day and up to several days), mainly depending on the number&#xD;
           of specimens tested in routine (as the test is performed with plates covering 96 tests),&#xD;
           and the distance/duration of transport between the clinical setting and the laboratory&#xD;
           where the test is performed. These limitations are overcome by the Lateral Flow Device&#xD;
           Test, a point of care test for IA developed by Prof. Thornton of the University of&#xD;
           Exeter, United Kingdom. This single sample test can be easily performed in every&#xD;
           laboratory using BAL and serum specimens and time to result is approximately 20 minutes.&#xD;
           Recent studies have shown the immense potential of the test in human BAL and serum&#xD;
           samples (13-15). In a very recent study our working group retrospectively evaluated the&#xD;
           LFD test by using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from patients with haematological&#xD;
           malignancies and patients after solid organ transplantation (SOT). Thirty-nine BAL&#xD;
           samples from 37 patients were included (29 samples haematological malignancies and 10&#xD;
           samples SOT; 12 probable IPA, 9 possible IPA, 16 no IPA). Sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
           BAL LFD test for probable IPA were 100% and 81%, respectively. GM levels in cases with&#xD;
           negative LFD were significantly lower than in patients with positive LFD (P &lt;0.0001). We&#xD;
           concluded that the LFD test of BAL specimens is performed easily and provides accurate&#xD;
           and rapidly available results. Therefore, this new point-of-care test may be a very&#xD;
           promising diagnostic approach for detecting IPA in BAL specimens from haematological&#xD;
           malignancy and SOT patients (16). Another recent study demonstrated in a neutropenic&#xD;
           guinea pig model that the LFD assay is reproducible between different laboratories and&#xD;
           studies (17). Multi-center studies are needed, however, to further evaluate the test&#xD;
           (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the proposed study we will evaluate the BAL Lateral Flow Device Test and compare&#xD;
           results to routinely performed Galactomannan values as well as, culture and PCR results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study design and methods 2.1. Study design The study design is exploratory,&#xD;
           retrospective, and multi-centric. The study will start in March 2013 with duration of 13&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Study sites&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University&#xD;
                of Graz, Austria&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Division of Hygiene and Medical Microbiology, Innsbruck Medical University, Austria&#xD;

&#xD;
           2.3. Study population All stored or routinely obtained BAL samples from adult patients&#xD;
           at risk for invasive pulmonary Aspergillosis will be eligible for study inclusion. The&#xD;
           treating clinicians will be blinded to BAL Lateral Flow Device test results and the test&#xD;
           will therefore have no impact on patient management / treatment decisions. The treating&#xD;
           clinicians will be blinded to BAL Lateral Flow Device test results. Test results will&#xD;
           therefore have no impact on clinical / treatment decisions and therefore not affect the&#xD;
           included patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Underlying diseases, EORTC status of IFI (both available from the clinical order&#xD;
           accompanying the BAL sample) and other microbiological/mycological test results will be&#xD;
           recorded in an electronic data base. No patient related personal data will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.1 Key Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patients above 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. BAL sample obtained in clinical routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. At risk for IFI (according to attending clinicians). Risk factors may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  febrile neutropenia&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  induction chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  allogeneic stem cell transplant/graft versus host disease&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  clinical/radiological/mycological findings suspicious for IFI&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Solid Organ transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  ICU patient&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Liver cirrhosis 2.3.2 Key exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Under 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. No BAL sample obtained in clinical routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           d.) Not at risk for IFI.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.4. Lateral Flow Device testing The previously described lateral flow device is&#xD;
           evaluated in BALs from patients at risk for invasive aspergillosis. Briefly, an&#xD;
           immunoglobulin G (IgG) monoclonal antibody (JF5) to an epitope on an extracellular&#xD;
           antigen secreted constitutively during active growth of Aspergillus is immobilized to a&#xD;
           capture zone on a porous nitrocellulose membrane. JF5 IgG is also conjugated to&#xD;
           colloidal gold particles to serve as the detection reagent. BAL fluid (100 μl of neat&#xD;
           sample, with no pre-treatment) is added to a release pad containing the antibody-gold&#xD;
           conjugate, which bound the target antigen, and then passed along the porous membrane and&#xD;
           bound to JF5 IgG monoclonal antibody immobilized in the capture zone. Lateral Flow&#xD;
           Device (LFD) Results will be read 15 minutes after loading the sample. Bound&#xD;
           antigen-antibody-gold complexes are observed as a red line (T for test) with an&#xD;
           intensity proportional to the antigen concentration and were classified as negative,&#xD;
           weakly positive, moderately positive, or strongly positive (Fig. 1). Anti-mouse&#xD;
           immunoglobulin immobilized to the membrane in a separate zone (C for control) serves as&#xD;
           an internal control (13, 15). Detailed product information can be found in the attached&#xD;
           publication &quot;Development of an Immunochromatographic Lateral-Flow Device for Rapid&#xD;
           Serodiagnosis of Invasive Aspergillosis&quot; (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
           As the device is in the process of being CE marked for European use as a medical&#xD;
           diagnostic device, one can only view the current results as a multicentre prototype test&#xD;
           comparison (with no clinical implications for patient management).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical Considerations Statistical analysis including multivariate analyses will be&#xD;
           performed in cooperation with ao. Univ. Prof. Dipl.-Ing. Dr. tech. Josef Haas from the&#xD;
           Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Documentation, Medical University of&#xD;
           Graz and Univ. Doz. Mag. Dr. Herbert Schwetz, University of Salzburg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. Sample size calculation Due to the explorative study design statistical sample size&#xD;
      calculation is not possible. The samples size has been calculated by using recent published&#xD;
      epidemiological data from involved centres (3, 16). The proposed number of patients to be&#xD;
      investigated is representative and appropriate to generate data for further studies and has&#xD;
      been considered to be adequate by the statistical advisor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis will be performed by using SPSS in cooperation&#xD;
      with our specialized co-operators mentioned above.&#xD;

        All stored or routinely obtained BAL samples from adult patients at risk for invasive&#xD;
        pulmonary Aspergillosis will be eligible for study inclusion. The treating clinicians will&#xD;
        be blinded to BAL Lateral Flow Device test results and the test will therefore have no&#xD;
        impact on patient management / treatment decisions. The treating clinicians will be blinded&#xD;
        to BAL Lateral Flow Device test results. Test results will therefore have no impact on&#xD;
        clinical / treatment decisions and therefore not affect the included patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Underlying diseases, EORTC status of IFI (both available from the clinical order&#xD;
        accompanying the BAL sample) and other microbiological/mycological test results will be&#xD;
        recorded in an electronic data base. No patient related personal data will be required.&#xD;
