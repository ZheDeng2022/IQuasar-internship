  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is the hypothesis of this protocol that a subset of NSCLC patients with stage IVa disease&#xD;
      can benefit from curative therapy and extends beyond the very limited subset of&#xD;
      oligometastatic patients that have already been studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patiently will be aggressively treated with 4 cycles of full dose&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy with concurrent radiation therapy to the primary tumor and&#xD;
      identified mediastinal lymph nodal metastatic drainage. Local curative radiation will then&#xD;
      target the oligometastatic tumor sites.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological or cytological documented NSCLC, including squamous cell carcinoma,&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma including large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and&#xD;
             poorly differentiated (not otherwise specified - NOS) non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
             Bronchial alveolar adenocarcinoma and totally resected tumors are excluded. All&#xD;
             histology is to be reviewed at East Carolina University or designated participating&#xD;
             center.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Stage II-IIIB intra-thoracic disease with oligometastatic disease&#xD;
             (hereafter referred to as &quot;Stage IVa&quot; disease) are eligible. Definition of Stage IVa:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Metastatic disease; either biopsy proven or with strong radiographic evidence suggesting&#xD;
        its existence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        As determined by CT, MRI or PET no more than five distinct metastatic sites. All metastatic&#xD;
        disease must be anatomically located in such a way as to permit a reasonable attempt at&#xD;
        permanent ablation. Ablative measures may include surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, and&#xD;
        external beam therapy. Patients who meet the minimal metastatic disease requirement and who&#xD;
        would otherwise have been staged II, IIIA or IIIB.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with tumors adjacent to a vertebral body are eligible as long as all gross&#xD;
             disease can be encompassed in the radiation boost field.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;

             hepatic function defined as: total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dl, and adequate renal function&#xD;
             defined as a serum creatinine level ≤ 2.0 mg/dl.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy that would interfere with delivery of&#xD;
             treatment as outlined above as judged by the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cytologically malignant effusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic disease beyond what is described in section 3.1.2.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with &gt; grade 2 neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of malignancy in the past 2 years except for adequately treated basal cell or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
