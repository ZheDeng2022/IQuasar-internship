    <textblock>
      The dialysis patient of chronic kidney disease and parathyroid hormone levels greater than or&#xD;
      equal to 800 Pg per ml were divided into two groups by randomized 1:1, one group to receive&#xD;
      medication and a control group that did not receive the medication. By group to receive in&#xD;
      those taking 25 mg per day to get the default dose and the dose is adjusted according to the&#xD;
      levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone. By adjusting the dose of 25 mg every 3 weeks for a&#xD;
      period of 12 weeks, the drug is between 25-75 mg dose , with a maximum dose of not more than&#xD;
      100 mg per day (weeks 3, 6 , 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a follow-up treatment in weeks 12, 24 and 36 with an blood,ultrasound test parathyroid&#xD;
      glands , abdominal x-ray side . To evaluate the changes without the drug .Unless the track&#xD;
      during treatment the patients with low blood calcium levels over 8.4 mg per dL . No dose&#xD;
      adjustment . regpara while if blood calcium levels less than 7.5 mg per deciliter . Must be&#xD;
      stop taking medication for patients in the control group will receive standard treatment .&#xD;
      Which consisted of dose vitamin D sterol and parathyroid surgery . Unable to control the&#xD;
      level of parathyroid hormone with vitamin D sterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While participating in the research are not allowed to adjust the amount of vitamin D sterol&#xD;
      in the two groups . But the amount of dialysate calcium phosphate binders and can be adjusted&#xD;
      as appropriate to healthcare is fine .&#xD;

      The renal impairment is caused FGF-23 resistance to the congestion of phosphate and stimulate&#xD;
      the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from the parathyroid gland causes secondary&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism. They also found that high levels of FGF-23 is also a risk factor of&#xD;
      vascular calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) is a disorder caused by renal&#xD;
      impairment cause abnormalities occurring in the body. Can be summarized into three main parts&#xD;
      as follows : 1) The disorders of minerals and hormones (laboratory abnormalities) such as&#xD;
      hyperphosphatemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism. 2 ) The disorders of bone (bone&#xD;
      abnormalities) , formerly known as renal osteodystrophy 3) The vascular calcification which&#xD;
      results happened increase the risk of heart disease and stroke (cardiovascular disease) ,&#xD;
      broken bones (fractures) and death rate (mortality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary hyperparathyroidism. PTH secretion from parathyroid glands are more than normal&#xD;
      and a major cause of the congestion of phosphate , reduced levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D&#xD;
      [1,25 (OH) 2D] in the blood and a decrease in blood calcium levels decreased calcium levels&#xD;
      in the blood is low. will result in a calcium (calcium sensing receptor or CaSR) on&#xD;
      parathyroid glands make parathyroid cell signaling and increased PTH secretion .&#xD;
&#xD;
      That PTH increased continuously in the long run will cause the destruction of the bone called&#xD;
      bone decay know &quot;osteitis fibrosa&quot;. Some patients with a bone fracture. Important&#xD;
      characteristics of osteitis fibrosa is an increase of bone destruction(osteoclastic bone&#xD;
      resorption). In addition, the bone marrow may also be found associated with bone marrow&#xD;
      fibrosis which causes anemia and did not respond to erythropoietin.&#xD;
