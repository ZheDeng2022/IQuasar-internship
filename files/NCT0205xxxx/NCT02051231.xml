    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide&#xD;
      and is caused most commonly by poor uterine muscle tone after delivery. The first line agent&#xD;
      used in the prevention and treatment of PPH is oxytocin, which acts by binding with oxytocin&#xD;
      receptors (OTR) found on myometrial cells to cause uterine contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who require augmentation of labour with oxytocin because of inadequate labour&#xD;
      progression are at increased risk of PPH because they have received intravenous oxytocin&#xD;
      which exposes the uterus (and OTR) to doses greater than would normally be found without&#xD;
      medical intervention. This exposure results in OTR desensitization and decreased uterine&#xD;
      sensitivity to oxytocin which may lead to the use of much higher doses of oxytocin (up to 9x)&#xD;
      or other agents for preventing and treating PPH with the potential for causing serious&#xD;
      drug-related morbidity or fatality to the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, in women who have failed labour augmentation and need to have a Cesarean delivery,&#xD;
      it is not known if it would be beneficial to wait a certain period of time after&#xD;
      discontinuing intravenous oxytocin before proceeding with the operation. The goal of the&#xD;
      waiting time would be to allow the OTRs to recover and resensitize the uterus to the effects&#xD;
      of oxytocin to avoid the need for high doses or additional uterus-contracting agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that there will be a positive correlation between the magnitude of recovery&#xD;
      of the myometrium's response to oxytocin and the time elapsed from the desensitizing oxytocin&#xD;
      pretreatment (simulated labour augmentation).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have previously established an in vitro model of labour augmentation and&#xD;
      myometrial desensitization using pregnant human myometrium and an isometric tension recording&#xD;
      device. The investigators propose to use this model in order to characterize the time course&#xD;
      of recovery of oxytocin-desensitized myometrium to oxytocin sensitivity. These results will&#xD;
      help in establishing whether myometrial recovery can occur within a clinically relevant time&#xD;
      period, how much sensitivity is recovered, and the duration required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical setting of failed labour augmentation and OTR desensitization, it is not&#xD;
      known if it is beneficial to wait a certain period of time after discontinuing intravenous&#xD;
      oxytocin before proceeding to Cesarean section to allow for resensitization of the myometrium&#xD;
      to oxytocin. The results of this study will provide insight into the time course of recovery&#xD;
      of the myometrium using an in vitro model of failed labour augmentation. Based on the&#xD;
      oxytocin dose-response curves after variable periods of time of &quot;rest&quot;, the investigators&#xD;
      will be able to determine the degree of recovery of myometrial contractility over time and&#xD;
      whether this will occur in a clinically relevant time period for implementation into clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
