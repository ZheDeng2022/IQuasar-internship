      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Pluripotent stem cells are cells that can be converted to any type of cell (muscle, nerve,&#xD;
      liver, etc.). Researchers are collecting blood samples to develop way to make a special cell&#xD;
      product called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSCs may be used to repair or replace&#xD;
      organs and tissues, produce blood and immune cells for transfusion, or correct inherited&#xD;
      immune and blood diseases. iPSCs can be made from many kinds samples, such as skin, blood, or&#xD;
      hair. This is different from embryonic stem cells, which can only be derived from embryos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To develop new methods to make iPSCs; to identify better ways to collect, produce, and grow&#xD;
      them; and to make an iPSC bank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy adults and adults already in a treatment protocol who have a medical condition that&#xD;
      could be treated with iPSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be screened with questionnaire, physical exam, and blood and HIV&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will donate 4 tablespoons of blood. It will be taken by needle from a vein in their arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants already in another protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will have their blood collected, separated in a lab, and iPSCs grown in large numbers.&#xD;
           Some may have their sample given back to them as a treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Samples will be kept in the study up to 5 years or until a participant withdraws from&#xD;
           the study or becomes ineligible to participate, or the study is closed. If participants&#xD;
           have not withdrawn their consent, they may be contacted in the future to donate again.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be produced from small quantities of blood.&#xD;
      Clinical protocols to treat several diseases using iPSCs or cells derived from iPSCs are&#xD;
      being developed by intramural investigators, i.e., investigators in National Institute of&#xD;
      Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and National Eye Institute (NEI). This clinical&#xD;
      protocol will allow personnel in the Cell Processing Service (CPS) of the Department of&#xD;
      Transfusion Medicine (DTM) to collect blood from healthy donors or patients with diseases&#xD;
      targeted in IRB-approved treatment protocols to manufacture iPSCs or iPSC derived products to&#xD;
      support these intramural investigators. CPS DTM will submit a Drug Master File (DMF) to the&#xD;
      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the manufacture and testing of these products. When&#xD;
      iPSCs are used clinically in some cases the donors will be the recipients of the iPSCs, or&#xD;
      the ex vivo expanded and differentiated iPSCs (autologous therapy). In other cases, healthy&#xD;
      subjects will serve as donors of the blood used as starting material for manufacturing iPSCs&#xD;
      (allogeneic therapy) where no matching of HLA or other antigens is required between the&#xD;
      healthy blood donor and the iPSC recipient. While methods to produce and expand iPSCs have&#xD;
      been described, they must be modified periodically to meet changing Good Manufacturing&#xD;
      Practices (GMP) requirements for manufacturing clinical cell and gene therapies, therefore&#xD;
      peripheral blood for iPSCs from normal donors is needed for research and development.&#xD;
