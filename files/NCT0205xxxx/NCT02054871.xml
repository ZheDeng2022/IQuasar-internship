    <textblock>
      This study aims to demonstrate if remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) may confer renal&#xD;
      protection in patients undergoing peripheral angioplasty. Patients will be randomised to&#xD;
      receive RIPC and biomarkers for renal injury will be analysed post procedure to determine if&#xD;
      any protective benefit was obtained.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischaemic preconditioning is an endogenous mammalian mechanism whereby a brief period of&#xD;
      ischaemia and reperfusion confers resistance to subsequent prolonged ischaemic insults. First&#xD;
      observed in the canine heart, subsequent investigators noted that brief ischaemia in remote&#xD;
      organs e.g. skeletal muscle, induced protection in key central organs e.g. the heart. This&#xD;
      remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) does not require direct interference with the target&#xD;
      organs' blood supply. It can be induced using blood pressure cuffs to produce brief episodes&#xD;
      of upper limb ischaemia and reperfusion and confers protection upon numerous organs&#xD;
      simultaneously. RIPC reduces myocardial injury following aortic aneurysm repair, cardiac&#xD;
      surgery and angioplasty. It also reduces adverse ischaemic events up to six months following&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention, implying some medium-term effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date ischaemic conditioning has been applied primarily to the heart however animal studies&#xD;
      have shown pre conditioning to offer renal protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fikret et al in 2012 in the Renal Protection Trial demonstrated a protective benefit with&#xD;
      RIPC from the development of CIN in high risk patients undergoing elective coronary&#xD;
      angiography.Whittaker and Przyklenk in 2011 explored this concept retrospectively using data&#xD;
      from patients who had undergone emergency angioplasty for ST elevation myocardial infarction.&#xD;
      The original trial was a RCT which examined the protective effect of postconditioning on&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia. The authors retrospectively examined if study patients treated with&#xD;
      multiple coronary balloon inflations had better renal function than patients not exposed to&#xD;
      this remote conditioning. They concluded that patients in the conditioning group received 25%&#xD;
      more contrast volume than the control group and showed no decline in renal function as&#xD;
      demonstrated by examination of glomular filtration rate at day 3 post procedure in comparison&#xD;
      to the control group which saw a significant decline in renal function. The need for&#xD;
      contrast-based procedures is rising, with increasing numbers of patients undergoing&#xD;
      endovascular procedures, as is the incidence of postcontrast renal failure, which has a&#xD;
      reported mortality of 34%. The potential use of RIPC therefore to reduce the risk of kidney&#xD;
      damage needs further investigation in a prospective study and the PAD patient group who are&#xD;
      routinely exposed to contrast administration in angiography are an ideal study group.&#xD;

    <description>Experimental: RIPC Remote preconditioning Calculated EGFR based on MDRD. Patients receive intravenous fluids preprocedure as additional renal protection.&#xD;
Preconditioning will be performed in the same manner as several previous trials. Immediately prior to angiography a CE-approved blood pressure cuff will be placed around one arm of the patient. It will then be inflated to a pressure of 200mmHg for 5 minutes. For patients with a systolic blood pressure &gt;185mmHg, the cuff will be inflated to at least 15mmHg above the patient's systolic blood pressure. The cuff will then be deflated and the arm allowed reperfuse for 5 minutes. This will be repeated so that each patient receives a total of 4 ischaemia-reperfusion cycles.</description>
