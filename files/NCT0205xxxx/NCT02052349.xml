        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Body mass index of 18.0 to 35.0 kg/m2 or, if outside the range, considered not&#xD;
             clinically significant by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must demonstrate their ability to swallow an empty size 000 capsule&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must be willing and able to communicate and participate in the whole study&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Must provide written informed consent&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participation in a clinical research study within the previous 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of any drug or alcohol abuse in the past 2 years or current smokers and those&#xD;
             who have smoked within the last 12 months. A breath carbon monoxide reading of greater&#xD;
             than 10 ppm at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Females of childbearing potential who are pregnant or lactating (female subjects must&#xD;
             have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and admission)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Radiation exposure, including that from the present study, excluding background&#xD;
             radiation but including diagnostic xrays and other medical exposures, exceeding 5&#xD;
             (micro sievert) mSv in the last 12 months or 10 mSv in the last 5 years. No&#xD;
             occupationally exposed worker, as defined in the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999,&#xD;
             shall participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Positive hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M (HAVIgM), hepatitis B surface antigen&#xD;
             (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
             results&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Donation or loss of greater than 400 mL of blood within the previous 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects who are taking, or have taken, any prescribed or over-the-counter drug (other&#xD;
             than 4 g per day paracetamol, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and hormonal&#xD;
             contraception) or herbal remedies in the 14 days before Investigational Medical&#xD;
             Product (IMP) administration. Exceptions may apply on a case by case basis if&#xD;
             considered not to interfere with the objectives of the study by both the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator (or delegate) and sponsor's medical monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Acute diarrhoea or constipation in the 7 days before the predicted first study day. If&#xD;
             screening occurs &gt;7 days before the first study day, this criterion will be determined&#xD;
             on first study day. Diarrhoea will be defined as the passage of liquid faeces and/or a&#xD;
             stool frequency of greater than 3 times per day. Constipation will be defined as a&#xD;
             failure to open the bowels more frequently than every other day&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Presence of non-removable metal objects such as metal plates, screws, etc, in the&#xD;
