  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccines are one of our most effective public health tools but many who need them don't&#xD;
      respond well and are not protected. Adjuvants boost immune responses and are commonly&#xD;
      included in vaccine preparations. Bisphosphonates are the most commonly prescribed treatment&#xD;
      for osteoporosis and may represent a new class of adjuvant. Bisphosphonates are well&#xD;
      tolerated with chronic administration and have very few adverse effects. Research suggests&#xD;
      that these medications can stimulate the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bisphosphonates are of special interest in populations with impaired immunity and an&#xD;
      inability to amount protective antibody responses following immunizations. We propose a pilot&#xD;
      study to evaluate the clinical relevance of this finding in humans. We will study the effect&#xD;
      of bisphosphonates on quantitative humoral immune response to hepatitis B vaccine in healthy&#xD;
      older volunteers who have not previously received this vaccine.&#xD;

      Background: Immunization is one of the most beneficial and cost-effective disease prevention&#xD;
      measures available, but is not always efficacious, especially in older and immunosuppressed&#xD;
      populations. This commonly encountered failure to produce protective antibodies following&#xD;
      immunization leaves large parts of the population vulnerable to serious morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality resulting from potentially preventable communicable diseases. Bisphosphonates, a&#xD;
      commonly prescribed treatment for osteoporosis that is well tolerated with few adverse&#xD;
      effects, has recently been shown to enhance B cell expansion and antibody production after&#xD;
      vaccination in mice, and may represent a new vaccine adjuvant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effect of bisphosphonates on the immune&#xD;
      response to vaccination in adults using two complementary research methodologies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluating the effect of bisphosphonates on quantitative humoral immune response to&#xD;
           hepatitis B vaccine in healthy older volunteers through a randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluating the effect of bisphosphonate treatment on protection against influenza and&#xD;
           influenza-like illness after seasonal Influenza immunization in the adult population&#xD;
           through a population-level retrospective analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The first part of the study consists of a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study&#xD;
      in which 20 healthy adults 40-70 years of age who are seronegative for Hepatitis B, will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either two doses of intramuscular hepatitis B vaccine with alendronate&#xD;
      or hepatitis B vaccine with placebo. The primary outcome evaluated will be quantitative&#xD;
      anti-HB surface IgG antibody titers in the study group compared to the placebo group at week&#xD;
      8 and at 6 months. The second part of the study is a retrospective population based&#xD;
      case-control study utilizing extensive available data repositories. Rates of influenza,&#xD;
      influenza-like illness and lower respiratory tract infections per 1000 subjects will be&#xD;
      ascertained and compared between study and control populations for each year, while adjusting&#xD;
      for potential confounders.&#xD;

    <description>Safety is assessed by clinical symptoms and exam at final in-person visit. Standardized CTAE will be recorded and graded (mild/moderate/severe) with a special focus on vaccine related adverse events: Temperature, local injection site reactions, fatigue and malaise, AND adverse events related to alendronate which are primarily gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, esophagitis, ulceration. Rare, unlikely events such as atypical fractures and jaw osteonecrosis are extremely unlikely with this duration of dosing (4 weekly doses) but will also be specifically sought.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks to 5 months after final alendronate dose</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy is assessed by quantitative Anti Hepatitis B Surface IgG (immunoglobulin G) antibody titers in international units (iU) per ml. All subjects must have levels of ZERO in order to participate. A value of 10 iU/ml is considered protective. Titers directed against hepatitis B surface antigen will be measured by commercially available testing Efficacy will also be assessed as a categorical value: Yes/No for protective level of antibody achieved at either 8 weeks or 6 months (5 months after second vaccination). A protective level of hepatitis B surface antibody is defined as 10 iU/ml; levels of 10-100 are considered protective but &quot;poorly responsive.&quot; We will compare mean titers between groups (placebo vs. alendronate). We believe a mean increase of 20% is likely clinically significant/important.</description>
