    <textblock>
      The first part of this study is to find the recommended dosages of a combination of two&#xD;
      drugs: pazopanib and fosbretabulin, which will be given to female patients with relapsed&#xD;
      ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the study involves comparing the recommended dose of pazopanib and&#xD;
      fosbretabulin in combination against pazopanib alone in female patients with relapsed ovarian&#xD;
      cancer to determine whether the combination is more beneficial that pazopanib on it's own.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is the fourth biggest contributor to female cancer mortality, accounting for&#xD;
      4% of all malignancies diagnosed in women. In the United Kingdom (UK), there are seven&#xD;
      thousand new cases of ovarian cancer annually and four thousand two hundred deaths from the&#xD;
      disease. The standard treatment approach currently consists of surgical debulking and&#xD;
      chemotherapy, usually based around a combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel. Most ovarian&#xD;
      cancers are initially chemo-responsive however the majority of patients whose disease&#xD;
      initially responds subsequently develop recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patients recur, treatment options become less numerous and less effective. Progression&#xD;
      free survival rates for platinum-sensitive disease are only about 13 months and the outlook&#xD;
      for patients with platinum-resistant disease is much worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is exploring a new combination of drugs fosbretabulin, a vascular disrupting agent&#xD;
      and pazopanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. There is scientific rational for combining these&#xD;
      two types of drugs as they should be able to work in combination through contrasting&#xD;
      mechanisms of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the study is a dose finding exercise with cohorts of patients being given&#xD;
      drugs with in combination until the recommended dose of both drugs is found. Patients in each&#xD;
      cohort will be monitored closely for safety and drug toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the study has a randomised component where patients will receive the&#xD;
      combination of drugs or pazopanib alone with the aim to determine whether there is an&#xD;
      advantage in progression free survival for patients that receive pazopanib and fosbretabulin.&#xD;
      This will be monitored by RECIST.&#xD;
