  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a lead-in dose escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended Phase II dose of OPB-51602&#xD;
      administered on a weekly basis in subjects with advanced malignancies. Using the recommended&#xD;
      phase II dose, the efficacy and tolerability of OPB-51602 administered prior to definitive&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy will be evaluated in locally advanced NPC patients. This study's&#xD;
      overarching goal is the development of STAT3 inhibitors as a novel class of anti-cancer&#xD;
      agents and the optimization of patient selection for STAT3 inhibitor therapy through parallel&#xD;
      biomarker studies. This study hopes to establish a therapeutic window for OPB-51602 in solid&#xD;
      tumours and will evaluate its potential as a targeted therapy of NPC, since this represents a&#xD;
      critical unmet clinical need. The development of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers in&#xD;
      tandem with the clinical evaluation of OPB-51602 will be crucial to its therapeutic&#xD;
      advancement and will enable an understanding of the genetic contexts of responsiveness and&#xD;
      resistance to OPB-51602, which can in turn lead to the development of effective drug&#xD;
      combinations to overcome resistance.The study hypothesizes that OPB-51602, a first-in-class&#xD;
      STAT3 inhibitor, is efficacious in solid tumours with constitutively activated STAT3, such as&#xD;
      NPC.&#xD;

      Part I This is a lead-in dose-finding, open-label, non-randomised study of OPB-51602 in&#xD;
      patients with advanced refractory solid tumours who have biopsy-amenable lesions at study&#xD;
      entry. Using a starting dose of 10mg per week, an accelerated dose titration escalation&#xD;
      followed by a 3+3 design will be employed until MTD and recommended weekly dose are&#xD;
      determined. Following this, an expansion cohort of 10 patients will be enrolled to establish&#xD;
      safety of the recommended phase II dose. Additionally, it is also planned to explore the&#xD;
      efficacy of the agent in an enrichment cohort of approximately 10 metastatic NPC patients.&#xD;
      One treatment cycle is defined as a period of 28 days. Tumour biopsies will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline while blood sampling for circulating biomarkers will be performed on days 1, 2, 3,&#xD;
      8, 22 and upon completion of OPB-51602 dosing. Pharmacokinetic sampling will be done on Cycle&#xD;
      1 Days 1, 8 and 22. Safety assessments will be performed weekly till week 8, bi-weekly till&#xD;
      week 16, then monthly thereafter and response assessments will be performed every 8 weeks.&#xD;
      The number of subjects estimated to participate in this study will depend on the number of&#xD;
      cohorts enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II This is a single-centre, open-label non-randomised phase II study evaluating&#xD;
      OPB-51602 in stage III-IVB NPC conducted in the window period prior to definitive&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy. Eligible patients will receive OPB-51602 on a weekly basis (Day 1, 8, 15)&#xD;
      at the recommended dose determined in part I for a total of 15 days prior to definitive&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy. Response assessment will be performed after OPB-51602 dosing on day 15&#xD;
      using PET/CT scans and clinical tumour measurements, while other radiologic assessments will&#xD;
      be performed on the completion of chemoradiotherapy. Safety assessments will be performed at&#xD;
      weekly intervals until day 22 or until toxicities related to the study treatment have been&#xD;
      resolved. Tumour biopsies will be performed at baseline and day 15 while circulating&#xD;
      biomarker studies will be performed on days 1, 2, 3, 8, 15 and upon completion of&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy. There is no mandated rest period between the administration of study drug&#xD;
      and definitive chemoradiotherapy. The decision to proceed with chemoradiotherapy is at the&#xD;
      discretion of individual investigators, provided the subject has recovered or is recovering&#xD;
      from all significant toxicities of the study drug. Chemoradiotherapy should be in accordance&#xD;
      with the institutional standard and induction chemotherapy is not permitted. Proposed&#xD;
      alternative treatment regimens must receive the approval of the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
