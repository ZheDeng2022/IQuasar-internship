  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-site trial assessing the sensitivity of DENV Detect™ NS1 ELISA versus&#xD;
      standard reference tests (e.g. PCR or viral culture) for dengue diagnosis in the US and&#xD;
      internationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DENV Detect™ NS1 ELISA serves as an aid in the clinical laboratory diagnosis of early&#xD;
      stages of Dengue infection in patients with clinical symptoms consistent with Dengue&#xD;
      infection. This test is intended to be used on sera obtained within the first 7 days of&#xD;
      symptoms. DENV Detect™ NS1 ELISA results (positive or negative) must be confirmed by testing&#xD;
      with a reference standard test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be patients who present with symptoms consistent with dengue infection, such as&#xD;
      fever and myalgia. After informed consent is obtained and the subject is screened for&#xD;
      eligibility, 2 diagnostic samples will be collected. The first will be collected within the&#xD;
      first 7 days of symptoms onset, and the second will be collected at least 7 days later,&#xD;
      between the 10th and 21st days post-onset of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELISA and reference tests will be performed by different operators who are laboratory staff&#xD;
      members. These staff members, blinded to each other's results, will evaluate the samples from&#xD;
      each method independently.&#xD;

        Human males and females of varying ages and geographical locations where dengue fever is&#xD;
        endemic. We will use retrospective (archived) and prospective human serum samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Some study sites will only use retrospective (archived) serum samples not collected&#xD;
        specifically for this study and not individually identifiable to the Investigators. These&#xD;
        samples will fall under the category of &quot;leftover&quot; specimens as described by FDA guidance.&#xD;
        These archived samples will have been collected from patients within 7 days after onset of&#xD;
        symptoms consistent with Dengue infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition paired prospective samples will be collected in compliance with human subject&#xD;
        protection. The prospective samples will be collected from patients with symptoms&#xD;
        consistent with Dengue infection. The first sample will be collected within the first 7&#xD;
        days of symptom onset; the second sample will be collected: 1) at least seven days later;&#xD;
        and 2) between the 10th and 21st day of symptom onset.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All age groups and both sexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Initial serum samples must be collected within 1- 7 days of onset of symptoms&#xD;
             consistent with Dengue virus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Information must be available about symptoms, age, and sex of patient from which&#xD;
             samples are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The location of sample collection must be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Archived samples that have been sent to reference labs for dengue or flavivirus&#xD;
             testing should be considered for inclusion as test specimens in this study. If these&#xD;
             specimens are included in this study, then they must have a documented history that&#xD;
             the specimen was obtained within the first 7 days of onset of subject symptoms&#xD;
             consistent with dengue infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Archived samples with linked personal identifiers or any sample for which personal&#xD;
             information can be discovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prospective samples from nursing home residents; inmates/subjects in police custody;&#xD;
             participants who are unable to understand verbal or written local language in which a&#xD;
             certified translation of the informed consent is available, or requires a Legal&#xD;
             Authorized Representative (LAR) for consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject serum specimens that have undergone more than 2 freeze-thaw cycles or that&#xD;
             have not been stored frozen.&#xD;
