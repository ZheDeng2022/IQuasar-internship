  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In HIV+ cigarette smokers, with no prior history of pulmonary infections, emphysema is often&#xD;
      developed at an earlier age and is a significant cause of morbidity despite treatment with&#xD;
      antiretroviral drugs. Preliminary data gathered from HIV+ individuals that smoke cigarettes&#xD;
      strongly support the hypothesis that the combination of HIV infection and smoking creates&#xD;
      increased stress in the lower respiratory tract. To examine the underlying factors that&#xD;
      contribute to the accelerated development of emphysema in this cohort, samples from the lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract will be provided by HIV+ and HIV- subjects. The samples collected will&#xD;
      serve as biomarkers for assessing the onset of emphysema.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is to analyze biologic samples from the blood, airways and/or urine&#xD;
      of HIV- and HIV+ smokers and non-smokers to better understand the etiology and pathogenesis&#xD;
      of emphysema in association with HIV infection. The underlying hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      combination of HIV infection and smoking creates chronic oxidant stress in the lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract that promotes cellular loss and contributes to the progressive development&#xD;
      of emphysema. Preliminary data strongly supports our hypothesis that the accelerated&#xD;
      development of emphysema among HIV+ smokers is due in part to the interaction of HIV directly&#xD;
      on the macrophage found in the pulmonary alveolus. The interaction causes a release of&#xD;
      exaggerated amounts of oxidants in the lower respiratory tract and leads to increased levels&#xD;
      of oxidized metabolites. HIV+ individuals with emphysema have high plasma levels of apoptotic&#xD;
      pulmonary capillary-derived micro particles that contain oxidized metabolites. The increased&#xD;
      release of micro particles is characteristic of an apoptotic process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study this hypothesis by sampling HIV+ and HIV- subjects alveolar macrophages (AM),&#xD;
      which are found on the epithelial surface of the lung, and epithelial lining fluid (ELF)&#xD;
      found in the lower respiratory tract. We will also assess plasma pulmonary capillary-derived&#xD;
      endothelial microparticles (EMPs) as a biomarker for pulmonary apoptosis. Using newly&#xD;
      developed mass spectrometry methodologies, we will quantify the oxidant stress of AM, ELF and&#xD;
      plasma EMPs, and identify specific oxidized metabolites within each of these compartments.&#xD;
      Finally, we will examine the interaction in vitro to tease apart the contribution of each&#xD;
      component (AM, ELF, and plasma EMPs) of the interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess this concept, the following aims will be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 (n=160). To explore the extent of the oxidant stress in the lower respiratory&#xD;
      tract in association with HIV infection and smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 (n=160). To evaluate plasma levels of capillary apoptosis and oxidation state&#xD;
      of HIV+ nonsmokers and smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3 (n=160). To examine the interaction of pulmonary capillary endothelium and&#xD;
      various oxidant effector components to identify oxidant-vulnerable pathways relevant to the&#xD;
      development of new treatment therapies.&#xD;
