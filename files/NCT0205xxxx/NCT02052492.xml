  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activated macrophages, present in excess during natural inflammatory responses, bear the&#xD;
      potential to kill and eradicate cancer cells. Macrophage activation has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      require the serum-borne vitamin D binding protein (known as Gc protein), as well as B and T&#xD;
      lymphocytes. However, in various cancer patients the Gc protein is deglycosylated by serum&#xD;
      α-N-acetyl galactosaminidase (Nagalase) secreted from cancer cells. This deglycosylated Gc&#xD;
      protein, lacking the N-acetylgalactosamine monosaccharide, cannot be converted to its form of&#xD;
      Macrophage Activating Factor, leading to immunosuppression rather than Macrophage activation&#xD;
      against cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efranat has developed cancer immunotherapy based on Macrophage Activating Factor produced&#xD;
      from natural Gc protein extracted from FDA approved healthy human plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase I study, the treatment is given as Intramuscular, once-weekly injection of&#xD;
      EF-022, for two courses, while each course is comprised of 4 injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational treatment is expected to enhance immune response, thereby, improve&#xD;
      patient's well being, quality of life and disease control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the safety and tolerability of EF-022 and to define the maximal tolerated&#xD;
           dose (MTD) for potential administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of EF-022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the 'Recommended Phase 2 Dose' (RP2D) based on MTD data, immunological and&#xD;
           pharmacodynamics markers&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore preliminary efficacy of EF-022 in advanced solid tumors according to the&#xD;
           'Response Evaluation Criteria in the modified Solid Tumors' (RECIST 1.1) and blood&#xD;
           levels of tumor-related markers known to reflect tumor burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess levels of immune-related factors in peripheral blood (determined by FACS&#xD;
           analysis), reflecting induced immunological activities, including but not limited to,&#xD;
           natural killer (NK), monocytes (M1 and M2) and T cell subpopulations (effector vs&#xD;
           regulatory, CD4+ and CD8+ cells), B cells (CD20), myeloid and dendritic cells etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the change in serum levels of protein biomarkers in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To immunohistochemically assess and compare tumor derived tissue samples Pre and post&#xD;
           treatment. To analyze the infiltration of different population of cells into the tumor&#xD;
           bed.&#xD;

      Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be assigned, successively in order of accrual, to one of the three&#xD;
      cohorts, to receive intramuscular (IM) injections of EF-022, once weekly for two courses of&#xD;
      treatment. Each course will consist of 4 injections with one week intervals (total: 8 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will only proceed in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during&#xD;
      course 1. For this purpose, each cohort will only begin its first course of EF-022 when the&#xD;
      cohort preceding it has successfully completed its first 4-week treatment course without any&#xD;
      signs of DLT. During this first course, should 1/3 patients experience DLT, dose escalation&#xD;
      for the next cohort will not be authorized; the next cohort will receive the same dose as the&#xD;
      one preceding it. If 2 patients or more of all patients treated with a given dose develop&#xD;
      DLT, dose escalation will be halted and no more patients will be treated at the DLT dose. The&#xD;
      value of MTD will be defined as the EF-022 dose below the dose at which DLT was seen for at&#xD;
      least 2 subjects. Upon determination of the MTD, an additional cohort will be opened&#xD;
      (confirmatory cohort) and treated with two courses of that dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the expanded cohort, 24 Patients will be allocated to receive either 100ng, 500ng or&#xD;
      1000ng weekly treatment as detailed below: The first 18 patients will be assigned to&#xD;
      alternating doses of either 100ng or 500ng in a sequential manner (each patient will be&#xD;
      assigned to a single dose), with the caveat that given indications should be assigned&#xD;
      equally, as much as possible, between these two doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis will be performed once the 12th patient reaches Day 57 and the CT results as&#xD;
      well as PD analysis are available for at least 12 patients, while at least 18 patients have&#xD;
      begun study treatment. A decision regarding adding a 1000ng dose cohort vs. continuing with&#xD;
      the 100ng and 500ng doses will be based on a discussion of the interim analysis results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive 2 courses of treatment, i.e. weekly injections for a total period&#xD;
      of 8 weeks, followed by a follow-up period of up to 12 months from the start of treatment&#xD;
      (Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuation of treatment after the second course will be at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator. Patients who will continue extended treatment post course 2 will keep the&#xD;
      weekly injection dosage mode and continue therapy until disease progression, development of&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicities, non-compliance, inter-current illness that prevents treatment&#xD;
      continuation, withdrawal of consent, or change in subject condition that renders the subject&#xD;
      unacceptable for further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study patients who completed at least two courses of treatment will be followed up until&#xD;
      12 months from day 1 of treatment.&#xD;
