  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perinatal depression is a common and serious mood disorder that increases morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in new mothers and results in poor infant/child outcomes. Current therapies often&#xD;
      fail to produce recovery or are poorly tolerated and many pregnant women seek&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic therapy or forgo treatment when non-pharmacologic options are not&#xD;
      available. Expectant and new mothers who suffer from circadian rhythm disruption are at risk&#xD;
      for perinatal depression. This R34 Pilot Effectiveness Studies and Services Research Grant&#xD;
      seeks to test whether an Integrated Chronotherapy (IC) intervention can be implemented in an&#xD;
      outpatient psychiatry setting to improve treatment outcomes for patients with perinatal&#xD;
      depression. IC is a multicomponent treatment consisting of bright light therapy, sleep phase&#xD;
      advance, and sleep stabilization/restriction that targets the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)&#xD;
      constructs of circadian rhythms, sleep-wake behavior, social rhythms, and arousal. We will&#xD;
      assess the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of an IC intervention for perinatal&#xD;
      depressin by testing the treatment in expectant mothers diagnosed with major depressive&#xD;
      disorder during 3rd trimester of pregnancy. We will randomize patients to either: (a) usual&#xD;
      care (UC, n = 20) or (b) IC+UC (n = 20). IC+UC will have pregnancy and postpartum components&#xD;
      and will be administered via an individualized case formulation approach tailored to each&#xD;
      patient. After a baseline assessment, IC will be prescribed during 5 dedicated clinical&#xD;
      visits: three during 3rd trimester of pregnancy and 2 in the postpartum period. UC will&#xD;
      consist of medication administered by a perinatal psychiatrist and/or psychotherapy. UC will&#xD;
      be quantified in both groups to evaluate differences between the IC+UC and UC groups. Mood&#xD;
      will be measured in both groups by blinded clinician interview and patient self-report. We&#xD;
      will assess the safety profile of the IC intervention with evaluation of side effects/adverse&#xD;
      events. Importantly, the study will also examine the putative mechanisms by which IC is&#xD;
      hypothesized to work and the &quot;dose&quot; of IC received by patients in the IC+UC group. All&#xD;
      participants will wear wrist actigraphy/light monitors continuously during weeks 28-40 of&#xD;
      pregnancy and postpartum weeks 2-6 to assess light exposure and sleep duration and timing.&#xD;
      Circadian phase (measured with salivary dim light melatonin onset) will be measured at&#xD;
      baseline during pregnancy (~30 weeks gestation), at 36 weeks gestation, and at postpartum&#xD;
      week 6. This pilot will allow us to refine the IC intervention for future integration into&#xD;
      various clinical settings and establish an infrastructue for a larger (R01-scale) trial,&#xD;
      including measuring acceptability of IC among UC clinicians and implementing web-based data&#xD;
      collection to facilitate data sharing in the planned R01. Perinatal IC could have major&#xD;
      public health impact due to the high prevalence of perinatal depression and its negative&#xD;
      effects on mothers and their children. This project represents a first step toward achieving&#xD;
      this goal, as it will provide the pilot data necessary to prepare for a larger scale&#xD;
      intervention study focused on providing non-pharmacologic therapies and improving outcomes&#xD;
      for women with perinatal depression.&#xD;
