      Most vestibular schwannomas are benign and slow-growing. Based on that fact, conservative&#xD;
      management with serial imaging is a viable alternative. For patients who undergo treatment&#xD;
      because of tumor growth, progressive symptoms, or personal preference, options include serial&#xD;
      observation, microsurgical resection, fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, and&#xD;
      stereotactic single-session radiosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite improved radiosurgical techniques and lower marginal doses, a recent report has shown&#xD;
      a somewhat disappointing 10-year actuarial hearing preservation rate of 44.5%, with hearing&#xD;
      loss developing as much as 6 years after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fractionation of the prescribed dose may takes some advantages from radiobiologic principles&#xD;
      to reduce toxicity and maintain tumor control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staged frame-based radiotherapy using a 12-hour interfraction interval was successfully used&#xD;
      at Stanford university and has shown a hearing preservation rate of 77% at 2 years of&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present protocol is to evaluate the hearing preservation, the local control&#xD;
      and toxicity after single-session (sSRS) or multi-session (3 fractions) radiosurgery (mSRS)&#xD;
      by using the frameless robotic CyberKnife® system (Accuray Incorporated, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to investigate about this a randomised controlled double harm (sSRS vs mSRS) trial&#xD;
      was designed.&#xD;

      Single-session radiosurgery versus multi-sessions radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND Most vestibular schwannomas are benign and slow-growing. Based on that fact,&#xD;
      conservative management with serial imaging is a viable alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who undergo treatment because of tumor growth, progressive symptoms, or personal&#xD;
      preference, options include serial observation, microsurgical resection, fractionated&#xD;
      stereotactic radiotherapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There remains some debate as to how best to manage these tumors. Historically, vestibular&#xD;
      schwannomas have been treated with microsurgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loss of hearing and facial nerve injury, however, are not uncommon microsurgical&#xD;
      complications. Fractionated radiotherapy was used initially as an adjunct to microsurgery in&#xD;
      patients who had undergone subtotal resection, and it demonstrated the overall effectiveness&#xD;
      of radiation as a treating modality for vestibular schwannomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic radiosurgery has emerged as a safe and effective treatment modality for&#xD;
      vestibular schwannomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term data of stereotactic radiosurgery now support the efficacy of this treatment&#xD;
      modality in term of local control, but the concerns about hearing preservation still remain&#xD;
      debated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last decade, attention has been directed to improving the hearing preservation rates&#xD;
      following radiosurgery and reducing other treatment-related morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial radiosurgery series reported hearing preservation rates that ranged from 51% to 60%&#xD;
      with significant rates of facial weakness and numbness. Analysis of the more recent data&#xD;
      suggests that an overall hearing preservation rate of approximately 51% can be expected&#xD;
      approaching 3-4 years after radiosurgical treatment, and the analysis reveals that patients&#xD;
      treated with ≤13 Gy were more likely to have preserved hearing than patients receiving larger&#xD;
      doses of radiation. Furthermore, larger tumors and older patients do not appear to be at any&#xD;
      increased risk for hearing loss after SRS than younger patients or patients with smaller&#xD;
      tumors .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite improved radiosurgical techniques and lower marginal doses, a recent report has shown&#xD;
      a somewhat disappointing 10-year actuarial hearing preservation rate of 44.5%, with hearing&#xD;
      loss developing as much as 6 years after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have demonstrated that the total radiation dose to the cochlea is a critical factor&#xD;
      in hearing preservation. Fractionation of the total dose, or staging, however, also may play&#xD;
      a fundamental role. Staging radiation treatments long has been proposed as a means to reduce&#xD;
      the risk of injury to adjacent critical structures such as the brainstem, cranial nerves, and&#xD;
      cochlea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fractionation of the prescribed dose may take some advantages from radiobiologic principles&#xD;
      to reduce toxicity while maintaining tumour control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the present study is to compare outcome from single and multisession radiosurgery both&#xD;
      in terms of hearing preservation and local control by using the frameless, robotic&#xD;
      CyberKnife® system (Accuray Incorporated, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, from a radiobiological point of view, a high local dose of radiation in a single or&#xD;
      a few fractions would produce better tumour control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, limited fractionation could protect the surrounding normal tissues&#xD;
      (cochlea, brainstem, etc.) from injurious levels of radiation. This could improve the&#xD;
      therapeutic rationale for MSRS, especially for large (3 cm) lesions in proximity to critical&#xD;
      organs such as the brainstem or cochlear apparatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRETREATMENT EVALUATION Prior medical history and physical examination. Complete history,&#xD;
      physical examination including a detailed neurological examination and evaluation of&#xD;
      Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any prior surgery, prior radiation therapy and/or radiosurgery of the brain will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior surgery at the site of the lesion, prior radiation therapy and/or radiosurgery of the&#xD;
      brain will not prevent the patient from participating in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment audiograms (pure tone audiometry and speech comprehension) are obtained within&#xD;
      2 months before treatment to document baseline hearing unless anacusis has been documented&#xD;
      previously. Hearing is graded according to the American Academy of Otorhinolaryngology-Head&#xD;
      and Neck Surgery classification A full neurological assessment will be performed before each&#xD;
      treatment. Special attention will be given to the fifth, seventh cranial nerve examination.&#xD;
      Any baseline deficits or palsies will be registered. Trigeminal nerve function is graded on a&#xD;
      semiquantitative scale as normal sensation, decreased sensation, or no sensation (Barrow&#xD;
      Neurological Institute pain intensity score, Barrow Neurological Institute facial numbness&#xD;
      score, BNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facial nerve function is graded on the House-Brackmann (H-B) scale. Patient written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained prior any examinations related to the Cyberknife treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RADIOSURGICAL PROCEDURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      mSRS and sSRS (CyberKnife) Planning All patients initially are fitted with a custom made&#xD;
      Aquaplast mask and thin foam headrest to ensure consistent positioning from the acquisition&#xD;
      of the imaging studies through the radiotherapy treatment. While in the mask, a thin slice&#xD;
      (1.0 mm) high resolution (CT) scan of the entire head is obtained with Scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A thin slice (2 mm) gadolinium enhanced T1 weighted MRI is also acquired. The acquired images&#xD;
      then are transferred to the Cyberknife treatment planning workstation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI then will be fused to the CT by using the Cyberknife treatment planning software to&#xD;
      create a composite image for tumor localization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treating surgeon then manually defines the tumor volumes and critical structures on the&#xD;
      axial images . Although the axial images normally are used for treatment planning, it is&#xD;
      possible to delineate structures on the either the coronal or sagittal images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is usually necessary to adjust the windows and levels of the treatment planning CT dataset&#xD;
      to optimize clarity of the bone of the internal auditory canal to improve definition of the&#xD;
      tumor margins. In addition, the cochlea is defined (mandatory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the tumor and critical structures are delineated, inverse planning using the Cyberknife&#xD;
      treatment planning software provides a highly conformal radiotherapy dose that minimizes dose&#xD;
      to the adjacent critical structures The treatment plan is evaluated and selected based on an&#xD;
      analysis of the volumetric dose and the dose-volume histograms of the target volume and the&#xD;
      adjacent critical structures. The number of paths and beams used for each patient varies and&#xD;
      is determined by the selected individual treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planning target volumes The target volume for CyberKnife radiosurgery will consist of the&#xD;
      tumor outlined in the treatment planning software seen on planning CT and/or MRI with 1 mm of&#xD;
      t margin Dose Treatments will be delivered with hypofractionated schedule or single-session&#xD;
      radiosurgery according to randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prescription dose will be to the 70 to 85% In radiosurgery the dose will be 11Gy to 13Gy&#xD;
      (median 13 Gy) In fractionated schedule: dose fraction of 6 to 7 Gy will be delivered. The&#xD;
      number of fractions will be 3 Total dose will be 11 to 21 Gy in relation to proximity of&#xD;
      critical organs (cochlea)&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT ASSESSMENTS Evaluation During Treatment Patients will be seen and evaluated during&#xD;
      CyberKnife radiosurgery with documentation of tolerance, including acute reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation Following Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neurologic assessment, the contrast enhanced, thin slice (1 to 3 mm) MRI, and the&#xD;
      audiometric evaluation will be performed every 4 months during the first year post-SRS; every&#xD;
      6 months during the 2nd and the 3rd years and then annually. Tumors volume will be always&#xD;
      recorded. A response classification (CR, PR, SD, PD) will be then assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whenever possible, patients obtain audiograms at the same center to minimize discrepancies&#xD;
      related to technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Toxicity Toxicity will be graded per the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version&#xD;
      3.0. Criteria for Local Control Complete response (CR) is defined as the MRI disappearance of&#xD;
      the lesion. Partial response (PR) is defined as 20%, decrease in the volumetric size of the&#xD;
      lesion on MRI, stable disease (SD) as no change in the size of the lesion, and progressive&#xD;
      disease (PD) increase in any volumetric size of the lesion, confirmed at least a the&#xD;
      following two consecutive MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Patients will be allocated a number and their data will be collected on a&#xD;
      Case Report Forms. Data will include information from each protocol visit and will be&#xD;
      completed on a timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Randomization procedure The assignment of patients to group will&#xD;
      be performer through randomization. The randomization number will be assigned to each patient&#xD;
      by an independent institution (Dipartimento di Scienze Sanitarie Applicate, Università di&#xD;
      Pavia) using a computer-generated randomization list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of sample size The sample size is based on the primary endpoint of proportion&#xD;
      of subjects with hearing preservation. Assuming that the proportion of subjects with hearing&#xD;
      preservation is 50% with the standard technique, 49 patients per group are required to&#xD;
      conclude that the experimental technique reaches a proportion of hearing preservation of 77%,&#xD;
      with 80% power and 5% significance level. Allowing for a 10% drop-out rate, a total of 108&#xD;
      patients will be randomized between single and multisession radiosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Demographic data (age weight, height) will be summarized by treatment&#xD;
      group. Quantitative variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics suitable for&#xD;
      continuous variables; qualitative variables will be summarized by frequency distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy variable is the hearing preservation proportion, defined as the number&#xD;
      of the treated patients into the classes A and B on the total number of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will present the difference in the proportion of subjects with hearing&#xD;
      preservation between the two groups after at least 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analysis will be performed for the primary outcome variable and the secondary&#xD;
      efficacy variables. The results will be presented for demographic subgroups (age, sex, prior&#xD;
      surgery dose to the cochlea, volume of the lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary efficacy variables will be local tumour and toxicity (neurological) evaluation&#xD;
      (facial and trigeminal nerve). Associations between neurological scores (BNI, BPS, BNS) and&#xD;
      facial nerve function and MRI measures will be examined using Spearman's rank correlation&#xD;
      coefficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will be performed using Stata version 10 (Stata Corp,College Station, Tex). All&#xD;
      tests will be performed at the 0.05 level of significance.&#xD;
