  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one billion people suffer from hypertension worldwide. At least 10% of this&#xD;
      population, that is, 100 million people, also suffers from associated chronic conditions&#xD;
      namely, atrial fibrillation (AF), obesity, arterial stiffness (AS), and heart failure (HF).&#xD;
      Personal interaction with medical practitioners (doctors) and review of published clinical&#xD;
      research confirms that current non-invasive automatic blood pressure (BP) monitors that rely&#xD;
      on BP pulse analysis alone cannot provide accurate measurement due to the unpredictable/weak&#xD;
      nature of BP pulses in the above-mentioned chronic conditions. Lack of accuracy in BP&#xD;
      estimation can lead to wrong diagnoses and hence to complications such as stokes and heart&#xD;
      attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sponsor is developing a novel non-invasive BP monitor that is similar to existing&#xD;
      automatic monitors yet is capable of acquiring and analyzing electrocardiogram (ECG) data in&#xD;
      conjunction with BP pulse data to provide better and more accurate measurements in the above&#xD;
      chronic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the performance of this ECG-assisted BP&#xD;
      monitor against invasive BP measurements in a small group of patients who suffer from the&#xD;
      above conditions.&#xD;

    <description>We expect to demonstrate that our automated non-invasive ECG-assisted BP monitoring technology can provide accurate and consistent diastolic &amp; systolic pressure measurements in chronic patient conditions (namely AF, obesity, AS, and HF) in which current non-invasive oscillometric technologies tend to be unreliable.</description>

        We will recruit a minimum of 20 qualified adult patients who come to the catheterization&#xD;
        lab at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute for an angiography. The patients will have&#xD;
        at least one of the following chronic conditions: atrial fibrillation, obesity,&#xD;
        atherosclerosis, and heart failure.&#xD;
