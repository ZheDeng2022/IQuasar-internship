  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dual-energy CT (DECT) provides information on the blood volume in tumors and lymph nodes. As&#xD;
      tumors respond to treatment, preliminary data suggests that the blood volumes changes as&#xD;
      well. Investigators are therefore using DECT to test whether it can be used on radiation&#xD;
      treatment to rapidly assess response to treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the tumor's maximum iodine related attenuation (IRA) from baseline to on-treatment DECT.</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 1, 3, 5</time_frame>
    <description>This change in the maximum IRA will be compared with the change in the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) between baseline PET-CT and follow-up PET-CT at 3 months after treatment. For patients undergoing surgery, this change in the maximum IRA will be compared between patients who have a complete pathologic response, and those patients who do not.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients aged greater than 18 years with a diagnosis of stage III non-small cell lung&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned treatment with either definitive chemoradiotherapy or preoperative&#xD;
             chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PET-CT study within 4 weeks of next available DECT study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable primary and nodal disease, defined by at least one&#xD;
             lesion (primary and lymph node) greater than 1 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Kidney function sufficient to tolerate iodine-based CT contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No allergy to iodine-based contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a prior history of thoracic radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may not be receiving any other study agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to tolerate CT contrast&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because radiotherapy has the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             radiotherapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             radiotherapy. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
