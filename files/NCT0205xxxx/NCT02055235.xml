      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Different people perceive the same pain differently. Mood, attention, stress, and&#xD;
      personality affect how we feel pain. Researchers want to know whether people who do yoga&#xD;
      perceive pain differently than people who do not practice yoga, meditation, or martial arts.&#xD;
      They also want to study if cortisol, a stress hormone, relates to pain or brain differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the effects of yoga on the body s stress response, pain perception, and the brain&#xD;
      s structure and pain response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Right-handed adults 30 years and older who practice yoga regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy right-handed volunteers 30 years and older who do at least mild exercise but no&#xD;
           yoga or martial arts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will&#xD;
           have blood and urine tests and electrocardiogram to measure heart activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At home, participants will wear a heart monitor for 1 day and collect 5 saliva samples&#xD;
           daily for seven days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: Participants will undergo tests in a chair or in a mock MRI machine. They will&#xD;
           lie on a table that slides into a cylinder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A heating device will be placed on their leg and heated periodically for few seconds at&#xD;
           a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will give saliva samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate, respiration, etc. will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will fill out questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3: Participants will answer questions and repeat Visit 2 tests. Tests will be done&#xD;
           in the real MRI machine. The scanner makes loud knocking sounds. Participants will get&#xD;
           earplugs. Participants will be in the scanner about 1 hour with a coil over their head.&#xD;

      Objective: Pain perception is characterized by substantial differences between individuals.&#xD;
      We recently showed that a group of experienced yogis tolerated pain much longer than matched&#xD;
      controls. To tolerate pain yogis reported using strategies involving interoceptive awareness&#xD;
      and parasympathetic activation while nearly all controls did not. Yogis had more gray matter&#xD;
      in multiple brain regions, but only mid-insular gray matter correlated with pain tolerance.&#xD;
      They also had higher left intra-insular white matter connectivity than controls. Given that&#xD;
      autonomic integration occurs in the mid-insula, these observed insular adaptations could be&#xD;
      related to successful pain affect regulation mediated by increased interoceptive processing&#xD;
      and parasympathetic regulation. Our findings are consistent with a recent theory suggesting&#xD;
      that yoga s benefits are achieved by reducing allostatic load in stress response systems (&#xD;
      wear and tear on the body ), thus restoring optimal homeostasis. Specifically, the beneficial&#xD;
      effects of yoga on many conditions, including chronic pain, may be attributable to increased&#xD;
      parasympathetic activation. Indeed, all the conditions benefiting from yoga practice are&#xD;
      exacerbated by stress and exhibit a high sympathetic/parasympathetic balance, as measured by&#xD;
      low heart rate variability (HRV). Increased sympathetic activity is known to increase&#xD;
      hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. Additionally, it has been proposed that&#xD;
      people respond to uncertainty by activating the sympathetic nervous system, and that this&#xD;
      default response is related to the well-known negativity bias, the tendency to prioritize&#xD;
      negative information over positive. Yoga teaches a more neutral appraisal of the world which&#xD;
      might be a better adaptive response to uncertainty not involving as much sympathetic&#xD;
      activation and requiring less energy from the organism than prioritizing negative information&#xD;
      in a reactive way. This should promote a better control over stressful events including pain.&#xD;
      Thus, the proposed studies will first pilot the psychophysical procedures before proceeding&#xD;
      to the full study testing general hypothesis that the differences in pain processing and the&#xD;
      related neurostructural and neurophysiological differences expected to be found in&#xD;
      experienced yogis are related to more flexible autonomic and HPA axis control. We will also&#xD;
      document personality traits, including pain-related behaviors, and mental states associated&#xD;
      with the observed differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: In the pilot sub-study 19 experienced yogis will be compared to 19 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers who will serve as controls. The full protocol will include 49 participants per&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A pilot sub-study will be followed by the full cross-sectional study. In the full&#xD;
      cross-sectional study experienced yogis will be matched on a number of variables with healthy&#xD;
      controls not practicing any type of mind-body techniques. After screening, participants will&#xD;
      be fitted with an ambulatory electrocardiography device (Holter monitor) for 24 hours to&#xD;
      characterize their HRV in natural settings. They will also provide saliva samples at&#xD;
      pre-determined intervals for seven consecutive days to measure cortisol, an index of the HPA&#xD;
      axis function. Each subject will undergo two testing sessions. Session 1 will evaluate how&#xD;
      participants anticipate and process warm and painful stimuli in certain and uncertain&#xD;
      contexts by measuring perception while monitoring physiological responses such as&#xD;
      respiration, heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductance and cortisol response. In session&#xD;
      2, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to assess potential differences&#xD;
      in brain resting state activity between groups, as well as to document neural responses&#xD;
      related to the anticipation and processing of warm and painfully hot stimuli in certain and&#xD;
      uncertain contexts using a similar paradigm as in session 1. Once again, physiological&#xD;
      monitoring will be performed. Anatomical MRI scans will be acquired for co-registration of&#xD;
      the fMRI findings as well as to measure gray matter volume and cortical thickness differences&#xD;
      between groups. Questionnaires evaluating the participants mental state and personality&#xD;
      traits will be acquired throughout the sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Ratings of warm and painfully hot stimuli in certain and uncertain contexts&#xD;
      will be compared between groups. Baseline HRV and cortisol levels will also be compared&#xD;
      between groups. Functional and anatomical MRI data will be analyzed to examine differences&#xD;
      between yogis and healthy volunteers for 1) gray matter volume and cortical thickness; 2)&#xD;
      thermal anticipation and thermal-evoked activation patterns in certain and uncertain&#xD;
      contexts; 3) functional connectivity during both anticipation and processing of thermal&#xD;
      stimuli in certain and uncertain contexts; 4) resting state activity; and 5) functional&#xD;
      connectivity during resting state. We will examine whether the behavioral, functional, or&#xD;
      structural differences found are related to HPA axis function, autonomic function,&#xD;
      personality traits and mental state.&#xD;
