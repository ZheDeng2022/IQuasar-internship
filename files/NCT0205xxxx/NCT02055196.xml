  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of genetically modified stem cells&#xD;
      when given together with irinotecan hydrochloride in treating patients with recurrent&#xD;
      high-grade gliomas. Irinotecan hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Placing a gene that has been created in the&#xD;
      laboratory into neural stem cells and injecting it into the brain may help irinotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride kill more tumor cells once it reaches the brain.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define the recommend phase II doses of intracranially administered active modified&#xD;
      human form of carboxylesterase (hCE1m6)- neuronal stem cells (NSCs)&#xD;
      (carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural stem cells) in combination with intravenous&#xD;
      irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the biologic activity of the hCE1m6-NSCs by comparing SN-38 concentrations&#xD;
      in the brain after treatment with hCE1m6-NSCs and irinotecan compared to irinotecan alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the relationship between hCE1m6-NSC dose and SN-38 concentrations in brain&#xD;
      interstitium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the relationship between intracerebral and systemic concentrations of&#xD;
      irinotecan and SN-38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess for possible development of NSC immunogenicity after first exposure and with&#xD;
      repeat doses of NSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the intracerebral distribution of NSCs by using iron-labeling as a cellular&#xD;
      tracker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To describe the clinical benefit (defined as stable disease, partial response, or complete&#xD;
      response) in patients who receive treatment with repeat cycles of NSCs and irinotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine, at time of autopsy, the fate of the NSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural&#xD;
      stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural stem cells via intracerebral&#xD;
      catheter on day 1 of week 1; weeks 1 and 3, weeks 1, 2, and 3; or weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4.&#xD;
      Patients also receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 3 of&#xD;
      week 1; weeks 1 and 3, weeks 1, 2, and 3; or weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4. Courses repeat every 6&#xD;
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 15 years.&#xD;
