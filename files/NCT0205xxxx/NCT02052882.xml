  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine if using weekly romiplostim injections will improve the patient's&#xD;
      platelet count more effectively than simply waiting for the platelets to improve on its own,&#xD;
      and if romiplostim will also allow the patient to receive at least 2 further cycles of&#xD;
      chemotherapy without thrombocytopenia.&#xD;

    <description>All patients will begin weekly romiplostim at 2 mcg/kg, subcutaneously. The romiplostim dose will be titrated on weekly CBC/platelet counts. For titration purposes, the target platelet count is 150,000-200,000/mcL. Treatment can be held up to 16 days if a patient develops an intercurrent medical illness or symptom that is unrelated to study drug therapy.&#xD;
Treatment may be held up to 20 days if the patient unavailable for non- medical reasons, such as vacation or travel.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients (18 years of age or greater) with active non-hematological cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. The patients have previously received a chemotherapy regimen including one or more of&#xD;
        the following agents:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Nucleoside Analogue, including gemcitabine and fluorouracil&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Carboplatin or cisplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Anthracycline&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Alkylating agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Other chemotherapy agents with thrombocytopenia as known common toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who have not had any cytotoxic chemotherapy within 14 days of beginning the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Thrombocytopenia:.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Defined as platelet count &lt;100,000/mcL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. The patient will have had at least 2 CBCs with platelet counts &lt;100,000/mcL separated by&#xD;
        at least 4 weeks, and no platelet count ≥100,000/mcL in the prior 6 week period, despite&#xD;
        (1) delay, or (2) modification of chemotherapeutic regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. A platelet count of &gt;100,000/mcL, that follows within 7 days of a platelet transfusion,&#xD;
        will not make the patient ineligible, as long as one or more subsequent platelet counts&#xD;
        confirms thrombocytopenia (&lt;100,000/mcL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        D. Patients have undergone bone marrow aspirate and biopsy or peripheral blood test in the&#xD;
        prior 3 months without evidence of leukemia or myelodysplasia by fluorescent in&#xD;
        situ-hybridization (FISH) E. Dysplastic changes, based on morphology only, will not exclude&#xD;
        the patient if FISH panel for MDS is normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4.KPS ≥ 50 or ECOG performance status ≤2 .&#xD;
&#xD;
        5.Ability to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with history of hematologic malignancies, including leukemia, myeloma,&#xD;
             myeloproliferative disease, lymphoma, or myelodysplastic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with known bone metastases, with evidence of corticol bone damage/lytic&#xD;
             lesions/blastic lesions on standard imaging studies (CT/MR)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Anemia (Hgb &lt;8.0 gm/dl) or leukopenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1,000/mcL).&#xD;
             Use of red cell transfusions, erythropoietin, or G-CSF, as ordered by the managing&#xD;
             oncology service, is acceptable and does not preclude participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with underlying liver disease, such as cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis, and do&#xD;
             not have primary or metastatic cancer in the liver will be excluded if ALT/AST &gt;3X ULN&#xD;
             or Total Bili &gt;3X ULN. In the presence of primary or metastatic liver cancer, patients&#xD;
             will be excluded if ALT/AST &gt;5X ULN or Total Bili &gt;5X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with a history of a prior symptomatic venous thrombotic event such, as DVT or&#xD;
             pulmonary embolism and symptomatic arterial thrombotic events such as myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, ischemic cerebral vascular accident or transient ischemic attack will be&#xD;
             ineligible if they have not tolerated anticoagulation therapy. If patients remain on&#xD;
             anticoagulation, or have completed the prescribed course of anticoagulation, they will&#xD;
             be eligible for enrollment. A venous thrombotic event associated with a central venous&#xD;
             catheter will not make the patient ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Serious concomitant medical condition that could interfere with the conduct of the&#xD;
             clinical trial, such as unstable angina, renal failure requiring hemodialysis, or&#xD;
             active infection requiring IV antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnant women/lactating mothers&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients unwilling to use contraception.&#xD;
