    <textblock>
      Injecting local anesthetic to anesthetize a nerve or group of nerves (a 'nerve block') is an&#xD;
      effective way to eliminate pain during and after surgery. There are instances when it would&#xD;
      be beneficial to the patient for the nerve block to be resolved quickly rather than waiting&#xD;
      for it to naturally wear off. For example, a sciatic nerve block that freezes the lower leg&#xD;
      and foot typically takes over 18 hours to resolve on its own, and both the surgeon and&#xD;
      patient prefer to have motor function before discharge. The investigators wish to perform a&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trial to determine if infusion of a solution such as saline to 'wash&#xD;
      out' the nerve block after surgery can allow the patient to be pain-free while still being&#xD;
      able to move their leg and foot.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background and rationale Peripheral nerve blocks provide effective surgical anesthesia&#xD;
      targeted to specific body regions while avoiding the unpleasant side-effects of general&#xD;
      anesthesia. Additionally, infusion of local anesthetic (LA) solution through a perineural&#xD;
      catheter can provide superior analgesia compared to opioid painkillers and reduces the&#xD;
      incidence of opioid-associated side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most studies to date have focused on the efficacy of agents to extend block duration, thereby&#xD;
      maximizing pain relief for patients receiving a nerve block. However, there are occasions&#xD;
      when rapid and effective block reversal is needed. For example, interscalene brachial plexus&#xD;
      block for upper extremity surgery frequently causes paralysis of the diaphragm due to&#xD;
      inadvertent anesthesia of the phrenic nerve. A method to 'wash out' the local anesthetic&#xD;
      around the phrenic nerve in these cases would be beneficial, especially for patients who have&#xD;
      pre-existing pulmonary or respiratory diseases. Saline washout of LA may have an additional&#xD;
      safety benefit since LAs are myotoxic; reducing the exposure of muscle to LA solutions while&#xD;
      maintaining anesthesia would increase the safety of peripheral nerve blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated that epidural washout using normal saline (NS) or Ringer's&#xD;
      lactate following epidural block facilitates more rapid recovery of motor function and&#xD;
      sensation than letting the block resolve on its own. However, no studies to date have&#xD;
      addressed whether washout is effective for reversal of peripheral nerve blocks. Our limited&#xD;
      clinical experience suggests that a bolus of NS through a perineural catheter can rapidly and&#xD;
      effectively restore phrenic nerve function following interscalene block, and preliminary&#xD;
      laboratory experiments indicate that a continuous washout of 0.9% NS reduces by half the time&#xD;
      required for normal diaphragm function following injection of lidocaine around the phrenic&#xD;
      nerve. Unclear, however, is the mechanism by which NS is able to resolve the block. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigators wish to investigate the optimal approach to block reversal and resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective To demonstrate that an infusion of NS can be used in a clinical setting to&#xD;
      modify the properties of a nerve block in patients who have received a nerve block for&#xD;
      surgery and post-operative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that NS can be delivered through a perineural&#xD;
      catheter to 'wash out' a nerve block to the point that motor function is restored while&#xD;
      maintaining anesthesia of sensory nerve fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Using a sealed envelope system (see below), patients recruited to the study will be&#xD;
      randomized to Control or Study groups. Baseline motor and sensory function will be assessed&#xD;
      and recorded (see below for methods). Control group patients will undergo ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      popliteal sciatic nerve block as described previously. A bolus of 20 mL 0.5% ropivacaine/0.5%&#xD;
      bupivacaine will be delivered through a catheter-over-needle unit (e.g., B.Braun Contiplex C&#xD;
      or equivalent) to provide surgical anesthesia to the lower extremity. After withdrawing the&#xD;
      needle, the catheter will be left in place throughout the operation to provide a conduit to&#xD;
      deliver rescue analgesia if required (see criteria below). Patients in the Study group will&#xD;
      undergo the same procedures before and during surgery. After surgery, all patients will be&#xD;
      brought to the recovery room for assessment of motor function and sensation in the&#xD;
      anesthetized region. Study group patients will then receive a washout infusion regimen (e.g.,&#xD;
      continuous infusion of 3 mL per hour with a 3 mL bolus of 0.9% NS). Control group patients&#xD;
      will receive an infusion of the same solution, but it will only be run at 1 mL/hr to maintain&#xD;
      catheter patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patient is transferred to the ward, motor and sensory assessment (see below) will&#xD;
      be performed hourly until full motor function has returned. Once motor function has returned&#xD;
      completely, the washout infusion will be stopped. The patient will be monitored for sensory&#xD;
      function hourly for a maximum of 8 hours or until the first dose of oral pain medication or&#xD;
      rescue analgesia is required. If the patient's pain score (determined by Numeric Rating Scale&#xD;
      (NRS) score between 0-10, where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain ever) is &gt;5, or if the&#xD;
      patient is complaining of severe pain, the nerve block will be reinitiated by delivering a&#xD;
      bolus of local anesthetic mixture through the catheter. A member of the clinical research&#xD;
      team will follow up with the patient every 24 hours post-surgery (up to a maximum of 72 hours&#xD;
      or discharge from hospital, whichever happens first) to record motor and sensory data and&#xD;
      pain score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory and motor assessment Sensory assessment will be performed by measuring current&#xD;
      perception threshold (CPT) using the Neurometer (Neurotron, Inc., Baltimore, MD, USA), a&#xD;
      validated device for sensory assessment. The investigators have experience using the&#xD;
      Neurometer for CPT measurement and will be able to perform sensory assessment with the device&#xD;
      easily and efficiently. Briefly, paired adhesive electrodes (Neotrode II, ConMed Corp.,&#xD;
      Utica, NY, USA) connected to the Neurometer will be attached to the big toe and the ankle of&#xD;
      the leg that was blocked. The Neurometer can be set to three different frequencies - 2000 Hz,&#xD;
      250 Hz, and 5 Hz - that stimulate Aβ (large fiber/motor), Aδ (large fiber/pain), and C (small&#xD;
      fiber/pain) fibers, respectively. A member of the research team will increase the current&#xD;
      manually until the patient reports feeling an &quot;electrical&quot; sensation in the area where the&#xD;
      electrodes are attached. The reading at this time will be recorded as the CPT. The data&#xD;
      collector will also note if the current reached its maximum level, which will be defined as&#xD;
      complete sensory blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor function will be assessed by recording voluntary motor responses in the lower&#xD;
      extremity. The investigators will grade plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of the foot based on&#xD;
      the following scale: 0 = normal movement, 1 = decreased movement, and 2 = no movement. Motor&#xD;
      block will be deemed complete when a score of 2 is recorded for both plantar flexion and&#xD;
      dorsiflexion. This grading scale has been described before for assessment of motor function&#xD;
      following popliteal sciatic nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data recording and analysis The clinical research team member will record patient demographic&#xD;
      information (age, height, weight, gender), NRS scores before and after surgery, and&#xD;
      information about the nerve block and infusion regimen. This individual will also assess&#xD;
      motor function and will assess sensory response (see above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be recorded on a data sheet and transferred to an Excel spreadsheet for statistical&#xD;
      analysis. Comparisons between groups will be performed with Student's t-test. Qualitative&#xD;
      data will be reported as either absolute numbers or percentage and will be analyzed by&#xD;
      Chi-square analysis or Fisher's exact test, whichever is appropriate. A p value of &lt; 0.05&#xD;
      will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation The primary endpoint for this study will be time to return of full&#xD;
      motor activity. Several reports have demonstrated that popliteal sciatic nerve block has an&#xD;
      average duration of 14-16 hours. Our preliminary results of phrenic nerve block suggest that,&#xD;
      following a bolus of washout solution, the time to recovery is reduced to approximately 50%&#xD;
      versus time to spontaneous recovery. The investigators assume conservatively that 70% of&#xD;
      Study group (washout) patients and 25% of Control group patients will have full motor&#xD;
      activity with no pain by 8 hours. Using these parameters with an α value of 0.05 and β value&#xD;
      of 0.2, it was determined that 19 patients per group (38 total) will be required to&#xD;
      demonstrate a statistically significant difference. To compensate for study protocol&#xD;
      violations and/or loss to follow-up, 20 patients will be recruited to each group (40 total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Prior to subject recruitment, a member of the study team not involved in data&#xD;
      collection will create a series of 40 slips of paper indicating the allocation group (Study&#xD;
      or Control) and the intervention (washout regimen or control (1 mL/hr infusion) regimen). The&#xD;
      slips will be put into a random order and each placed in an opaque envelope. The envelopes&#xD;
      will be sealed and numbered sequentially. During the study, once the patient returns to the&#xD;
      post-anesthesia recovery room, the attending regional anesthesiologist will open the envelope&#xD;
      to determine the intervention the patient is to receive. If this anesthesiologist is the PI,&#xD;
      he will remove himself from the area while a colleague initiates the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding Both the investigators and participants will be blinded in this study. Investigators&#xD;
      will be blinded by having one member of the study team collect the data and another study&#xD;
      team member analyze the data. All study participants will have a nerve block catheter and be&#xD;
      connected to an infusion pump; however, only Study group patients will receive the washout&#xD;
      regimen. Control group patients will have the same solution running but at 1 mL/hr to&#xD;
      maintain catheter patency. The pump display showing the infusion rate will be masked with&#xD;
      tape or an opaque covering to prevent patients and data collectors from knowing the patient's&#xD;
      allocation group.&#xD;
