  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic problems after traumatic events are common in non-elderly adults. Previous studies&#xD;
      have shown that after minor motor vehicle collision (MVC), 10-30% of non-elderly adult&#xD;
      patients develop chronic regional pain (neck or back pain). In addition, up to 1/3 of&#xD;
      non-elderly adults will develop psychological sequelae, including posttraumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders. There have been no prospective studies examining&#xD;
      the frequency or predictors of persistent pain or psychological sequelae in older adults. The&#xD;
      proposed study seeks to determine the frequency of persistent pain, psychological sequelae,&#xD;
      and associated disability in older adults after minor MVC trauma and to identify candidate&#xD;
      predictors for a model of adverse outcomes after MVC in this population. 200 individuals over&#xD;
      65 years of age will be recruited from emergency departments in four states with no-fault&#xD;
      accident laws. Patients who meet inclusion criteria and who consent to the emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) study will undergo a 30-45 minute ED assessment of crash-related,&#xD;
      psychosocial, and biological factors, and complete telephone follow-ups at 2 weeks, 6 weeks 6&#xD;
      months, and 12 months. The wealth of information gained from this study will be used to&#xD;
      determine the frequency of adverse events in older adults after MVC and to identify high risk&#xD;
      elderly patients. These results will inform subsequent development of secondary pharmacologic&#xD;
      and/or behavioral interventions to prevent chronic pain and psychological sequelae after&#xD;
      traumatic events in older adults.&#xD;
