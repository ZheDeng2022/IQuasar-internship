    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial in addition to a dose finding study for concurrent Paclitaxel, will&#xD;
      be to establish a treatment algorithm for chest wall reirradiation. A nominal margin of at&#xD;
      least 5cm will be used on the protocol and extending it to 7cm. Considering the standard&#xD;
      treatment of breast cancer incorporates a cumulative dose of 60Gy, delivering an additional&#xD;
      50.4 Gy followed by a boost should target a total dose of 120 Gy.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologically proven diagnosis of breast cancer with clinical evidence of recurrent&#xD;
             disease on the chest wall following treatment that included radiotherapy, and for&#xD;
             which there is no current standard of care or curative resection able to be performed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are permitted to have received prior therapy, but must have received a&#xD;
             minimum of 30 Gy to the chest wall with a minimal interval since completion of&#xD;
             radiation therapy equal to or greater than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are permitted to have been treated with previous systemic chemotherapy. A&#xD;
             minimal time interval since last dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy must be equal to or&#xD;
             greater than 21 days, and all acute toxicities should be resolved to less than grade&#xD;
             2, and hematologic counts should meet study criteria. With regards to toxicity,&#xD;
             patients who have left sided chest wall recurrences should not have previously&#xD;
             exceeded more than 450 mg/m2 doxorubicin due to expected cumulative cardiotoxicity.&#xD;
             Prior taxane therapy is allowed, however, there should be no reported anaphylactic&#xD;
             reactions of grade 3 or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets ≥100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance ≥60&#xD;
                  mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  levels above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had radiotherapy within 6 months prior to entering the study or&#xD;
             those who have not recovered to &lt; grade 2 adverse events due to radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have experienced a previous grade 3 or 4 anaphylactic reaction to&#xD;
             Paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with grade &gt; 2 neuropathy attributable to previous administration of Taxane&#xD;
             chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy are allowed, provided they have been off&#xD;
             systemic therapy for 21 days and all acute toxicities have resolved to less than grade&#xD;
             2. Patients who have received Paclitaxel within 3 months of study entry and have&#xD;
             developed documented progressive disease despite therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should have their brain metastases treated prior&#xD;
             to enrollment on this protocol. Subjects may enroll on this trial after completion of&#xD;
             whole brain radiation therapy and/or Stereotactic Radiosurgery, provided they are&#xD;
             clinically without evidence of progressive brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who are actively receiving other cytotoxic or antibiologic chemotherapies. For&#xD;
             patients with Her-2/neu positive disease, Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is NOT ALLOWED on&#xD;
             this study, and should be withheld during the 8 weeks of therapy, and can be resumed&#xD;
             no sooner than 14 days following completion of protocol therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with a confirmed intrauterine pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule&#xD;
             agent with known potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is&#xD;
             an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with Paclitaxel, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with Paclitaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with poor cardiac function defined as an ejection fraction (EF) &lt; 40% are&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
