  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the bioequivalence of the second generation&#xD;
      dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride (HCL) combination capsule versus currently available&#xD;
      commercial combination of dutasteride 0.5 milligram (mg) and tamsulosin HCL 0.4 mg capsule in&#xD;
      healthy adult male subjects. Subjects in this study will receive either a single oral dose of&#xD;
      the second generation dutasteride 0.5 mg and tamsulosin 0.4 mg combination capsule or a&#xD;
      single dose of commercially available combination of dutasteride 0.5 mg and tamsulosin HCL&#xD;
      0.4 mg followed by a 28-day washout period both in fasted state. The study will enroll&#xD;
      approximately 92 healthy adult male subjects in order to complete approximately 76 evaluable&#xD;
      subjects. The total duration of a subject's involvement in this study is anticipated to be&#xD;
      approximately 12 weeks.&#xD;
