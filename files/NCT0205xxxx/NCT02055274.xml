      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LY03003 following&#xD;
      multiple escalating intramuscular injections, as compared to Neupro patch and to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability and preliminary efficacy of multiple ascending dose (MAD) of LY03003&#xD;
      following intramuscular injections.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease defined by the cardinal sign, Bradykinesia,&#xD;
             plus the presence of at least 1 of the following: resting tremor, rigidity, or&#xD;
             impairment of postural reflexes, and without any other known or suspected cause of&#xD;
             Parkinsonism&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject is Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage ≤3&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is male or female aged ≥18 years at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of ≥25&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has a Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score (Part III)&#xD;
             of ≥10 but ≤30 at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has atypical Parkinson's syndrome(s) due to drugs (e.g., Metoclopramide,&#xD;
             Flunarizine), metabolic neurogenetic disorders (e.g., Wilson's Disease), Encephalitis,&#xD;
             Cerebrovascular Disease, or Degenerative Disease (e.g., progressive Supranuclear&#xD;
             Palsy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has a history of Pallidotomy, Thalamotomy, deep brain stimulation, or fetal&#xD;
             tissue transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has dementia, active psychosis or hallucinations, or clinically significant&#xD;
             depression&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has a lifetime history of suicide attempt (including an active attempt,&#xD;
             interrupted attempt, or aborted attempt), or has suicidal ideation in the past 6&#xD;
             months as indicated by a positive response (&quot;Yes&quot;) to either Question 4 or Question 5&#xD;
             of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has a history of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension with a decrease of ≥20&#xD;
             mmHg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or ≥10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure when&#xD;
             changing from supine to standing position after having been at supine position for at&#xD;
             least 5 minutes within 28 days prior to the Screening Visit, or SBP less than 105 mmHg&#xD;
             at study entry, or reports clinical signs of clinically significant orthostatic&#xD;
             hypotension within 28 days prior to the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject is receiving therapy with a dopamine agonist (DA) either concurrently or has&#xD;
             done so within 28 days prior to the Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject is receiving therapy with 1 of the following drugs either concurrently or&#xD;
             within 28 days prior to screening: MAO-B inhibitors, DA releasing agents, DA&#xD;
             modulating agent, DA antagonists, neuroleptics, or other medications that may interact&#xD;
             with DA function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject is currently receiving central nervous system active therapy (e.g., sedatives,&#xD;
             hypnotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics), unless the dose has been stable for at least&#xD;
             28 days prior to Screening Visit and is likely to remain stable for the duration of&#xD;
             the study. Patients should not take those medications within 8 hours prior to clinical&#xD;
             visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject has a current diagnosis of epilepsy, has a history of seizures as an adult,&#xD;
             has a history of stroke, or has had a transient ischemic attack within 1 year prior to&#xD;
             Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject has a history of known intolerance/hypersensitivity to non-dopaminergic&#xD;
             antiemetics, such as domperidone, ondansetron, tropisetron, and glycopyrrolate&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject has any other clinically relevant hepatic, renal and cardiac dysfunction, or&#xD;
             other medical condition or laboratory abnormality including abnormal plasma magnesium&#xD;
             level, which would in the judgment of the investigator, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             ability to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject has a history of significant skin hypersensitivity to adhesive or other&#xD;
             transdermal preparations or recent unresolved contact Dermatitis (this item is&#xD;
             specific for patients to be enrolled to part 2 of this study)&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects with C-reactive protein levels of 2x of upper limit of normal range&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Female subjects who are pregnant or are breastfeeding or are of childbearing potential&#xD;
             without adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients with a positive finding in drug screening test or alcohol test&#xD;
