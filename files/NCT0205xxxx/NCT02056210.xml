      The objective of this study is to assess whether there are differences in the mobilization of&#xD;
      CD34+ cells and EPC in response to Mozobil in patients with diabetes mellitus compared to&#xD;
      subjects without diabetes. Currently, there are no non-invasive methods for the study of bone&#xD;
      marrow function in humans. This project aims to evaluate in patients with type 1 or type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus the ability to mobilize CD34+ cells and EPC from the bone marrow to the&#xD;
      periphery in response to the exogenous mobilizing agent AMD3100 / plerixafor (Mozobil),&#xD;
      compared with a group of non-diabetic individuals. While it has been recently shown that&#xD;
      diabetic patients do not respond to mobilization induced by G-CSF (Filgrastim), the&#xD;
      investigators herein hypothesize that diabetic patients can adequately respond to&#xD;
      mobilization induced by Plerixafor&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Scientific background. Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased prevalence and&#xD;
      incidence of cardiovascular diseases. It is believed that the high cardiovascular risk in&#xD;
      diabetes is attributable to the adverse effects of glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity on&#xD;
      endothelial cells. Recent data indicate that endothelial repair mechanisms play an important&#xD;
      role in determining the integrity of the endothelium and thus the global health of the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system. Data from our research group demonstrated that the cells involved in&#xD;
      endothelial regeneration and neo-angiogenesis (including CD34+ cells and endothelial&#xD;
      progenitor cells, EPC) are reduced in number and dysfunctional in patients with diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. EPC belong to the CD34+ cell population and are defined based on the co-expression&#xD;
      of endothelial-lineage markers, such as VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2 or KDR). These cells are&#xD;
      further impaired in diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease. It is believed that these&#xD;
      changes represent one of the causes of cardiovascular damage in diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms underlying the decrease of EPC and other progenitor cells in diabetes are not&#xD;
      fully understood. Normally, EPC reside in the bone marrow and their circulating levels in&#xD;
      peripheral blood are very low. In response to ischemic injury or vascular damage, EPC are&#xD;
      mobilized from the bone marrow to peripheral blood. Data obtained in experimental models of&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus indicate a defect in EPC mobilization from the bone marrow to the&#xD;
      peripheral circulation in response to ischemia, which results in an impairment of the&#xD;
      post-ischemic neo-angiogenetic processes. Similar experimental results were obtained by&#xD;
      different research groups. Our data also show that experimental diabetes reduces the marrow&#xD;
      response to exogenous mobilizing agents such as G-CSF and SCF. Other clinical data in humans&#xD;
      from our and other research groups confirm the hypothesis of a defect in the bone marrow of&#xD;
      patients with diabetes mellitus. In particular, diabetes causes profound alterations of the&#xD;
      bone marrow microenvironment associated with microangiopathy and alteration of the stem cells&#xD;
      niche. These results confirm a study in the mouse model of type 1 diabetes, in which it was&#xD;
      for the first time identified a specific form of microangiopathy causing depletion of CD34+&#xD;
      cells and EPC in the bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a consequence of this bone marrow damage, our research group has recently shown that the&#xD;
      mobilization of CD34+ cells and EPC phenotypes is profoundly defective in patients with type&#xD;
      1 and 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reach this conclusion, the investigators used a test of bone marrow reserve by&#xD;
      administering low dose human recombinant G-CSF (Filgrastim). The study showed that a&#xD;
      sub-maximal marrow stimulation is able to highlight differences between diabetics and&#xD;
      non-diabetics and is absolutely safe, since there have been no significant side effects. In a&#xD;
      hematology context, it was also previously shown that diabetes is a factor predictive of&#xD;
      &quot;poor mobilization&quot; exposing patients to an increased risk of failing stem cell collection&#xD;
      for autologous stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a functional/mechanistic standpoint, it has been demonstrated that an impairment of the&#xD;
      CXCL12/CXCR4 axis probably contributes to the lack of mobilization of bone marrow&#xD;
      stem/progenitor cells associated with diabetes. The drug AMD3100 / plerixafor (Mozobil Â®) is&#xD;
      a direct antagonist of CXCR4 and inhibits the cellular signal keeping stem / progenitor cells&#xD;
      within the bone marrow. For this reason, AMD3100 / Plerixafor is rapidly effective for the&#xD;
      mobilization of bone marrow stem cells. From an experimental point of view, it was observed&#xD;
      that diabetic animals, although not responsive to mobilization induced by ischemia and G-CSF,&#xD;
      are responsive to mobilization induced by AMD3100 / Plerixafor. Mozobil is currently approved&#xD;
      in Italy for stem cell mobilization in patients with multiple myeloma or lymphoma for the&#xD;
      purpose of auto-transplantation, in combination with G-CSF, in poorly mobilizing patients&#xD;
      (see SmPC). At this stage, the effectiveness of Mozobil in inducing mobilization of stem /&#xD;
      progenitor cells in diabetic patients has not yet been tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific question. The objective of this study is to assess whether there are differences&#xD;
      in the mobilization of CD34+ cells and EPC in response to Mozobil in patients with diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus compared to subjects without diabetes. Currently, there are no non-invasive methods&#xD;
      for the study of bone marrow function in humans. This project aims to evaluate in patients&#xD;
      with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus the ability to mobilize CD34+ cells and EPC from the&#xD;
      bone marrow to the periphery in response to the exogenous mobilizing agent AMD3100 /&#xD;
      plerixafor (Mozobil), compared with a group of non-diabetic individuals. While it has been&#xD;
      recently shown that diabetic patients do not respond to mobilization induced by G-CSF&#xD;
      (Filgrastim), the investigators herein hypothesize that diabetic patients can adequately&#xD;
      respond to mobilization induced by Plerixafor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plausibility and clinical relevance. It is believed that alterations of stem/progenitor cells&#xD;
      secondary to a bone marrow defect contribute to the development of clinical diabetic&#xD;
      microangiopathy and macroangiopathy. For this reason, it is of great interest to explore the&#xD;
      mechanisms causing an progenitor cell defects in diabetes and the possible strategies to cope&#xD;
      with this. A wealth of data coming from animal, human and epidemiologic studies indicate that&#xD;
      the mobilizing response to G-CSF is impaired in diabetic patients. Therefore, stem&#xD;
      mobilization in diabetes has to be considered an &quot;unmet clinical need&quot;. On the other side,&#xD;
      preclinical experimental data in animal models of diabetes indicate that AMD3100 / Plerixafor&#xD;
      is able to mobilize stem and progenitor cells. The clinical relevance of the project lies in&#xD;
      the possibility to identify a treatment able to restore stem/progenitor cell mobilization in&#xD;
      diabetes. This can have favorable implications for chronic diabetic complications, such as&#xD;
      microangiopathy and cardiovascular diseases. In fact, this project is relevant from a&#xD;
      pathophysiological point of view, since it is believed that EPC should protect against&#xD;
      vascular complications of diabetes. Furthermore, from a hematologic standpoint, being aware&#xD;
      that diabetic patients are hyporesponsive to G-CSF whilst responding adequately to Plerixafor&#xD;
      would allow to individualize mobilization protocols in view of an autologous hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected adverse events. Treatment with Mozobil in combination with G-CSF may be associated&#xD;
      with mild adverse events (see SmPC). Compared to placebo + G-CSF, the use of Mozobil + G-CSF&#xD;
      in patients from two clinical trials induced a significantly higher number of grade 1-2&#xD;
      adverse reactions: diarrhea (37% vs 17%), nausea (34% vs 22%), flatulence (7% vs 3%),&#xD;
      injection site reactions (34% vs 10%), dizziness (11% vs 6%). No side effects of grade 3-4&#xD;
      were reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study Mozobil will be given as monotherapy, ie not in combination with G-CSF.&#xD;
      Based on literature data, adverse events that may be expected with this type of treatment are&#xD;
      mild:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In a study of 20 healthy volunteers grade 1 side effects were reported in response to a&#xD;
           monotherapy treatment with Mozobil sc: cramps or bloating, flatulence, dry mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In a study that involved 10 healthy volunteers treated with Mozobil sc monotherapy the&#xD;
           following mild side effects were observed (grade 1): erythema or itching at the site of&#xD;
           injection, headache, perioral paresthesia, nausea, abdominal swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A study that involved 25 healthy donors treated with Mozobil sc monotherapy reported the&#xD;
           following adverse events of grade 1 (mild): dizziness, nausea, flatulence, discomfort or&#xD;
           feeling of warmth at the injection site, perioral paresthesias, sweating, cephalea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of these data, it can be assumed that the use of Mozobil monotherapy is safe and&#xD;
      expected side effects are mild and tolerable for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, as with almost all drugs, Mozobil can induce allergic reactions and anaphylaxis.&#xD;
