  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of three different dosing&#xD;
      regimens of brilacidin compared to daptomycin for the treatment of serious skin infections.&#xD;
      This study will aid in selecting the appropriate dose of brilacidin for later stage studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-center, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      three regimens of brilacidin compared to an active control, daptomycin, in subjects with&#xD;
      ABSSSI. Subjects must have infections that warrant intravenous therapy but may be treated as&#xD;
      either inpatients or outpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of 4 treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to brilacidin will receive either a single intravenous infusion (0.6&#xD;
      mg/kg or 0.8 mg/kg) followed by six days of once daily placebo, or a three day regimen (0.6&#xD;
      mg/kg on Day 1 followed by 0.3 mg/kg on Days 2 and 3) followed by 4 days of once daily&#xD;
      placebo. Subjects randomized to daptomycin will receive 7 days of treatment. Subjects will be&#xD;
      assessed for both clinical and microbiologic efficacy 48-72 hours after the first dose of&#xD;
      study drug. After an assessment at Day 7-8, subjects will be again be evaluated for efficacy&#xD;
      at Day 10-14 and via a phone contact at Day 21-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 200 subjects randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the three&#xD;
      brilacidin regimens or daptomycin will be evaluable. The primary efficacy outcome, early&#xD;
      clinical response 48-72 hours after the first dose of study drug, will be determined in the&#xD;
      Intent-to treat (ITT) population. Additional efficacy and safety analyses will be performed.&#xD;

    <description>The primary efficacy outcome, early clinical response 48-72 hours after the first dose of study drug, will be determined in the ITT population. A subject will be considered a Clinical Success if 1) the lesion area has decreased by ≥20% compared to baseline and 2) no additional systemic antibacterials that are potentially effective against gram positive organisms have been administered.</description>

    <description>For Days 7/8 and 10-14, a response of Clinical Success will be assigned if all signs and symptoms of infection present at baseline have improved and/or resolved and no additional antibiotics are considered necessary.&#xD;
Subjects who have a response of Clinical Success at Day 10-14 will be assessed for sustained efficacy at Day 21-28. A response of Sustained Clinical Success will be assigned if all signs and symptoms remain resolved and no additional antibiotics are considered necessary. If signs and symptoms of infection recurred at the original site of infection and require additional antibiotic therapy, a response of Relapse will be assigned.</description>
