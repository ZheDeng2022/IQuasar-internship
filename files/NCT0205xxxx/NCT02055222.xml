  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the implementation of modern public health interventions, 1 in 5 adults in the United&#xD;
      States are either current or former smokers and remain at risk for the development of chronic&#xD;
      lung diseases. It is unknown how or why any one individual smoker can develop a wide range of&#xD;
      lung diseases including chronic obstructive lung disease and/or pulmonary fibrosis. The&#xD;
      purpose of this protocol is to collect clinical data, blood, urine, and bronchoalveolar&#xD;
      samples from smokers and non-smokers in an attempt to establish phenotypic clinical profiles&#xD;
      that correspond to divergent pathways in the expression of such proteins as the transforming&#xD;
      growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta &lt;=1). The information generated from this study will provide&#xD;
      insight into the pathogenesis of smoking-related lung injury and potentially allow for the&#xD;
      development of early therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
