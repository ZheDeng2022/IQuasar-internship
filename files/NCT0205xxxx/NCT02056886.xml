    <textblock>
      Breast carcinoma requires frequently an adjuvant therapy after surgical excision: in this&#xD;
      way, one of the major criteria indicating the need of adjuvant chemotherapy is the diagnosis&#xD;
      of a metastatic lymph-node invasion, mainly in the axillary field. Axillary surgery is&#xD;
      therefore mandatory at the diagnosis of breast carcinoma. For many years, in order to avoid&#xD;
      unnecessary complications due to extensive axillary surgery (for instance, arm enlargement by&#xD;
      lymphedema), a limited surgery is frequently performed on the first supposed invaded&#xD;
      lymph-nodes (LN) called &quot;sentinel&quot; LN technique; if the sentinel LN are not invaded,&#xD;
      extensive axillary surgery can be omitted. To decide it during the surgery, removed sentinel&#xD;
      LN are cut in 3 to 4 slices which are examined immediately as smears (cytology) or frozen&#xD;
      slices (pathology). However, due to hazard in cutting the LN, micro-metastases can be&#xD;
      misdiagnosed. That is why a recent molecular biology method has been developed in which the&#xD;
      total LN are crushed and blended, then analyzed by OSNA technique (One Step Nuclear Acid&#xD;
      analysis) so as to amplify and detect the mRNA coding for cytokeratin-19 protein witnessing&#xD;
      the LN metastatic invasion. A standardized automated technique is available with a mean time&#xD;
      of 30 to 50 minutes according to the number of analyzed LN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 12 international studies (2830 cases) the consistency between OSNA technique and final&#xD;
      pathology is of 91 to 98% and the sensitivity seems higher. Less than 5% of all breast&#xD;
      carcinomas cells don't express CK-19 protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of OSNA technique requires a dedicated machine and a skilled pathologist, increasing&#xD;
      slightly the operation time; however it allows to avoid the immediate and long-term&#xD;
      complications due to the radical LN axillary surgery in case of negativity of the sentinel LN&#xD;
      procedure. To date, the three techniques including extemporaneous examinations (OSNA or&#xD;
      classical methods) or not (classical pathological analysis) have their own advantages and&#xD;
      drawbacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;SAGE&quot; study main objective is to compare these three techniques in terms of direct costs and&#xD;
      Quality of Life impacts. The superiority of any of these three techniques is not the purpose&#xD;
      of SAGE study, but the economic burden of OSNA technique in comparison with the 2 others in&#xD;
      the standard setting in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life and Pain evaluations will be performed immediately after surgery and during&#xD;
      the 6 months after.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Today, standard treatment for early Breast carcinoma starts with a surgical step consisting&#xD;
      of the tumor resection and sentinel lymph-node (SLN) detection, in order to select patients&#xD;
      to be proposed for complementary axillary lymphadenectomy. This requested information may be&#xD;
      obtained during the same operation time by intra operative examination, or after surgery with&#xD;
      the consequence of a second surgical procedure when lymphadenectomy appears to be indicated.&#xD;
      In France, three strategies are currently used for the management of sentinel lymph nodes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intra operative pathological frozen section examination followed by final pathological&#xD;
           diagnosis,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intra operative molecular biology using the OSNA technique (One Step Nuclear Acid&#xD;
           analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no intra operative examination, but the final pathological examination. Each of these 3&#xD;
           strategies has advantage and drawbacks and their own cost. With more than 50000 new&#xD;
           cases per year in France, Breast carcinoma, thanks to population screening, more and&#xD;
           more small tumors are detected where such information about sentinel LN invasion is&#xD;
           needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposed study is a prospective, cost-effectiveness and comparative non randomised study&#xD;
      where three strategies are evaluated in the current practice of the participating teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      • to evaluate in each of these 3 strategies for sentinel LN diagnosis, cost-effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-utility (QALY), Quality of Life,…&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rate of second surgery needed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rate of mico-metastases or macro-metastases detected to build a decision score,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  follow-up of non re-operated patient despite positive sentinel LN,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RNA collection from the crushed and blended sentinel LN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life evaluation through the surgical times using QLQ C30 and Br 23 scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical section :&#xD;
&#xD;
      At pre-operative consultation, patients will be informed to consent participating in our&#xD;
      observational study, without any change in their treatment strategy. Inclusion parameters are&#xD;
      strictly the same in the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of surgery, if intra operative examination is planned, patient will be informed&#xD;
      that a complete axillary dissection could be indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients will be followed 15 days after surgery and at 3 and 9 months. Then every 6&#xD;
      months during 2 years, then yearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economical section :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective of &quot; SAGE &quot; study is to light up decision maker in striking the balance of&#xD;
      each strategy (induced costs and prevented costs) and results in terms of health as expressed&#xD;
      by individuals preference depending on different health status, treatment strategies and&#xD;
      clinical practice in French centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, the medico-economical evaluation on such a quite National scale (17 different&#xD;
      centers) takes place in a practice standardization prospect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each participating center, one of the 3 strategies for the sentinel LN analysis is&#xD;
      currently used (with or without extemporaneous procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effect evaluation will inventory all undertaken costs in each strategy and all induced&#xD;
      positive or negative consequences, both at a qualitative and quantitative level using micro&#xD;
      costing and macro costing evaluations. Evaluation of Quality of Life adjusted to health will&#xD;
      be included to the cost effect analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, population studied with a localized breast carcinoma, are women aged between 18&#xD;
      and 65 years old and likely to be active : inclusion criteria are strictly the same in the 3&#xD;
      strategies studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, we will consider Hospital and Health Insurance point of view. Hospital prospect&#xD;
      will identify and value the cost paid by health institution due to the use of any of these 3&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insurance Health prospect will value the costs of each treatment strategy including direct&#xD;
      costs related to private medical care and not only those to be reimbursed to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study starts at the time of the sentinel LN excision and ends 9 months later, including&#xD;
      the post-operative complications and the possible second surgery for axillary LN excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all 920 patients will be included in the 20 participating team.&#xD;
