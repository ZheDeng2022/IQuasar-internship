  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation (DBS) as a possible new treatment for Tourette Syndrome (TS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation will (1) test the hypothesis that centromedian (CM) continuous brain&#xD;
      stimulation will be an effective, safe method for the treatment of tics in medication&#xD;
      refractory TS, (2) will define the intra-operative and post-operative physiological changes,&#xD;
      and (3) will test the hypothesis that responsive brain stimulation (RBS) will provide an&#xD;
      alternative to chronic DBS in TS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Normal clinical care for TS includes cognitive behavior therapy, medication, supportive&#xD;
      psychotherapy, and/or a combination of the two. To meet entry criteria for this study, you&#xD;
      must have already tried these methods and they did not help your symptoms. DBS is considered&#xD;
      experimental for the treatment of TS and would not be done as normal clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will require extensive pre-surgical screening to determine&#xD;
      eligibility for DBS surgery, a DBS surgical procedure, and regular follow-ups. Subjects will&#xD;
      be seen monthly post surgery for 6 months. After 6 months, data will be assessed and RBS may&#xD;
      be offered as a stimulation setting. If so, the stimulator settings will be changed from&#xD;
      chronic to responsive. If not, the subject will continue to receive chronic DBS stimulation.&#xD;
      Subsequent visits will be scheduled every 6 months until a total of 24 months of study&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the initial 24-month study period, subjects will have the choice of 1)&#xD;
      continuing active stimulation at the current setting, 2) continuing stimulation but searching&#xD;
      for a new setting, 3) discontinuing stimulation (turning the device off), 4) having the&#xD;
      device removed. If the subject continues to receive active stimulation, they will be followed&#xD;
      by the PI and seen at yearly intervals until the DBS system is commercially available, FDA&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of TS, or unavailable for patient use.&#xD;

    <description>The YGTSS is a 10-item semi-structured clinician-rating instrument that provides an evaluation of the number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference of motor and phonic symptoms. The items pertaining to the tic ratings are scored on two subscales: motor tics and phonic tics. Behaviors are rated on a 6-point scale. A higher score indicates a higher severity of symptoms.</description>

    <description>The investigators will collect real time, local field potentials (LFP) that are time synchronized with clinical behavior, from the CM region, pre-motor, and motor cortex in order to study the thalamocortical interactions and determine if there is a correlation between increases in gamma oscillations and improvement in Tourette Syndrome (TS) symptomology.</description>

    <description>Scores on the YGTSS during continuous stimulation will be compared to scores on the YGTSS during RBS.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects' DBS surgical intervention requires implantation of a DBS system: two CM thalamic leads (one in each brain hemisphere), two ECOG strip leads (one in each brain hemisphere), and two neurostimulators implanted in the chest.&#xD;
The ECOG strip lead is implanted into the brain to provide an interface through which stimulation can be delivered or activity of the brain can be monitored by the device, or observed by a clinician using a programmer.&#xD;
Neurostimulator and leads system includes a programmer, which includes a wand and telemetry interface, and a patient remote control to check battery status and whether the device is on or off. The programmer is used to set up the device, including setup of stimulation and recording, as well as to retrieve data for subsequent review.</description>

    <description>The DBS system includes an implantable neurostimulator, CM thalamic leads, and Electrocorticography (ECOG) strips.&#xD;
The DBS system will be set to provide continuous stimulation for the 6 months following surgery. Subjects will be seen monthly for evaluation as a part of normal clinical care for DBS. At 6 months, the investigators will determine whether or not the subject is a candidate for responsive brain stimulation (RBS). Qualifying subjects will have the option to have their settings changed in order to participate in the RBS stimulation intervention. Subjects who do not qualify or do not participate will continue to receive this intervention for the duration of the study. These subjects will been seen every 6 months for evaluation as part of normal clinical care for DBS.</description>
