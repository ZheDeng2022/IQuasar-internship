  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no standard treatment for Merkel cell carcinoma(MCC), as no randomized trials have&#xD;
      been conducted to establish standard of care. Despite a sizable number of objective responses&#xD;
      induced by combination cyototoxic chemotherapy, a prolongation of patients overall survival&#xD;
      has never been demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label, randomized, double-arm, multi-centre, phase II study of F16IL2 in&#xD;
      combination with paclitaxel versus paclitaxel monotherapy, proposes to test the therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy of F16IL2 plus paclitaxel in patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, who are&#xD;
      not amenable to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 90 patients with Merkel cell carcinoma will be enrolled and treated during the&#xD;
      study; 45 patients will receive the combination treatment of F16IL2 and paclitaxel (Arm A),&#xD;
      and 45 patients will receive paclitaxel monotherapy (Arm B).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      F16IL2 has been studied in two clinical pase I/II trials in patients with different advanced&#xD;
      cancer types. One of them (Nr. EudraCT: 2007-006457-42) tested the administration of&#xD;
      therapeutic doses of paclitaxel (up to 90 mg/m2 on a weekly basis) together with escalating&#xD;
      doses of F16IL2 (from 5 Mio IU of IL2 equivalents in a weekly administration schedule, until&#xD;
      definition of MTD). More than 40 patients were treated in this clinical trial. As of today,&#xD;
      the highest F16IL2 dose tested corresponds to 45 Mio IU, but the dose escalataion of the&#xD;
      F16IL2/paclitaxel combination study is still ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, treatment of patients with F16IL2 plus paclitaxel was very well tolerated not&#xD;
      exceeding the expected toxicity of chemotherapy alone. Multiple objective and durable tumor&#xD;
      responses were observed in the F16IL2/paclitaxel combination trial(particularly in patients&#xD;
      with non small cell lung cancer or melanoma who had previously failed several lines of&#xD;
      chemotherapy). In addition to several disease stabilizations of previously progressive&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes&#xD;
      microtubules by preventing depolymerisation. This stability results in the inhibition of the&#xD;
      normal reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and&#xD;
      mitotic cellular functions. In addition, paclitaxel reduces abnormal arrays or bundles of&#xD;
      microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F16 is a human recombinant antibody fragment in the scFv (single chain Fragment variable)&#xD;
      format that is directed against tenascin C, an angiogenesis marker common to most solid&#xD;
      tumors independent of the tumor type. ScFv(F16) selectively localizes in tumor tissues in&#xD;
      animal models as demonstrated both histologically and during mechanistic studies involving&#xD;
      mice transfected with orthotopic human tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL2, the human cytokine interleukin-2, is a potent stimulator of the immune response. It has&#xD;
      a central role in the regulation of T cell responses and effects on other immune cells such&#xD;
      as natural killer cells, B cells, monocyte/macrophages and neutrophils (Smith, 1988). IL2 can&#xD;
      induce tumor regression through its ability to stimulate a potent cell-mediated immune&#xD;
      response in vivo (Rosenberg, 2000).&#xD;
