      A study to compare the change in glycaemic control in participants with Type 2 diabetes when&#xD;
      treated with GWP42004 or placebo as add-on therapy to metformin over a period of 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This 14 week (one week baseline, 12 week treatment period and one week follow-up),&#xD;
      multicentre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study will evaluate&#xD;

    <description>The DTSQ (status version) is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of eight items. Two of the eight items are used to assess 'perceived frequency of hyperglycaemia' and 'perceived frequency of hypoglycaemia', both of which are rated from 0 (none of the time) to 6 (most of the time) and are summed to produce a Glycaemic Control score.

    <measure>Change from baseline to the end of treatment in mean Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) total score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and End of treatment (Day 85)</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II is a multiple choice self-reported inventory that is one of the most widely used instruments for measuring the severity of depression. There are 21 questions or items, each having four possible responses. Each response is assigned a score ranging from zero to three, indicating the severity of the symptom. Items 1 to 13 assess symptoms that are psychological in nature, while items 14 to 21 assess symptoms that are more physical. The sum of all BDI-II item scores indicates the severity of depression. For participants eligible for this study, a score of 21 or over represents depression. The BDI-II can distinguish between different subtypes of depressive disorders, such as major depression and dysthymia. A decrease from baseline to the end of treatment, a negative value, indicates an improvement.</description>

    <description>Participants are scored at each clinic visit for the following outcomes using the C-SSRS: suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviour, suicidality (including complete suicidality). Possible flags are as follows: &quot;Wish to be Dead&quot;, &quot;Non-specific Active Suicidal Thoughts&quot;, &quot;Active Suicidal Ideation Without Intent&quot;, &quot;Active Suicidal Ideation With Intent, No Plan&quot;, &quot;Active Suicidal Ideation With Intent and Plan&quot;.

    <measure>Change from baseline to the end of study in mean Cannabis Withdrawal Scale (CWS) total score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Final follow-up (Day 92)</time_frame>
    <description>The CWS is validated and used as a diagnostic instrument in clinical and research settings where regular monitoring of withdrawal symptoms is required. The CWS will be completed for UK-based participants only. The CWS is a 19 item scale with each item (withdrawal symptom) measured on a 0-10 point scale (0 = Not at all, 5 = moderately, 10 = Extremely). For each item, the participant is asked to record the extent to which it was experienced in the last 24 hours and also to rate its negative impact on their normal daily activities (i.e., two separate scores are recorded for each item using the same 0-10 scale). Scores are summed over the 19 items for each measure, extent of experience and negative impact on normal daily activities. An increase from baseline to the end of study, a positive value, indicates withdrawal.</description>
