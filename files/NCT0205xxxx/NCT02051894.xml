  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1 in 1000 babies are born suffering from a lack of oxygen. This is known as hypoxic ischemic&#xD;
      encephalopathy (HIE). Infants with this condition can suffer multiple organ problems. In&#xD;
      particular it can affect how their hearts pump blood around their body thus leading to a poor&#xD;
      blood supply to parts of their body such as the brain. This is known as circulatory failure&#xD;
      and can contribute to poor long term outcomes such as cerebral palsy. To try and prevent&#xD;
      brain damage these infants are treated with total body cooling, however this treatment can&#xD;
      further effect how babies pump blood around the body, but also how drugs which may be used by&#xD;
      in this condition are processed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess and treat this condition doctors need to be able to accurately measure the&#xD;
      blood supply in an infant. However there is no agreement on how best to do this. This makes&#xD;
      decisions about when to treat an infant difficult. Sometimes doctors may want to use drugs&#xD;
      such as dobutamine or adrenaline but these drugs are unlicensed in babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to observe the way babies circulatory problems are treated in babies with&#xD;
      HIE the in the first four days of life. In addition the study will look are two new&#xD;
      measurements of a babies blood supply to see if they are a better measure of when an infant&#xD;
      needs treatment. This will involve an ultrasound scan of the heart and measurement of the&#xD;
      baby's oxygen levels from a probe placed on their hand. The study will also look at how the&#xD;
      drug dobutamine is processed by babies. This will be done from two small extra blood tests.&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to help clinicians refine the identification and treatment of&#xD;
      circulatory failure in babies with HIE.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current definitions of neonatal shock/circulatory failure are outdated, inaccurate and it&#xD;
      is not be appropriate to apply to infants suffering from hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy he&#xD;
      purpose of the this research is to look at older than 33 weeks gestational age in order to&#xD;
      fill the knowledge gap here and help in the development a new definition of neonatal&#xD;
      circulatory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main research questions are:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate new non-invasive methods of assessing an infants circulatory status in&#xD;
           infants suffering from HIE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To gain initial data on how dobutamine is processed by babies when they are used for&#xD;
           circulatory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To observe how physicians decide to treat circulatory failure in infants suffering from&#xD;
           HIE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that there is up to a 14 fold difference in how doctors assess and treat&#xD;
      circulatory failure. In infants suffering from hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy this is&#xD;
      complicated further by the fact that treatment with total body cooling can interfere further&#xD;
      with how the body pumps blood around the body. This is further complicated by the fact there&#xD;
      is no agreed definition for circulatory failure in infants. By investigating new methods of&#xD;
      assessing a babies circulatory status we intend to help create a new definition of&#xD;
      circulatory failure which will in turn help doctors create further studies to identify&#xD;
      infants with circulatory failure and find the best ways of treating this condition in babies.&#xD;
      So far research in this area has been concentrated in babies born at less than 33 weeks&#xD;
      gestation. We extend the knowledge in the area to infants older that 36 weeks gestation&#xD;
      suffering from hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dobutamine is a drug that does not have a license for use in infants. In the future all new&#xD;
      drugs will need to be studied in children before a license for them is given. In addition the&#xD;
      European Community are encouraging that research is undertaken to look into the use of old&#xD;
      drugs in which are used in babies. As mentioned previously there is very little data to show&#xD;
      how dobutamine is handled by babies and contribute to new information on how this drug should&#xD;
      be given safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an observational pilot study, to gain novel values of SVC flows and pleth values&#xD;
      in infants with HIE being treated with total body cooling. In addition this population will&#xD;
      be observed with regard to which diagnostic measures that lead to treatment decisions,&#xD;
      especially with regards to haemodynamic stability, and what the effect of those decisions are&#xD;
      on the various diagnostic measures. Decision-making for their treatment will be based on&#xD;
      clinical guidelines in at the Trevor Mann Baby Unit and clinician preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of SVC flow and PVI will only be done every 24 hours whist the infant is&#xD;
      receiving total body cooling and once during the re-warming phase of their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measure Values for SVCF and PVI in neonates with HIE admitted for total body&#xD;
      cooling derived from Echo-D and plethysmographic studies .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observed Clinical Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI appearances&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cranial US appearances&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CFM appearances The MRI will be reported and scored according to a system described by&#xD;
           Rutherford et al to aid predict long term outcome. This will be performed within the&#xD;
           first two weeks post-total body cooling treatment which is in keeping with national and&#xD;
           local guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the findings on cranial ultrasound scan will be interpreted in the light of a&#xD;
      baseline scan, to be performed as soon as possible after birth on enrolment, to avoid&#xD;
      ascribing the effect of antenatal insults to postnatal events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those treated for HIE with total body cooling will have an additional daily neurological&#xD;
      assessment during the cooling and re-warming phases of treatment that will be a graded&#xD;
      according to criteria set out by Sarnat et al. This is routine in the treatment of this&#xD;
      population of infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CFM recordings will be made during the cooling treatment phase of an infant. This is a&#xD;
      standard observation in children with HIE and is associated with long term outcomes for these&#xD;
      infants. For the purposes of the study the CFM will be used at the discretion of the&#xD;
      attending medical team. The analysis of the CFM will follow what was used in the Toby Trial&#xD;
      and is described in detail elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments for Circulatory Failure Infants will receive treatment according to the preference&#xD;
      of the responsible physician. As is common practice, dobutamine, dopamine and/or other&#xD;
      treatments (including other cardiovascular drugs and/or volume replacement therapy with&#xD;
      normal saline) will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose of administration The dose of administration of dobutamine will be at the discretion of&#xD;
      the responsible physician. We envisage that dobutamine will typically be started between 2.5&#xD;
      and 5 mcg/kg/min and increased in steps of 5 mcg/kg/min to a maximum of 20 mcg/kg/min with a&#xD;
      given time frequency if no response is seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any changes to the treatment strategy will be documented by the responsible physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Up-Titration of Medication Dose escalation will be guided by clinical judgment.&#xD;
      Clinicians will be asked to record the criteria they used in order to make this decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Down-Titration Dose reduction will be guided by clinical judgment. Clinicians&#xD;
      will be asked to record the criteria they used in order to make this decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further treatment If there is no response to dobutamine at 20 mcgg/k/min or the clinical&#xD;
      response is considered by the attending physician to be inadequate, further treatment will be&#xD;
      at the discretion of the attending physician who will be asked to record the reasons for the&#xD;
      change in treatment strategy as well as the additional treatment that is given to the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant therapy There will be no per-protocol concomitant medication or treatment.&#xD;
      Accordingly, other important co-interventions will follow specific centre protocols and will&#xD;
      be recorded in the case record form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHARMACOKINETICS (PK) SUB-STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the PK sub-studies The aim of the sub-study is to give preliminary information in&#xD;
      order to try and construct a population PK model. Given the uncertainties regarding the PK of&#xD;
      dobutamine in infants receiving total body cooling we shall assess its elimination half life.&#xD;
      This is defined as the amount of time for the quantity of a concentration to fall by half.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half-life sub-study We will perform a preliminary study on all the infants included in&#xD;
      NeoAdapt 3 that receive dobutamine as treatment for haemodynamic insufficiency. Two blood&#xD;
      samples, of 400 μl each, will be obtained from each of these patients. The first sample will&#xD;
      be drawn after the end of the infusion, at the time when dobutamine ceases reaching the&#xD;
      systemic circulation of the neonate, defined as time end (te).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second sample will be taken at different study time points after the end of infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 min after te&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 min after te&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  45 min after te&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 hours after te&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 hours after te Two infants will be allocated to each time point. Sampling times will&#xD;
           be assigned randomly to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma samples will be sent to the laboratory for the quantification of dobutamine.&#xD;
