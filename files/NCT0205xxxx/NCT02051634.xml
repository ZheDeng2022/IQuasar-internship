  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to explore the effects of fermented papaya preparation&#xD;
      (FPP) on whole body inflammation, physical function, fatigue, and health-related quality of&#xD;
      life. The investigators will conduct a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot&#xD;
      study on FPP in older adults. If FPP is found to have a beneficial impact on systematic&#xD;
      inflammation in this study population (adults aged 70-100 years old), then this supplement&#xD;
      may be a potential treatment option to combat aging.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All of the participants in this research study will be divided randomly into one of two&#xD;
      groups: (1) a group taking fermented papaya preparation (FPP) for 8 weeks then taking placebo&#xD;
      for 8 weeks or (2) a group taking placebo for 8 weeks then taking FPP for 8 weeks. Placebo&#xD;
      sachets do not contain any treatment product. Participants will be assigned randomly to be in&#xD;
      one of these two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to take study product for 8 weeks each, and participation in the&#xD;
      study will last for a total of approximately 22 weeks. Participants will be asked to attend&#xD;
      five study visits at the University of Florida's Institute on Aging - Clinical &amp;&#xD;
      Translational Research Building (IOA - CTRB): Screening Visit, Visit 1, Visit 2, Visit 3, and&#xD;
      Visit 4. Visit 1 will take place approximately 30 days after the Screening Visit. Visit 2&#xD;
      will take place approximately 8 weeks after the Screening Visit. Visit 3 will take place&#xD;
      approximately 16 weeks after the Screening Visit. Visit 4 will take place approximately 20&#xD;
      weeks after the Screening Visit. Participants will be asked to fast (i.e., no food or liquids&#xD;
      except water) for 8 hours prior to all clinic visits. Each visit will take approximately 1.5&#xD;
      to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be called weekly during the study to ask how they are feel and to find&#xD;
      out and if they remembered to take all of their study product. Finally, investigators will&#xD;
      call approximately two weeks after participants stop taking the study product to ask how they&#xD;
      are feeling.&#xD;
