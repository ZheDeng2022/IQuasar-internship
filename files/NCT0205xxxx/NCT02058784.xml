        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy, adult, male or female, 18-55 years of age, inclusive, at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 1 only: continuous nonsmoker who has not used nicotine-containing products for&#xD;
             at least 6 months prior to the first dose and confirmed by urine cotinine test at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 2 only: moderate to heavy smokers defined as &gt; 1 pack of cigarettes per day or&#xD;
             &gt; 39 cigarettes per week for at least 6 months prior to the first dose and confirmed&#xD;
             by urine cotinine test at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 18.5 and ≤ 32.0 kg/m2 at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medically healthy with no clinically significant medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, laboratory profiles, vital signs or ECGs, as deemed by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For a female of non-childbearing potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A non vasectomized, male subject must agree to use a condom with spermicide or abstain&#xD;
             from sexual intercourse during the study until 90 days beyond the last dose of study&#xD;
             medication. (No restrictions are required for a vasectomized male provided his&#xD;
             vasectomy has been performed 4 months or more prior to study start. A male who has&#xD;
             been vasectomized less than 4 months prior to study start must follow the same&#xD;
             restrictions as a non vasectomized male).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Understands the study procedures in the informed consent form (ICF), and be willing&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated or has significant emotional problems at&#xD;
             the time of screening visit or expected during the conduct of the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Any drugs known to be significant inducers of CYP enzymes, including St. John's&#xD;
                  Wort, for 28 days prior to the first dose dosing of study medication and&#xD;
