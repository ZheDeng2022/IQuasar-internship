    <textblock>
      Understanding of how best to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has evolved over the last&#xD;
      ten years. Evidence now suggests that the most effective therapy early in the course of&#xD;
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) involves the use of immune suppressing&#xD;
      medications such as the anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (anti-TNF) agents infliximab, adalimumab,&#xD;
      and certolizumab. However, many CD and UC patients still ultimately require surgery despite&#xD;
      the use of these medications. Side effects of the anti-TNF agents include increased risk of&#xD;
      infections due to their effect on the immune system. Little is known about how use of these&#xD;
      medications near the time of surgery may affect patients' risks of infection or other&#xD;
      post-operative complications. The only available studies on this topic have given conflicting&#xD;
      results. These studies have been limited by the fact that they have been small in size and&#xD;
      retrospective. Retrospective studies primarily involve chart review as the method of&#xD;
      identifying potential risk factors for infections and other complications after they have&#xD;
      already occurred. This method limits both the type and quality of information/data that can&#xD;
      be collected. The conflicting results have led to variance in practice patterns with regards&#xD;
      to management of anti-TNF agents, the timing of surgery, and even the types of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By enrolling patients at the time of their surgery, collecting extensive information may be&#xD;
      possible than previously studied on potential risk factors for both infectious and&#xD;
      non-infectious complications following surgery. Risk factors to be studied will include&#xD;
      individual patient characteristics, disease characteristics, surgical methods, novel&#xD;
      characteristics of CT scans and MRIs and extensive medication exposures. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to determine if exposure to anti-TNF agents prior to surgery increases the risk&#xD;
      of infection post-operatively. And evaluate exposure to anti-TNF agents by both patient&#xD;
      history of use and measurement of anti-TNF drug levels at the time of surgery. Monitoring of&#xD;
      drug levels at the time of surgery has never been utilized in this way to evaluate the risk&#xD;
      of anti-TNF agents in IBD. However, this has been done to assess the risk of other&#xD;
      medications in different diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If anti-TNF agents are found to pose a risk for infectious or non-infectious outcomes in IBD&#xD;
      patients undergoing surgery, change maybe needed in the way these medications are used around&#xD;
      the time of surgery. Additionally, by collecting comprehensive information on other potential&#xD;
      risk factors besides medication use patients at greatest risk for bad outcomes can be&#xD;
      identified and take protective measures when possible. The aims of this study address the&#xD;
      CCFA challenge to better define the risks of medical and surgical therapies to improve the&#xD;
      quality of care of IBD patients undergoing surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study designed to determine if&#xD;
      pre-operative exposure to anti-TNF agents is an independent risk factor for post-operative&#xD;
      infectious complications within 30 days of surgery in subjects with IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient assessments will occur at the Screening/Baseline Visit, Discharge Day, and 30-Day&#xD;
      Telephone Follow-up (see Figure 1). Potential pre-operative predictors of post-operative&#xD;
      infections will be assessed at the Screening/Baseline Visit through a brief patient interview&#xD;
      and abstraction of medical records. Data will be entered into the electronic case report&#xD;
      forms (eCRF). A second data abstraction will occur on the Discharge Day. At this time, all&#xD;
      data from the day of surgery will be available including finalized operative reports,&#xD;
      anesthesia records, and pathology. The post-operative medical record will also be reviewed&#xD;
      for potential confounding factors related to post-operative infection (i.e. presence of&#xD;
      central lines, foley catheters, antibiotic use, etc.). Additionally, the medical record will&#xD;
      be reviewed for the occurrence of post-operative infection and the other non-infectious&#xD;
      outcomes being studied. Data will be entered into the eCRF. The final assessment will occur&#xD;
      on post-operative day 30 (within 1 week). A telephone interview will be conducted. The&#xD;
      purpose of the interview is to assess for the occurrence of post-operative infection and&#xD;
      non-infectious outcomes. If an infection has been identified, relevant medical records will&#xD;
      be requested to confirm infection and abstract information pertaining to the infection. Data&#xD;
      will be entered into the eCRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Anti-TNF Exposure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to anti-TNF agents will be defined in two different ways. The primary analysis will&#xD;
      define anti-TNF exposure as patient report of use within 12 weeks of surgery pre-operatively.&#xD;
      Confirmation of patient report will be through medical record abstraction. This definition of&#xD;
      anti-TNF exposure is consistent with many of the retrospective, single center studies on&#xD;
      post-operative infections related to IBD surgery. The 12-week cutoff point has been chosen to&#xD;
      account for the washout of infliximab before surgery based on its half-life. However, the&#xD;
      different anti-TNF agents have varying half-lives. Date of last administration prior to&#xD;
      surgery will be recorded so that different cutoff points to define exposure such as 4 weeks&#xD;
      and 8 weeks may be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary analysis will define anti-TNF exposure by measured peri-operative levels in&#xD;
      patients with a history of anti-TNF use in the six months preceding surgery. Anti-TNF levels&#xD;
      and anti-drug antibodies will be checked at two time points in patients with recent anti-TNF&#xD;
      use. An initial level will be drawn at the screening visit, which may occur peri-operatively&#xD;
      up to post-op day 4. A second level will be drawn anytime between post-op day 4 and post-op&#xD;
      day 7. The serum from these blood draws will be stored at -80 Celsius until the third year of&#xD;
      the study at which time samples will be tested for drug levels and antibodies.&#xD;
