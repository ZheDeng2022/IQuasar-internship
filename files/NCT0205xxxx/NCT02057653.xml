  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As part of a quality assurance program, the Department of Anesthesiology implemented a&#xD;
      Goal-Directed Fluid Management training course for all physicians and nurses to provide&#xD;
      goal-directed fluid management. We intend to assess whether there has been any improvement in&#xD;
      patient outcomes by analyzing de-identified clinical information that are readily available&#xD;
      via the medical center electronic medical record system. The time-frame we are interested in&#xD;
      is one year before and one year after the Goal-Directed Fluid Management training curriculum&#xD;
      (June 15, 2011 to September 15, 2013).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A number of published studies in anesthesia have demonstrated that certain patient factors&#xD;
      may impact patient perioperative outcomes. Factors such as age, gender, cardiac function, and&#xD;
      hemodynamic status all have been shown to be predictive indicators. The goal of the present&#xD;
      study is to evaluate these factors with the effectiveness of the Goal Directed Fluid&#xD;
      Management training on patient outcomes after major surgeries and document the final&#xD;
      perioperative outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study in which patients' de-identified clinical information will be&#xD;
      extracted from the University of California, Irvine Medical Center electronic medical record&#xD;
      system to evaluate whether there has been a change in patients' outcomes after the&#xD;
      Goal-Directed Fluid Management training curriculum was implemented. We will extract data from&#xD;
      both before and after the training took place-- the time-frame is from June 15, 2011 to&#xD;
      September 15, 2013. Specifically we will be looking at 30 day re-admission and 90 day&#xD;
      mortality following surgery. There are no study procedures or use of biological material.&#xD;
      Patient identifies are utilized in the secure database as this is utilized for clinical&#xD;
      management. When the data is extracted from the database for research purposes the patient&#xD;
      identifiers will be removed and no patient identifiers will be included in the information&#xD;
      during statistical analysis or subsequent reporting. For publication, only aggregate data is&#xD;
      utilized. No identifiable patient information will be released at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations may include: Sample Size Considerations, Predictors,&#xD;
      Covariates/Cofounders, Statistical Goal(s), Statistical Approach, and Secondary Analysis.&#xD;
      Specifically, statistical analysis will be performed using computerized software (SPSS for&#xD;
      Windows version 12.0). For data that was non-normally distributed a Mann Mann-Whitney test&#xD;
      will be used and normally distributed data will be compared using the Student T-test. Ordinal&#xD;
      and nominal data will compared using Chi-Square analysis. A p value smaller or equal to 0.05&#xD;
      will be considered significant. These statistical considerations will aid in supporting the&#xD;
      study's hypothesis for patient outcomes improvement with Early Goal Directed Fluid Management&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
