      Τhe effectiveness of newer angiotensin-II receptor blockers and cardioselective&#xD;
      beta-adrenergic blockers in treatment of arterial hypertension and in improvement of arterial&#xD;
      stiffness has been established in previous studies among the hypertensive population. The&#xD;
      present study is a comparison of the performance of two drugs, telmisartan and nebivolol, in&#xD;
      24h ambulatory blood pressure values and in the degree of arterial stiffness of patients with&#xD;
      stage I arterial hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be carried out with the use of 24-h ambulatory blood pressure measurement&#xD;
      devices and the method of pulse-wave velocity analysis. The effects of telmisartan and&#xD;
      nebivolol are going to be compared for a total time period of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to determine whether the expected decrease in arterial stiffness&#xD;
      of subjects with stage I arterial hypertension can be attributed to the blood pressure fall&#xD;
      solely, or to other factors as well. These factors are possibly dependent on the action of&#xD;
      these drugs on the renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone system (RAAS) or on peripheral&#xD;
      vasodilatory actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is going to be the first comparative test of the anti-hypertensive effects&#xD;
      of the two pharmaceutical substances in 12 months' time, and of the elimination of total&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk in terms of primary prevention of cardiovascular attacks.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to study the effects of telmisartan, a newer angiotensin-II receptor blocker and&#xD;
      nebivolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker on the 24-h ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
      values of subjects with stage I arterial hypertension in a total time period of 12 months. At&#xD;
      the same time, a study of the effects of treatment with the above mentioned antihypertensive&#xD;
      drugs on the grade of arterial stiffness of hypertensive subjects will be carried out. The&#xD;
      purpose of this project is to determine whether the expected decrease in arterial stiffness&#xD;
      of subjects with stage I arterial hypertension can be attributed to the blood pressure fall&#xD;
      solely, or to other factors, as well. These factors are possibly dependent on the action of&#xD;
      these drugs on the renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone system (RAAS) or on peripheral&#xD;
      vasodilatory actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to observe and compare, in a time period of 12 months, the&#xD;
      performance of two antihypertensives of different drug categories, telmisartan and nebivolol,&#xD;
      in treatment of patients with stage I arterial hypertension and in improvement of arterial&#xD;
      stiffness. It is an observational study according to the ESH (European Society of&#xD;
      Hypertension) guidelines for treatment of patients with arterial hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is going to be applied to subjects that attend the Hypertension-ABPM Clinic of the&#xD;
      3rd department of Internal Medicine in Papageorgiou University Hospital. All individuals&#xD;
      enrolled in the study will give a written consent for their participation. Healthy volunteers&#xD;
      aged between 18 and 65 years diagnosed with stage I arterial hypertension (24h SBP/DBP ≥&#xD;
      130/80 mm Hg) will be selected. All cases will regard to the initial diagnosis of arterial&#xD;
      hypertension, for which participants in the study will not receive or have previously&#xD;
      received any antihypertensive medication. At attendance, individual body weight in light&#xD;
      clothing and without shoes is going to be recorded and BMI (body mass index) is going to be&#xD;
      calculated as the ratio &quot;body weight (kg) / [height (cm)]2 &quot; . Waist and hip circumference&#xD;
      will also be measured in cm. Participants in the study will be divided into three categories&#xD;
      according to BMI: Normal weight (BMI 18,5 to 24,9), overweight (BMI 25 to 29,9) and obese&#xD;
      (BMI over 30). Detailed case-history and family history, smoking habit and alcohol use will&#xD;
      be recorded for each individual. A series of laboratory examinations will be executed: Hct,&#xD;
      serum glucose, fasting serum total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides, plasma urea,&#xD;
      creatinine, uric acid, sodium, potassium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in the study are going to be patients initially instructed for a three-month&#xD;
      lifestyle modification, according to the ESH guidelines. Recommended interventions include&#xD;
      cessation of smoking, physical exercise 3-4 hours per week, exclusion of polyunsaturated&#xD;
      fatty acids from the diet, high contamination of natural fibers, reduction of added salt to a&#xD;
      minimum, all aiming to reduce blood pressure to normal. Patients who present with stage I&#xD;
      arterial hypertension (24h SBP/DBP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg) at the end of the three-month period of&#xD;
      lifestyle modification will enter the study and undergo PWV-measurement, according to the&#xD;
      methods described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final selection of the sample of 80 patients diagnosed with stage I arterial hypertension&#xD;
      will be based on the ABPM results (24h SBP/DBP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg). Patients who present with&#xD;
      normal ABPM values at the end of the 3-month period will be excluded from the study. Subjects&#xD;
      diagnosed with white-coat hypertension [increased office BP values (SBP/DBP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg)&#xD;
      combined with normal ABPM values (24h SBP/DBP &lt; 130/80 mm Hg)] will also be excluded from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: All subjects with contra-indications for submission of drugs used in the&#xD;
      research protocol are going to be excluded from the study. The following categories of&#xD;
      patients will not participate in the research: renal failure, hepatic failure, renal artery&#xD;
      stenosis, bronchial asthma, vasoconstrictive (Prinzmetal's) angina, hypertrophic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy, aortic valve stenosis, mitral valve stenosis, sinus tachycardia, sinus&#xD;
      bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, chronic atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, second and third degree atrioventricular block, right heart failure due to&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension, pheochromocytoma, peripheral artery disease. Pregnant and nursing&#xD;
      women will be excluded from the study (history and pregnancy test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of Phase I (time 0), patients will be randomized into two groups, according&#xD;
      to the antihypertensive medication they are going to receive. The first group will receive&#xD;
      telmisartan, whereas the second group of patients will be instructed to receive nebivolol. In&#xD;
      the telmisartan group, each patient will receive 40 mg of telmisartan daily in the morning.&#xD;
      Patients of the group of nebivolol will take 5 mg of nebivolol daily in the morning. The aim&#xD;
      of the study in each of the phases is the normalization of the BP of the participants (24h&#xD;
      SBP/DBP &lt; 130/80 mm Hg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the first month of treatment, all participants will undergo 24h ABPM and&#xD;
      arterial stiffness measurement. Patients classified in the normal BP range based on the&#xD;
      results of ABPM (24h SBP/DBP &lt; 130/80 mm Hg) will continue on the same medication scheme. For&#xD;
      patients still classified in the stage I hypertensive range, the treatment will be modulated&#xD;
      as follows: the telmisartan group is going to receive 80 mg of telmisartan daily in the&#xD;
      morning, while the nebivolol group will receive 10 mg of nebivolol daily in the morning&#xD;
      (beginning of Phase II - time 1 month).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same procedure (24h ABPM and arterial stiffness measurement) will be repeated at the end&#xD;
      of the 6th month from the beginning of the study. Patients classified in the normal BP range&#xD;
      based on the results of ABPM (24h SBP/DBP &lt; 130/80 mm Hg) will continue on the same&#xD;
      medication scheme. For patients still classified in the stage I hypertensive range, the&#xD;
      treatment will be modulated as follows: 12,5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide will be added in the&#xD;
      medication scheme of both groups. The telmisartan group starts to receive the combination&#xD;
      scheme telmisartan/HCTZ 80/12,5 mg morning dose, whereas the nebivolol group starts on the&#xD;
      combination scheme nebivolol/HCTZ 10/12,5 mg morning dose. This point indicates the beginning&#xD;
      of phase III of the study (time 6 months). When 12 months from the beginning of the study are&#xD;
      completed, patients of both groups will undergo 24h ABPM and arterial stiffness measurement.&#xD;
      The end of the 12-month period from the beginning of the study (end of Phase III) indicates&#xD;
      the completion of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the measurement methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      24-h ABPM 24-h ABPM will be performed for all participants on a typical working day. All&#xD;
      subjects will be instructed to follow their usual program of daily activities. The&#xD;
      measurement device Spacelabs 90217 (Spacelabs Inc., Redmond, Wash.) will be used. A cuff of&#xD;
      the appropriate diameter will be adapted around the non-dominant arm of each subject and&#xD;
      three BP measurements will take place. A simultaneous measurement with the use of a&#xD;
      sphygmomanometric device will be taken, in order to make sure that the mean of differences in&#xD;
      BP values with the two methods is not ≥ 5 mm Hg. All participants should maintain their&#xD;
      normal activity from 08:00 to 22:00, with the arm still and loose during the measurements.&#xD;
      One measurement takes place every 15 minutes between 06:00 and 00:00, and every 30 minutes&#xD;
      between 00:00 and 06:00. Participants should avoid intense physical exercise and sleep during&#xD;
      daytime, while they will be instructed to rest between 00:00 and 06:00 and not to rise out of&#xD;
      bed until 06:00, even if awakened before that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial stiffness measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of the grade of arterial stiffness of the participants will take place in&#xD;
      each phase of the study in a quiet examination room with stable temperature (21ºC) and low&#xD;
      lighting. Subjects are instructed to lie down at the examination room for 15 minutes before&#xD;
      the beginning of the procedure. Also, they should avoid food, caffeine and cigarette smoking&#xD;
      for three hours, and alcohol use for ten hours before the measurement. The method of the&#xD;
      measurement of the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), according to the European&#xD;
      Expert Consensus on Arterial Stiffness, is used to define the grade of arterial stiffness.&#xD;
      The velocity of the pulse wave (PWV) is calculated by the equation PWV= D (m) / t (s), (t)&#xD;
      representing the time needed for transmission of the arterial pulse wave across the distance,&#xD;
      and (D) representing the distance between the measurement points. (D) is directly measured&#xD;
      with the use of a measurement tape, whereas (t) is given by the Complior System (Colson, Les&#xD;
      Lilas, France). It is quantified as the time space between the transmission of the pulse from&#xD;
      carotid to radial and to femoral artery and the formation of the two waveforms, respectively.&#xD;
      The two waveforms are simultaneously recorded at the right common carotid artery and the&#xD;
      right femoral artery ('foot to foot' method) via mechanic sensors put on the body surface in&#xD;
      direct contact with the skin. Participants should stay in supine position and avoid talking&#xD;
      or sleeping during the recordings. All the measurements will be executed by the same&#xD;
      observer. A second measurement of the PWV will be carried out 15 minutes after the first one.&#xD;
      The two recordings will be identically carried out.&#xD;
