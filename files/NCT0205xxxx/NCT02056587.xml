  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 10,000 metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients receive first-line therapy&#xD;
      in the Russian Federation. Bevacizumab (Avastin) in combination with interferon-alpha (IFN)&#xD;
      is a recommended first-line treatment for metastatic RCC according to clinical&#xD;
      recommendations of Russian Ministry of Health from 15.07.2010. Two randomized phase III&#xD;
      trials (AVOREN, CALGB) showed that 50% of patients will progress on bevacizumab plus IFN&#xD;
      within 8.5 - 10.2 months and will need sequential therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus (Afinitor) is a single agent which was evaluated and demonstrated efficacy in&#xD;
      randomized phase III study (RECORD-1) in metastatic RCC patients after failure of targeted&#xD;
      therapy. However, in this trial everolimus was compared with placebo for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients whose disease had progressed on treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib (n=227). Only&#xD;
      9% (n=24) of patients received bevacizumab. Thus, efficacy data of everolimus in patients&#xD;
      with disease progression on first-line bevacizumab is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating the effectiveness of everolimus in metastatic RCC patients with failure on&#xD;
      bevacizumab with/without interferon alpha has a scientific and practical sense, and it is&#xD;
      important for Russian Federation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      17563 new cases of renal cancer and 83790 associated deaths have recorded in the Russian&#xD;
      Federation in 2008. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is responsible for 4,3% of all malignancies,&#xD;
      with increased risk of disease after the age of 60 years. Renal cell carcinoma accounts for&#xD;
      90% renal neoplasms, and in 85% of renal cell carcinoma cases light-cell morphology is&#xD;
      diagnosed. Papillary, chromophobic cancer and cancer of the kidney collecting tubules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30% patients with localized renal cell carcinoma are found to progress after surgical&#xD;
      treatment. In the other 30% renal cell carcinoma is established at the dissemination stage.&#xD;
      Therefore approximately 60% of renal cell carcinoma patients are estimated to have&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to estimations by Kidney Cancer Research Bureau, currently first line treatment is&#xD;
      indicated to approximately 10,000 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma in Russia&#xD;
      annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently opportunities for systemic treatment in metastatic renal cell carcinoma were&#xD;
      limited to administration of cytokines and clinical research investigating novel medications.&#xD;
      Various combinations and doses of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-alpha (IFN) have been&#xD;
      investigated in randomized studies in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Immunotherapy was&#xD;
      found to have only limited efficacy (overall response rate 15-16%, survival of 12 months).&#xD;
      Therefore target medicines, specifically - tyrosine kinase inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors,&#xD;
      are under development as first and subsequent lines of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to standards of medical care established by the Ministry of Health and Social&#xD;
      Development of the Russian Federation as of July 15, 2010, combination of bevacizumab&#xD;
      (Avastin™) and interferon is recommended as first line treatment. According to two randomized&#xD;
      phase III trials (AVOREN, CALGB) more than half of patients are expected to require further&#xD;
      treatment for disease progression in 8,5-10,2 months. Everolimus (Afinitor) is the only&#xD;
      medicine that has been investigated in a phase III multicenter study (RECORD-1) as second and&#xD;
      subsequent lines of treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma resistant to targeted&#xD;
      agents. However, most patients (n=277) had received sunitinib or sorafenib prior to&#xD;
      enrolment; only some of them (24 patients (9%) had received bevacizumab. Therefore currently&#xD;
      convincing evidence of everolimus efficacy after progression on prior treatment with&#xD;
      bevacizumab or bevacizumab + IFN is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence it is deemed reasonable and practically relevant to investigate everolimus efficacy in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma previously treated on bevacizumab-containing&#xD;
      regimens, in the Russian Federation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is the proportion of progression-free patients for 2 months (based on&#xD;
      results of a phase III study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Median progression-free survival and overall survival from the time of enrolment Response&#xD;
      rate, according to RECIST 1.1 Treatment safety and tolerability according to NCI-CTCAE v.4.0&#xD;
      Patients quality of life, according to EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire&#xD;
