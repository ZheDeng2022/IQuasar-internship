      The aim of this prospective, randomized clinical trial was to assess the effectiveness of&#xD;
      repair of localized clinical defects of amalgam restorations that were initially scheduled&#xD;
      for replacement of restorations. A cohort of 20 patients with 40 (Class I and Class II)&#xD;
      amalgam restorations, that presented one or more clinical features that deviated from the&#xD;
      ideal (Bravo or Charlie) according to USPHS criteria, were randomly assigned to either, the&#xD;
      repair or replacement group: A: repair n= 19 and B: replacement n=21. Two examiners who had&#xD;
      calibration exercised evaluated the restorations at baseline and ten years after according to&#xD;
      seven parameters: marginal occlusal adaptation, anatomic form, surface roughness, marginal&#xD;
      staining, contact, secondary caries, and luster&#xD;

      Study Design A cohort of 20 patients between the ages of 18 to 80 years old (mean 26.5&#xD;
      years), female (58%) and male (42%), with 40 (Class I and Class II) amalgam restorations,&#xD;
      that presented one or more clinical features that deviated from the ideal (Bravo or Charlie&#xD;
      according to modified United States Public Health Service USPHS criteria). All of them were&#xD;
      recruited at the Operative Dentistry Clinic at the Dental School, University of Chile. The&#xD;
      protocol was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Committee of the Dental School at&#xD;
      the University of Chile (project PRI-ODO-0207), and all patients signed an informed consent&#xD;
      form and completed a registration form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group Criteria: 40 defective restorations were evaluated in accordance with the&#xD;
      modified USPHS criteria. Restorations with clinically diagnosed secondary caries (Charlie) or&#xD;
      under-contoured or over-contoured anatomic form defects and restorations with marginal&#xD;
      defects (Bravo) were randomly assigned (Random Number Generator, Microsoft Excel 97) to&#xD;
      either, the repair or replacement group. Diagnosis of active secondary caries was done&#xD;
      according to Ekstrand's criteria 31.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The groups were labeled A: repair n= 19 (Class I n=8 and Class II n=11) and B: replacement&#xD;
      n=21 (Class I n=9 and Class II n=12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restorations Assessment and Outcome Measurements. The quality of the restorations was scored&#xD;
      according to the modified USPHS criteria (Table 1) 32. Two examiners underwent calibration&#xD;
      exercises (JM and EF, Cohen's Kappa inter-examiner coefficient 0.74 at baseline and 0.87 at&#xD;
      ten years). The examiners assessed the restorations independently by direct visual and&#xD;
      tactile examination (mouth mirror, number 5, Hu Friedy Mfg. Co. Inc., Chicago, IL, USA, and&#xD;
      explorer, number 23, Hu Friedy) and indirectly by radiographic examination (Bite Wing) at&#xD;
      baseline (immediately after treatment) and 10 years after treatment. The seven examined&#xD;
      parameters were marginal occlusal adaptation (MA), anatomic form (A), surface roughness (R),&#xD;
      Marginal staining (MS), occlusal contact (O), secondary caries (SC), and luster (L) (Table&#xD;
      1). If any difference was recorded between the two examiners, and if they did not reach an&#xD;
      agreement, a third clinician, who also underwent calibration exercises (GM), made the final&#xD;
      decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Repair The clinicians (PV and CM) used Carbide burs (330-010 Komet, Brasseler GmbH Co.&#xD;
      Postfach 160.32631, Lemgo, Germany) to explore the defective margin, carious lesion or&#xD;
      anatomic form of the restorations. Part of the restorative material adjacent to the defect&#xD;
      was removed as an exploratory proceedure thus allowing a proper evaluation and subsequent&#xD;
      diagnosis of the extent of the defect. Provided that the defect was limited and localized,&#xD;
      the clinician then removed any defective tooth tissue. Mechanical retention was employed&#xD;
      inside the existing AM restoration. Rubber dam isolation was used for this procedure. Repair&#xD;
      of the restorations was carried out with a dispersed-phased amalgam (Original D, Wyckle&#xD;
      Research Inc, Carson City, NV, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Replacement The clinicians totally removed and replaced the defective restorations. After&#xD;
      completing the cavity preparations, the tooth was restored with a new AM (Original D).&#xD;
      Bonding agents and/or liners underneath the amalgam restorations were not used in this trial.&#xD;
      Rubber dam isolation was used for all restorative treatments. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were recalled after four and ten years after the restoration were placed for&#xD;
      clinical assessment by the same examiners, applying the same criteria used at baseline.&#xD;
      Failed restorations were removed from the study and treated according to their diagnosed&#xD;
      needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The ordinal dependent variable was changed in level of the modified&#xD;
      USPHS criteria from the baseline value. The assigned score of each restoration reflected the&#xD;
      worst result for any of the parameters. The results of each group in terms of degradation or&#xD;
      upgrade were analyzed by Friedman range non-parametric test to compare the pre and&#xD;
      postoperative conditions. Additionally, the performance of all groups was contrasted using&#xD;
      the Mann Whitney test to determine the differences between the upgrade and downgrade of the&#xD;
      restoration´s quality. The statistical significance was set at 95%, α=0.05 and β=0.80,&#xD;
      SPSS15.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis.&#xD;
