      The purpose of this research study is to see if there are differences between&#xD;
      African-American and Caucasian girls with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in how their&#xD;
      bodies respond to a type of sugar, called glucose, the body's main source of energy. PCOS is&#xD;
      one of the most common endocrine disorders among females. Features can include anovulation&#xD;
      (eggs are not released from the ovaries) resulting in irregular menstrual periods, excessive&#xD;
      amounts of androgenic (male) hormones resulting in acne and hirsutism (excessive hair growth&#xD;
      on the face and body), and polycystic ovaries (small sac-like structures [cysts] on your&#xD;
      ovaries) seen on ultrasound. Girls with PCOS also have higher levels of insulin in their&#xD;
      bodies (called hyperinsulinism) but are not able to use insulin very well (called insulin&#xD;
      resistance) resulting in an increased risk of diabetes. Diabetes is when you have high levels&#xD;
      of glucose (sugar) in your blood. Many studies have looked at how bodies respond to glucose&#xD;
      and have shown that compared to Caucasians, healthy African-Americans produce much more&#xD;
      insulin (hyperinsulinism) but are not able to use it as well (insulin resistance) in&#xD;
      childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose move from the&#xD;
      blood into the muscles for the body to use as energy. PCOS is associated with increased&#xD;
      levels of insulin (hyperinsulinism) and not being able to use it as well (insulin&#xD;
      resistance). So we want to see if there is a difference in insulin production (secretion) and&#xD;
      insulin resistance between African-Americans and Caucasians girls with PCOS. To do this, we&#xD;
      will look at blood glucose and insulin levels in response to giving glucose in&#xD;
      African-American and Caucasian girls who have PCOS. The results of this study may ultimately&#xD;
      help to more effectively target treatment therapy in individuals with PCOS that have&#xD;
      increased insulin secretion and/or increased insulin resistance.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      PCOS is the most common endocrine abnormality of reproductive-aged women in the United&#xD;
      States, affecting approximately 5 million women (1). The exact prevalence of PCOS in the&#xD;
      adolescent population is unknown mainly attributed to the diagnostic challenge PCOS presents&#xD;
      as the characteristics of normal puberty overlap with the signs and symptoms of PCOS (2). The&#xD;
      key features of PCOS include menstrual irregularity, hyper¬androgenism, and polycystic&#xD;
      ovarian morphology on ultrasound. However, clinical presentation may vary. It is a complex&#xD;
      heterogeneous condition with life-long psychological, reproductive, and metabolic&#xD;
      manifestations that impact a woman's health throughout her lifespan. PCOS is associated with&#xD;
      major metabolic consequences including hyperinsulinism (i.e. increased insulin secretion),&#xD;
      insulin resistance (i.e. decreased insulin sensitivity), obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, endothelial dysfunction, defective fibrino¬lysis, as&#xD;
      well as endometrial carcinoma (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particular disease processes show a predilection for certain racial and ethnic groups.&#xD;
      African-American [AA] adults are at increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease mortality, and hyper¬tension compared to Caucasian [CA] adults. Past&#xD;
      studies (4-9) have found that AAs have increased insulin secretion and decreased insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity compared to their CA counterparts in adolescence and adulthood and even in&#xD;
      childhood. These findings are secondary to the combination of increased insulin secretion and&#xD;
      resistance with decreased insulin sensitivity and clearance noted in African-Americans. It is&#xD;
      this combination of altered glucose metabolism that places AAs at increased risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity. It has been proposed that hyperinsulinism or&#xD;
      increased insulin secretion is a compensatory response by the pancreatic β-cell to increased&#xD;
      insulin resistance. However, it has also been speculated that it is insulin resistance that&#xD;
      is the compensatory response occurring in response to insulin hyper-secretion caused by&#xD;
      pancreatic β-cell dysregulation (10-11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperinsulinism and insulin resistance are known inherent features of PCOS. Several studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated significant hyperinsulinism with insulin resistance and lowered insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity in adolescents and adults with PCOS when compared to BMI-matched healthy control&#xD;
      subjects (12-18). Marked differences in insulin sensitivity/resistance and PCOS phenotype&#xD;
      have been reported in adults of different races/ethnicities with PCOS (19-23), however; other&#xD;
      studies have refuted these claims (24-27). The objective of this study is to examine the&#xD;
      differences in insulin secretion between AA and CA adolescents with PCOS. We will also&#xD;
      examine differences in insulin sensitivity/resistance between AA and CA adolescents with&#xD;
      PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: To determine the influence of racial/ethnic background on insulin secretion in&#xD;
      adolescent females with PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: To determine the influence of racial/ethnic background on insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity/resistance in adolescent females with PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: AA adolescent females with PCOS will have increased insulin secretion and&#xD;
      decreased insulin sensitivity (i.e. increased insulin resistance) compared to CA adolescent&#xD;
      females with PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this hypothesis, we will utilize one of the gold standards endorsed by the&#xD;
      American Diabetes Association that satisfactorily assess insulin secretion and insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity/resistance. The method utilized in this study is the frequently sampled&#xD;
      intravenous glucose tolerance test with minimal model analysis (MINMOD FSIVGTT) (28-32).&#xD;
      Using the data that is gathered as part of our primary and secondary aims, we will also&#xD;
      conduct an exploratory analysis to examine the influence of PCOS phenotype on insulin&#xD;
      secretion and insulin sensitivity/resistance and the influence of racial/ethnic background on&#xD;
      PCOS phenotype.&#xD;
