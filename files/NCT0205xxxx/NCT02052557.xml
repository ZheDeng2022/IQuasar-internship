      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of Exparel on pain control and patient&#xD;
      outcome after colon resection. The investigators will evaluate the clinical course of the&#xD;
      patients who receive exparel as compared to the patients who do not receive exparel. Exparel&#xD;
      is a 72 hour bupivacaine which is slowly released from lysosomes over the course of three&#xD;
      days. A long acting local anesthetic should provide better pain control than conventional&#xD;
      bupivacaine which has a 3.5 hour half-life.&#xD;

      Patients who are undergoing elective colon resection with Dr. Kraemer and Dr. Raman will be&#xD;
      offered participation in the study. This will include robotic, laparoscopic and open&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pre-operative area prior to surgery, the surgical resident will inform the patient of&#xD;
      the opportunity to participate in the research study. The resident will consent the patient&#xD;
      at that time, if the patient chooses to participate, they will be randomized to an exparel or&#xD;
      non-exparel group. The randomization will be done by having the resident pick an envelope&#xD;
      that will state whether or not the patient is randomized to the exparel or non-exparel group,&#xD;
      this will randomize to 50% in each group. The patient will not be notified of the type of&#xD;
      local anesthetic they receive. The attending surgeon will also be blind to the type of local&#xD;
      the pt will receive; only the resident and Operating Room (OR) staff will know what type of&#xD;
      local anesthetic was given. Unfortunately the opaque color of the exparel precludes the&#xD;
      physician injecting the local anesthetic from being blinded to the type of anesthetic given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be taken to the operating room as usual, and the surgery will proceed as it&#xD;
      normally would. At the end of the surgery the patient will receive either exparel or&#xD;
      bupivacaine depending upon which the patient was randomized to. The attending surgeon will&#xD;
      not be in the operating suite while the local anesthetic is being injected. 30 milliliters&#xD;
      (mL) of either exparel or bupivacaine will be injected into the subcutaneous tissues at the&#xD;
      end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be taken to the post operative care unit (PACU), the medications for&#xD;
      post-operative pain will be standardized between the two groups, a standard starting dose on&#xD;
      the patient controlled analgesia (PCA) will be used, and will be adjusted as needed. The&#xD;
      postoperative care will attempt to be standardized in regard to diet, discharge (dc) of&#xD;
      foley, not using nasogastric (NG) tubes, however this will be based on the individual patient&#xD;
      was what is best for their care. This data will then be analyzed to determine if exparel has&#xD;
      a beneficial effect on surgical care.&#xD;
