  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the highest possible dose of memory enriched T cells that can be&#xD;
      given following standard stem cell transplant before unmanageable side effects are seen in&#xD;
      patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after previous treatment. A T&#xD;
      cell is a type of immune cell that can recognize and kill abnormal cells of the body. Memory&#xD;
      enriched T cells will be made from a patient's own T cells that are genetically modified in a&#xD;
      laboratory. This means that the T cells are changed by inserting additional pieces of&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (genetic material) into the cell to make it recognize and kill lymphoma&#xD;
      cells. Memory enriched T cells may kill the cells that are not killed by stem cell transplant&#xD;
      and may lower the chances of the cancer recurring.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      each cellular immunotherapy product, cluster of differentiation (CD)19R (EQ) 28&#xD;
      zeta/truncated human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRt) + central memory T cell (Tcm)&#xD;
      (Arm 1) and CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ naive memory T cell (TN/MEM) (Arm 2), in conjunction with&#xD;
      a standard myeloablative autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for patients&#xD;
      with high-risk intermediate or high grade B-lineage non-Hodgkin lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the tempo, magnitude, and duration of engraftment of&#xD;
      the transferred T cell product as it relates to the number of cells infused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To study the impact of this therapeutic intervention on the development of normal CD19+&#xD;
      B-cell precursors in the bone marrow as a surrogate for the in vivo effector function of&#xD;
      transferred autologous CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ Tcm or TN/MEM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms. ARM 1:&#xD;
      Patients receive autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing TCM-enriched T cells&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes on day 2 or 3 following HSCT. ARM 2: Patients receive&#xD;
      autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing TN/MEM-enriched T cells IV over 10 minutes&#xD;
      on day 2 or 3 following HSCT. Patients who experience disease progression and have not&#xD;
      experienced serious treatment-related toxicities at greater than or equal to 100 days post T&#xD;
      cell infusion will be allowed to receive an optional second T cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 18-24 hours, then 18-72&#xD;
      hours, weekly for 1 month, monthly for 1 year, at 18, 24, and 36 months, and then annually&#xD;
      thereafter for a minimum of 15 years.&#xD;
