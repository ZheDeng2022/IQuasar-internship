      In this study we will compare the health effect of two different meal patterns. In one&#xD;
      subjects will consume food according to an 'irregular meal pattern' (3-9 meals/day) and the&#xD;
      other 'regular meal pattern' (6 meals/day) for two weeks. The energy requirement of the&#xD;
      subjects will be calculated to maintain body weight during the study. Participants will be&#xD;
      provided with all the food to be consumed during the study. Initially, subjects will attend a&#xD;
      screening visit in which they will complete questionnaires on medical health, eating habits&#xD;
      and physical activity. Height, weight and waist circumference will be measured at this visit.&#xD;
      Thereafter, subjects will be assigned to a 2-wk period following one of the two&#xD;
      meal-patterns. There will be a 2-week period between the two interventions when subjects will&#xD;
      consume their normal diet and at the end of this, participants will undertake the next meal&#xD;
      pattern. During the two phases participants will be asked to wear an armband, which detects&#xD;
      movement and measures heat loss, to assess their energy expenditure and a blood glucose&#xD;
      monitoring device will be worn for three days. Before and after each 2-week intervention,&#xD;
      subjects will come to the lab and will be given a test drink and blood samples will be&#xD;
      obtained to evaluate the health effects of the meal patterns. Energy expenditure will be&#xD;
      measured by indirect calorimetry. They will then be offered an ad-libitum meal and be asked&#xD;
      to eat until they feel comfortably full. During each of the 2-week periods, participants will&#xD;
      be asked to record their food intake and record their appetite sensations on specific days.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous work in our laboratory has shown that there are potentially important negative&#xD;
      health consequences associated with irregular eating. Greater fasting levels of&#xD;
      total-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, a decrease in meal induced thermogenesis, and as a&#xD;
      greater insulin response to a test drink, were observed in healthy women following a two-week&#xD;
      period of irregular meal pattern (variable number of daily meals; from 3 to 9); this was in&#xD;
      contrast to a regular pattern of six daily meals. In addition a greater energy intake was&#xD;
      self-reported during irregular compared with the regular meal pattern. Subsequent studies&#xD;
      have confirmed such an effect in overweight subjects and also provided evidence of&#xD;
      alterations in subjective appetite which may influence ad-libitum food intake. The present&#xD;
      project will study normal weight subjects, and incorporate energy expenditure measurement&#xD;
      under free living conditions using a novel technique (SenseWear armband, SWA), continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitor, and obtain more detailed information about appetite and food intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effects of regular and irregular meal pattern on energy expenditure,&#xD;
      energy intake, , Glucose profiles and subjective appetite in healthy normal weight women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal weight women (BMI 18.5-25) who are otherwise healthy will be studied during the early&#xD;
      phase of their menstrual cycle (first week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be initially screened and then complete a 7 days food diary before&#xD;
      participating in the study which will last for a total of 6 weeks. During the first 2 weeks&#xD;
      participants will adopt one of two meal patterns, followed by a two-week washout period on&#xD;
      habitual diet and meal pattern, before undertaking a second 2-week intervention following the&#xD;
      second meal pattern. The meal patterns will be 1) regular - 6 daily meals or snacks for 2&#xD;
      weeks, or 2) irregular - a different number (between 3 and 9) of meals/snacks every day. All&#xD;
      foods to be consumed during weeks1, 2, 5 and 6 will be provided free of charge, and will&#xD;
      comprise foods commonly consumed in the British diet in amounts designed to keep body weight&#xD;
      constant during the study. Participants will complete food diaries over the study period.&#xD;
      Subjects will wear a SenseWare device (attached to an upper arm) to allow physical activity&#xD;
      and energy expenditure to be estimated in weeks1, 2, 5 and 6. Subjects will attend the lab on&#xD;
      the 6th day of each intervention phase to have a continuous glucose monitoring probe inserted&#xD;
      in their subcutaneous tissue over the abdomen and attached to a small monitor. Subjects will&#xD;
      also need to measure their blood glucose four times a day using a fingerprick to obtain a&#xD;
      droplet of blood and analysing it with a pocket glucose analyser. After three seven subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to come back to have the device removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective appetite (hunger, fullness, etc.) will be assessed using visual analogue scales&#xD;
      (VAS) during the intervention (at the end of the first and second week) Before and after each&#xD;
      intervention period, participants will visit the laboratory after fasting overnight. At 8:30&#xD;
      am a cannula will be inserted into a hand vein, with the hand placed in a heating box, for&#xD;
      subsequent blood sampling. Indirect calorimetry will be performed to determine energy and&#xD;
      changes in the thermic response to a milkshake test drink providing 10 kcals/kg body weight,&#xD;
      and comprising 35% of energy as fat, 15% as protein, and 50% as carbohydrate. The SWA will be&#xD;
      placed on the upper left arm to estimate energy expenditure. Subsequent blood samples will be&#xD;
      obtained every 15 minutes during the next 3 hours in which indirect calorimetry and SWA will&#xD;
      be measured concurrently. Fasting blood samples will be used to measure total-, high density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (HDL)-, and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and&#xD;
      insulin. Blood samples obtained after the test drink will used to measure glucose, insulin&#xD;
      and hormones related to appetite. After that, a test meal (pasta) will be provided as&#xD;
      ad-libitum meal and subject will be asked to fill VAS to assess subjective appetite&#xD;
      sensations.&#xD;
