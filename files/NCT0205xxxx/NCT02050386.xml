  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study designed to look at how arousal levels in the brain change with age and how&#xD;
      these changes influence thinking, vision, hearing and physical function in people of advanced&#xD;
      age.&#xD;

      There are two parts involved in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part #1- Paperwork, Computer-based cognitive tests, Physical function test, EEG recording&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential participants will be pre-screened at the time of their initial phone call to&#xD;
           be sure they fit the guidelines for this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be given this Informed Consent document. This Informed Consent will be&#xD;
           reviewed in a private location; participants will be given as much time as participants&#xD;
           need to consider enrolling in the study. Participants may want to discuss the&#xD;
           information with friends or family. Participants may ask questions at any time during&#xD;
           the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participants choose to sign this form, and agree to participate, participants will be&#xD;
           further screened for inclusion/exclusion factors related to the MRI scanning. All women&#xD;
           under the age of 62 will be given a pregnancy test, based on a urine sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigators will review a detailed Medical History form with participants, asking&#xD;
           questions about participants and participants family's medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigators will ask participants to complete a brief physical activity questionnaire&#xD;
           asking questions about participants daily level of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to complete several computer tasks meant to measure&#xD;
           participants cognitive abilities (like memory and attention), which takes about 30&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also be asked to complete a short physical performance battery (SPPB),&#xD;
           that looks at participants ability to sit and stand, walk a short distance, and balance,&#xD;
           which takes about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also be asked to participate in an EEG recording session. An EEG cap,&#xD;
           selected for participants head size, will be placed on participants head. The cap&#xD;
           contains small electrodes that record participants brains electrical activity. During&#xD;
           this part of the study, participants will sit in a comfortable chair while watching&#xD;
           pictures on a computer screen, listening to sounds through headphones, or resting. This&#xD;
           will take about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also be asked to undergo a cold pressor test (CPT) and/or sham&#xD;
           stimulation. CPT involves immersing either participants hand or foot in cold water for&#xD;
           about one minute. Sham stimulation involved immersing either the hand or foot in room&#xD;
           temperature water for about one minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finally, participants will be transported by someone involved with this study (by&#xD;
           passenger van or golf cart) to the McKnight Brain Institute MRI Center. Or, if&#xD;
           participants prefer, the next portion of the visit can be scheduled for another day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part #2- MRI Scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures will take place at the Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Center at&#xD;
      the McKnight Brain Institute- for the MRI brain scan, and can be done on the same day as Part&#xD;
      #1, or on a different day for participants scheduling convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a procedure that allows doctors to look inside the body&#xD;
      by using a scanner that sends out a strong magnetic field and radio waves. This procedure is&#xD;
      used routinely for medical care and is very safe for most people, but participants will be&#xD;
      monitored during the entire MRI scan in case any problems occur. The risks of MRI are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The MRI scanner contains a very strong magnet. Therefore, participants may not be able&#xD;
           to have the MRI if participants have any type of metal implanted in participants body,&#xD;
           for example, any pacing device (such as a heart pacer), any metal in participants eyes,&#xD;
           or certain types of heart valves or brain aneurysm clips. Someone will ask participants&#xD;
           questions about this before participants have the MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is not much room inside the MRI scanner. Participants may be uncomfortable if&#xD;
           participants do not like to be in close spaces (&quot;claustrophobia&quot;). During the procedure,&#xD;
           participants will be able to talk with the MRI staff through a speaker system, and, in&#xD;
           the event of an emergency, participants can tell them to stop the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The MRI scanner produces a loud hammering noise, which has produced hearing loss in a&#xD;
           very small number of patients. Participants will be given earplugs to reduce this risk.&#xD;

    <description>The Cognition Domain measures several aspects of cognitive functioning for ages 3-85, including language, episodic memory, executive function, working memory and processing speed.&#xD;
To interpret individual performance, one can evaluate all three types of scale scores. A participant's age-adjusted scale score at or near 100 indicates vocabulary ability that is average for the age level. Scores around 115 suggest above-average vocabulary ability, while scores around 130 suggest superior ability.</description>
