  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal hypotheses to be tested is that Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)&#xD;
      reduces the distressing impact of tinnitus to a significantly greater extent than a waiting&#xD;
      list control or relaxation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a mixed design, with two groups assessed at a number of time points. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure will be that of tinnitus distress, and secondary outcomes will be&#xD;
      taken of psychological distress and tinnitus loudness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures will be measured first at 8 weeks pre-treatment. All subjects then wait&#xD;
      for 8 weeks before being randomly allocated to either an 8 week course of Mindfulness-Based&#xD;
      Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) (Group 1) or an 8 week course of Relaxation Therapy (RT) (Group 2).&#xD;
      All participants will be assessed at two main time-points (pre and post-treatment). The&#xD;
      outcome measures will be repeated at 1 and 6 month follow-up points.&#xD;

      Experimental design and methods (including statistical analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be identified from among&#xD;
      patients referred to the adult clinical psychology service within the department of Adult&#xD;
      Audiology at the Royal National Throat Nose &amp; Ear Hospital. These patients will be approached&#xD;
      and invited to discuss participation in the project. The potential participants will be given&#xD;
      full information about the study and invited to consider whether they wish to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study an independent groups, repeated measures design. Two groups will be assessed at&#xD;
      different time points. Group 1 will receive 8 weeks of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy&#xD;
      (MBCT) and Group 2 will receive 8 weeks of Relaxation Training (RT; an active control). All&#xD;
      participants will be assessed at five main time-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  8 weeks pre-treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The start of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The end of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 month follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 month follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be that of tinnitus complaint, and secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures will be taken of psychological distress and tinnitus loudness, tinnitus acceptance&#xD;
      and everyday mindfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of Questionnaire measures and a Visual Analogue Scale will be used to assess&#xD;
      tinnitus complaint, psychological well-being and mindfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are evaluated on all measures at initial assessment (8 weeks pre-treatment), at&#xD;
      treatment commencement, at end of treatment and at 1and 6 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the change in tinnitus complaint as measured by the Tinnitus&#xD;
      Questionnaire from pre-treatment to post-treatment. This will be assessed by using t-tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further statistical exploration will use t-tests to assess change from initial assessment to&#xD;
      end of the 8-week waiting period, and to assess change or maintenance of change from the end&#xD;
      of treatment to the 1and 6 month follow-up points. The same type of analysis will be done on&#xD;
      the measures of psychological well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess for differences in outcome between the MBCT and RT groups, a series of&#xD;
      repeated-measures (2x2) (Group 1 - Group 2 x pre-treatment - post-treatment) ANOVAS will be&#xD;
      carried out. This will allow for the assessment of between group effects and any interaction&#xD;
      effects between group and time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of correlations will also be performed to assess for relationships between&#xD;
      psychological distress pre-treatment and tinnitus outcome within each group. Correlation will&#xD;
      also be performed to assess for relationships between changes in tinnitus complaint and&#xD;
      tinnitus acceptance and everyday mindfulness. They will also be performed to assess for&#xD;
      relationships between changes in psychological distress and everyday mindfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi-square analyses will be carried out on the measures of tinnitus complaint and CORE-OM&#xD;
      score pre- and post-treatment to assess for the numbers of patients within each group who&#xD;
      demonstrate clinically significant change. A clinically significant change in tinnitus&#xD;
      complaint is defined as change of at least 10 points reduction on the TQ. A clinically&#xD;
      significant change in psychological well-being is defined as a reduction of at least 0.5 on&#xD;
      the total mean CORE-OM score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlations will be performed to assess for possible associations between patient&#xD;
      characteristics, attendance, amount of home practice and various outcomes. Weekly measures of&#xD;
      mindfulness will be used to explore the temporal sequence of change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be assessed using all of the measures described above over a 2 week&#xD;
      period. They will then be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 will be treated&#xD;
      using an 8 week course of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Group 2 will be treated&#xD;
      using an 8 week course of Relaxation Training (RT).This randomization will be carried out by&#xD;
      a member of staff at the Ear Institute, who is independent from the clinical part of the&#xD;
      trial. He will use a computer programme to complete randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After assessment, patients enter a 'waiting' stage of the trial, during which they receive no&#xD;
      intervention for eight weeks. Four weeks into the waiting time, all patients will be sent a&#xD;
      letter to confirm the dates and times at which their specific group will take place. On the&#xD;
      eighth week, participants will attend the first group session. At this point, prior to&#xD;
      commencement of the group, they will complete all of the measures described above for a&#xD;
      second time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will then attend 8 consecutive weeks of group treatment. Throughout this&#xD;
      treatment period, at the end of each session, participants will complete two brief measures&#xD;
      (the MAAS the TAQ). This is important as it will allow for the temporal sequence of change to&#xD;
      be assessed, offering an opportunity to explore the potential mediation effect of&#xD;
      mindfulness. At the end of the eighth week, they will again be asked to complete all of the&#xD;
      measures for a third time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will then be invited to attend two further sessions - at 1 and 6 months&#xD;
      after treatment completion. At the start of these sessions all participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete all of the measures described above for a fourth and fifth time. These sessions will&#xD;
      also provide ongoing support to the participants as they will provide an opportunity to&#xD;
      discuss how they are after the groups have finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus MBCT will be compared to an active control condition (RT) and a passive control&#xD;
      condition (wait list control), and RT will also be compared to the passive wait-list control&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
