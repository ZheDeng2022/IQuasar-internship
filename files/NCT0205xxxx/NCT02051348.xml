  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobator pylori (H. pylori) is a bacteria which survives in the lining of the stomach. An&#xD;
      estimated 50% of the world's population is infected with H. pylori. Developing economies,&#xD;
      such as in Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent and Latin America, have prevalence rates&#xD;
      of as high as 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. pylori infection often goes undiagnosed, as many sufferers do not experience any adverse&#xD;
      symptoms. Infection with H. pylori is described as &quot;not a disease in itself but a condition&#xD;
      that affects the relative risk of developing various clinical disorders of the upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract.' Clinically relevant symptoms could include peptic ulcer, melena or&#xD;
      secondary conditions such as iron deficiency anemia or vitamin B12 deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that probiotics can be beneficial for those with gastrointestinal diseases.&#xD;
      Pylopass contains the probiotic strain Lactobacillus reuteri, which was selected for its&#xD;
      anti-H. pylori characteristics and in clinical trials has shown to result in a reduction in&#xD;
      urease breath test values in subjects with H. pylori.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of Pylopass to reduce H. pylori load&#xD;
      in subjects who are H. pylori positive.&#xD;

      Helicobator pylori (H. pylori) is a gram negative, spiral shaped bacteria which colonizes in&#xD;
      the gastric mucosa. An estimated 50 percent of the world's population is infected with H.&#xD;
      pylori.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. pylori infection does not necessarily result in clinically relevant symptoms. Ching and&#xD;
      Wong report that most cases of H. pylori are asymptomatic . Moreover, Kusters et al states&#xD;
      that infection with H. pylori &quot;is not a disease in itself but a condition that affects the&#xD;
      relative risk of developing various clinical disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract&quot;&#xD;
      (Kusters, 2006). Clinically relevant symptoms could include peptic ulcer, melena or secondary&#xD;
      conditions such as iron deficiency anemia or vitamin B12 deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most recent iteration of the Maastricht/Florence Consensus report outlines the diagnostic&#xD;
      guidelines and treatment strategies for those with H. pylori (Malfertheiner 2012).&#xD;
      Individuals with certain risk factors, such as a family history of gastric cancer, bleeding&#xD;
      ulcer or with secondary disease such as iron deficiency anemia should undergo eradication&#xD;
      therapy. For those with functional dyspepsia, the test and treat strategy has been&#xD;
      recommended. However, there remains a lack of options for volunteers who are either&#xD;
      asymptomatic or experience mild gastrointestinal symptoms who are not indicated for&#xD;
      eradication therapy or to undergo the test and treat strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that probiotics can be beneficial for those with gastrointestinal diseases.&#xD;
      A review by Ritchie and Romanuk succinctly summarizes this point by writing that &quot;probiotics&#xD;
      are generally beneficial in treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal diseases&quot; (Ritchie&#xD;
      2012). In the context of H. pylori infection, probiotics are administered alongside&#xD;
      conventional eradication treatment regimens to lessen the severity of side effects and&#xD;
      improve tolerance. Francavilla et al has studied the impact of Lactobacillus reuteri on H.&#xD;
      pylori load levels, as measured by urea breath test (UBT) values. The researchers found that&#xD;
      a significant reduction in H. pylori load as evidenced by significantly decreased UBT values.&#xD;
      They also found a decrease in symptom scores as measured by the Gastrointestinal Symptom&#xD;
      Rating Scale (GSRS) (Francavilla 2008). Imase et al has also studied the impact of&#xD;
      Lactobacillus reuteri supplementation in H. pylori infected individuals and found a&#xD;
      suppressive effect from the L. reuteri tablets on UBT values (Imase 2007). These studies&#xD;
      indicate that Lactobacillus reuteri exerts an effect on H. pylori by lowering the load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many potential mechanisms by which probiotic strains, such as Lactobacillus&#xD;
      reuteri, could exert a suppressive effect against H. pylori. One potential method is to&#xD;
      stabilize or strengthen the gut mucosal barrier. Other mechanisms include sequestration of H.&#xD;
      pylori, production of antimicrobial substances or through competitive binding to receptors in&#xD;
      the gut (Garcia, 2009; Lesbros-Pantoflickova, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pylopass strain of Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) was identified after a detailed,&#xD;
      multi-year screening process. It was selected for its anti-H. pylori characteristics from a&#xD;
      culture collection of 8,000 different food grade strains. The original commensal environment&#xD;
      of the Pylopass strain of L. reuteri is from humans. L. reuteri is considered one of the few&#xD;
      autochthonous lactobacilli in humans and animals known to the scientific community. It has&#xD;
      been isolated in the gastrointestinal tract of humans, pigs, cattle and dogs (Casas 2000). It&#xD;
      has also been isolated in a variety of different foods, such as milk products and fermented&#xD;
      rice noodles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pylopass is comprised of Lactobacillus reuteri cells, suspended in a matrix and spray dried.&#xD;
      As such, the Lactobacillus reuteri cells are metabolically inactive. However, through in&#xD;
      vitro and human studies, it has been shown to exert an H. pylori load lowering effect. In&#xD;
      vitro work has found that Pylopass specifically coaggregates with H. pylori under acidic&#xD;
      conditions. Two human pilot studies have shown that oral administration of Pylopass leads to&#xD;
      a reduction in UBT values in volunteers with H. pylori (Mehling 2013). As the cells of the&#xD;
      Lactobacillus reuteri in Pylopass do not need to be metabolically active to exert a benefical&#xD;
      effect, this provides tremendous advantages in developing economies, where there are many&#xD;
      cases of antibiotic resistant H. pylori.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages of Pylopass over other Lactobacillus products are product stability,&#xD;
      specificity for H. pylori and stability in gastric conditions. As previously mentioned, the&#xD;
      highest prevalence of H. pylori is in developing economies, where access to an adequate cold&#xD;
      chain may not be reliable. As Pylopass is comprised of inactivated cells which can withstand&#xD;
      environmental fluctuations, it is appropriate for shipments that do not require temperature&#xD;
      control. Secondly, while probiotics cater to general gut health, Pylopass specifically bind&#xD;
      H. pylori under acidic conditions. Thirdly, the mechanism of action is not dependent on&#xD;
      binding sites or survival in the gastric environment. Probiotics can be beneficial because&#xD;
      they may replace harmful bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. However, it is uncertain&#xD;
      whether such living strains can withstand the acidic environment in the stomach. This concern&#xD;
      is not a challenge for Pylopass as the coaggregation depends only on the binding of surface&#xD;
      structures between Pylopass and H. pylori. As there are advantages to Pylopass over&#xD;
      traditional probiotic strains, it is the goal of this study to confirm that the results from&#xD;
      the first two human trials hold true.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the challenges of rising rates of antibiotic resistance, delivery of a product which is&#xD;
      relevant and useful in developing economies, development of a product which can withstand&#xD;
      environmental fluctuations and the lack of options for H. pylori positive individuals who are&#xD;
      not indicated for eradication therapy, the development of Pylopass could be an important tool&#xD;
      to address these challenges. To this end, the goal of this study is to assess the impact of a&#xD;
      four week supplementation period of Pylopass on markers of Helicobacter pylori load in&#xD;
      volunteers who do not meet the full criteria for eradication therapy as outlined by the&#xD;
      Maastricht Florence Consensus report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is the urease breath test (UBT), a widely validated&#xD;
      non-invasive measure for H. pylori status. However, we also recognize that there are&#xD;
      limitations of using the urease breath test. The primary limitation is that the UBT serves as&#xD;
      a proxy measure for Helicobacter pylori load levels and does not provide direct assessments&#xD;
      of the health of the gastric mucosa or of H. pylori load. By including a subset of volunteers&#xD;
      for gastric biopsies, the degree of inflammation can be directly assessed and the H pylori&#xD;
      load can be quantified. By performing biopsies at two time points, before and after&#xD;
      supplementation with the active ingredient, the effects of the supplement on the health of&#xD;
      the gastric mucosa can be assessed. Due to the small subset of volunteers, the information&#xD;
      will be qualitative in nature, but will provide a scientific basis for assessing participants&#xD;
      in future studies. As antibiotic resistance is on the rise in cases of Helicobacter pylori,&#xD;
      it is important to continuously develop new adjunctive solutions which may help improve the&#xD;
      health of the gastric mucosa, and the best way to assess this directly is through the use of&#xD;
      gastric biopsies.&#xD;
