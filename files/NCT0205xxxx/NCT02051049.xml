    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term safety follow-up of patients having been&#xD;
      treated with HepaStem.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the SAF001 study is the long-term safety surveillance of the&#xD;
      patients post infusion with HepaStem. Furthermore, the evolution of both the metabolic&#xD;
      condition and the quality of life are followed. As much as possible, the surveillance will&#xD;
      mimic the standard follow-up of the respective diseases (standard of care). The surveillance&#xD;
      will end when the patient is undergoing an organ transplant or takes part in another research&#xD;
      study. This surveillance will last up to a maximum of 48 months.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Characterisation of the long term safety profile of HepaStem therapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of safety will be achieved by evaluating the following parameters&#xD;
Physical examination&#xD;
Vital signs&#xD;
Laboratory tests&#xD;
Liver tumor markers&#xD;
Autoimmune markers related to liver pathology&#xD;
Anti-HLA antibodies specific for donor cell haplotypes&#xD;
Morphology of liver, bile ducts, and portal system by ultrasound&#xD;
Morphology of the kidneys by ultrasound&#xD;
Non-serious or serious Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) related to HepaStem therapy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To characterize the disease evolution after having received HepaStem therapy and to report on general safety.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment is based on the evaluation of:&#xD;
Report on cognitive skills, behaviour, and health-related quality of life indicators&#xD;
Non-serious or serious Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) related to concomitant medications or other causes&#xD;
Indication I: Crigler-Najjar syndrome&#xD;
Frequency and severity of metabolic decompensation&#xD;
Metabolic parameters (serum total bilirubin)&#xD;
Report on supportive treatment and any adjustment of phototherapy and medication (eg phenobarbital treatment)&#xD;
Indication II: Urea cycle disorders&#xD;
Frequency and severity of metabolic decompensation&#xD;
Metabolic parameters (NH3 values, amino acids in plasma)&#xD;
Report on supportive treatment and any adjustment of:&#xD;
diet (natural protein intake, total protein intake, amino acid supplements)&#xD;
Medication (eg nitrogen scavengers)</description>
