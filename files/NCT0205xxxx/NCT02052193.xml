  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BRAF inhibitors dabrafenib and vemurafenib belong both two a new class of potent&#xD;
      anti-cancer drugs and are highly efficacious in tumors harboring the BRAF V600E mutation.&#xD;
      Both drugs seem to be equally efficacious; however, their toxicity profile seems to differ.&#xD;
      Serious phototoxicity has been observed in ~ 30% of patients treated with vemurafenib and in&#xD;
      ~2 percent of patients treated with dabrafenib. These phototoxic reactions have developed in&#xD;
      spite of informing the patients of this possible adverse event and instructing them to&#xD;
      protect themselves. Manifestation of phototoxic reactions depends on the patient's habits of&#xD;
      exposure and their efforts to protect themselves. The true frequency of photosensitivity can&#xD;
      only be established by systematic photo-testing. In dermatology, standard test procedures&#xD;
      with different UV-wavelengths and dosages have been established and the primary goal of this&#xD;
      study will be to clarify the true rate of photosensitivity by these two BRAF-inhibitors.&#xD;
      Furthermore, systematic experience will be collected how to best protect patients from&#xD;
      phototoxic events. Dabrafenib and Vemurafenib are commercially available and considered&#xD;
      standard of care for BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma in Germany. As the number of patients&#xD;
      will not allow any conclusion with regard to efficacy or safety of vemurafenib, patients&#xD;
      randomized to vemurafenib in part 2 will only remain on study until completion of&#xD;
      phototesting.&#xD;
