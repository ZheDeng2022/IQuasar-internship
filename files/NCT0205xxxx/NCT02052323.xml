      Project Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine parasitological clearance rates by microscopy for the 72-hour period after&#xD;
      first artesunate dose in subjects with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. To describe clinical and parasitological outcomes for subjects with uncomplicated P.&#xD;
      falciparum malaria treated with AS-MQ administered sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. To measure the gametocyte carriage rate in subjects with uncomplicated malaria before&#xD;
      and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. To monitor drug levels associated with artesunate-mefloquine treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4. To determine in vitro drug sensitivity profiles for fresh parasites from&#xD;
      malaria-infected subjects prior to artesunate-mefloquine treatment and at the time of&#xD;
      parasite recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5. To identify specific genetic determinants of artemisinin resistance derived from&#xD;
      parasite populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6. To correlate clinical outcomes from the in vivo study with in vitro antimalarial drug&#xD;
      sensitivity responses and molecular genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.7. To compare P. falciparum malaria artemisinin resistance genotypes at three sites in&#xD;
      three continents, using clinical and parasitological outcomes, in vitro drug sensitivity&#xD;
      profiles, and molecular markers generated using harmonized methodologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.8. To determine the contribution of host immunity to parasitological and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.9. To create a catalog of parasite samples closely correlated to clinical datasets to&#xD;
      longitudinally track resistance trends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects aged 5-65 years, who meet study entry criteria will be drawn from the local&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be based at the Kwai River Christian Hospital (KRCH) in Sangklaburi District,&#xD;
      Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand, which is located about 360km northwest of Bangkok near the&#xD;
      Thailand-Myanmar border. Additional sites in Thailand, including in Sai Yok District,&#xD;
      Kanchanaburi Province, may be added if enrolment at Sangklaburi is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled to ensure a minimum of 59 subjects complete all study&#xD;
      activities. This will allow for 40% subjects dropping out or being otherwise unevaluable. Up&#xD;
      to 200 subjects may be screened to achieve the required number of evaluable subjects. A&#xD;
      subject is considered evaluable at 72 hours from the commencement of artesunate treatment or&#xD;
      once asexual parasites have been cleared from peripheral blood based on microscopy, whichever&#xD;
      is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antimalarial drug regimen being evaluated is: artesunate (AS) 4mg/kg by mouth once daily&#xD;
      at 0, 24 and 48 hours; plus mefloquine (MQ) 15mg/kg by mouth once at 72 hours, and 10mg/kg&#xD;
      once by mouth at 84-96 hours; plus primaquine (PQ) 0.5mg/kg single dose by mouth at 84-96&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, single-arm evaluation of AS-MQ combination for the treatment of&#xD;
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Subjects will remain as in-patients until completion of&#xD;
      antimalarial treatment and will then be followed up weekly to 42 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Parasite clearance rate as defined by the slope of the linear portion of the logarithm&#xD;
      parasite clearance curve using microscopy to determine parasitemia&#xD;

&#xD;
      2.5. Parasite molecular markers of drug resistance as determined by GWAS, SNP analysis and&#xD;
      other genotyping methodologies 2.6. A detailed characterization of drug-resistant malaria&#xD;

      of clinical and parasitological outcomes and in vitro and molecular features of parasites&#xD;
      between harmonized sites in Kenya and Peru.&#xD;

      clinical outcomes 2.9. Creation of a well-characterised catalog of malaria parasites for&#xD;
      future research&#xD;
