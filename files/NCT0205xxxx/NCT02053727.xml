  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the combination of abatacept along with&#xD;
      entecavir (the study drugs) is safe and effective in treating symptoms related to rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis (RA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abatacept, given in an intravenous (IV - injected into a vein) as well as subcutaneous form,&#xD;
      is approved by the FDA for the treatment of RA. In this research, abatacept will be given by&#xD;
      injection. A subcutaneous injection is an injection given under the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entecavir, to be taken by mouth, is approved by the FDA for the treatment of hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into the following time periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Phase: Up to 4 weeks Randomized Double-blind Phase: 24 weeks Open-label Extension&#xD;
      Phase: 24 weeksFollow-up Phase: a phone call after Week 48&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each phase contains one or more study visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder affecting 1% of the&#xD;
      world's population. If not adequately controlled, it may lead to disability in up to 30% of&#xD;
      patients within the first three years of disease onset [1] and can be associated with&#xD;
      premature death. Recent research has suggested that the first event in the pathogenesis of RA&#xD;
      is an antigen dependent activation of T-cells in an immunogenetically susceptible host.&#xD;
      T-cells require two signals for activation, one involving the trimolecular complex (class II&#xD;
      Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), antigen, T-cell receptor), and the other being&#xD;
      co-stimulation of the CD28 (Cluster of Differentiation 28) molecule on T-cells by the B7&#xD;
      molecules (CD80 and CD86) on antigen presenting cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can cause chronic disease in 5% of immunocompetent adults and has a&#xD;
      prevalence of over 350 million worldwide. It is a leading cause of chronic hepatitis,&#xD;
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer and accounts for one million deaths annually. In patients&#xD;
      with chronic hepatitis B and RA, treatment options are limited. Traditional disease modifying&#xD;
      anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are associated with hepatotoxicity and are contraindicated in&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis. A recent retrospective analysis suggests that successful use of anti-tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF) agents may be possible in these patients but the authors do&#xD;
      warn that these patients should be closely monitored and that fatal reactivation of hepatitis&#xD;
      B is possible. Treatment with rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against B-cell&#xD;
      protein CD20, is another option; however, the use of this medication in RA patients with&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis B may also cause reactivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When RA patients with chronic hepatitis B were started on a Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)&#xD;
      inhibitor or methotrexate (MTX), 2 of 5 HBsAg+ patients reactivated their hepatitis B,&#xD;
      indicating a possible high rate of activation in these patients when not on hepatitis B&#xD;
      treatment. Reactivation in this and another study occurred after 9-19 months of antirheumatic&#xD;
      therapy. In RA patients with chronic Hepatitis B, entecavir appears to be effective at&#xD;
      preventing reactivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no studies on the safety of abatacept in patients with RA and HBV. Adequate T-cell&#xD;
      function is important to help cure or contain HBV infection. Our site has conducted a&#xD;
      retrospective study that shows preliminary safety of abatacept in patients with RA and&#xD;
      chronic Hepatitis B on antiviral therapy. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of abatacept in RA patients with chronic Hepatitis B in a pilot study in a&#xD;
      randomized, controlled fashion.&#xD;
