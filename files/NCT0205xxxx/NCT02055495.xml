      There is no consensus on the surgical treatment of unremitting, painful flatfeet in children.&#xD;
      Subtalar arthroereisis has gained notoriety although there is a paucity of literature on its&#xD;
      biomechanical effects. The goal of the investigators was to compare a group treated with&#xD;
      subtalar arthroereisis with another group undergoing lateral column calcaneal lengthening.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis was that the results of arthroereisis would be equivalent to the&#xD;
      more established method of calcaneal lengthening.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, non-randomized study was to evaluate two different surgical&#xD;
      treatments for symptomatic planovalgus feet: lateral column lengthening osteotomy and&#xD;
      subtalar arthroereisis. The goal of the investigators was to compare the outcomes of these&#xD;
      two surgeries and determine whether both treatments resulted in clinical improvement. This&#xD;
      was accomplished through the use of pre- and post-operative kinematics, pedobarography,&#xD;
      radiographic measurements, and validated outcome measures. The investigators were&#xD;
      particularly interested in analyzing the kinematic changes to quantify the changes in the&#xD;
      foot mobility and alignment during ambulation, as it has not been previously studied to our&#xD;
      knowledge. The investigators hypothesis was that both procedures would show significant&#xD;
      improvement and be equivalent in their results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective trial was conducted. The investigators enrolled fifteen patients (mean age&#xD;
      12.8y, 24 feet) with painful, planovalgus feet refractory to conservative treatment. Seven&#xD;
      patients (13 feet) were enrolled in the arthroereisis group, and eight patients (11 feet)&#xD;
      were enrolled in the calcaneal lengthening group. Though not specifically excluded, none of&#xD;
      the enrolled patients had an underlying neuromuscular diagnosis. Kinematic motion analysis&#xD;
      was performed on each patient prior to surgery and at one year of follow-up. Pedobarometry&#xD;
      studies, radiographs, and validated outcome questionnaires (Oxford Ankle-Foot Questionnaire&#xD;
      for Children) were also performed to evaluate the outcomes of both groups.&#xD;

        Patient ages ranged from 7 to 17 (mean 12.8y) at the time of surgery. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
        were patients with planovalgus deformity, painful symptoms refractory to conservative&#xD;
        treatment for at least 6 months, and independent ambulation without the use of assistive&#xD;
        devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A longitudinally study of two patient cohorts: 1) children with planovalgus foot deformity&#xD;
        treated with arthroereisis (subtalar implant) and 2) children with planovalgus foot&#xD;
        deformity treated by calcaneal (lateral column) lengthening.&#xD;
