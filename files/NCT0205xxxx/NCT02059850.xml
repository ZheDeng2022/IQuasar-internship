      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best way to give NY-ESO-1 specific T cells&#xD;
      after cyclophosphamide in treating patients with advanced synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round&#xD;
      cell liposarcoma. Placing a gene that has been created in the laboratory into white blood&#xD;
      cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving NY-ESO-1&#xD;
      specific T cells with cyclophosphamide may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To confirm the safety and efficacy of cancer-testis antigen (NY-ESO-1) specific T cells&#xD;
      (autologous NY-ESO-1-specific cluster of differentiation [CD]8-positive T lymphocytes) in&#xD;
      patients with advanced synovial sarcoma and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma following&#xD;
      conditioning with high dose cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To confirm the persistence of NY-ESO-1 tetramer positive cells in the peripheral blood at&#xD;
      10 weeks after T cell infusion for synovial sarcoma and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma&#xD;
      patients receiving NY-ESO-1 specific T cells following cyclophosphamide conditioning but not&#xD;
      post-infusion interleukin (IL)-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -3 and -2 and NY-ESO-1 specific&#xD;
      T cells IV over 60 minutes on day 0. Patients may receive additional infusions at the&#xD;
      discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 12 weeks.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SCREENING:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical history including histopathological documentation of sarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)&#xD;
             signing&#xD;
&#xD;
        CRITERIA FOR LEUKAPHERESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NY-ESO-1 expression in tumor by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is not required prior to&#xD;
             screening consent; however, patients must have NY-ESO-1 expression to proceed with the&#xD;
             leukapheresis; additionally patients must also meet the following criteria to proceed&#xD;
             with leukapheresis (any exceptions to this will require prior approval by the&#xD;
             Apheresis director and Principal Investigator):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical exam and Karnofsky performance status&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete blood count (CBC), differential and platelet count&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Basic metabolic and hepatic function panels&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Puget Sound Blood Center Recipient Donor Battery Panel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy test for females of child-bearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  White blood cell (WBC) &gt;= 2,000&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hematocrit (HCT) &gt;= 30%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 75,000&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Research blood including 40 mL of blood in a heparinized tube for peripheral blood&#xD;
             mononuclear cell (PBMC) collection and 10 mL of blood for serum collection (generally&#xD;
             in a red top tube) within 30 days of leukapheresis collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have &quot;advanced disease&quot;; usually, this will mean metastatic disease;&#xD;
             this may also be multiply recurrent disease or locally advanced disease; locally&#xD;
             advanced disease is defined for this study as disease where a mutilating surgery is&#xD;
             required and the patient is more likely than not to die of their disease despite an&#xD;
             aggressive operation; patients with metastatic disease that has been resected or&#xD;
             radiated are allowed to participate; Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
             (RECIST) evaluable disease is not necessary for participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NY-ESO-1 positive by IHC (for this study, even a small level of positivity is&#xD;
             acceptable); for patients with &lt; 5% NY-ESO-1 by IHC positivity, the level of staining&#xD;
             should be discussed with the patient and they should be informed that this will likely&#xD;
             effect the efficacy of the therapy; this conversation must be documented in the&#xD;
             patient's medical chart&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A0201 or HLA-A2402&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Zubrod performance status of '0-1'&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have an electrocardiogram (ECG) within 2 weeks of starting&#xD;
             conditioning&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have a stress test within 6 months of starting treatment showing no&#xD;
             evidence of cardiac ischemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have an echo or multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) scan showing&#xD;
             ejection fraction (EF) &gt; 50% and normal troponin and creatine kinase (CK) myoglobin&#xD;
             binding (MB) (echo may be done at the time of stress test as a stress echo); within 6&#xD;
             months of starting treatment; however if the patient has received cardiotoxic&#xD;
             chemotherapy such as Adriamycin, they must have had an echo or MUGA scan since&#xD;
             completing this treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If there is a patient with an NY-ESO-1 expressing soft tissue sarcoma who would be&#xD;
             otherwise eligible for the trial, which is either not synovial sarcoma (SS) or&#xD;
             myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCL) or there is controversy about the diagnosis,&#xD;
             eligibility will be decided by the PI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have NY-ESO-1 specific cells already produced or in production; these&#xD;
             cells may be either in the process of their final expansion (for fresh infusion) or&#xD;
             expanded and frozen at the time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients for whom we are unable to generate NY-ESO-1 specific cells&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women, nursing women, and men and women of reproductive ability who are&#xD;
             unwilling to use effective contraception or abstinence; women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test within two weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.6 mg/dL or glomerular filtration rate &lt; 50&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) &gt; 150 IU or &gt; 3 x upper limit of normal&#xD;

             symptomatic)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Newly diagnosed cardiac arrhythmia; patients with an arrhythmia that has been stable&#xD;
             for at least 6 months will be allowed to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastasis; patients with CNS metastasis&#xD;
             will be allowed on study once treated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active systemic infections requiring antibiotics or chronic&#xD;
             maintenance/suppressive therapy; once the infection in question has resolved and&#xD;
             patient is off antimicrobial treatment, patients may participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic anticancer treatments (including chemotherapy and biologics) less than 3&#xD;
             weeks prior to T cell therapy; locally directed therapy (e.g. radiation) 2 weeks prior&#xD;
             to cell infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known clinically significant autoimmune disorders requiring systemic immunosuppression&#xD;
             for control&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive are not&#xD;
             eligible for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current treatment with steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV); (if a&#xD;
             patient was not tested at the time of their leukapheresis, they must be tested prior&#xD;
             to receiving T cell infusion; if testing was done for leukapheresis, this is adequate&#xD;
             and does not need to be repeated)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known history of proven myocarditis, pericarditis, and/ or&#xD;
             endocarditis&#xD;
