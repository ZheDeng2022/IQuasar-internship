      The primary objective was to confirm the effect of tasquinimod in delaying disease&#xD;
      progression or death as compared with placebo in chemo-naïve patients with metastatic&#xD;
      castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives included further evaluation of the safety profile of tasquinimod,&#xD;
      comparison of clinical benefits (such as overall survival and symptoms) of tasquinimod with&#xD;
      placebo, to evaluate the quality of life impact and to determine the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      tasquinimod.&#xD;

      The study involved a 4-week Screening Period, Baseline Visit (Day 1) where the patient was&#xD;
      randomised, followed by a Double Blind Treatment Period. Patients initially received&#xD;
      tasquinimod (or corresponding placebo) at a 0.25 mg/day dose which was then titrated through&#xD;
      0.5 mg/day (from Day 15) to a maximum of 1 mg/day (from Day 29). If tolerability issues arose&#xD;
      at 0.5 or 1 mg/day, patients had their dose reduced to 0.25 or 0.5 mg/day, respectively. The&#xD;
      Double Blind Treatment Period continued until the death of the patient or any criterion for&#xD;
      withdrawal from study treatment was reached. Any placebo treated patients with radiological&#xD;
      disease progression confirmed by the central imaging assessment, who remained asymptomatic or&#xD;
      mildly symptomatic were, at the Investigator's discretion, given the option to continue on&#xD;
      active treatment (tasquinimod) during an Open-Label Treatment Period, following the same&#xD;
      titration rule described above until progression under active treatment. All other patients&#xD;
      stopped study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An End-of-Study Treatment/Withdrawal Visit was to be performed within 14 days after the last&#xD;
      dose of study treatment and patients were then to be followed up every 6 months until 80% of&#xD;
      the patients had died or 2 years after the last patient was randomised, whichever occurred&#xD;
      last.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A PK ancillary study was to be performed in a subgroup of 12 Asian-Chinese patients before&#xD;
      randomisation; however, due to the early termination of this study, only some samples were&#xD;
      analysed and no PK analyses were performed.&#xD;

    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of radiological progression (confirmed by the central imaging assessment) or death due to any cause. Radiological progression was defined by any of the following criteria: progression of soft tissue lesions evaluated by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria; progression of bone lesions detected with bone scan according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria; or radiologically confirmed spinal cord compression or pathological fracture due to malignant progression.&#xD;
The primary endpoint was centrally and independently evaluated.</description>

Due to a necessary visit for 1 patient, the last patient last visit of the study was on 26 May 2015.</recruitment_details>

        <title>Time to Radiological Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of radiological progression (confirmed by the central imaging assessment) or death due to any cause. Radiological progression was defined by any of the following criteria: progression of soft tissue lesions evaluated by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria; progression of bone lesions detected with bone scan according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria; or radiologically confirmed spinal cord compression or pathological fracture due to malignant progression.&#xD;
The primary endpoint was centrally and independently evaluated.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Sponsor required reasonable opportunity to review any abstract, presentation, or paper before the material was submitted for publication or communicated. This also applied to any amendments that were requested by referees or journal editors. The Sponsor committed to comment on the draft documents within a time period agreed in the contractual arrangements between the Sponsor and authors or their institution. Delays were also possible if publication would adversely affect patentability.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The study was terminated early due to the Sponsor deciding to stop development in prostate cancer; therefore, the results of all efficacy analyses should be considered exploratory and not supportive of efficacy in any indication.</limitations_and_caveats>
