      Our objective is to develop a community-based cohort and novel genomic science resource for&#xD;
      defining the biological significance of ancestry-related genomic variation in&#xD;
      African-Americans within the GENE-FORECAST :GENomics, Environmental FactORs and the Social&#xD;
      DEterminants of Cardiovascular Disease in African Americans STudy. This resource will enable&#xD;
      our team to test the working hypothesis that race-ancestry differences in the burden of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) reflects the influence of a unique interplay between the&#xD;
      distinct genomic variation characteristic of African-Americans (AA) and the exposome of&#xD;
      social determinants and environmental factors that influence the pathogenesis of CVD in AA.&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM I. To examine the associations between common or ancestry-related DNA variants and CVD&#xD;
      risk factors (e.g. hypertension) and phenotypes (e.g. coronary artery calcification) in&#xD;
      African-Americans (AA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM II. To examine the associations between health behaviors or social-environmental factors&#xD;
      and CVD risk factors and phenotypes in AA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to create a cohort amenable to nested case-control analyses based on a&#xD;
      community-based sampling frame with a target size of approximately 1800 self-identified, US&#xD;
      -born, African-American (AA) men and women (ages 21-65) to be recruited over the next 5-6&#xD;
      years from the metropolitan Washington DC, Montgomery County (MC) and Prince George s County&#xD;
      (PG) areas to be recruited to the NIH Clinical Center. The initial participant recruitment&#xD;
      strategy involved two approaches: 1) a random-digit telephone screening survey targeting&#xD;
      study-eligible AA that will be consented and invited to an evaluation visit in the NIH&#xD;
      Clinical Center which we contracted with a well-established survey group (Southern Research&#xD;
      Group [SRG]); and 2) a community outreach effort to recruit participants into the Clinical&#xD;
      Center by leveraging marketing and the engagement of community-based leaders, organizations&#xD;
      and faith-based institutions in the area. We are no longer contracting with SRG but rather&#xD;
      focusing on community outreach and marketing for recruitment to the Clinical Center. The&#xD;
      contract with SRG was terminated after the first two years of the protocol due to low yield&#xD;
      of recruitment to the Clinical Center compared to community outreach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the high burden of CVD among AA, this approach will yield a sample with normal&#xD;
      individuals as well as a high proportion of AA with CVD risk factors such as obesity and&#xD;
      hypertension that predispose to the eventual clinical signs and symptoms of CVD (e.g. heart&#xD;
      attack and stroke). Based on previous epidemiology studies, this protocol s participant&#xD;
      ascertainment approach and the target demographic profile; it is anticipated that the&#xD;
      prevalence of clinically manifest CVD (history of angina, heart attack or stroke) will be&#xD;
      less than 10-15% of the sample. All participants will undergo extensive evaluation in the&#xD;
      Clinical Center that includes: medical evaluation (e.g. anthropometrics, blood pressure),&#xD;
      laboratory tests (e.g. lipid levels, kidney function), social determinants profiles (e.g.&#xD;
      socioeconomic status (SES), perceived stress, discrimination, depression, perceived&#xD;
      neighborhood characteristics), blood/urine collection for deep-sequencing based omic analyses&#xD;
      (e.g. whole exome sequencing, and RNA-Seq), as well as testing for pre-clinical , biomarkers&#xD;
      of the pathobiological processes of CVD or CVD phenotypes (e.g. coronary artery&#xD;
      calcification, microalbuminuria, leukocyte telomeres, or vascular dysfunction). It is&#xD;
      anticipated that these deep sequencing efforts will yield novel ancestry-related DNA variants&#xD;
      associated with the CVD phenotypes; yet with unclear biological significance in elucidating&#xD;
      racial disparities in CVD. Accordingly, our protocol also includes a Genotype-to-Phenotype&#xD;
      (G2P) component that re- contacts subsets of the cohort based on their genotype (e.g. APOL1&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease risk alleles) for a call-back visit for more in-depth phenotyping and&#xD;
      characterization of the potential effect of the DNA variant of interest on human systems&#xD;
      biology. In some cases family members of the proband may also be invited to participate in&#xD;
      these G2P studies to further characterize the biological significance of these putative&#xD;
      functional DNA variants of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variables involve well established CVD phenotypes: 1) CVD risk factors&#xD;
      (e.g. hypertension, dyslipidemia), 2) markers of pre-clinical CVD (i.e. coronary artery&#xD;
      calcification, coronary plaque burden by cardiac CT angiography (CTA), carotid plaque burden&#xD;
      by 3D ultrasound, vascular dysfunction, microalbuminuria, C-reactive protein, Vitamin D&#xD;
      levels). The protocol will assess exposures associated with CVD and relevant covariates&#xD;
      including: 1) social determinants (e.g. socioeconomic status (SES), perceived stress,&#xD;
      discrimination, and depression); 2) environmental factors s......&#xD;

      characteristics (geospatial features of healthy lifestyles [e.g. walkability]) and 3)&#xD;
      behavioral factors (e.g. diet, physical activity). The G2P callback visit protocol will&#xD;
      involve additional measures of in-depth phenotyping that include: 1) peripheral immune cell&#xD;
      phenotyping (e.g. T-cell, monocyte subsets); 2) blood/immune cell RNAseq; 3) iPSC cell line&#xD;
      generation (endothelial; vascular smooth muscle cells) and analysis of cardiovascular cell&#xD;
      systems biology; 4) HDL proteome analysis, 5) FDG PET/CT and/or PET/MRI scan (vascular&#xD;
      inflammation) 6) echocardiography, 7) bisulfite sequencing for identifying sites of DNA&#xD;
      methylation, and 8) chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (Chip-Seq) for&#xD;
      identifying sites of histone modification. It is anticipated that this multi-level,&#xD;
      multi-dimensional analysis of genomic and phenotypic characteristics of AA will advance our&#xD;
      understanding of the bio-social determinants of the intragroup variance and the increased&#xD;
      overall burden of CVD observed among AA.&#xD;
