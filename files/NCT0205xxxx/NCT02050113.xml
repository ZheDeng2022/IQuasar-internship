      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of custom made devices,&#xD;
      Zenith t-Branch devices and physician modification of FDA approved off-the-shelf endovascular&#xD;
      grafts in the treatment of patients with complex abdominal aneurysms, aortoiliac aneurysms or&#xD;
      thoracoabdominal aneurysms who (1) have anatomy not suitable for endovascular repair using&#xD;
      grafts currently marketed in the United States,(2) are deemed unsafe to wait the required&#xD;
      time necessary for commercial endograft manufacturing, and (3) are at high risk for open&#xD;
      surgical repair. Amendment to the study has created a cohort open to people with connective&#xD;
      tissue diseases such as Marfan, Ehlers-Danlos or Loey-Dietz syndromes to enroll in the trial.&#xD;
      An additional amendment to the study allows the use of a custom made device to treat an&#xD;
      aneurysm in the aortic arch.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular repair of complex aortic aneurysms is limited by the need to maintain blood flow&#xD;
      to the critical organs that receive blood from the aorta, such as the kidneys, liver and&#xD;
      intestines. While there are some commercially available devices that may treat some of these&#xD;
      patients these devices may not be suitable or available for a given patient. In this study we&#xD;
      will use custom made devices manufactured by Cook, Inc, Zenith t-Branch devices and&#xD;
      off-the-shelf, FDA approved devices which are altered by creating fenestrations (holes) in&#xD;
      the stent graft that allow additional stents to be inserted into the blood vessels that&#xD;
      supply blood to these critical organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of which type of endograft to use will be based on the patient's anatomy and&#xD;
      the perceived urgency of the need for repair. This decision will be made by the study team&#xD;
      and confirmed by a 3rd party reviewer who is not an investigator on the study team. After&#xD;
      ensuring that a patient meets inclusion and exclusion criteria for participation in the&#xD;
      CARPE-CMD study, the perceived urgency for repair will be evaluated given the 6-8 week&#xD;
      required time for manufacture of a CMD device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient's aneurysm is not symptomatic and if, at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      surgeon, the patient is deemed safe to wait 8 weeks until repair, the patient will be&#xD;
      considered non-urgent. Non-urgent patients will undergo repair with a CMD device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient's aneurysm is symptomatic and if, at the discretion of the treating surgeon,&#xD;
      the patient is deemed unsafe to wait 8 weeks until repair, the patient will be considered&#xD;
      urgent. Urgent patients will undergo repair with a t-branch device (if anatomy suitable)&#xD;
      Urgent patients who do not have anatomy suitable to a t-branch device or patients who are not&#xD;
      deemed safe to wait for the device to be obtained, will undergo repair with a physician&#xD;
      modified device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device is inserted into the body through two small punctures or incisions in the groin.&#xD;
      Small stents will be inserted through the stent graft fenestrations into the major blood&#xD;
      vessels affected by the aneurysm so that blood flow is maintained to these organs.&#xD;

    <description>The surgeon will place a custom made graft, t-Branch device or modify commercially available stent grafts to match the anatomy of the patient being treated. Small fenestrations (holes) will be made in the stent graft so that additional stents can be inserted through the fenestration and into the blood vessels that lead to the kidneys, intestines or liver. These stents allow blood to flow freely to these organs. If the aneurysm is in the aortic arch stents may be placed in the carotid and subclavian arteries. This surgery is done through small incisions in the groin and sometimes in the upper arm.</description>
