      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intra- and postoperative use of the&#xD;
      cardioPAT® cell saver decreases the need for allogenic red blood cell transfusion in&#xD;
      patients, who undergo open heart surgery (with cardiopulmonary bypass) and preoperatively&#xD;
      have an increased risk for bleeding.&#xD;

      This scientific study will be conducted as a randomized controlled trial with N = 146, and&#xD;
      therefore n = 2 x 73.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be carried out as a simple 1:1 randomization in to the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group: undergo heart surgery with blood conserving strategies that are currently&#xD;
           standard routine at Rigshospitalet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Interventional group: undergo heart surgery with intra- and postoperative use of the&#xD;
           cardioPAT cell saver. The cardioPAT collects blood from the operative site and from the&#xD;
           chest tubes, thereafter it washes and concentrates the red blood cells. This blood can&#xD;
           then be returned to the patient. Furthermore, this group will also receive the same&#xD;
           blood conserving strategies as the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified for the inclusion criteria to ensure that the two groups&#xD;
      have the same amount of women, men with a hemoglobin under 8 mmol/l and men over 75 years&#xD;
      with double procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All legally competent adults who receive an on-pump open heart surgery at the Department of&#xD;
      Cardiothoracic Surgery at Rigshospitalet will be screened for participation in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with an increased risk for bleeding, who undergo open heart surgery, that is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men with a hemoglobin &lt; 8mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men &gt; 75 years of age with combined procedures, that is f.ex. combined CABG and valve&#xD;
           surgery, regardless of preoperative hemoglobin level&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Re-operation within the first 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known clotting disorders (coagulopathy) or hematological diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sepsis, f ex due to Endocarditis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are already enrolled in other studies, where data from the studies are at&#xD;
           risk of interfering with each other&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Jehovah's witnesses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute surgery (&lt; 24 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether the requirement for allogenic transfusion of red blood cells (SAG-M), platelets&#xD;
           and fresh frozen plasma to patients, with an increased bleeding risk who undergo open&#xD;
           heart surgery, can be decreased with intra- and postoperative use of the cardioPAT® cell&#xD;
           saver&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether the percentage of patients receiving no transfusion (0 units) is increased with&#xD;
           the use of a cardioPAT® cell saver&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cost-effectiveness of using the cardioPAT® cell saver compared with the current&#xD;
           standard treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemoglobin and platelet count for the interventional group pre- and postoperatively, as&#xD;
           well as at discharge and compare these with the control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The composition and quality of the cardioPAT® red blood cell product&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The composition of the cardioPAT® waste product&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The length of stay in the ICU and total hospitalization after cardiac surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The impact on different aspects of coagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The extent of renal impairment in the postoperative period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The inflammatory response in the postoperative period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endothelial injury in in the postoperative period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard deviation, for blood transfusion to patients at the Department of Cardiothoracic&#xD;
      Surgery, Rigshospitalet, was calculated to ±0,32.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a clinical point of view a relevant reduction, which would justify a routine use of the&#xD;
      CardioPAT® device, would be somewhere between 15-20%. This reduction would result in the&#xD;
      Department saving every 1/7 to 1/5 unit of blood. Therefore a difference of 15% will be used&#xD;
      for the power calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated by means of a &quot;Sample Size Calculator&quot; found online at:&#xD;
      http://hedwig.mgh.harvard.edu/sample_size/size.html.This power analysis calculated that a&#xD;
      total of 146 patients will need to enter this two-treatment parallel-design study. The&#xD;
      probability (power) is 80% that the study will detect a treatment difference at a two-sided&#xD;
      0,05 significance level, based on the assumption that the standard deviation of the response&#xD;
      variable is 0,32 and the true difference between treatments is set to 0,15 units (15%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis will be conducted after the inclusion of approximately 80 patients. If&#xD;
      the results are relevant at this time, the study will stop inclusion here and present the&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
