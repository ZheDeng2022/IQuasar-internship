      HCC is classified as keratin (K) 19 positive or K19 negative. K19 is a biliary/hepatic&#xD;
      progenitor cell (HPC) marker only expressed in a subset of HCC with poor prognosis and high&#xD;
      risk of early recurrence after treatment; particularly in radio-frequency ablation (RFA).&#xD;
      These patients consequently show worse survival compared to patients with K19 negative HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent publication has shown the value of pretreatment biopsy with K19 staining and&#xD;
      suggests that the role of routine biopsies in potentially curable HCC should be reconsidered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, currently, pretreatment biopsies are rarely performed in the diagnosis of HCC due to&#xD;
      the excellent performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detection, diagnosis and&#xD;
      staging of cirrhotic livers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous publications have indicated imaging patterns that may be associated with worse&#xD;
      prognostic tumoral parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If MRI determined imaging parameters could indeed provide a surrogate marker for presence of&#xD;
      K19 and/or microvascular invasion as potential important prognostic factors in RFA of HCC,&#xD;
      these imaging parameters may thus hold prognostic information towards RFA treatment and&#xD;
      possibly predict treatment outcome. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the retrospective study is thus to evaluate MRI determined imaging parameters&#xD;
      at pretreatment MRI for their predictive value towards outcome (disease free survival) of&#xD;
      radio-frequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, pretreatment MRI parameters may be used for selecting patient with high risk&#xD;
      of unfavorable outcome after RFA and select the patients for more aggressive treatment such&#xD;
      as surgical resection or upfront transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent pathological, immunohistochemical and molecular profiling have progressively revealed&#xD;
      the complex classification of primary liver cancers and have resulted in a subclassification&#xD;
      roughly separating mucinous cholangiocarcinomas from mixed tumors from &quot;pure&quot; hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, HCC is classified as keratin (K) 19 positive or K19 negative. K19 is a&#xD;
      biliary/hepatic progenitor cell (HPC) marker only expressed in a subset of HCC with poor&#xD;
      prognosis and high risk of early recurrence after treatment; particularly in radio-frequency&#xD;
      ablation (RFA). These patients consequently show worse survival compared to patients with K19&#xD;
      negative HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent publication has shown the value of pretreatment biopsy with K19 staining and&#xD;
      suggests that the role of routine biopsies in potentially curable HCC should be reconsidered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, currently, pretreatment biopsies are rarely performed in the diagnosis of HCC due to&#xD;
      the excellent performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detection, diagnosis and&#xD;
      staging of cirrhotic livers. This progression of MRI is based on technical refining of&#xD;
      three-phase contrast-enhanced imaging, development of the cellular marker sequence&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and hepatospecific biliary contrast-agents. While pretreatment&#xD;
      biopsies would have incremental value in treatment planning, its routine application in daily&#xD;
      clinical practice is faced with multiple problems. First, K19 evaluation at histopathology&#xD;
      can - in most cases - only reliably be performed on whole resection specimens and is more&#xD;
      difficult on biopsies. Second, routine biopsies would lead to a dramatic increase in workload&#xD;
      for radiologists and pathologists influencing daily practice and organization. Also, lesions&#xD;
      are not always readily detectable at ultrasound and possibly not eligible for percutaneous&#xD;
      biopsy requiring laparoscopy guided biopsy under anesthesia. Third, the risk of tract seeding&#xD;
      remains controversial but has not been completely excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous publications have indicated imaging patterns that may be associated with worse&#xD;
      prognostic tumoral parameters. The corona sign seen at CT during arterial portography and&#xD;
      hepatic arteriography (invasive imaging only performed in Japan) is associated with the&#xD;
      presence of microvascular invasion. However, this sign has not yet been described at MRI.&#xD;
      Also MRI derived parameters may predict the presence of HCC expressing progenitor cell&#xD;
      markers, including K19. If MRI determined imaging parameters could indeed provide a surrogate&#xD;
      marker for presence of K19 and/or microvascular invasion as potential important prognostic&#xD;
      factors in RFA of HCC, these imaging parameters may thus hold prognostic information towards&#xD;
      RFA treatment and possibly predict treatment outcome. The hypothesis is that lesions showing&#xD;
      features correlating to K19 positivity such as persistent (rim) enhancement and rim like&#xD;
      intensity at DWI may correlate to worse prognosis than HCC that don't express these imaging&#xD;
      features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If confirmed, MRI may be the first line modality adapting the patients management; either by&#xD;
      selecting patients who actually would benefit from biopsy or identifying patients in who more&#xD;
      invasive treatment is necessary (for instance: surgical resection instead of RFA in child A&#xD;
      patients; ablation with wider margins in patients not eligible for surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, before performing a prospective or interventional study, experience needs to be&#xD;
      gained with the various possible imaging patterns, aiming to find significant correlations&#xD;
      between imaging parameters and adverse prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the retrospective study is thus to evaluate MRI determined imaging parameters&#xD;
      at pretreatment MRI for their predictive value towards outcome (disease free survival) of&#xD;
      radio-frequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, pretreatment MRI parameters may be used for selecting patient with high risk&#xD;
      of unfavorable outcome after RFA and select the patients for more aggressive treatment such&#xD;
      as surgical resection or upfront transplantation.&#xD;
