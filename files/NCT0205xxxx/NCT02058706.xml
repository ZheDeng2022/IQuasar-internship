  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies if enzalutamide added to standard luteinizing&#xD;
      hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue therapy will improve effects against prostate&#xD;
      cancer compared to the standard therapy of LHRH analogue and bicalutamide. Hormone therapies&#xD;
      stop the body from producing or block the effect of male sex hormones (testosterone).&#xD;
      Enzalutamide blocks the effect of male sex hormones which are responsible for the growth of&#xD;
      prostate cancer. Hormonal therapies that lower the level of testosterone are among the most&#xD;
      effective treatments for prostate cancer that have spread to other areas of the body&#xD;
      (metastasized). It is not yet known whether LHRH analogue therapy with bicalutamide is more&#xD;
      effective than LHRH analogue therapy with enzalutamide in treating prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the rates of achieving prostate-specific antigen (PSA) remission at month 7&#xD;
      with LHRH analogue therapy and enzalutamide (Arm A) with that achieved with LHRH analogue and&#xD;
      bicalutamide (Arm B) in metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the primary endpoint by race. II. To compare the rates of each of 2 types of&#xD;
      response by treatment arm: measurable disease response; and PSA response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare each of 7 time-to-event endpoints by treatment arm: duration of overall&#xD;
      response (RD); duration of stable disease (SDD); time to treatment failure (TTF);&#xD;
      time-to-progression (TTP); TTP in patients with bone metastases; progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS); and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare the rates of each type of toxicity by treatment arm. V. To compare the&#xD;
      incidence rate of skeletal related events (SRE), and the time until SRE, separately by&#xD;
      treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To compare the rates of circulating tumor cell (CTC) response by treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To explore the molecular mechanisms within the androgen receptor pathway by determining&#xD;
      the levels of chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) and transmembrane protease, serine 2&#xD;
      (TMPRSS2)-v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (ERG) expression, androgen&#xD;
      metabolism enzymes; androgen receptor variants, and length of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG)&#xD;
      repeats within the androgen receptor gene, and to associate them with the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive enzalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) and undergo orchiectomy or&#xD;
      receive LHRH analogue therapy (leuprolide acetate, goserelin acetate, or any other Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration [FDA] approved preparation). Treatment continues in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive bicalutamide PO QD and undergo orchiectomy or receive LHRH analogue&#xD;
      therapy as in Arm A. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All patients who have not initiated hormone therapy (Early induction patients) must&#xD;
             have elevated PSA ≥ 4 ng/ml within 28 days prior to registration. For late induction&#xD;
             registrations, PSA must be ≥ 4 ng/ml prior to start of androgen deprivation therapy;&#xD;
             either antiandrogen or LHRH analogue or GNRH antagonist .If patients are on&#xD;
             antiandrogen, this will need to be discontinued for at least 7 days prior to&#xD;
             registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant hormone therapy are eligible&#xD;
             provided they have received twenty four or less months of hormone treatment (single or&#xD;
             combination treatment, excluding orchiectomy). Both therapies (neoadjuvant/adjuvant&#xD;
             hormone therapy) must have been discontinued at least 6 months prior to registration.&#xD;
             This is intended to exclude patients who might have been rendered indirectly androgen&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  There must be no plans to receive concomitant chemotherapy, biological response&#xD;
             modifiers, radiation therapy or hormonal therapy. Concomitant radiation therapy is&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell (or squamous&#xD;
             cell) skin cancer, superficial or in situ cancer of the bladder. For an invasive&#xD;
             cancer the patients should be disease free for at least 3 years prior to enrollment on&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For all patients a bone scan must be performed within 60 days prior to registration&#xD;
             for tumor assessment. CT scans (abdomen and pelvis) and chest x-ray are optional, but&#xD;
             must be repeated if used for disease assessment. For late induction registrations,&#xD;
             tumor assessment imaging showing metastatic disease must be available prior to start&#xD;
             of androgen deprivation therapy.&#xD;
