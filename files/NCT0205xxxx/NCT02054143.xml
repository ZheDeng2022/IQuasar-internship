      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of different carbon-dioxide&#xD;
           concentrations on cerebral CO2 sensitivity and the resistance and stiffness of systemic&#xD;
           arteries during anesthesia with sevoflurane. Sevoflurane is a widely and commonly used&#xD;
           inhalational anaesthetic, that is mainly used for the maintenance of general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in the velocity of cerebral blood flow and arterial stiffness due to the&#xD;
           different exhaled carbon-dioxide concentrations will allow us to conclude how&#xD;
           sevoflurane affects these parameters during the course of the narcosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An ultrasound device called transcranial doppler (TCD) is used to measure the velocity&#xD;
           of blood flow within a main artery located inside the skull.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A tonometry device named SphygmoCor is used to assess the pressure wave proceeding in&#xD;
           the radial artery, from which the stiffness of the systemic vessels can be concluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Examinations with the ultrasound and tonometry devices are carried out once before the&#xD;
      operation, three times during the intervention, with different exhaled CO2 values and once&#xD;
      after the operation is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Sevoflurane alters cerebral carbon-dioxide sensitivity and the stiffness of systemic&#xD;
      arteries.&#xD;

      Study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The study is conducted in four stages: in the first stage, measurements are performed&#xD;
      preoperatively in awake patients. Patients are placed in supine position and mean arterial&#xD;
      blood pressure (MAP), heart rate, oxygen saturation are measured. The transcranial doppler&#xD;
      (TCD) probe is fixed in place by applying a headband to maintain a constant angle of&#xD;
      insonation. Mean blood flow velocity (MBFV) and pulsatility index (PI) in the middle cerebral&#xD;
      artery (MCA) are obtained. MCA is insonated through the right temporal window by using pulsed&#xD;
      2 megahertz TCD ultrasound probe. Identification of the MCA is confirmed by using standard&#xD;
      criteria, at a depth of 45-55 mm. Cerebral CO2 vasoreactivity is calculated as the percentage&#xD;
      change in MBFV or PI for mmHg change in end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SphygmoCor is placed on the left radial artery to obtain data about the central aortic blood&#xD;
      pressure, augmentation pressure (AP) and augmentation index normalised to a 75 beat per&#xD;
      minute heart rate (Alx75). From the derived aortic pulse, calculations can be made, using the&#xD;
      area under the systolic and diastolic part of the curve, to determine the heart's ratio of&#xD;
      oxygen supply and demand, it is called the subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the premedication each patient receives 7.5 mg midazolam. Anaesthesia is induced&#xD;
      using 2 mcg/kg fentanyl followed by 2 mg/kg propofol. Afterwards 0.6mg/kg rocuronium is given&#xD;
      for muscle paralysis and subsequently patients were intubated with a suitable intratracheal&#xD;
      tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After induction of anaesthesia, the patients are placed on a mechanical ventilation system,&#xD;
      using a volume-controlled setting with an air and oxygen mixture set to 0.4 fraction of&#xD;
      inspired oxygen (FiO2) , the fresh gas flow rate to 2 l/min and sevoflurane is adjusted to&#xD;
      reach a constant 1minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) during examination. Anesthesia is&#xD;
      maintained with sevoflurane and on demand fentanyl boluses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in the depth of anesthesia could influence cerebral activity, thereby cerebral&#xD;
      metabolism and blood flow. Bispectral index is placed onto every patient in order to assure&#xD;
      constant depth of anaesthesia during the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second series of TCD and SphygmoCor measurements are performed 20 minutes after the&#xD;
      respiratory rate is set to maintain end-tidal CO2 at 40 mmHg in order to allow sufficient&#xD;
      time for equilibrium to be reached and the effect of drugs used for the induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia to be terminated. Subsequently the examinations are repeated twice again at 35 and&#xD;
      30 mmHg ETCO2. The measurements were carried out 5-5 minutes after adjusting the minute&#xD;
      ventilation to reach target ETCO2 values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Comparisons between the preoperative and three intraoperative stages of the study are made&#xD;
      using repeated measures ANOVA with the Bonferroni post hoc correction. The relationship&#xD;
      between MBFV, PI and ETCO2 is assessed using linear regression, while the connection between&#xD;
      SEVR, pulse and Alx75 is calculated with bivariate correlation.&#xD;
