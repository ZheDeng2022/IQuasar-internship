  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an exploratory, open-label, single sequence, two part study (Part A and an&#xD;
      optional Part B). The aim of this study will be to assess whether systemic inhibition of&#xD;
      Lipoprotein associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) in humans, effected by 11 days of once&#xD;
      daily dosing to steady state with 160 milligrams (mg) of enteric coated (EC) darapladib, will&#xD;
      specifically reduce the number of macrophages and/or result in a higher proportion of M2&#xD;
      macrophages in skin blisters induced by cantharidin (a chemical agent that causes blisters).&#xD;
      In Part A of the study, a cohort of 8 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus will be&#xD;
      recruited. In Part B of the study, a cohort of 8 additional healthy subjects with matching&#xD;
      age (+/- 24 months) and gender to Part A may be recruited.&#xD;

             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: non-childbearing potential&#xD;
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or&#xD;
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a&#xD;
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40&#xD;
             milli-international units (MIU)/milliliter (mL) and estradiol &lt; 40 picograms (pg)/mL&#xD;
             (&lt;147 picomoles per liter [pmol/L]) is confirmatory]. [Females on hormone replacement&#xD;
             therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of&#xD;
             the contraception methods listed in the protocol if they wish to continue their HRT&#xD;
             during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of&#xD;
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4&#xD;
             weeks should elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval&#xD;
             depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal&#xD;
             status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive&#xD;
             method]; Child-bearing potential and is abstinent (abstinence from penile-vaginal&#xD;
             intercourse must be consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject)&#xD;

             appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior&#xD;
             to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point.&#xD;
             Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 42 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             study medication.&#xD;

             (with at least 5 minutes between ECG readings) and the average of the 3 QTc values&#xD;
             used to determine eligibility.&#xD;

             laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may&#xD;
             be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the&#xD;

          -  Other issues which in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation in&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
