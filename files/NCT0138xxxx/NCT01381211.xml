  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignant tumor of the liver that accounts for an&#xD;
      important health problem worldwide. In only 10% - 15% of all patients with HCC, tumors are&#xD;
      considered resectable at presentation. In contrast to metastatic liver disease, there is no&#xD;
      role for systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of HCC. Today only evidence is available for&#xD;
      Sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibiting agent. The arsenal of non-surgical therapies can&#xD;
      roughly be divided into local ablative, transarterial and systemic therapies. In well&#xD;
      selected patients, local ablative therapy can offer favorable long term results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with disease confined to the liver, but locally more advanced, transarterial&#xD;
      treatment modalities are proposed. These therapies exploit the dual blood supply to the&#xD;
      liver. HCC derives its blood supply almost entirely from the hepatic artery, while liver&#xD;
      parenchyma derives &gt; 75% of its blood supply from the portal vein. Antitumoral agents, such&#xD;
      as cytotoxic drugs or radionuclides, can be delivered in close proximity of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examples of transarterial therapies are: transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), bland&#xD;
      transarterial embolization (TAE), transarterial chemoembolization with drug eluting beads&#xD;
      (TACE-DEB) and transarterial radioembolization with Iodine-131 or Yttrium-90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TACE is currently the gold standard for treatment of patients with intermediate stage HCC,&#xD;
      with a reported median survival of around 17 months. A novel development in the TACE&#xD;
      treatment for HCC is the drug-eluting bead (DEB). Recently performed small clinical trials&#xD;
      reported the efficacy of DEBs in the treatment of intermediate stage HCC, which is&#xD;
      substantially higher compared to conventional TACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yttrium-90 radioembolization (90Y-RE) is a relatively recently developed technique which&#xD;
      implements transarterial administration of minimally embolic microspheres loaded with&#xD;
      Yttrium-90, a β-emitting isotope, delivering selective internal radiation to the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators want to prospectively compare TACE-DEB and 90Y-RE, two novel&#xD;
      treatments that both have theoretical and/or proven advantages compared to the use of&#xD;
      conventional TACE, in patients with intermediate stage HCC.&#xD;
