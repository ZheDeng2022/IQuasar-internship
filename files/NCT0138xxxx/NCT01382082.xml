  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairments in cancer patients represent an important clinical problem. Studies to&#xD;
      date estimating prevalence of difficulties in memory, executive function, and attention&#xD;
      deficits have been limited by small sample sizes and many have lacked healthy control groups.&#xD;
      More information is needed on promising biomarkers and allelic variants that may help to&#xD;
      determine the etiology of impairment, identify those most vulnerable to impairment, and&#xD;
      develop interventions for these difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a longitudinal observational study of cognitive function in breast cancer and&#xD;
      lymphoma patients receiving chemotherapy to better understand the prevalence of cognitive&#xD;
      difficulties (i.e., problems with memory, executive function, and attention) in these&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
