  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many children with cancer cannot participate regularly in school due to frequent&#xD;
      hospitalizations for treatment or treatment related effects such as pain, nausea, and&#xD;
      fatigue. Prior studies have shown that children with cancer desire to attend school while&#xD;
      receiving therapy despite these challenges, and that they report psychological and&#xD;
      psychosocial difficulties if unable to attend. While school attendance has been found to&#xD;
      correlate with Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), self-efficacy beliefs, and&#xD;
      self-esteem, little is known about how children with cancer experience school attendance&#xD;
      while receiving active cancer therapy. The purpose of this study will be to explore how 6-12&#xD;
      year old children with cancer perceive school attendance pre and post diagnosis during active&#xD;
      therapy as measured at one-time point, 6 months (Â± 2months) into active therapy.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to explore 6-12 year old pediatric oncology patients'&#xD;
      perceptions of their school experiences pre and post cancer diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will utilize qualitative interview methods. Potential participants who meet&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be approached by the principal investigator to obtain consent and&#xD;
      assent in accordance with institutional guidelines. Upon giving consent, the child will&#xD;
      participate in a one-hour audio-taped interview session with the principal investigator. The&#xD;
      interview session will begin with some general rapport building questions to help the child&#xD;
      grow comfortable with the interviewer, the interview room, and the interview format. The rest&#xD;
      of the interview will consist of questions pertaining to the child's school experiences both&#xD;
      before and during diagnosis and treatment for malignancy. The interview will conclude with&#xD;
      the child being asked to draw a picture of themselves at school before diagnosis, and of&#xD;
      themselves at school since being diagnosed. Demographic data will be collected from each&#xD;
      participant's medical chart pertaining to age, gender, ethnicity, diagnosis, and the type of&#xD;
      school attended before and after diagnosis and the principal investigator and study staff&#xD;
      involved in data coding will complete field note entries directly following the conclusion of&#xD;
      each interview or data coding session (see Appendix V). The participant's involvement in the&#xD;
      study will end at the conclusion of the interview session.&#xD;

        Participants will consist of 6-12-year-old patients currently on therapy for a primary&#xD;
        diagnosis of a leukemia/lymphoma or solid tumor at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in&#xD;
        Memphis, Tennessee. Potential participants will be recruited via a medical chart review&#xD;
        performed by the principal investigator in order to identify children who have been on&#xD;
        active therapy for a malignancy for 6 months (plus or minus 2 months) at the time of&#xD;
        enrollment on this protocol&#xD;
