      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      of 2B3-101 both as single agent and in combination with trastuzumab. Furthermore, the study&#xD;
      will explore the preliminary antitumor activity of 2B3-101 as single agent in patients with&#xD;
      with solid tumors and brain metastases or recurrent malignant glioma as well as in patients&#xD;
      with various forms of breast cancer with and in combination with trastuzumab in HER2+ breast&#xD;
      cancer patients with brain metastases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/IIa, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in 6 phases: &quot;2B3-101 single agent dose-escalation phase&quot;, &quot;a 2B3-101 with&#xD;
      trastuzumab dose-escalation phase&quot;, &quot;a Breast cancer brain metastases study-expansion&#xD;
      phase&quot;,&quot;a Recurrent malignant glioma study-expansion phase&quot;, &quot;a Melanoma brain metastases&#xD;
      study- expansion phase&quot; and &quot;SCLC brain metastases study-expansion phase&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      2B3-101 single agent dose-escalation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 2B3-101 single Agent dose-escalation phase, female and male patients with solid tumors&#xD;
      and brain metastases or recurrent malignant glioma will be enrolled. Patients will be&#xD;
      assigned to a dose level cohort. - The starting dose will be 5 mg/m2, which is equal to 1/10&#xD;
      of the human equivalent dose of the LD10 of 2B3-101 in rats. A &quot;3+3&quot; dose-escalation design&#xD;
      will be used. The study will investigate sequential cohorts consisting of 3-6 patients to be&#xD;
      enrolled and treated at the applicable dose level. Planned dose levels for subsequent cohorts&#xD;
      are 10, 20, 30, mg/m2 and steps of 10 mg/m2 thereafter. For more information on the dose&#xD;
      escalation design and the increments, please see the dose escalation criteria section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no intra-patient dose escalation. Each treatment cycle consists of 21 days.&#xD;
      Patients will receive a single IV dose of 2B3-101 on day 1 of each cycle. In order to&#xD;
      minimize the risk of infusion reactions 5% of the total dose of 2B3-101 (in mg) should be&#xD;
      infused slowly over the first 30 minutes. If tolerated, the infusion may then be completed&#xD;
      over the next hour for a total infusion time of 90 minutes. Blood samples will be taken on&#xD;
      day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 11 of cycle 1 and day 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 2 to assess the PK profile&#xD;
      during the first 2 cycles. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period for each dose&#xD;
      level will be cycle 1 (day 1 to day 21). Patients who do not complete the DLT observation&#xD;
      period (cycle 1) for other reasons than a DLT will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD of 2B3-101 as single agent has been determined, the study will continue to the&#xD;
      breast cancer brain metastases and recurrent malignant glioma dose expansion phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2B3-101 in combination with trastuzumab dose-escalation phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 2B3-101 in combination with trastuzumab dose escalation phase, only patients with&#xD;
      HER2+ breast cancer and brain metastases will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be assigned to a 2B3-101 dose level cohort. - The starting dose of 2B3-101&#xD;
      will be 40 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. This dose has been selected based upon safety information&#xD;
      from patients treated with 2B3-101 at this dose level, as well as upon previous treatment&#xD;
      with PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin in combinations trastuzumab (Chia et al 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose-escalation will be conducted in steps of 10 mg/m2 up to the MTD level determined for&#xD;
      2B3-101 as single agent. The trastuzumab dose will remain fixed to a loading dose of 8 mg/kg&#xD;
      at day 1 and 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks at the subsequent cycles throughout the determination of&#xD;
      the MTD. Enrolment of HER2+ patients breast cancer patients in the &quot;2B3-101 in combination&#xD;
      with trastuzumab dose-escalation&quot; phase of the study will be allowed in parallel with the&#xD;
      determination of the MTD of 2B3-101 as single agent. A &quot;3+3&quot; dose-escalation design will be&#xD;
      used. Thus, the study will investigate sequential cohorts of 3-6 patients, who will be&#xD;
      enrolled and treated at the applicable dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No intra-patient dose-escalation will be allowed. Each treatment cycle consists of 21 days.&#xD;
      All patients will receive a single IV dose of 2B3-101 on day 1 of each cycle. In order to&#xD;
      minimize the risk of infusion reactions 5% of the total dose of 2B3-101 (in mg) should be&#xD;
      infused slowly over the first 30 minutes. As long as 2B3-101 is well tolerated, the remaining&#xD;
      95% of the infusion could thereafter be administered over the next 60 min, resulting in a&#xD;
      total infusion time of 90 minutes. The infusion of trastuzumab will then follow 30 minutes&#xD;
      after the completion of the 2B3-101 infusion. Blood samples will be taken on day 1, 2, 3, 5,&#xD;
      8 and 11 of cycle 1, on day 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 2 and if applicable on day 1 of cycle 3 and&#xD;
      day 1 of cycle 4 to assess the PK profile of 2B3-101 during the first 4 cycles. The dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period will be cycle 1 (day 1 to day 21) at each&#xD;
      individual dose level. Patients who do not complete the DLT observation period (cycle 1) for&#xD;
      other reasons than a DLT will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer brain metastases expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the breast cancer brain metastases expansion phase, each treatment cycle consists of 21&#xD;
      days. Patients will receive a single IV dose of 2B3-101 on day 1 of each cycle. In order to&#xD;
      minimize the risk of infusion reactions 5% of the total dose of 2B3-101 (in mg) should be&#xD;
      infused slowly over the first 30 minutes. If tolerated, the infusion may then be completed&#xD;
      over the next hour for a total infusion time of 90 minutes. Blood samples will be taken on&#xD;
      day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 11 of cycle 1 on day 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 2 and if applicable on day 1&#xD;
      of cycle 3 and on day 1 of cycle 4 to assess the PK profile during the first 4 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent malignant glioma expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recurrent malignant glioma expansion phase, each treatment cycle is 28 days long.&#xD;
      Patients will receive a single IV dose of 2B3-101 on day 1 of each cycle. In order to&#xD;
      minimize the risk of infusion reactions 5% of the total dose of 2B3-101 (in mg) should be&#xD;
      infused slowly over the first 30 minutes. If tolerated, the infusion may then be completed&#xD;
      over the next hour for a total infusion time of 90 minutes. Blood samples will be taken on&#xD;
      day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 11 of cycle 1, day 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 2 and if applicable on day 1 of&#xD;
      cycle 3 and on day 1 of cycle 4 to assess the PK profile during the first 4 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCLC brain metastases study arm of the expansion phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SCLC brain metastases study arm of the expansion phase, each treatment cycle is 21&#xD;
      days long. Patients will receive a single IV dose of 2B3-101 at MTD determined for 2B3-101 as&#xD;
      single agent on day 1 of each cycle. In order to minimize the risk of infusion reactions 5%&#xD;
      of the total dose (in mg) should be infused slowly over the first 30 minutes. As long as&#xD;
      2B3-101 is well tolerated, the remaining 95% of the infusion could thereafter be administered&#xD;
      over the next 60 minutes, resulting in a total infusion time of 90 minutes. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be taken on day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 11 of cycle 1, day 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 2 and if&#xD;
      applicable on day 1 of cycle 3 and on day 1 of cycle 4 to assess the PK profile during the&#xD;
      first 4 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melanoma brain metastases study arm of the expansion phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the melanoma brain metastases study arm of the expansion phase, each treatment cycle is 21&#xD;
      days long. Patients will receive a single IV dose of 2B3-101 at MTD determined for 2B3-101 as&#xD;
      single agent in the dose escalation phase on day 1 of each cycle. In order to minimize the&#xD;
      risk of infusion reactions 5% of the total dose (in mg) should be infused slowly over the&#xD;
      first 30 minutes. As long as 2B3-101 is well tolerated, the remaining 95% of the infusion&#xD;
      could thereafter be administered over the next 60 minutes, resulting in a total infusion time&#xD;
      of 90 minutes. Blood samples will be taken on day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 11 of cycle 1, day 1, 8&#xD;
      and 15 of cycle 2 and if applicable on day 1 of cycle 3 and on day 1 of cycle 4 to assess the&#xD;
      PK profile during the first 4 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all stages a patient will stay on treatment until disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, or discontinuation for any other reason.&#xD;
