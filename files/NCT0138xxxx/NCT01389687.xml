  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the immunogenicity and safety of SP059 as a three-dose&#xD;
      primary and booster vaccination in Japanese infants aged 3 through 68 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess that the seroprotection rates against polio types 1, 2 and 3 are over 90%&#xD;
           approximately one month following the three dose primary vaccination series with&#xD;
           inactivated polio vaccine (IPV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immunogenicity (in terms of seroprotection / seroconversion vaccine&#xD;
           response rates and Geometric Mean Titers) of IPV before and after the primary&#xD;
           vaccination and before and after the booster vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety after each dose of IPV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants will receive three doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) (at each visit&#xD;
      and given 3-8 weeks apart) as a three-dose primary vaccination starting at 3-68 months of age&#xD;
      and followed by a single dose of IPV as a booster vaccination 6-18 months after completion of&#xD;
      the three-dose primary vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be observed by the Investigator or sub-Investigator for 30 minutes following&#xD;
      the vaccine injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of each participant's participation in the trial will be approximately 1 year.&#xD;
