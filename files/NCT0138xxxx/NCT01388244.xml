      The Risk-stratified Osteoporosis Strategy Evaluation Study (ROSE) is a randomised&#xD;
      population-based study, including 20,904 Danish women aged 65-81 years, investigating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a two-step screening programme for osteoporosis, using a questionnaire based&#xD;
      on FRAX® followed by DXA-scan of those at highest risk. Further, the study is expected to&#xD;
      provide knowledge about cost-effectiveness, patient preferences and acceptance of screening&#xD;
      programme to prevent fractures&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is highly prevalent especially in postmenopausal women. Approximately 46 % of&#xD;
      all women will suffer at least one osteoporotic fracture after the age of 50. The US&#xD;
      Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) recommend&#xD;
      screening with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in all women aged 65 years and above&#xD;
      regardless of risk factors. Nevertheless, the use of clinical risk factors has been shown to&#xD;
      enhance the risk-gradient and accuracy of fracture risk prediction. The FRAX risk assessment&#xD;
      score was derived from large population-based cohorts and validated in separate validation&#xD;
      cohorts. Its use as a risk assessment tool is endorsed by WHO, but no prospective studies&#xD;
      examining the effect of a screening programme using a combination of FRAX and DXA in a&#xD;
      two-step manner have been performed previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      35,000 women aged 65-80 years were selected at random from the population in the Region of&#xD;
      Southern Denmark and -before inclusion-randomised to either a screening group or a control&#xD;
      group. As first step, a self- administered questionnaire regarding risk factors for&#xD;
      osteoporosis based on FRAX® was issued to both groups. As second step, subjects in the&#xD;
      screening group with a 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fractures ≥15 % were offered&#xD;
      a DXA scan. Patients diagnosed with osteoporosis from the DXA scan were advised to see their&#xD;
      GP and discuss pharmaceutical treatment according to Danish National guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is incident clinical fractures as evaluated through annual follow-up&#xD;
      using the Danish National Patient Registry. The secondary outcomes are cost-effectiveness,&#xD;
      participation rate and patient preferences. The aim of the ROSE study is to investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a two-step population based osteoporosis screening programme using FRAX®&#xD;
      based on self-administered questionnaire to select women for DXA followed by the standard&#xD;
      osteoporosis treatment according to national guidelines and delivered by GPs in the Region of&#xD;
      Southern Denmark. Secondary aims are to clarify whether the screening programme is&#xD;
      cost-effective and to assess the patients' preferences, experience and acceptance of the&#xD;
      screening programme. Moreover, sub-studies allow assessment of the effectiveness of FRAX®&#xD;
      alone or combined with individual clinical risk factors in the prediction of fractures and&#xD;
      the impact of socioeconomic factors for participation and outcome.&#xD;
