  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug SOM 230 in addition to&#xD;
      standard therapy of gemcitabine can shrink or slow the growth of pancreatic cancer. The&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of different doses of SOM 230 will also be studied. The participants'&#xD;
      physical state, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings taken while&#xD;
      on-study will help us (the study doctor and Moffitt Cancer Center) decide if SOM 230 is safe&#xD;
      and effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, phase I study of combination therapy with SOM 230 LAR and&#xD;
      standard treatment with gemcitabine. We will utilize a staggered, sequential dose-escalation&#xD;
      design to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SOM 230 LAR when combined with standard&#xD;
      doses of gemcitabine. Cycle will be defined as 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Gemcitabine is administered by IV&#xD;
      infusion. The dose should be based on the patient's actual baseline body weight; the dose&#xD;
      will be recalculated if there is a weight change of &gt; 10% from baseline. The dose of&#xD;
      gemcitabine will be given over 30 minutes, weekly every 3 weeks followed by 1 week rest&#xD;
      period. SOM 230 LAR will be administered as an intramuscular dose determined by the dosing&#xD;
      schema, every month.&#xD;
