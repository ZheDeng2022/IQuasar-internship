  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to estimate the actual or potential benefit of deep inspiration&#xD;
      breath holding (DIBH) treatment in the context of proton radiotherapy as compared to 3&#xD;
      dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) and intensity-modulated x-ray therapy (IMXT),&#xD;
      as it relates to variability in tumor localization, treatment margins, target volume&#xD;
      definition, doses to organs at risk and variations with treatment planning.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Image acquisition and treatment under deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to reduce treated volumes and doses to organs at risk (OARs) for photon&#xD;
      radiotherapy but has not been investigated in the context of proton radiotherapy. The&#xD;
      objective of this registry study is to prospectively evaluate deep inspiration breath hold CT&#xD;
      scans for use in proton radiotherapy treatment planning and obtain dosimetric data to assess&#xD;
      for changes in target volume, planning volumes and doses both to tumor and organs at risk&#xD;
      using the SpiroDynrX (SDX) deep inspiration breath hold system as compared to free breathing&#xD;
      and 4D CT scans. Patients will be treated with photon therapy. This is a prospective&#xD;
      non-randomized, single arm, single institution registry study of patients undergoing&#xD;
      definitive external beam photon radiotherapy in our department. Deep inspiration breath hold&#xD;
      CT scans will be obtained in our department in the treatment position at the time of CT&#xD;
      simulationin addition to the currently obtained free breathing and 4D CT scans. These scans&#xD;
      will all be co-registered with the treatment planning CT. Treatment planning volumes will be&#xD;
      delineated by the physician and compared to the results and data for our current standard of&#xD;
      care utilizing 4D CT scans. Patients will be treated with breath hold CT using photon&#xD;
      radiotherapy but we will prospectively create proton treatment plans which will also be&#xD;
      compared to the photon treatment plans used for actual treatment. Variability in tumor&#xD;
      localization, target volume definition, doses to organs at risk and treatment planning&#xD;
      particularities will be summarized and reported across several modalities, including: 3&#xD;
      dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT), intensity-modulated x-ray therapy (IMXT) and&#xD;
      proton therapy. Correlations will be statistically analyzed and reported in terms of minimum,&#xD;
      maximum, average and standard deviation, and other dose volume histogram parameters, and&#xD;
      where appropriate, compared with appropriate statistical methods (for example, student&#xD;
      t-test).&#xD;
