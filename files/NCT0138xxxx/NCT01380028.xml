  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The chronic subdural hematoma is a common disease in the population over 60 years. For&#xD;
      example, in patients over 70 years, it occurs every year 7 new cases per 100,000 people. A&#xD;
      chronic subdural hematoma is an accumulation of blood in the intracranial space between brain&#xD;
      membrane (dura mater) and the brain. The origin of blood in this area follows a minor brain&#xD;
      injury, which causes the rupture of small vessels in the area. During its evolution, the&#xD;
      volume of the hematoma increases. After a few weeks, the amount of fluid build-up can&#xD;
      compress the brain. That's when clinical symptoms occur: persistent headaches, neurological&#xD;
      deficits, seizures, impaired consciousness, cognitive functions (memory loss, impaired&#xD;
      intellectual function, or hallucinations, etc.). The compression of the brain may cause&#xD;
      impairment of consciousness resulting in more severe cases coma and death. At this stage, a&#xD;
      neurosurgical intervention is necessary. Recurrences are numerous (15 to 25% recurrence over&#xD;
      six months after neurosurgery). That is why in France, about 20% of medical teams administer&#xD;
      a postoperative treatment with corticosteroids to reduce the risk of recurrence. Until now,&#xD;
      the potential benefit of this treatment has not yet been confirmed by a clinical study. So&#xD;
      the purpose of this research.&#xD;

      The chronic subdural hematoma (HSDC) is a common disease in the population over 60 years. The&#xD;
      incidence is 7 / 100000 in patients over 70 years. This condition occurs readily after a&#xD;
      minor head injury. Bleeding secondary to cerebral concussion and vascular fragility from a&#xD;
      cortico-dural vein. It is favored in most cases by taking anti-platelet or other blood&#xD;
      thinners. The hematoma formed and causes a local inflammatory reaction. This reaction tends&#xD;
      to partition the collection by the formation of a membrane whose pathological vessels&#xD;
      weakened by inflammation, causing bleeding iterative low abundance. A vicious circle is&#xD;
      established by a combination of these phenomena and causes a progressive worsening clinical&#xD;
      and radiological.Because of the importance of recurrence (15 to 25% at 6 months) and the high&#xD;
      rate of mortality at one year (10 to 15%), but also supposed pathophysiological mechanisms&#xD;
      (inflammation, formation of membrane self-sustaining blood collection ), a postoperative&#xD;
      treatment with corticosteroids was introduced in secondary prevention by some teams (about&#xD;
      20% in France). However, this practice has never been a prospective study on clinical and&#xD;
      radiological interest.The aim of this prospective multicenter randomized, double blind, is to&#xD;
      evaluate in patients with chronic subdural hematoma, compared with placebo, the efficacy of&#xD;
      postoperative corticosteroid treatment orally for approximately 2 months on the rate of&#xD;
      clinical recurrence and / or radiological subdural hematoma 6 months after surgery (primary&#xD;
      endpoint).The secondary endpoints are the rate of mortality at one year, and the 6 month&#xD;
      follow-up of clinical and radiological evolution, neurological status (Markwalder scale),&#xD;
      quality of life (health scale perceptual Nottingham), autonomy (Karnofsky scale), the state&#xD;
      of consciousness (Glasgow scale), and size of the hematoma on CT scan without injection.340&#xD;
      adult patients of the 2 sexes who received surgical treatment for a chronic subdural hematoma&#xD;
      unilateral or bilateral primary diagnosis (hematoma hypodense or isodense with a blade of at&#xD;
      least 3 mm thick axial CT scan on brain) will be included in the study on 5 centers (services&#xD;
      of Neurosurgery Hospital of Montpellier, Marseille, Nice, Perpignan and Lyon).Patients&#xD;
      enrolled will be assigned to one of two treatment groups (active treatment or placebo) by&#xD;
      lot. Active treatment is prednisone establishment within 72 hours after the end of surgery at&#xD;
      the dose of 1 mg / kg (rounded to the nearest 10 mg) once daily orally for one week . The&#xD;
      daily dose then decreases in increments of 10 mg weekly, by the second week. Once the level&#xD;
      of 10 mg / day reached the daily dose by one level lower than 5 mg weekly. Treatment is&#xD;
      stopped after this week to 5 mg / day .. The placebo was similar in all respects to active&#xD;
      treatment and is administered in the same way that the active treatment. Additional treatment&#xD;
      will be administered to all patients throughout the duration of the experimental treatment.&#xD;
      It is a vitamin and calcium supplementation in preventing the risk of osteoporosis.Medical&#xD;
      monitoring of patients will be over a period of six months with visits scheduled in the&#xD;
      various departments of Neurosurgery at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after surgery. Each&#xD;
      visit is a consultation with a neurosurgical team physician including a review of clinical&#xD;
      research with the recurrence of subdural hematoma and the collection of adverse events. This&#xD;
      physician, independent of the investigative team, will also collect scores Markwalder,&#xD;
      Nottingham, Karnofsky and Glasgow. Analysis of the CT scan will be centralized. A blood&#xD;
      sample will be performed at the visit at 1 month, to establish a biological monitoring in&#xD;
      relation to the potential electrolyte disturbances related to steroids.The mortality survey&#xD;
      will take place 1 year after surgery by telephone interview between an investigator and the&#xD;
      patient or his entourage.The overall duration of the study is about 6 years including 4 years&#xD;
      of clinical phase.Given the extensive use of corticosteroids in the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      subdural hematomas and absence of solid data on the subject, our research should clarify the&#xD;
      role of corticosteroids in secondary prevention and improve the overall management of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
