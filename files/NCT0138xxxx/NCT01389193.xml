  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, two period cross over study of&#xD;
      ibudilast in the treatment of chronic migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants resident in Adelaide, South Australia (i.e. &quot;local participants&quot;):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve a screening visit followed by eight visits to the Pain and Anaesthesia&#xD;
      Research Clinic (PARC), within the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH), for baseline testing,&#xD;
      initiation of the study medications and ongoing data collection (one baseline and three study&#xD;
      visits during each treatment period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit, blood samples to assess biomarkers (glutamate, calcitonin gene-related&#xD;
      peptide, glial fibrillary acidic protein and S100β) will be taken. Patients will then be&#xD;
      randomised (in a 1:1 ratio) to commence either ibudilast or placebo treatment, which will&#xD;
      continue for 8 weeks. Subsequently participants will undergo a 4-week washout period. At the&#xD;
      end of the washout period a second 8-week treatment block with the alternative treatment will&#xD;
      commence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will complete a headache diary daily for at least 4 weeks prior to the baseline&#xD;
      visit, throughout the treatment and washout periods and for 4 weeks after treatment ceases.&#xD;
      The diary will record headache frequency, duration, intensity, pain characteristics and&#xD;
      medication intake for comparison with baseline data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From screening until the final study visit (over a minimum of 6 months) a total of&#xD;
      approximately 200 mL in blood samples will be taken from each local participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants located in country or interstate locations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same study will be undertaken, but instead of attending the Pain and Anaesthesia Research&#xD;
      Clinic (PARC), within the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) for screening and study visits, these&#xD;
      will be managed remotely through:&#xD;
&#xD;
      basic input from the participant's GP during the screening period correspondence with the PI&#xD;
      and study staff via registered post, phone or Skype scheduled visits to the nearest pathology&#xD;
      collection centre for blood biochemistry and haematology analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interstate or country participants will also be exempt from collection of blood samples for&#xD;
      biomarker analysis, hence a total of approximately 120 mL of blood samples will be taken from&#xD;
      each interstate or country participant.&#xD;

    <description>As suggested by the IHS guidelines for clinical trials in chronic migraine, the primary efficacy endpoint will be number of headache days per month with moderate or severe intensity. Study outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at weeks 2, 4 and 8 of each treatment period.&#xD;
To monitor treatment with ibudilast, blood biochemistry (including assessment of renal and hepatic including GGT function) and haematology will be assessed at baseline, and at weeks 2, 4 and 8 of each treatment period. Patients will also be screened for adverse effects via questionnaire at each visit during treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary efficacy end points</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary end points assessed will include:&#xD;
Migraine frequency (number of days with migraine of any severity/month)&#xD;
Migraine episode frequency (number of migraine episodes/month)&#xD;
Medication frequency (number of days acute headache medication taken/month)&#xD;
Headache related impact on quality of life as assessed using the HIT-6&#xD;
Cutaneous allodynia as assessed using the ASC-12&#xD;
Biomarker levels</description>
