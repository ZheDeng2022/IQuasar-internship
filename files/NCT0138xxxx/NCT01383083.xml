  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of PAH associated with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts in Western&#xD;
      countries has been estimated to range between 1.6 and 12.5 cases per million adults, with&#xD;
      25-50% of this population affected by Eisenmenger's syndrome. The rarity of this syndrome,&#xD;
      combined with its complex pathophysiology, account for the insufficient understanding of the&#xD;
      principles underlying its proper treatment.Recent decades have seen developments in pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension pathophysiology which have led to the introduction of new groups of drugs:&#xD;
      prostacycline analogs (Epoprostenol, Treprostinil, Beraprost, Illoprost), phosphodiesterase&#xD;
      inhibitors (Sildenafil, Tadalafil), endothelin receptor antagonists (Bosentan, Sitaxantan,&#xD;
      Ambrisentan) and nitric oxide. These drugs should be administered to patients in III-IV NYHA&#xD;
      class. Despite successful early results, the therapeutic effect on patients with Eisenmenger&#xD;
      syndrome has not been conclusively established The treatment strategy for patients with PAH&#xD;
      associated with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and, in particular, those with&#xD;
      Eisenmenger's syndrome is based mainly on clinical experience rather than being evidence&#xD;
      based. Although Eisenmenger's syndrome is uncurable disease, the survival rate is relatively&#xD;
      higher than primary PAH, and the patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome are relatively younger&#xD;
      group. So the improvement of exercise tolerance and quality of life is very important.&#xD;
      Several randomized controlled trial reported favourable short- and long-term outcomes of&#xD;
      treatment with the orally active dual endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan in patients&#xD;
      with Eisenmenger's syndrome. However, there was scare data of outcomes of treatment with the&#xD;
      inhaled iloprost in patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome. In Korea, most of patients with&#xD;
      Eisenmenger's syndrome are treated with conservative therapy instead of administration of&#xD;
      PAH-specific drug, because of lack of clinical experience. Moreover, oral agent such as&#xD;
      bosentan, sidenafil is preferred than iloprost becase of more evidence and convenience. Our&#xD;
      therapeutic efforts should be directed mainly towards preventing complications. As a rule, we&#xD;
      should avoid agents with no established therapeutic efficacy and try to alleviate symptoms&#xD;
      without any additional risk, so as not to disrupt the existing clinical balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we investigate to know the clinical benefit of iloprost on patients with&#xD;
      Eisenmenger's syndrome by the use of functional and hemodynamic parameters, which would add&#xD;
      the evidence of PAH-specific agents on the Eisenmenger's syndrome&#xD;

      A large proportion of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), in particular those with&#xD;
      relevant systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, will develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) if&#xD;
      left untreated. Persistent exposure of the pulmonary vasculature to increased blood flow, as&#xD;
      well as increased pressure, may result in pulmonary obstructive arteriopathy, which leads to&#xD;
      increased pulmonary vascular resistance that, if it approaches or exceeds systemic&#xD;
      resistance, will result in shunt reversal. Eisenmenger's syndrome, the most advanced form of&#xD;
      PAH associated with CHD, is defined as CHD with an initial large systemic-to-pulmonary shunt&#xD;
      that induces severe pulmonary vascular disease and PAH, with resultant reversal of the shunt&#xD;
      and central cyanosis. The histopathological and pathobiological changes seen in patients with&#xD;
      PAH associated with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, such as endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
      of the pulmonary vasculature, are considered similar to those observed in idiopathic or other&#xD;
      associated forms of PAH.&#xD;

    <description>In the adult patient group, iloprost acceptable target dose is 2.5 ug 4-6 times/day according to the patient's compliance. Because of the concern of safety and tolerability, during the first 4 weeks of treatment, patients receive 2.5 ug twice daily. After 4 weeks, this is increased to the target dose, if iloprost is well tolerated.</description>
