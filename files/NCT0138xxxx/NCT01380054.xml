      The investigators aim to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  describe and analyse psychological characteristics, cognitive factors and&#xD;
           representations in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension, a rare disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess the psychological characteristics impact on quality of life, check the&#xD;
           association between disease and QoL evolution, and the variability of QoL parameters&#xD;
           over severity class changes and follow-up&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PAH is a rare, and severe disease, potentially mortal, affecting preferentially young&#xD;
      subjects. The knowledge and the international literature, as regards the quality of life, the&#xD;
      expectations, the needs and the psychosocial characteristics of patients with PAH, are&#xD;
      non-existent. But it is known that the persons affected by rare diseases are more vulnerable,&#xD;
      on the psychological, social, economic and cultural planIn all the stages of the treatment,&#xD;
      patients with PAH are confronted with heavy psychosocial situations, in a context of vital&#xD;
      risk, with exceptional medicinal treatments (intravenous administration at home).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QoL might be differently affected by these changes according to situational and&#xD;
           dispositional psychological dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the predictive role of these characteristics on the current and later quality of life,&#xD;
           as well as the impact of diverse cognitive mediators and strategies to cope with the&#xD;
           disease, should be investigated.The respiratory diseases department of the Montpellier&#xD;
           hospital is regional competence center for PAH in Languedoc-Roussillon, under the aegis&#xD;
           of the national reference center (the respiratory diseases department of Antoine Béclère&#xD;
           hospital, Le Petit-Clamart).&#xD;
