      In this mechanistic pilot study in 40 patients the investigators will compare the findings in&#xD;
      patients treated with very early high dose statin therapy with historic controls from the&#xD;
      KOMPIS study published in EHJ 200925. The investigators want to assess if early high dose&#xD;
      statin therapy in patients treated with primary PCI:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. reduces area of myocardial infarction, reduces volumes and improves remodelling as&#xD;
           assessed by MRI at 2 days and at 2 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. improves microcirculation (Decreased number of patients with MO) as assessed by first&#xD;
           pass time estimated with MRI 2 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. have impact on coronary blood flow as assessed by intravascular registrations and TIMI&#xD;
           frame count immediately after PCI&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. reduce levels of CK-MB and TnT measured as area under the curve during the hospital stay&#xD;
           at improves neurohumoral profile assessed by Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and&#xD;
           neurohormones at discharge and at 2 months follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. improves endothelial function assessed by flow mediated vasodilatation at discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. alters Peak VO2 at 1 and 6 month&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. reduce levels of CRP and pro-inflammatory cytokines during index hospitalization and at&#xD;
           follow-up alters collagen turnover&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Impairment of the myocardial microcirculation in the setting of AMI is multifactorial in&#xD;
      etiology. This may be due to vasoactive factors including endothelin-1, which is a potent&#xD;
      vasoconstricting peptide and increasingly expressed in the active plaque . Oxidative stress&#xD;
      and ischaemia per se may also reduce the bioavailability of nitric oxide, further&#xD;
      contributing to the dysfunction of the myocardial microcirculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins have been shown to benefit ACS patients in that they are believed to decrease&#xD;
      reperfusion injury after an ischemic event, promote plaque stabilization, and reduce&#xD;
      inflammation in ACS patients. In patients admitted with acute coronary syndrome (ACS),&#xD;
      treatment with statins &lt;24 hours of presentation was associated with lower incidences of&#xD;
      death, stroke, reinfarction, heart failure, and pulmonary edema compared with delayed&#xD;
      administration .&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 statin naive patients admitted with STEMI will receive high dose statin Rosuvastatin 40 mg&#xD;
      pre/per primary PCI and continue this treatment during the hospital stay. The high dose of&#xD;
      rosuvastatin is chosen to achieve high plasma concentration as early as possible for per&#xD;
      conditioning of the myocardium at risk. At discharge they will be switched to standard dose&#xD;
      statin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial infarction will be assessed with Contrast enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance at 2&#xD;
      days and at 2 months. Microvascular obstruction (MO) may be assessed by first- pass perfusion&#xD;
      (FPP) and delayed hyper enhancement (DHE) MO is defined as regional hypoperfusion on&#xD;
      first-pass perfusion as previously described . The investigators have recently demonstrated&#xD;
      that MO as verified by CMR following MI may allow early identification of patients with a&#xD;
      high risk of LV remodeling likely to benefit from pharmacological therapy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests for assessment of collagen turnover, neurohumoral activation and inflammation&#xD;
      will be drawn daily during hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Results will be compared with the findings of statin naive patients from tha KOMPIS trial&#xD;
      who were not treated with high dose pre and per operative statins&#xD;
