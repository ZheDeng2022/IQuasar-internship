  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis is an under diagnosed global health problem which affects up to 25% of the&#xD;
      population worldwide. It has been reported as being one of the 10 most common causes for&#xD;
      attendance to primary care clinics. It is clinically defined as a symptomatic disorder of the&#xD;
      nose induced by an IgE mediated inflammation following allergen exposure of the membranes&#xD;
      lining the nose and is characterized by varying combinations of nasal symptoms including&#xD;
      sneezing, nasal blockage, rhinorrhoea and itching. Intra nasal corticosteroids form the&#xD;
      cornerstone of anti-inflammatory therapy in allergic rhinitis and there is increasing&#xD;
      interest in the role of intranasal beta 2 agonists in the management of allergic rhinitis.&#xD;
      The question therefore arises as to whether salmeterol exhibits such synergistic activity in&#xD;
      the nose in terms of potentiating the steroid response of fluticasone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In vitro and ex vitro data have suggested that salmeterol may exhibit ligand independent&#xD;
      activation of glucocorticoid receptors, which might result in potentiation of fluticasone by&#xD;
      salmeterol when given in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although no such evidence of synergy was reported with fluticasone salmeterol combination in&#xD;
      the nose with allergen challenge, no data are available on nasal AMP challenge in the nose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study compares the single and long term dosing effects of intranasal fluticasone alone,&#xD;
      salmeterol alone and fluticasone salmeterol combination on nasal AMP challenge in persistent&#xD;
      allergic rhinitis sufferers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal corticosteroid,leukotriene receptor antagonist and anti histamine stopped for one week&#xD;
      before the start of randomized treatment during the run in phase and wash out periods.&#xD;
      Intransal sodium cromoglycate spray provided for rescue use throughout the study but witheld&#xD;
      for at least twenty four hours before challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal AMP challenges performed at baseline, after run-in and each washout, and 12 hours after&#xD;
      the first and last evening dose of the study medication. A Zerostat Antistatic spacer (Cipla,&#xD;
      Mumbai, India) used to administer the randomized treatments, adapted with a nasal olive for&#xD;
      intranasal use instead of the conventional mouthpiece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized treatments given once daily at night time as follows: placebo&#xD;
      hydrofluoroalkane, 2 puffs (Cipla, Mumbai,India) salmeterol-hydrofluoroalkane, 2 puffs of 25&#xD;
      g (Serevent Evohaler Allen and Hanburys, Middlesex, United Kingdom) fluticasone- salmeterol&#xD;
      hydrofluoroalkane, 2 puffs of 250/25 g (Seretide Evohaler, Allen and Hanburys) and&#xD;
      fluticasone-hydrofluoroalkane,2 puffs of 250 g (Flixotide Evohaler, Allen and Hanburys).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The double-blind randomization process computer generated from www.randomization.com. Trial&#xD;
      drug randomization performed under the direct supervision of the clinical trial pharmacist at&#xD;
      Ninewells University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active fluticasone,salmeterol, and fluticasone-salmeterol combination procured from&#xD;
      GlaxoSmithKline (Allen and Hanburys) by the clinical trial pharmacy and matched placebo&#xD;
      provided by Cipla.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following Informed Consent and screening visit, participants provided with randomized,&#xD;
      labeled treatment packs with a single inhaler, either active or placebo at each study&#xD;
      treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding of patients and investigators ensured by using identical colored actuators for each&#xD;
      treatment and labeling of active or placebo canisters with trial-specific labels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements made at 12 hours after the first and last dose of each randomized treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At initial screening, nasal endoscopy performed to exclude significant nasal polyp disease&#xD;
      (greater than grade 1), concha bullosa, and septal deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Niox Flex nitric oxide analyzer (Aerocrine AB, Solna, Sweden) used to measure nasal nitric&#xD;
      oxide. The standard aspiration technique recommended by the American Thoracic&#xD;
      Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines used with a unilateral,nasal olive,&#xD;
      breath-holding, and velum closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For nasal AMP challenge, PNIF measured before and every 5 minutes for 60 minutes after 4&#xD;
      squirts of 0.1 mL per actuation in each nostril of 400 mg/mL of AMP (ie, 320-mg total dose)&#xD;
      delivered to the nose. The maximum decrease in PNIF measured using an In-check Nasal&#xD;
      Inspiratory Flow Meter (Clement Clarke International Ltd, Harlow, United Kingdom).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that measuring PNIF (PEAK NASAL INSPIRATORY FLOW) response is more&#xD;
      sensitive than measuring nasal airway resistance and is also more reproducible.PNIF&#xD;
      correlates well vs symptoms in response to treatment in allergic rhinitis patients and has&#xD;
      been shown to have a minimal clinically important difference of 5 L/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening, patients instructed in the correct technique with particular attention to&#xD;
      horizontal positioning of the meter, a closed mouth with maximal peak nasal inspiratory&#xD;
      effort, and an adequate mask seal around the mouth and nose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal impulse oscillometry measurements for nasal airway resistance at 5 Hz performed using a&#xD;
      Jaeger MasterScreen impulse oscillometry system (Erich Jaeger, Hoechberg, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total nasal symptom 4 (TNS4) scores recorded at all visits, with a total score of 12 for&#xD;
      the sum of the 4 separate domains for nasal blockage, run, itch, and sneeze, each rated from&#xD;
      0 to 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Juniper Mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (Mini-RQLQ) completed by&#xD;
      the participant immediately before and a week after each randomized treatment. The global&#xD;
      RQLQ is the mean of the 5 individual domains, with individual domains scored from 0 to 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum eosinophilic cationic protein measured using an enzyme-linked immunoassay technique&#xD;
      (UniCAP; Sweden Diagnostics UK Ltd, Milton Keyes, United Kingdom).&#xD;
