      The Project aims at pooling (retrospectively) a large population of patients with suspected&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent Computed Tomography Coronary Angiography (CTCA)&#xD;
      and who were adequately stratified in the first place. Then the investigators will be able to&#xD;
      assess the incremental value of CTCA in the stratification of prevalence of disease (non&#xD;
      obstructive/obstructive) and prognosis of patients with suspected CAD. The added information&#xD;
      to current evidence is how reliable and to what extent CTCA can define the actual burden of&#xD;
      disease and cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MACE/Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (i.e. Cardiac Death, Unstable Angina requiring&#xD;
           Hospitalization, Acute Myocardial Infarction)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevalence of cardiovascular risk category shifting based on coronary plaque burden&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coronary Revascularizations occurred after CTCA (i.e. PCI/Percutaneous Coronary&#xD;
           Revascularization and CABG/Coronary Artery Bypass Graft)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevalence of outliers (i.e. patients lying completely outside the conventional risk&#xD;
           stratification; pts with &gt;3 risk factors and no CAD at CTCA and pts with no risk factors&#xD;
           and &gt;5 coronary segments with CAD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institutional Database will be used as data supply. Data will be anonimyzed and pooled (i&#xD;
      twill not be possible to detect patients' identity). For this reason the investigators will&#xD;
      no task for patients' Informed Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN The investigators will retrospectively collect data from respective Institutional&#xD;
      databases regarding patients who underwent CTCA for suspected CAD in the last 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Inclusion criteria Only patients with also Calcium Score&#xD;
&#xD;
      ≥64-slice CT technology (or 16-slice CT technology with &gt;4 year follow-up) Number of patients&#xD;
      of at least 100 with complete clinical file and follow-up Minimum follow-up of 12 months Only&#xD;
      patients with suspected Coronary Artery Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Study design and patient population This is an observational retrospective study&#xD;
      (consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria) in patients with suspected coronary&#xD;
      artery disease referred to our Institutions for evaluation by Computed Tomography Coronary&#xD;
      Angiography (CTCA) starting in January 2003. Participating centers will provide data from&#xD;
      16-slice CTCA (minimum follow-up &gt;4 years) or superior (i.e. 64-slice CTCA; minimum follow-up&#xD;
      12 months). Each center will have to provide at least 200 patients (with complete file for&#xD;
      evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are usually referred because of symptoms (chest pain, dyspnoea on exertion) and/or&#xD;
      abnormal or equivocal stress test and/or high cardiovascular risk profile. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      are renal failure (creatinine clearance &lt;60ml/min), known previous reaction to iodinated&#xD;
      contrast medium and pregnancy, history of Myocardial Infarction, previous revascularization&#xD;
      (PCI and/or CABG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be assessed by interview and by data collection from clinical database&#xD;
      of the Institution for presence of cardiovascular risk factors and symptoms. The following&#xD;
      risk factors will be considered: 1) Hypertension (defined as Arterial Pressure 140/80 mmHg or&#xD;
      need for antihypertensive therapy); 2) Hypercholesterolemia (LDL Cholesterol &gt;130 mg/dl or&#xD;
      current treatment with lipid-lowering therapy); 3) Diabetes Mellitus (current need for&#xD;
      antidiabetic or insulin therapy); 4) Smoking habit; 5) Obesity (Body Mass Index/BMI&gt; 30); 6)&#xD;
      Family history of cardiac disease. Symptoms will be classified as no symptoms, typical chest&#xD;
      pain, atypical chest pain, dyspnoea on exertion. The pre-test cardiovascular risk of the&#xD;
      patients will be determined by means of the Morise risk score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Follow-up data of all the patients were obtained by outpatient visit and/or phone&#xD;
      contact and/or data collection from clinical database of the Institution. Minimum follow-up&#xD;
      will be 6 months. Hospital/patients' records were screened for the occurrence of clinical&#xD;
      events to confirm the obtained information. The clinical end-points are: 1) cardiac death, 2)&#xD;
      non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, 3) unstable angina requiring hospitalization, 4)&#xD;
      percutaneous or surgical revascularization. Cardiac death is defined as death caused by acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmias. Non-fatal myocardial infarction is defined&#xD;
      based on criteria of typical chest pain, elevated cardiac enzyme levels, and typical changes&#xD;
      on the electrocardiogram. Revascularization is defined as percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      (PCI) with stenting or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). The end point was the&#xD;
      occurrence of one MACE at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multislice computed tomography data acquisition All examinations were performed with a&#xD;
      16-slice or higher CT system (Multi-vendor). First, a prospectively triggered coronary&#xD;
      calcium CT data set was obtained using standardized CT parameters. Thereafter CTCA was&#xD;
      performed after the administration of a bolus (60-100ml) non ionic contrast material&#xD;
      (Multi-vendor) at flow rate of 4-6ml/s depending on patient status. All injections were&#xD;
      performed by power injector via an antecubital vein and were followed by 50 ml of saline&#xD;
      bolus chase at the same flow rate. A bolus tracking technique was used to determine the&#xD;
      initiation of CT data acquisition. CTCA was performed with the best available parameters,&#xD;
      depending on scanner type and generation. The reconstruction slice thickness and increment&#xD;
      were 0.5-0.75mm and 0.3-0.5mm respectively. Intra-venous beta-blocker (e.g. atenolol 5-10mg)&#xD;
      was administered to all patients with a heart rate &gt;65 beats/min and without contraindication&#xD;
      (known asthma or bronchospasm, systolic blood pressure &lt;100mmHg). In addition,&#xD;
      nitro-glycerine was administered sublingually to all patients, albeit contraindications&#xD;
      (known significant aortic stenosis, systolic blood pressure &lt;100mmHg). Patients with atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation or frequent premature beats were included in the study. To obtain optimal image&#xD;
      quality, datasets were reconstructed at least at two points of the cardiac cycle using a&#xD;
      retrospective ECG gating algorithm (one diastolic cardiac phase usually at -350msec from the&#xD;
      R waves and one end-systolic phase at +275msec). In the presence of motion artefacts, as in&#xD;
      the case of cardiac arrhythmias, additional reconstructions were made at different time&#xD;
      points of the R-R interval. At the time of the study, tube current modulation was not used.&#xD;
      The estimated radiation dose would be 5-20mSv. Axial data sets are transferred to a remote&#xD;
      workstation (Multi-vendor) for post-processing and subsequent evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTCA data analysis - Coronary Artery Calcium Score The coronary artery calcium (CACS) score&#xD;
      was assessed with the application of dedicated software (Multi-vendor). Coronary artery&#xD;
      calcium was identified as a dense area in the coronary artery whose attenuation exceeded the&#xD;
      threshold of 130 Hounsfield units (HU). The overall calcium score was calculated according to&#xD;
      Agatston score algorithm for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTCA data analysis - Coronary Artery Atherosclerotic plaque assessment All CTCA angiograms&#xD;
      are evaluated locally by 2 experienced board certified observers. In case of disagreement, a&#xD;
      joint reading was performed and a consensus was reached. Coronary arteries were divided into&#xD;
      15-16 segments according to the modified American Heart Association classification and in the&#xD;
      case the intermediate branch was present it was added to the classification. All coronary&#xD;
      segments were considered in the analysis. First, each segment was classified as assessable or&#xD;
      not assessable. All assessable segments were then evaluated for the presence of any&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque. Axial images and curved multiplanar reconstructions of the segmental&#xD;
      vasculature were utilized for the assessment. Coronary plaques were defined as described&#xD;
      previously as structures of &gt;1mm^2 within and/or adjacent to the coronary artery lumen which&#xD;
      are clearly distinguishable from the vessel lumen and surrounding pericardial tissue.&#xD;
      Obstructive coronary plaques were defined as plaques resulting in ≥50% luminal narrowing; non&#xD;
      obstructive plaques were defined as plaques that resulted in &lt;50% luminal narrowing. Patients&#xD;
      were classified as belonging to one of three groups based on the CTCA findings: 1) patients&#xD;
      with normal coronary arteries, 2) patients with non obstructive coronary artery disease, and&#xD;
      3) patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (presence of at least one plaque ≥50%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Categorical baseline characteristics, expressed as numbers and&#xD;
      percentages, will be compared using the chi-square test. Continuous variables, expressed as&#xD;
      mean and standard deviation (SD), will be compared using the 2-tailed t test and analysis of&#xD;
      variance if normally distributed or by means of the Kruskal-Wallis method if not normally&#xD;
      distributed. A composite end-point of MACE will be used (cardiac death, non-fatal infarction,&#xD;
      unstable angina). Cumulative event rates as a function of time were obtained by means of the&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier method. Event curves of MACE will be compared using the log-rank test. Cox&#xD;
      regression analysis will be used to identify associations between clinical characteristics&#xD;
      and CTCA variables and outcome. Univariate and multivariate analyses will be performed to&#xD;
      identify potential predictors. In the multivariate analysis will be included only variables&#xD;
      which were significant at univariate analysis. Hazard ratios will be calculated with 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals as an estimate of the risk associated with a particular variable.&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed using Excel 2007 software (Microsoft, United States),&#xD;
      MedCalc software (version 8.0, United States), STATA software (version 10, United States),&#xD;
      SPSS software (version 12.0, United States). p values &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incremental value of CTCA above CACS will be analyzed. Sub-analysis for the pre-test&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk stratification according to the Morise score (low-risk, intermediate&#xD;
      risk, high risk) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Based on our experience and data from literature the investigators estimated a&#xD;
      sample size of 1000 patients. Considering the retrospective nature of the study, it is&#xD;
      possible that at the end the investigators will reach a population &gt;1000 patients which will&#xD;
      anyway let the study continue to the expected 2 years duration.&#xD;
