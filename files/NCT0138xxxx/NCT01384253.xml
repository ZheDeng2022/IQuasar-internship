  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monoclonal antibodies can transport and deliver radioactive elements capable of releasing&#xD;
      sufficient amounts of energy to destroy tumor cells. In this clinical trial, we will study&#xD;
      alpha particle radio immunotherapy using lead-212 (²¹²Pb), an isotope with a short path&#xD;
      length targeted to malignant cells by the trastuzumab antibody, as a potential treatment for&#xD;
      metastatic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase I trial is designed to determine the toxicity profile of ²¹²Pb-TCMC-Trastuzumab,&#xD;
      its dose-limiting toxicities, and its anti-tumor effects in patients with HER-2 positive&#xD;
      intraperitoneal cancers.&#xD;

    <description>In preparation for the study, patients screened and eligible will have a peritoneal catheter placed and the evening prior to the injection of the labeled antibody will receive furosemide. Herceptin will be administered IV followed by a single IP infusion of ²¹²Pb-TCMC-Trastuzumab. Serial sampling of blood, urine, and dosimetry will be performed following treatment to determine the toxicity, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and antitumor effects.</description>

    <description>The starting dose level will be 200 μCi/m² of ²¹²Pb-TCMC-Trastuzumab. Three to six patients will be treated at each dose level, and dose escalation will proceed if no more than 1 out of 6 patients in a cohort experiences dose limiting toxicity.
