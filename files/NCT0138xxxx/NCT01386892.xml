  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to obtain normal samples of blood, saliva and urine to serve as controls for&#xD;
      other approved protocols and for analysis. These include determination of the functional&#xD;
      capabilities of cells, proteins, nucleic acids and microvesicles obtained from peripheral&#xD;
      blood including plasma, serum and cellular fraction from normal individuals. Saliva and urine&#xD;
      will have similar testing which may also be compared to the blood testing results. The&#xD;
      ongoing objective varies from investigation to investigation but in general the&#xD;
      investigational goals are to better understand the immune function of normal volunteers and&#xD;
      compare it to immune function in disease states.&#xD;

      Blood will be obtained via peripheral venipuncture. The blood will be divided into components&#xD;
      (e.g. plasma, serum, microvesicles, and cells) then analyzed. Flow cytometry will be used to&#xD;
      determine cell and microvesicle subsets. RNA will be extracted from the various components of&#xD;
      blood and will be subjected to gene and microRNA profiling to determine gene expression. DNA&#xD;
      will be isolated from the cells to be used in studies investigating epigenetic regulation of&#xD;
      genes identified in the screens. Protein will also be isolated from the multiple components&#xD;
      to examine the impact of genetic regulation by epigenetic mechanisms or microRNA on protein&#xD;
      expression. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be placed in tissue culture for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva and urine will be obtained the same day as blood for testing.&#xD;
