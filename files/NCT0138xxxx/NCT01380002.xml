  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Liver/renal transplantations are now tending to be the most important treatment for&#xD;
           terminal liver and renal disease. Although transplantation can prevent recipients from&#xD;
           suffering with critical and fatal symptoms, patients may experience the complication&#xD;
           from surgery and immunosuppressive drugs. Furthermore, they might have many unmet needs&#xD;
           in daily life, and so as their spouses. The purpose of this study is to explore the&#xD;
           home-care needs among the post liver or renal transplant recipients and their spouses,&#xD;
           and identify the significant factors for care needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cross-sectional correlated design will be used and patients will be recruited by&#xD;
           purposive sampling from an organ transplant outpatient department at a medical center in&#xD;
           northern Taiwan. A set of structured questionnaires will be used to collect data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The result of this study will be helpful for clinical nurses to understand liver or&#xD;
           renal recipients' physical and mental distress, also identify the potential risk of&#xD;
           home-care needs and the degree of satisfaction as well.&#xD;
