  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An existing face-to-face HIV prevention intervention (The Young Men's Health Project, YMHP;&#xD;
      R01DA20366) will be iteratively adapted and pilot-tested to target difficult to engage&#xD;
      high-risk young men who have sex with men (YMSM) via online social networking and aims to&#xD;
      reduce both high-risk sexual behavior and drug use.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study entails a two-phase process. During Phase I, 15 former YMHP participants&#xD;
      (intervention decliners and those who only completed one session) will participate in focus&#xD;
      groups to advise us on the feasibility and pragmatic specifications of an HIV prevention&#xD;
      intervention received via the IM (instant messaging) function of Facebook. Focus group&#xD;
      transcripts will be examined to isolate key recommendations for modifying the intervention's&#xD;
      structure and procedures. Focus groups will be reconvened for additional feedback on the&#xD;
      modified intervention, followed by further adjustment. During Phase II, 40 high-risk YMSM&#xD;
      (ages 18-29 and Facebook users) will be enrolled in a pilot of the modified intervention. The&#xD;
      intervention will span 4 weeks and contain 8 bi-weekly 30 minute Motivational Interviewing&#xD;
      (MI) chat-window sessions consisting of a sequential progression of intervention approaches&#xD;
      tailored to each participant's readiness to change their drug use and high risk sexual&#xD;
      behavior. Data from Phase II will include pre-post intervention behavioral risk assessments,&#xD;
      as well as individual interviews with all 40 intervention participants for a qualitative&#xD;
      evaluation regarding the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention's structure, and&#xD;
      process. Findings from these interviews (and counselor focus group) will inform the&#xD;
      fine-tuning of the intervention in preparation for a subsequent randomized control trial&#xD;
      (RCT).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the focus group portion of the study (N=20), we will invite former YMHP participants&#xD;
        who declined the intervention or only completed one session, agreed to be contacted for&#xD;
        future studies, indicated using Facebook, are still between the ages of 18-29 and live in&#xD;
        NYC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To qualify for the intervention portion of the study, participants must report&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. at least 5 days of drug use (of 1 or more of the following drugs: cocaine,&#xD;
             methamphetamine (MA), or ecstasy (MDMA) in the prior three months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. high-risk sexual behavior (1 or more acts of unprotected insertive or receptive anal&#xD;
             sex with a male partner of unknown or HIV+ serostatus), in the prior three months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. biologically male;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. age 18 to 29;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. HIV-;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. reliable Internet access;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Facebook use at least four times per week;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. able to write in English given that intervention participation involves writing;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. NYC residency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will be excluded for any of the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unstable, serious psychiatric symptoms;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Currently suicidal/homicidal;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evidence of gross cognitive impairment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Self-reported current enrollment in a drug or HIV-related intervention or research&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We exclude those with serious cognitive or psychiatric impairments because this would&#xD;
        compromise ability to participate, regardless of whether these impairments are attributed&#xD;
        to drug use. Such impairments would make completion of assessments difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded participants will be referred to local community health and social services&#xD;
        resources, for which we have established linkages to facilitate access to care regardless&#xD;
        of ability to pay.&#xD;
