  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common causes of community-acquired pneumonia and&#xD;
      exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, which are associated&#xD;
      with morbidity, mortality, and higher health-care cost. In addition, recently high daily dose&#xD;
      of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy became more evident to be beneficial in&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe COPD patients, but excess risk of pneumonia shown in database analysis was&#xD;
      worried about by primary physicians. The use of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination&#xD;
      (PPSV23) has protective efficacy to eliminate infection of Streptococcus pneumoniae from&#xD;
      previous studies. If the use of PPSV23 can reduce the incidence of pneumonia or exacerbations&#xD;
      in COPD patients using high daily dose of ICS, the benefit of ICS can be preserved and risk&#xD;
      of pneumonia can be reduced. However, there is only limited data supporting this hypothesis.&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will conduct a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      to evaluate the clinical efficacy of PPSV23 in severe COPD patients using high daily dose of&#xD;
      ICS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exacerbations are a common feature in moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD). Morbidity, mortality and health-care costs of these patients largely result&#xD;
      from exacerbations. The most common causes of an exacerbation are infection of&#xD;
      tracheobronchial tree. Among them, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequently isolated&#xD;
      organism, accounting for 5-25% patients of COPD, while it is also the most commonly&#xD;
      identified cause in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), accounting for 16.5-38.9% of CAP&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, widespread emergence of antimicrobial resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae&#xD;
      has became a major global concern, especially in Taiwan, one of the highest levels of&#xD;
      antibiotic-resistant pneumococci in the world. Therefore, primary prevention by vaccination&#xD;
      is encouraged for those high-risk patients with COPD. The currently available adult&#xD;
      pneumococcal vaccine consists of the capsular polysaccharide of 23 different serotypes of&#xD;
      Streptococcus pneumoniae (PPSV23). The antibodies produced in response to this polysaccharide&#xD;
      can provide protection by inducing host immune cells to kill or to opsonize bacteria for&#xD;
      phagocytosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, few studies have been designed to specifically examine vaccine efficacy in COPD&#xD;
      patients. Among 3 available randomized controlled trials, only one study involving 596&#xD;
      patients found, from post-hoc analyses, some protective efficacy for pneumonia in patients of&#xD;
      &lt; 65 years of age and of an FEV1 &lt; 40% predicted. Based on above evidence (only limited body&#xD;
      of data), the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2006 Guideline&#xD;
      has recommended the PPSV23 inoculation as evidence B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the way, in comparison to placebo and the single components, a superior control by means&#xD;
      of the inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) fixed combination&#xD;
      therapy has been demonstrated for significant clinical improvement in moderate-to-severe COPD&#xD;
      patients, except mortality, by meta-analysis and large prospective studies (TORCH [Towards a&#xD;
      Revolution in COPD Health] trial and INSPIRE [Investigating New Standards for Prophylaxis in&#xD;
      Reduction of Exacerbations] trial). However, those database indicated that high daily dose of&#xD;
      ICS (fluticasone propionate at a dose of 500-1000mcg daily) was associated with an excess&#xD;
      risk of pneumonia, which doubles the pneumonia incidence in patients not receiving ICS. The&#xD;
      immunogenicity of PPSV23 in COPD patients using systemic steroid was demonstrated but the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of vaccination has not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From above-mentioned background, if the use of PPSV23 can reduce the incidence of pneumonia&#xD;
      or exacerbations in COPD patients using high daily dose of ICS, the benefit of ICS can be&#xD;
      preserved and risk of pneumonia can be reduced. For primary physicians, this hypothesis, if&#xD;
      true, is very beneficial. So, in this study, the investigators want to conduct a&#xD;
      double-blinded, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the clinical efficacy of PPSV23 in&#xD;
      COPD patients using high daily dose of ICS.&#xD;
