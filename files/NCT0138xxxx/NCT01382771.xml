  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects (N=120) who have had non-radicular low back pain, believed by clinical assessment&#xD;
      and imaging to be consistent with lumbar zygapophysial joint (Z-joint) generated pain, who&#xD;
      have failed conservative therapy including physical therapy, have had an initial &gt;80% pain&#xD;
      relief on a diagnostic medial branch block, and are scheduled to undergo a routine second&#xD;
      medial branch block for facet mediated pain will be randomized. Both groups will receive the&#xD;
      standard of care, a medial branch block. The treatment group will also receive one set of&#xD;
      intra-articular lumbar Z-joint corticosteroid injection and the placebo group will receive&#xD;
      intra-articular normal saline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will have failed conservative treatment, including, but not limited to oral&#xD;
      medications, physical therapy, chiropractic treatment, and/or alternative medicine. They will&#xD;
      be evaluated by a spine specialist in the Spine Division of the Department of Orthopaedics&#xD;
      and will be schedule for a medial branch block as standard of care. As part of usual and&#xD;
      standard care, patients will undergo lumbar medial branch blocks for diagnosis of&#xD;
      zygapophysial joint pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who obtain ≥ to 80% relief of their index pain with a first set of lumbar medial&#xD;
      branch blocks will be offered the opportunity for possible inclusion in the study if they are&#xD;
      scheduled to receive a second medial branch block. The definition of a positive response to&#xD;
      MBB's is an 80% reduction in pain (by change in NPR scores or estimated patient improvement)&#xD;
      AND the restoration of the ability to perform at least one previously painful posture,&#xD;
      movement, or activity without increase in pain, during the anesthetic phase of the blocks. If&#xD;
      subjects are unable to render NPR scores or percentage estimate of improvement, then a 5&#xD;
      point global perception of effect tool will be used.&#xD;
