    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare two study patches having minor differences in patch components&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the pharmacokinetics (PK - how the body absorbs, metabolizes and eliminates&#xD;
           medication) of NP101 (study patches) versus a currently approved oral formulation of&#xD;
           Imitrex&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Collect resistance data during application of NP101 (study patch)&#xD;

    <description>Blood samples (4 mL per sample) for PK analysis will be collected at the following times for the determination of sumatriptan concentrations in plasma for each treatment:&#xD;
Pre-dose (within 15 minutes prior to dosing) and at 0.25, 0.50, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hrs post-dose.</description>
