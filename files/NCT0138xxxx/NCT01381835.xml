  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the steady-state pharmacokinetics of TMC435 in&#xD;
      participants with severe renal impairment and to compare these with the TMC435&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics in matched participants with normal renal function. We will also study the&#xD;
      short-term safety and tolerability of TMC435, when administered in participants with severe&#xD;
      renal impairment and in participants with normal renal function. Steady-state is a term that&#xD;
      means that the drug has been given long enough so that the plasma concentrations will remain&#xD;
      the same with each subsequent dose. TMC435 is being investigated for the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Pharmacokinetics (PK) means how the drug is absorbed into&#xD;
      the bloodstream, distributed in the body, and eliminated from the body.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TMC435 is a protease inhibitor (PI) and is being investigated for treatment of chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, in combination with Peg-IFN (pegylated interferon) and RBV&#xD;
      (ribavirin). The result of this study may provide dosing recommendations for TMC435 in&#xD;
      patients with severe renal impairement. This is a Phase I, open-label (both participant and&#xD;
      investigator know the name of the medication given at certain moment), to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics and safety of TMC435. Severe renal&#xD;
      impairment will be defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) = 29&#xD;
      mL/min/1.73m2. Participants with severe renal impairment are only allowed in this study if&#xD;
      they are not on dialysis. Normal renal function will be considered as an eGFR = 80&#xD;
      mL/min/1.73m2. eGFR is a measured filtering capacity of the kidneys. The trial population&#xD;
      will consist of a total of 16 male or female participants. Eight (8) healthy participants&#xD;
      with a normal renal function and 8 participants with severe renal impairment will be&#xD;
      included. A healthy participant will be matched to a participant with severe renal impairment&#xD;
      with regards to sex, race, age (± 10 years), and body mass index (BMI) (± 20%). Dosing of the&#xD;
      matched healthy participants can only start once the corresponding participants with severe&#xD;
      renal impairment has completed Day 10 assessments (including physical examination). All&#xD;
      participants will receive TMC435150 mg once a day (q.d.) for 7 days under fed conditions.&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples, electrocardiogram (ECG) and vital signs (blood pressure and heart&#xD;
      rate) will be taken at screening, on Day 1, Day 7, at the follow-up visit at 1 week after&#xD;
      last dose of study medication and at the follow-up visit at 4-5 weeks after last dose of&#xD;
      study medication. A physical examination will be performed at screening, on Day -1 (= day&#xD;
      before first medication intake), on Day 10 and during the follow-up visits. A full&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profiles of bound TMC435 will be determined on Day 7 up to 72 hours postdose.&#xD;
      In addition, unbound TMC435 plasma concentrations will be determined at specified timepoints.&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the trial. Participants will be admitted&#xD;
      to the unit on Day-1 and discharged on Day10. Each participant will receive orally 150 mg&#xD;
      TMC435, q.d. for 7 consecutive days.&#xD;
