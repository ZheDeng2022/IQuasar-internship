  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is now a global epidemic of diabetes and obesity affecting more than 300 million people&#xD;
      worldwide with Asia in the forefront. In Hong Kong, diabetes affects more than 10% of the&#xD;
      population. Patients with diabetes have a 12-25% lifetime risk of developing a foot ulcer.The&#xD;
      abnormal metabolic milieus of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, pro-thrombotic&#xD;
      state and chronic inflammation in diabetes causes atherosclerosis.A significant proportion of&#xD;
      subjects have underlying peripheral arterial disease and neuropathy. These subjects are at&#xD;
      great risk of developing infective foot ulceration secondary to impaired vascular supply,&#xD;
      sensory loss and minor trauma.Without prompt and proper medical treatment, these infective&#xD;
      ulcers will deteriorate leading to gangrene and limb amputation. In-vitro and in-vivo studies&#xD;
      revealed that 5 out of the 12 herbs were effective in promoting fibroblast proliferation and&#xD;
      angiogenesis. To minimize potential drug interactions and adverse effects from multiple&#xD;
      components in a recipe of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the investigators have&#xD;
      developed a simplified formula from the 12 herbs consisting of only two herbs. In this&#xD;
      proof-of-concept study, the investigators hypothesize that the novel recipe of herbal&#xD;
      medicine will expedite healing of early foot ulcer by promoting vascularisation and&#xD;
      granulation as well as modulating inflammatory response.&#xD;

      There is now a global epidemic of diabetes and obesity affecting more than 300 million people&#xD;
      worldwide with Asia in the forefront. In Hong Kong, diabetes affects more than 10% of the&#xD;
      population. Patients with diabetes have a 12-25% lifetime risk of developing a foot ulcer.&#xD;
      These silent conditions independently and collectively contribute to 50% of all causes of&#xD;
      death mainly due to cardiovascular and renal complications. Type 2 diabetes is a complex&#xD;
      disorder characterized by a constellation of cardiovascular risk factors, notably,&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, obesity, dyslipidemia (high triglyceride (TG) and low HDL-C), hypertension,&#xD;
      microinflammation and prothrombotic state, often referred to as the metabolic syndrome. The&#xD;
      public health implication of diabetes lies mainly in its devastating chronic complications&#xD;
      due to generalized vascular dysfunction. In patients with diabetes and metabolic syndrome,&#xD;
      loss of cellular structure or function due to apoptosis, angiogenesis and fibrosis eventually&#xD;
      manifest as overt diabetic complications, such as cardiovascular diseases, neuropathy,&#xD;
      retinopathy and nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The abnormal metabolic milieus of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, pro-thrombotic&#xD;
      state and chronic inflammation in diabetes causes atherosclerosis. A significant proportion&#xD;
      of subjects have underlying peripheral arterial disease and neuropathy. These subjects are at&#xD;
      great risk of developing infective foot ulceration secondary to impaired vascular supply,&#xD;
      sensory loss and minor trauma. Without prompt and proper medical treatment, these infective&#xD;
      ulcers will deteriorate leading to gangrene and limb amputation. Age, wound depth, the&#xD;
      presence of ischaemia, a low albumin level, and the lack of simultaneous ulceration are the&#xD;
      most significant independent predictors of an unfavourable outcome. The conventional&#xD;
      management of diabetic foot ulcer includes rest, antibiotic therapy, surgical debridement and&#xD;
      good glycemic control. The investigators previously demonstrated that the use of a recipe&#xD;
      containing 12 herbs was effective in promoting the healing of severe chronic non-healing&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcers and achieved an 85% of limb preservation. In-vitro and in-vivo studies&#xD;
      revealed that 5 out of the 12 herbs were effective in promoting fibroblast proliferation and&#xD;
      angiogenesis. To minimize potential drug interactions and adverse effects from multiple&#xD;
      components in a recipe of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the investigators have&#xD;
      developed a simplified formula from the 12 herbs consisting of only two herbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many herbs have long been used to treat diabetes mellitus and its complications. In many of&#xD;
      these successful attempts Radix Rehmanniae (RR) and Radix Astragali (RA) have frequently been&#xD;
      used in combination with other herbs to form complex formulae such as 'blood-house blood&#xD;
      stasis-dispelling decoction with additive ingredients' and 'pills of six drugs with&#xD;
      Rehmannia'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our previous in-vitro and in-vivo studies, a new reformulated recipe of herbal&#xD;
      medicine has been developed. In this proof-of-concept study, the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the novel recipe of herbal medicine will expedite healing of early foot ulcer by&#xD;
      promoting vascularisation and granulation as well as modulating inflammatory response.&#xD;
      Results will provide valuable insight and understanding of the application of TCM in the&#xD;
      management of diabetic foot ulcer, in particular, the effect on angiogenesis and&#xD;
      anti-inflammation. New intellectual properties will be developed and provide the foundation&#xD;
      for future research. Such an integrated approach from bench to bedside will serve as a model&#xD;
      platform for the development of TCM in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will investigate whether the two-herb recipe can increase the wound healing of&#xD;
      patients with diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Resolution/progression of foot ulcer based on PEDIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Failure of treatment i.e. no improvement in 6 months, rapid deterioration or emergency&#xD;
           surgery required&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hospital admission/attendance/stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Metabolic parameters&#xD;
