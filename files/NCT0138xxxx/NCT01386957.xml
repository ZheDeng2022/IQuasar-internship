      Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is the most frequent glomerular disease in childhood.&#xD;
      Currently, all children with INS are treated at onset with steroids. The optimal duration and&#xD;
      dosage of steroid therapy is debated. For each patient, the challenge is to minimise&#xD;
      potential side effects of steroids, while achieving a good clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to assess the benefits and potential adverse effects of a prolonged&#xD;
      initial corticosteroid regimen, for the treatment of the initial episode. The results will be&#xD;
      compared with data obtained retrospectively. In addition genetic studies will be undertaken&#xD;
      with the aim of evaluating pharmacodynamics of steroid treatment with the ultimate goal to&#xD;
      individualise treatment in single patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study group: children aged 6 months - 18 years, diagnosed with an initial episode of&#xD;
           idiopathic nephrotic syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group: data of children with a onset INS between January 2007 and December 2009&#xD;
           from the same area of the study group and treated with a short steroid regimen will be&#xD;
           retrospectively analysed and compared&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is the most frequent glomerular disease in&#xD;
      childhood, with an incidence of 2-4 cases per 100,000 children. Currently, all children with&#xD;
      INS are treated at onset with steroids. Approximately 80% of cases respond to oral&#xD;
      corticosteroid therapy, but 75-80% of these children will experience relapses which can recur&#xD;
      over many years. The optimal duration and dosage of steroid therapy at onset and during&#xD;
      subsequent relapses is debated. For each patient, the challenge is to minimise potential side&#xD;
      effects of steroid therapy (hypertension, bone disease, Cushing syndrome, obesity, growth&#xD;
      retardation, cataracts and a variety of psychological, social and behavioural disturbances)&#xD;
      while achieving a good clinical response. This is particularly difficult at the beginning of&#xD;
      the illness, because of the lack of reliable indicators that allow the identification of&#xD;
      patients who will respond poorly or will experience frequent relapses. In 2006 the Cochrane&#xD;
      Collaboration published the first systematic review of corticosteroid therapy for childhood&#xD;
      idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. They concluded that children with the first episode of steroid&#xD;
      sensitive INS should be treated for a minimum of three months, to achieve a reduction in the&#xD;
      subsequent relapse rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fine border between the optimal dose of steroids and the collateral effects can not be&#xD;
      overlooked given the results of some recent studies (relative to patients with chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease or children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia subject to prolonged&#xD;
      cycles of steroid therapy) based on the pharmacogenetic evaluation of the diverse individual&#xD;
      responses to steroids. Clinical data supports the concept that the collateral effects of&#xD;
      steroids are not exclusively dose related, but can depend on constitutional hypersensitivity&#xD;
      or resistance, at times specific for a particular corticosteroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This diverse individual response can depend on a number of factors. The activity of the&#xD;
      corticosteroids is mediated by interactions with the DNA (genomic mechanism) or by a direct&#xD;
      interaction with the cellular membranes (non-genomic mechanism). The genomic effects are by&#xD;
      far the most important and are mediated by the interactions of the steroids with a specific&#xD;
      cytoplasmic receptor (GR). The binding of the steroid determines the activation of the&#xD;
      receptor and its translocation within the nucleus where it induces (transactivation) or&#xD;
      inhibits (transcriptional interference) the synthesis of numerous regulatory proteins. The&#xD;
      mechanism of transactivation is likely responsible for the major part of collateral effects&#xD;
      (suppression of the hypothalamic-hypophysial-adrenal axis, genesis of glaucoma and diabetes),&#xD;
      while the anti-inflammatory effects are for the most part tied to transcriptional inhibition&#xD;
      (with reduced synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, cyclic oxygenase2, inducible forms of&#xD;
      nitrite synthesis and finally a reduction in synthesis of receptors for Fc and C3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are individual diverse molecular anomalies of the gene for the glucocorticoid receptors&#xD;
      (hGR/NR3C1) that have bean uncovered: for example the presence of polymorphisms of the gene&#xD;
      hGR is correlated with receptor hyperactivity (Bcl1 e N3635) or relative resistance of the&#xD;
      glucocorticoid receptor (polymorphism ER22/23EK); a further 15 mutations have already been&#xD;
      identified to be associated with corticosteroid resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These facts open interesting possibilities for pharmacological research with the hypothesis&#xD;
      of being able to adjust steroid therapy in response to an individuals genetic make-up and&#xD;
      predict the appearance of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM The aim of our study is to assess the benefits and potential adverse effects of a&#xD;
      prolonged initial corticosteroid regimen across four Italian regions, for the treatment of&#xD;
      the initial episode of INS. The results will be compared with data obtained retrospectively&#xD;
      from the analysis of a control group of INS, treated with a short steroid regimen during the&#xD;
      previous 3 years in the same area. In addition genetic studies will be undertaken with the&#xD;
      aim of evaluating pharmacogenetics and pharmacodynamics of steroid treatment with the&#xD;
      ultimate goal to individualise treatment in single patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study group: children aged 6 months - 18 years, diagnosed with an initial episode of&#xD;
           idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria&gt; 40mg/m2/h or urine protein/creatine ratio &gt;&#xD;
           2 mg/mg and hypoalbuminemia &lt;2.5g/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will be enrolled from the first of July 2011 to the 30th of June 2013; the&#xD;
           follow-up of each subject will continue for 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group: data of children with a onset INS between January 2007 and December 2009&#xD;
           from the same area of the study group and treated with a short steroid regimen will be&#xD;
           retrospectively analysed and compared. Data will be recorded anonymously through an&#xD;
           online database. The epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic parameters collected will be&#xD;
           the same of the intervention group, except for pharmacogenetic and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
           tests, and behavioral questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study group patients will be subjected to the following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction therapy: prednisone 60mg/m2/day in 2 divided doses. Patients achieving remission&#xD;
      within 10 days, will continue this dosage until the 28th day, whereas patients not achieving&#xD;
      remission within 10 days, will continue this dosage until the 42nd day. Moreover, from the&#xD;
      3rd day of remission prednisone will be given in a single morning dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients going into remission during the induction therapy will have steroids tapered over a&#xD;
      16 weeks period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  40 mg/m2/alt day in a single morning dose for 4 weeks,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 mg/m2/alt day in a single morning dose for 2 weeks,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  22.5 mg/m2/alt day in a single morning dose for 2 weeks,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 mg/m2/alt day in a single morning dose for 2 weeks,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  7.5 mg/m2/alt day in a single morning dose for 2 weeks,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4.5 mg/m2/alt day in a single morning dose for 4 weeks,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stop therapy. A subgroup of patients (estimated to be 100) will undergo pharmacogenetic&#xD;
           and pharmacodynamic studies. The pharmacogenetic study will evaluate the presence of&#xD;
           gene polymorphisms that modifies the numbers of functioning receptors and their affinity&#xD;
           for steroids (genes studied are showed in Tab 3). The pharmacodynamic study will&#xD;
           evaluate the in vitro response to steroids on blood mononuclear cells: individual&#xD;
           sensibility to steroids will be detected before and during steroid treatment and&#xD;
           compared with the clinical response, in order to tailor treatment in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapses. Relapses will be treated with a further prolonged steroid regimen witch is&#xD;
      described in the protocol per extenso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical examination Height, weight, BMI, blood pressure Parent heights recording (for&#xD;
           familial target) (at onset, remission, 4th, 20th weeks, 6, 12, 18, 24 months)&#xD;
