  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Simvastatin and related statins, such as compactin, are able to inhibit the constitutive&#xD;
      expression of inducible/repressible keratin genes such as K6a and K17. This effect is due to&#xD;
      the reported ability of statins to inhibit STAT1 expression (Lee et al., 2007). The&#xD;
      constitutive K6a promoter activity is dependent on STAT1 and blocked by simvastatin or siRNA&#xD;
      against STAT1. This STAT1-dependent constitutive expression of K6a, is independent of JAK&#xD;
      (Janus family of kinases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus simvastatin is capable of down-regulating both the constitutive and interferon-inducible&#xD;
      expression of PC-related keratins such as K6a and K17. Therefore, this class of molecule has&#xD;
      potential for the treatment of PC or related inherited disorders where the causative mutation&#xD;
      resides in an inducible/repressible keratin gene such as K6a or K17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simvastatin or other statins approved for human use might be delivered either orally, as is&#xD;
      currently the case for cholesterol-lowering treatment or, if higher therapeutic doses are&#xD;
      required in skin for reduction of hyperkeratosis in PC or in related keratinizing disorders,&#xD;
      this might be achieved by topical formulations.&#xD;
