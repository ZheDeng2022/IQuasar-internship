  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there are no controlled data on the management of postpartum depression that fails&#xD;
      to respond to adequate antidepressant therapy. The investigators recently reported that a&#xD;
      large number of patients responded to the addition of atypical neuroleptics after having&#xD;
      failed antidepressant trials. Aripiprazole used adjunctively to antidepressants is effective&#xD;
      in patients with resistant depression but it has not been studied in patients with resistant&#xD;
      postpartum depression. The investigators propose to conduct a 6 week open-label study to&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness and tolerability of aripiprazole used adjunctively to&#xD;
      antidepressants in patients with resistant postpartum depression.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Euthyroid outpatients aged 18 to 45 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;

             delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A 17-item HAM-D score of 18 or more&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inadequate response to at least one antidepressant drug - defined as a &lt;50% reduction&#xD;
             in severity of depression for a duration of &gt;6 weeks ( &gt; than 8 weeks for fluoxetine),&#xD;
             determined by the Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Response&#xD;
             Questionnaire. Patients having a score of 18 or more on the 17-item HAM-D will be&#xD;
             eligible to participate in the study. The primary efficacy endpoint will be mean&#xD;
             change in MADRS score, and the secondary endpoint will be mean change in the HAM-D&#xD;
             score&#xD;
&#xD;
             &gt;For patients on psychotropic drugs (other than antidepressants) prior there will be a&#xD;
             washout period of two weeks&#xD;

             least 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug to minimize the risk of pregnancy.&#xD;
             Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing potential must be advised of the&#xD;
             importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk&#xD;
             factors for an unintentional pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        WOCBP include any woman who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful&#xD;

        pregnancy, or who are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile (eg,&#xD;
        vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or&#xD;
