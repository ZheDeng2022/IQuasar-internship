  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain following Cesarean delivery remains the most common post-operative complaint, and the&#xD;
      provision of effective and safe analgesia is very important. Pain can impede the mother's&#xD;
      ability to mobilise, and to care for and breastfeed her newborn baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) devices have been used in various clinical settings,&#xD;
      especially after plastic surgeries, to reduce postoperative swelling and pain, as well as to&#xD;
      accelerate wound repair. PEMF therapy is simple to use, cost-effective and has no known side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite advances in post-operative analgesia, pain relief and maternal satisfaction remain&#xD;
      inadequate in some patients. Improving the quality of post-Cesarean analgesia while limiting&#xD;
      undesirable side effects will enhance maternal satisfaction and reduce the risk of&#xD;
      post-operative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the continuous use of a PEMF device for 48 hours after&#xD;
      Cesarean delivery will result in decreased post-operative pain scores on movement at 48&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Currently, at our institution, analgesic regimens are multimodal, in that they combine&#xD;
      analgesic drugs with differing mechanisms of action, with the aim of producing effective&#xD;
      analgesia while minimising adverse effects. They include opioid drugs, administered both&#xD;
      neuro-axially and systemically, as well as paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drugs (NSAIDs). Opioids, while effective, have significant adverse effects, including&#xD;
      sedation, nausea, vomiting and constipation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&#xD;
      can reduce opioid consumption, but also have side effects, and are contra-indicated in a&#xD;
      significant number of patients. Therefore there remains considerable scope to improve&#xD;
      post-Cesarean analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) technology relieves edema, inflammation and pain by&#xD;
      stabilizing leaking cell membranes. The short bursts of electrical current do not produce&#xD;
      heat or interfere with nerve or muscle function. The pulsed energy drives out edematous fluid&#xD;
      along with by-products of the damaged tissue, which reduces swelling and helps re-establish&#xD;
      cell-cell communication. The device is easily applied over the wound dressing, and has no&#xD;
      known side effects for either the mother or the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the rate of Cesarean delivery continues to increase, and there remain significant problems&#xD;
      with current analgesic regimens, the use of pulsed electromagnetic field therapy has the&#xD;
      potential to considerably improve acute and chronic post-Cesarean pain management, and lead&#xD;
      to a widespread change in clinical practice.&#xD;
