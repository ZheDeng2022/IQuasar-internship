      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The p53 gene normally helps to stop cancer cells from growing. However, when the p53&#xD;
           gene is mutated or damaged, cancer cells may grow unchecked. Researchers have been&#xD;
           working on a vaccine that will help the immune system recognize and destroy cells that&#xD;
           have the p53 mutation and may be cancerous.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT-011 is another drug that may help the body's immune system to fight cancer. This drug&#xD;
           blocks a chemical found on tumor cells that prevents the immune system from recognizing&#xD;
           and destroying them. Research studies have shown that CT-011 slows the growth of tumors.&#xD;
           By combining the p53 vaccine and CT-011, researchers hope to slow or stop tumor growth&#xD;
           in people whose cancer that has not responded to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of CT-011 and the p53 genetic vaccine to treat adults&#xD;
      with solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People at least 18 years of age who have solid tumors that have not responded to standard&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also&#xD;
           have blood tests and tumor imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive the p53 vaccine as an injection in the arm or thigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two days after receiving the p53 vaccine, those in the study will receive CT-011 as an&#xD;
           infusion over about 2 hours. Participants will be monitored during the infusion for any&#xD;
           side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The combination of p53 vaccine and CT-011 will be repeated every 3 weeks (one cycle).&#xD;
           Treatment will continue as long as the side effects are not severe and the tumor does&#xD;
           not grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three weeks after the second dose of p53 vaccine and CT-011, participants will have a&#xD;
           full physical exam. They will also have blood tests, and tumor imaging studies. This&#xD;
           exam set will be repeated after every two cycles of p53 vaccine and CT-011.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have regular follow-up visits for up to a year after stopping&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PD1 is an inhibitory receptor that belongs to CD28-B7 family.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PD1 binds to two ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 to down modulate T-cell immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PD1 is expressed on T cells, B cells, and NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The over expression of PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) in tumors is associated with an immune&#xD;
           suppression and poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of anti PD1 antibody&#xD;
           (CT-011) in combination with subcutaneous p53 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the immune response to wt p53 (264-272) peptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the clinical efficacy of this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18 years of age or older, not pregnant or nursing and not immunocompromised or having an&#xD;
           autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HLA-A2 haplotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status of 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advanced solid tumors over expressing p53 protein with a histological confirmation of&#xD;
           the original primary tumor via the Pathology Laboratory, CCR , NCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single arm, pilot/phase I trial in patients receiving a fixed dose of vaccine in&#xD;
           combination with an escalating dose of CT-011.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The vaccine will be administered subcutaneously every 3 weeks followed by CT-011 two&#xD;
           days after each vaccine until disease progression or toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo blood draw or aphaeresis for immunologic assays prior to starting&#xD;
           treatment and after every second cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be assessed for overall safety, immunologic efficacy, tumor response using&#xD;
           RECIST criteria and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be followed for up to two years after the last vaccination for assessment&#xD;
           of safety and efficacy.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Solid malignancies with a histological confirmation of the original primary tumor&#xD;
                  via the pathology report for which no curative therapies are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients must have disease progression after at least one prior first line&#xD;
                  disease-appropriate therapy, or be unable to tolerate or declined to receive&#xD;
                  first line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. No chemotherapy or radiation therapy or systemic steroids for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
                  prior to starting vaccination. No immunotherapy (including monoclonal antibodies)&#xD;
                  within 4 weeks prior to start of vaccine. Patients should have recovered from all&#xD;
                  acute toxicities of previous treatment (excluding alopecia).&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patients must have tumors over expressing p53 protein as assessed by&#xD;
                  immunohistochemistry, as determined by positive staining of tumor sample when&#xD;
                  compared to negative controls. The immunohistochemical staining will be performed&#xD;
                  in the Pathology Laboratory, CCR, NCI on fresh or archival tissue and will be&#xD;
                  supervised by Dr. Merino. The criteria used to determine overexpression will be&#xD;
                  that used in the Pathology Laboratory: Ten fields will be evaluated at 40 times&#xD;
                  magnification and if &gt; 25% of cells stain positive, the tumor will be categorized&#xD;
                  as an overexpressor. Fresh tissue from a new biopsy will only be collected for&#xD;
                  IHC staining if the tumor is easily accessible and does not pose greater than&#xD;
                  minimal risk. A separate procedure consent will be required for all biopsy&#xD;
                  procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Patients must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. ECOG performance status of 0-1.&#xD;

&#xD;
                  i. Leukocytes greater than or equal to 2,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
                  ii. Lymphocytes greater than or equal to 800/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
                  iii. ANC greater than or equal to 1000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
                  iv. Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
                  v. Total Bilirubin less than or equal 2mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
                  vi. AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) less than or equal to 1.5 times the institutional upper&#xD;
                  limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  vii. Creatinine less than or equal to 2mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Patients must have HLA-A0201.&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Patients must be willing to travel to the NIH Clinical Center for treatment and&#xD;
                  follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. Willing to use effective birth control measures: Since the effects of P53 vaccine&#xD;
                  and CT-011 on the developing human fetus are unknown and potentially harmful,&#xD;
                  women of child-bearing potential and men with partners of childbearing potential&#xD;
                  must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or double barrier method of&#xD;
                  birth control or complete abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
                  of study participation and for one month after the last dose of investigational&#xD;
                  agent. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
                  participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
                  immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
              13. Patients must understand and sign an informed consent document that explains the&#xD;
                  neoplastic nature of his/her disease, the procedures to be followed, the&#xD;
                  experimental nature of the treatment, alternative treatments, and potential risks&#xD;
                  and toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Concurrent therapy with any other investigational agent(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial because of&#xD;
             their poor prognosis and frequent development of progressive neurological dysfunction&#xD;
             that would confound the evaluation of neurological and other adverse events. Patients&#xD;
             with treated brain metastases which have been stable for 6 months or longer will be&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who are immunocompromised (HIV positive) or with active Hepatitis B or C;&#xD;
             HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with CT-011 or p53. .&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who have underlying immune deficiency or history of autoimmune disease&#xD;
             (including but not limited to SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease, regional enteritis or other diseases known or presumed to&#xD;
             be of autoimmune origin.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients being chronically treated with immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin,&#xD;
             adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Concurrent use of systemic steroids except physiologic doses for systemic steroid&#xD;
             replacement or local therapy. Physiologic doses are defined as daily systemic therapy&#xD;
             used to replace endogenous steroids because of HPA axis dysfunction or other&#xD;
             physiological abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of a second active malignancy in the last 2 years other than non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancers or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with active infections requiring antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with New York Heart Association stage 2 or greater heart failure, unstable&#xD;
             angina or cardiac arrhythmias requiring therapy including atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pregnant women or nursing mothers are ineligible since the effect of this&#xD;
             investigational treatment on the health of the fetus is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. If, in the opinion of the Principal or Associate Investigators, it is not in the best&#xD;
             medical interest of the patient to enter this study, the patient will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with history of chronic radiation injury/inflammation due to the risk of&#xD;
             perforation in the event of autoimmune inflammation, or history of chronic diarrhea&#xD;
             due to previous treatments or surgery.&#xD;
