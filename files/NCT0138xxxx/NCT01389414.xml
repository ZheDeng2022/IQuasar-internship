      Study Phase: Phase II, Open-label, Randomized&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication: First line treatment in advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and extrahepatic&#xD;
      biliary adenocarcinoma including gallbladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To evaluate the clinical activity of the Panitumumab and GEMOX (P-GEMOX)&#xD;
      combination compared to GEMOX alone in patients with previously untreated surgically&#xD;
      unresectable or metastatic biliary tract carcinoma (KRAS wild-type).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To evaluate the safety profile of the P-GEMOX combination; to assess&#xD;
      the objective response rate; to assess overall survival; to study the correlation between&#xD;
      biomarkers with activity and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Multi-centre phase II, open-label, randomized (1:1), parallel-arm, study of&#xD;
      panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy (P-GEMOX) versus chemotherapy alone (GEMOX).&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized to receive first-line combination therapy&#xD;
      consisting of panitumumab and GEMOX (experimental arm) or GEMOX alone (control arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to study entry and in order to confirm eligibility, the investigator will review&#xD;
      relevant clinical documents including existing radiological images to ensure the subject has&#xD;
      previously untreated, unresectable biliary tract adenocarcinoma including gallbladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment assignment will be done centrally via an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS),&#xD;
      using a permuted-block randomization stratified according to ECOG performance status (PS) (0&#xD;
      or 1 vs 2), and site of primary tumor (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma vs extrahepatic&#xD;
      biliary carcinoma including gallbladder).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panitumumab will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose of 6 mg/kg once every&#xD;
      two weeks (Q2W).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GEMOX chemotherapy will be administered after the administration of panitumumab once Q2W.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be treated for a maximum of 12 cycles until disease progression (PD),&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, or patient's refusal. Patients in the experimental arm without tumor&#xD;
      progression at the end of chemotherapy (12 GEMOX completed or interruption for unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity from chemotherapy) will continue panitumumab 6 mg/kg once Q2W until tumor&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following documentation of progressive disease patients will be followed-up for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated for tumor progression every 8 weeks + 1 week. Tumor response&#xD;
      assessment will be performed by the Investigator using the revised Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines, version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with symptoms suggestive of PD should be evaluated for tumor progression at the time&#xD;
      the symptoms occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from randomization to&#xD;
      evidence of progression (RECIST, vers.1.1), death, or last radiographic assessment in absence&#xD;
      of a PFS event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: Objective response rate (RECIST, vers.1.1); Overall survival; Safety,&#xD;
      defined as incidence and severity of adverse events (Aes), significant laboratory changes,&#xD;
      changes in vital signs, incidence of concomitant medications, changes from baseline over time&#xD;
      in ECOG performance status, incidence of dose adjustments over the treatment period, and&#xD;
      incidence of treatment limiting toxicities (TLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Endpoints:Investigation into potential correlations between the activity of the&#xD;
      combination regimen of panitumumab and GEMOX (P-GEMOX) on molecular markers. Depending on the&#xD;
      availability of tumor tissue, the biomarkers will be analyzed with the following priority:&#xD;
      EGFr expression, nucleotide changes in EGFr and BRAF cancer genes, mutations of other genes&#xD;
      involved in the activation of the EGFr pathway; EGFr gene amplification).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Approximately 88 subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panitumumab will be administered as a 60 minute +/- 15 minutes IV infusion, just prior to&#xD;
      administration of chemotherapy, at a dose of 6 mg/kg on day 1 of each cycle. Gemcitabine&#xD;
      1000mg/sqm will be administered by intravenous infusion in accordance with the hospital&#xD;
      guidelines for administration of Gemcitabine. Gemcitabine should be reconstituted and&#xD;
      administered as 1-hour infusion on day 1 of each cycle. Oxaliplatin 100mg/sqm will be&#xD;
      administered by intravenous infusion in accordance with the hospital guidelines for&#xD;
      administration of Oxaliplatin. Oxaliplatin should be reconstituted and administered as 2-hour&#xD;
      infusion on day 2 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: panitumumab 6 mg/kg will be administered over 60 minute +/- 15 minutes on day 1&#xD;
      followed by Gemcitabine 1000mg/sqm administered by intravenous infusion as 1-hour infusion on&#xD;
      day 1 of each cycle. Oxaliplatin 100mg/sqm will be administered by intravenous infusion as&#xD;
      2-hour infusion on day 2 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: Gemcitabine 1000mg/sqm will be administered by intravenous infusion as 1-hour infusion&#xD;
      on day 1 of each cycle. Oxaliplatin 100mg/sqm will be administered by intravenous infusion as&#xD;
      2-hour infusion on day 2 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations: This phase II design implies a direct, but non-definitive,&#xD;
      &quot;screening&quot; comparison of the experimental therapeutic approach against a randomized&#xD;
      standard-treatment control arm, within a trial with a moderate sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming an accrual time of 24 months and a follow-up time of 12 months, accounting for a 10%&#xD;
      loss to follow-up in both arms, a total sample of 88 patients is expected to yield the&#xD;
      necessary numbers of events if the accrual rate is constant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The log-rank analysis will be stratified by ECOG PS (0 to 1 vs 2), and site of primary tumor&#xD;
      (ie. intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma vs extrahepatic biliary tract carcinoma including&#xD;
      gallbladder).&#xD;
