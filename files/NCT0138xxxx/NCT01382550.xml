  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to estimate the incidence of spontaneous and provoked recurrent VTE&#xD;
      and the bleeding events during a 10-year follow-up in subjects experiencing a first VTE&#xD;
      stratified according to % AT levels and to treatment schedule (long-term vs 6-12 months oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation+transient prophylaxis during high risk periods)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study population: subjects with a recent (&lt;3 months) first VTE event will be enrolled for a&#xD;
      long-term follow-up. Clinical visits will be performed every 4-6 months (average).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each case, objective diagnosis has to be achieved by compression ultrasonography, the&#xD;
      diagnosis being based on the lack of compressibility of one or more venous segments. PE has&#xD;
      to be documented by ventilation/perfusion lung scanning or by spiral computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each subject, information about pregnancy, active malignancy, recent (&lt;3 mo) surgery or&#xD;
      trauma, fracture, immobilization, acute medical illness, use of oral contraceptives,&#xD;
      long-distance travel, personal or family history of arterial and/or venous thrombosis or&#xD;
      repeated birth losses will be collected. In the presence of at least one of the previous risk&#xD;
      factors, VTE will be defined as secondary otherwise idiopathic. Further information,&#xD;
      collected from the whole population by a trained staff, were the following: gender, age,&#xD;
      weight, height, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, personal history of symptomatic&#xD;
      atherosclerosis (i.e. ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, angina, intermittent claudication), arterial hypertension, use of&#xD;
      antihypertensive drugs, diabetes mellitus, use of antidiabetic drugs, hyperlipidemia, use of&#xD;
      statins, smoking habit (use of cigarettes/d), current use of heparin, use of oral&#xD;
      anticoagulant (how long) or of antiplatelet drugs (how long), chronic consumption of other&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these information will be collected by a trained staff on admission and during follow-up&#xD;
      visits (every 4-6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: missing data during the follow-up; contraindications to or lack of&#xD;
      compliance to oral anticoagulation (OAT), lack of informed consent; history of previous VTE&#xD;
      event; indication for continuous oral anticoagulation (e.g., an artificial heart valve or&#xD;
      chronic atrial fibrillation); events occurring during pregnancy, malignancy, puerperium, oral&#xD;
      contraceptive intake, hormone replacement therapy; deficiencies of Prot. C and Prot S or&#xD;
      combined inhibitor deficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Studies All laboratory evaluations will be carried out at least 2 weeks after&#xD;
      cessation of the anticoagulant therapy or after a switching to low-molecular weight heparin&#xD;
      (LMWH) treatment. Antithrombin (AT) functional activity will be measured and VTE patients&#xD;
      will be stratified into 3 subgroups of AT% (1st: &lt;70%, 2nd: 70-80, 3rd: &gt;81%). AT&#xD;
      measurements will be confirmed in a second sample collected 3 months later. In case of&#xD;
      discrepancy between the results of the 2 tests, a third sample will be collected. Protein C&#xD;
      and S; antiphospholipid antibodies (IgG and IgM); homocysteine, and factor V Leiden and&#xD;
      prothrombin 20210A polymorphisms will be determined using commercially available kits by&#xD;
      technicians who had been unaware of the patients' treatment assignments and of the clinical&#xD;
      course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antithrombotic treatment The antithrombotic treatment will be decided according to the usual&#xD;
      practice of the enrolling Center. The duration of the initial treatment with parenteral&#xD;
      anticoagulation (Low Molecular Weight Heparin or Fondaparinux), the beginning of oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation (OAT) with Vit K inhibitors and the International Normalized Ratio (INR)&#xD;
      target will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Center indications the OAT duration (6 months, 12 months or long-lasting) will&#xD;
      be recorded and population will be stratified accordingly. The length of therapy will be&#xD;
      counted from the date when a stable prothrombin time within the target INR range is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of surgery, trauma, prolonged immobilization (&gt;7 days), pregnancy (VTE risk&#xD;
      periods) during the follow-up and the use of adequate anti-thrombotic prophylaxis will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Subjects will be followed-up at 3, 6, and 12 months after enrollment and at least&#xD;
      every 6 months thereafter either by a visit to the Center or by telephone contact. INR values&#xD;
      will be reported by telephone twice monthly. At each visit the patients will be asked about&#xD;
      new symptoms of VTE and about bleeding manifestations. When appropriate, a clinical&#xD;
      assessment will be made and diagnostic tests will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on major and minor bleedings during oral anticoagulation will be collected in the&#xD;
      whole sample. Major bleedings will be defined as hemorrhages that were either retroperitoneal&#xD;
      or intracranial or associated with a decrease in hemoglobin of at least 2.0 g per deciliter&#xD;
      or that had required either transfusion of at least 2 units of blood (or of red cells) or an&#xD;
      invasive procedure, including surgery, to stop them or if they warranted permanent OAT&#xD;
      withdrawing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study end points The incidence of objectively documented recurrent VTE (DVT and/or PE) during&#xD;
      the life-long follow-up is the primary outcome of this study. Contralateral DVT and PE will&#xD;
      be computed as a recurrence. Ipsilateral DVT will be adjudicated recurrent if the results of&#xD;
      the tests are worse than those obtained in a previous test or if the thrombus is diagnosed in&#xD;
      another venous district of the leg. DVT of the arm; CT or MRI-documented occlusion of&#xD;
      cerebral/abdominal veins; ultrasound-documented thrombosis of the great saphenous vein of the&#xD;
      leg not involved in the first appearance will be also defined as a recurrence. The total&#xD;
      (minor and major) bleeding occurrence during the life-long follow-up represents the safety&#xD;
      end-point of this study and will be analyzed according to the thrombolysis in myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (TIMI) bleeding score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Assuming a 20:1:1 sample size ratio between AT% subgroups (AT%&gt; 80%; AT%=70-80%;&#xD;
      and AT%&lt;70%, respectively), to detect an increase in the incidence of recurrent events from&#xD;
      0.3 in the control population (AT% &gt; 80%) to 0.6 in each of the other two subgroups&#xD;
      (AT%=70-80% and AT%&lt;70%), a sample size of about 900 subjects is needed (power= 95%; Î±=0.025,&#xD;
      to allow for two independent comparisons).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results Among individuals with a history of first VTE stratified according to AT%&#xD;
      levels, the risk/benefit analysis of this study will help identify group(s) of individuals&#xD;
      with a strong indication to long-term oral anticoagulation.&#xD;
