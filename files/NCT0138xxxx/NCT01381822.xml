      The primary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the MTD and DLT(s) of TH-302 when used in combination with sunitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose expansion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To make a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of TH-302 in combination with sunitinib&#xD;
           as determined by the response rate and the progression-free survival in subjects with&#xD;
           advanced RCC treated at the RP2D&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the safety of TH-302 in combination with sunitinib and determine a recommended&#xD;
           Phase 2 dose of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose expansion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To make a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of TH-302 in combination with sunitinib&#xD;
      as determined by stable disease or better rate, duration of response and overall survival in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced RCC treated at the RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objective is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To explore the association of serum hypoxia biomarkers with efficacy endpoints.&#xD;

      This Phase 1 dose-escalation study will use a classic dose escalation design to determine the&#xD;
      MTD of TH-302 when used in combination with sunitinib. The study will be divided into two&#xD;
      parts completed in succession to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for dose&#xD;
      expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of TH-302 will be escalated in cohorts of 3-6 subjects. The initial dose of TH-302&#xD;
      will be 240 mg/m2. A Dose Level minus 1 and 2 will be built into the study in the event that&#xD;
      subjects experience excessive toxicity at Dose Level 1. Dose escalation will continue with&#xD;
      approximately 40% increases from the previous dose level; however lower dose increases of&#xD;
      20-39% may be implemented after consultation between the Investigators, Medical Monitor and&#xD;
      Sponsor with the percent increase dependent on the current dose level and the cumulative&#xD;
      safety data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject experiences a DLT, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled at that dose level for&#xD;
      a total of 6 subjects in that cohort. If no additional DLTs are observed, dose escalation&#xD;
      will resume. However, if 2 or more of 6 subjects within a cohort experience a DLT, that dose&#xD;
      will be considered to exceed the MTD. The MTD will then be defined at the next lower dose&#xD;
      level whereby 6 subjects were treated and &lt; 1 subject experienced a DLT. The maximum dose of&#xD;
      TH-302 will be 575 mg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MTD will be based on toxicities occurring during the first cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TH-302 will be administered by IV infusion over 30-60 minutes on Days 8, 15 and 22 of a&#xD;
      42-day cycle (6 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of sunitinib will remain fixed: 50 mg administered PO daily on days 1 to 28 day of a&#xD;
      42-day cycle (6 weeks). On days when both sunitinib and TH-302 are administered, sunitinib&#xD;
      should be administered at least 2 hours before or at least 2 hours after completion of the&#xD;
      TH-302 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD from Part A has been determined, Part B can commence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial dose of TH-302 will be one dose level higher than the MTD established in Part A.&#xD;
      The dose of TH-302 will be escalated in cohorts of 3-6 subjects. A Dose Level at the MTD&#xD;
      established in Part A will be built into the study in the event that subjects experience&#xD;
      excessive toxicity at the initial dose. Dose escalation will continue with approximately 40%&#xD;
      increases from the previous dose level; however lower dose increases of 20-39% may be&#xD;
      implemented after consultation between the Investigators, Medical Monitor and Sponsor with&#xD;
      the percent increase dependent on the current dose level and the cumulative safety data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject experiences a DLT, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled at that dose level for&#xD;
      a total of 6 subjects in that cohort. If no additional DLTs are observed, dose escalation&#xD;
      will resume. However, if 2 or more of 6 subjects within a cohort experience a DLT, that dose&#xD;
      will be considered to exceed the MTD. The MTD will then be defined at the next lower dose&#xD;
      level whereby 6 subjects were treated and &lt; 1 subject experienced a DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MTD will be based on toxicities occurring during the first cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TH-302 will be administered by IV infusion over 30-60 minutes on Days 8, 15 and 22 of a&#xD;
      42-day cycle (6 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of sunitinib will remain fixed: 37.5 mg administered PO daily on days 1 to 28 of a&#xD;
      42-day cycle (6 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days when both sunitinib and TH-302 are administered, sunitinib should be administered at&#xD;
      least 2 hours before or at least 2 hours after completion of the TH-302 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional 10 RCC subjects will be enrolled at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the&#xD;
      dose expansion portion of the study.&#xD;
