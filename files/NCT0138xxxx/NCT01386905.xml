  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of the TransPyloric Shuttle™ (TPS™)&#xD;
      when used to treat obesity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of people who are overweight or obese has been steadily rising. In Australia, in&#xD;
      1980, 8.3% of the population was considered obese. By 2010, the Australian obesity rate had&#xD;
      risen to 24.8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight loss significantly decreases early mortality as well as the development of new&#xD;
      health-related conditions in obese subjects, and can improve many of the co-morbidities&#xD;
      associated with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapies include drugs, surgery and treatment with medical devices, such as gastric banding&#xD;
      and intragastric balloons. The TransPyloric Shuttle™ (TPS™) is a medical device that is&#xD;
      endoscopically delivered and removed from the stomach. The TPS™ is designed to self-position&#xD;
      across the pylorus and create an intermittent obstruction to outflow that may result in&#xD;
      delayed gastric emptying. Slowing gastric emptying may enable an overall reduction in caloric&#xD;
      intake by helping the subject feel full sooner (early satiation) and/or feel full longer&#xD;
      (prolonged satiety/reduced hunger).&#xD;
