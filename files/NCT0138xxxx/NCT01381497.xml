  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine headaches lead to absenteeism and can restrict on-the-job productivity&#xD;
      (presenteeism) for employed migraine sufferers. Effective migraine treatments should reduce&#xD;
      migraine-associated productivity losses and return migraineurs to normal functioning within a&#xD;
      few hours of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an observational, multicenter, parallel-group study of employed patients who&#xD;
      have been prescribed either a combination product containing sumatriptan and naproxen sodium&#xD;
      (SumaRT/Nap) or oral triptan monotherapy to treat acute migraine attacks. The study will&#xD;
      report results from 4 migraine attacks per patient. Eligible migraine attacks will be defined&#xD;
      as those preceded by a 24-hour, headache-free period with onset between 2 hours prior to the&#xD;
      start of and 4 hours before the end of a scheduled work shift. Data will be collected at time&#xD;
      of treatment and hourly until the end of the attack or the end of the workday. To estimate&#xD;
      baseline productivity, data will be collected from 50 randomly selected subjects during a&#xD;
      migraine-free workday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare migraine-related, work productivity losses&#xD;
      (absenteeism and presenteeism) reported by patients treated with SumaRT/Nap to losses&#xD;
      reported by patients treated with triptan monotherapy. The null hypothesis is that no&#xD;
      difference will be observed between the number of hours of productivity lost for patients who&#xD;
      treat workday migraine attacks with SumaRT/Nap and patients who treat migraine attacks with&#xD;
      an oral triptan alone. The alternative hypotheses are that patients in either treatment group&#xD;
      experience significantly fewer hours of lost productivity associated with migraine compared&#xD;
      to patients in the other treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to measure the time between treatment and return&#xD;
      to patient-reported, normal functioning; to evaluate rescue medication use after initial&#xD;
      treatment; to measure total productivity loss following treatment at hourly time points; and&#xD;
      to estimate the probability of absenteeism when a migraine begins before or during the&#xD;
      workday. The null hypotheses for the secondary endpoints are that no differences will be&#xD;
      observed between the results reported by patients treating with SumaRT/Nap and patients&#xD;
      treating with triptan monotherapy. The alternative hypotheses are that either treatment is&#xD;
      superior to the other for each endpoint.&#xD;

    <measure>Total Lost Productivity (absenteeism and presenteeism) measured by Lost Time Equivalents</measure>
    <time_frame>Four qualifying migraine attacks must occur within 16 weeks of enrollment. Data collection begins at time of treatment and continues in hourly intervals until the end of the migraine attack or the end of the workday.</time_frame>
    <description>Lost Time Equivalents = hours missed from work + [(100% - % effectiveness while working with symptoms)/100 x hours working with symptoms].</description>

    <measure>Percentage of patients returning to normal functioning as measured by the Clinical Disability Questionnaire (CDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of treatment for a qualifying attack and at hourly intervals post treatment until end of migraine attack or end of workday</time_frame>
    <description>The CDQ uses one question to assess ability to perform normal or usual activities. Responses are recorded on a 5-point scale, where 1 is &quot;normal/not impaired&quot;, 2 is &quot;mildly impaired&quot;, 3 is &quot;moderately impaired&quot;, 4 is &quot;severely impaired&quot;, and 5 is '&quot;required bedrest&quot;. Normal functioning is considered a score of &quot;1&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rescue medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Rescue medication is prohibited within 2 hours of study treatment administration. Rescue medication use is measured between 2 and 4 hours post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>For patients who need pain relief in addition to the study treatment, rescue medication is allowed and measured. Type of rescue medication will be allowed at the discretion of the investigator and within the guidelines of the package insert for the study medication</description>
