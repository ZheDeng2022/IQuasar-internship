    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of oral amoxicillin in&#xD;
      treating WHO defined severe pneumonia(cough and fast breathing with lower chest indrawing) at&#xD;
      home and at hospital using an open labelled multicentric prospective two-arm randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial to determine the differences in failure of treatment with a 7 day course of&#xD;
      oral amoxicillin administered for first 48 hours in the hospital in comparison to being sent&#xD;
      home after enrolment, in children 3 to 59 months old who have severe pneumonia. The&#xD;
      investigators developmental hypothesis were to test whether the community/home based oral&#xD;
      amoxicillin is efficacious for treating severe pneumonia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objectives of this trial are to assess the rates of treatment failure (as defined&#xD;
      below) within the first 7 days or efficacy of a 7 day course of oral amoxycillin when&#xD;
      administered at home in comparison to administration of oral amoxycillin for first 48 hours&#xD;
      in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment failure is defined as follows-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical deterioration of disease any time after enrollment: developing any sign of very&#xD;
           severe disease such as persistent vomiting (vomiting repeated thrice within an hour due&#xD;
           to any reason), central cyanosis, grunt, stridor, abnormally sleepy or difficult to&#xD;
           wake, inability to drink, convulsions, or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change of antibiotic: due to persistent vomiting (vomiting of amoxycillin within 20&#xD;
           minutes of administration; 3 such attempts), or, developing a co-morbid condition, or&#xD;
           persisting fever &gt; 98.6Â°F with lower chest indrawing even after 3rd day, or, fever alone&#xD;
           at or after day 5, or, lower chest indrawing alone (non responsive to three doses of&#xD;
           nebulization with bronchodilator) at or after day 5(as reported by the mother), or,&#xD;
           persistence of fast breathing after day 7 which is non responsive to three doses of&#xD;
           nebulisation with bronchodilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization: any time in home managed patients or clinical decision to extend the&#xD;
           hospitalization longer than 48 hours in hospitalized children or re-hospitalization in&#xD;
           those discharged after 48 hours from hospital. It could be related to pneumonia, or to&#xD;
           therapy with amoxycillin [relatedness determined by the Data &amp; Safety Monitoring Board&#xD;
           (DSMB)].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children who need to restart antibiotics i.e. &quot;failure of treatment&quot;, between day 8th&#xD;
           and day 14th due to reappearance of any danger signs, lower chest indrawing or fast&#xD;
           breathing which is non responsive to three trials of nebulization with bronchodilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious adverse event considered possibly or probably related to amoxycillin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Left against medical advice (LAMA) or Voluntary withdrawal of consent from study from&#xD;
           enrollment uptill day 14th.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss to follow up uptill day 14th.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of this trial are to determine in children receiving oral amoxycillin&#xD;
      for severe pneumonia, the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the proportion of children who need to restart antibiotics i.e. &quot;failure of&#xD;
           treatment&quot;, between day 8th and day 14th due to reappearance of any danger signs, lower&#xD;
           chest indrawing or fast breathing which is non responsive to three trials of&#xD;
           nebulization with bronchodilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify clinical predictors at baseline and during the course of treatment that&#xD;
           predicts &quot;failure of oral treatment&quot;, from enrollment till day 14th.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The costs of home and hospital management of severe pneumonia with oral amoxycillin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Left against medical advice (LAMA) or Voluntary withdrawal of consent from day 7th to&#xD;
           day 14th.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss to follow up from day 8th to day 14th.&#xD;
