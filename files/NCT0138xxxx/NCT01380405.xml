    <textblock>
      Given the importance of the correct use of inhalers by patients with Chronic Obstructive&#xD;
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD) for the appropriate treatment of the disease, the self-care&#xD;
      programme which will be assessed will consist of an educational intervention on the correct&#xD;
      use of inhalers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this aim, we have designed this study to assess the influence of both individualized and&#xD;
      collective self care programmes about the correct use of inhalers improves the functional&#xD;
      state of patients with COPD compared to when there is no educational intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the key aspects for treating COPD is therapy with inhalation devices. Regarding the&#xD;
      correct use of these devices, the international evidence showing that inhalers are not&#xD;
      properly used, and in Spain, to the point that the inhaled therapy will fail if it is not&#xD;
      accompanied by health education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recent studies touch upon the importance of nurses, physicians and other medical staff&#xD;
      teaching the correct use of the inhaler. Apart from education, other factors play an&#xD;
      important role when it comes to using the inhaler correctly: sex, age, level of education,&#xD;
      polymedicated patients who use several kinds of devices, patients who are not aware of their&#xD;
      disease and, finally, what is called therapeutic non-fulfillment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first report of the effectiveness of a self care programme aimed at the acquisition of&#xD;
      self care abilities and behavior change was by Worth. Unfortunately this pilot study was not&#xD;
      controlled and only studied a small sample of patients with COPD. There were impressive&#xD;
      reductions in the frequency of irritations and house visits by the GP, but no changes in&#xD;
      pulmonary function were found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical trials have been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of education&#xD;
      programmes and self care in COPD. In the Cochrane revision (up-date 2007), no conclusions&#xD;
      could be drawn about the effectiveness of self-control due to the great diversity of&#xD;
      variables measured in the few studies published. Based on the antecedents presented, it is&#xD;
      evident that COPD is a disease which is difficult to control in daily clinical practice, and&#xD;
      that this inadequate control has a significant impact not only on the health of the patient&#xD;
      who has this disease, but also on society and the economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the control of COPD, the Primary Care physician needs simple and fast intervention&#xD;
      to allow him or her to objectively improve the level of control of the disease that these&#xD;
      patients have. The objective of self care is to teach patients the necessary aptitudes to&#xD;
      carry out specific medical regimes for the treatment of COPD, to guide patients in how to&#xD;
      have healthy habits and to lend emotional support to patients to help control their disease&#xD;
