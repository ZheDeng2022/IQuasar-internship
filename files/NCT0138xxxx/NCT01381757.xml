      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Tuberculosis (TB) is an infection of the lungs caused by bacteria. In Mali, TB is diagnosed&#xD;
      with a test that is fast and inexpensive but not always accurate. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to test a new method for diagnosing TB, called the microscopic-observation&#xD;
      drug-susceptibility (MODS) test. The MODS test takes 7 days to show results. The test also&#xD;
      gives information on which drugs will work best in each case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To test a new method for diagnosing tuberculosis called the microscopic observation drug&#xD;
      susceptibility test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be 12 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They must have a diagnosis of TB from a sputum smear, or have symptoms of TB and an&#xD;
           x-ray indicating that TB is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take part in the study from 6 months to 21 months and be assigned to&#xD;
           one of three groups, depending on what type of TB they have.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit, researchers ask questions about general health and symptoms of TB.&#xD;
           They check vital signs, draw blood, and ask for a sputum sample. The blood is used to&#xD;
           check for HIV infection and for the number of CD4 cells, which measures the severity of&#xD;
           the HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 2-, 5-, and 6-month visits are similar to the first. Those who do not have&#xD;
           multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB will end their participation after the 6-month visit. MDR&#xD;
           TB is tuberculosis that has not responded to isoniazid and rifampicin. Participants with&#xD;
           MDR TB will remain in the study for 21 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment is provided as part of this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one-third of the world s population is infected with tuberculosis (TB), and&#xD;
      over 1 million deaths occur annually worldwide because of it (1,2). Accurate diagnosis and TB&#xD;
      drug susceptibility testing is necessary to treat the infection appropriately and bring this&#xD;
      epidemic under control. Inappropriate treatment of TB, on the other hand, has led to the&#xD;
      recent spread in multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), estimated to affect over half of million&#xD;
      people worldwide (2,4,5). Sputum smear microscopy, the diagnostic method commonly used in&#xD;
      developing countries, is not as sensitive at detecting TB as culture-based techniques&#xD;
      utilized in developed countries. Furthermore, drug-susceptibility testing is not routinely&#xD;
      performed in resource-limited settings. Consequently, many individuals with TB in developing&#xD;
      countries are treated with inadequate regimens, and MDR-TB continues to spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microscopic-observation drug-sensitivity (MODS) assay has been recently developed for&#xD;
      rapid diagnosis of TB and simultaneous detection of resistance to first-line TB medications&#xD;
      in resource-limited settings (11). MODS has been shown to be as sensitive as traditional&#xD;
      culturebased methods for the detection of TB, providing results for drug susceptibility&#xD;
      testing that are highly concordant with standard techniques (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to study the utility of the MODS assay for the diagnosis of TB in subjects who are&#xD;
      sputum-smear positive or sputum-smear negative, and those with chronic TB. Susceptibility&#xD;
      testing will be performed for first-line antituberculous drugs and, subsequently, second-line&#xD;
      drugs, if subjects are found to have MDR-TB. The first primary objective is to calculate the&#xD;
      sensitivity of detection of the MODS assay, compared with the Middlebrook culture method, in&#xD;
      subjects suspected of having TB who are sputum-smear positive by microscopy. The second&#xD;
      primary objective is to calculate the concordance of drug-susceptibility testing between the&#xD;
      MODS assay and the agar proportion method for subjects who are sputum-smear positive,&#xD;
      sputum-smear negative, or diagnosed with chronic TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include evaluating the utility of the MODS assay in the diagnosis of TB&#xD;
      in subjects who are sputum-smear negative and those with chronic TB, the performance of&#xD;
      second-line drug-susceptibility testing using the MODS assay in subjects diagnosed with&#xD;
      MDRTB, the utility of the MODS assay in the diagnosis of TB in subjects coinfected with human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or -2, and the ability of the MODS assay to identify&#xD;
      nontuberculous mycobacteria in subjects harboring these organisms.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals (12 years of age) who meet the following criteria are eligible for enrollment&#xD;
        in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have a sputum smear that is positive for acid-fast bacilli by microscopy or have clinical&#xD;
        symptoms and abnormal findings compatible with active TB on a previously performed chest&#xD;
        radiograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have either completed at least 5 months of treatment with antituberculous therapy within&#xD;
        the past year or have not received any antituberculous treatment in the preceding 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Willingness to provide a sputum sample for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to follow verbal instructions for producing sputum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Willingness to undergo testing for HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Willingness to allow storage of samples for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible for enrollment in the&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any condition that in the investigator s opinion places the subject at undue risk by&#xD;
        participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects younger than 12 years of age will be excluded from the study due to the difficulty&#xD;
        of obtaining adequate sputum samples for the diagnosis of TB in this population and because&#xD;
        there are no means for obtaining gastric aspirates at the reference centers.&#xD;
