      This is a non-therapeutic study. Pediatric AML patients undergoing HCT with a myeloablative&#xD;
      preparative regimen may be enrolled. Subjects can be enrolled 10-40 days prior to HCT. Three&#xD;
      samples for MRD (measured by WT1 PCR and flow cytometry) will be collected from peripheral&#xD;
      blood and bone marrow: 1) pre-HCT (&lt;3 weeks prior to starting the preparative regimen), 2)&#xD;
      day 42 +/- 14 days post HCT (early post-engraftment), and 3) day 100 (+/-20 days) post HCT.&#xD;
      For two years after transplant, the subject's follow-up data will be collected using the&#xD;
      Research Level Forms in the CIBMTR Forms Net internet data entry system. The main objective&#xD;
      is to determine whether there is any association between level of pre-transplant and&#xD;
      post-transplant bone marrow MRD using WT1 and flow cytometry with 2-year event-free-survival,&#xD;
      and to estimate the strength of that association in terms of the predictive accuracy of MRD.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that measurable MRD at either time point will be associated&#xD;
      with decreased 2-year event-free survival.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-therapeutic study, assessing the significance of minimal residual&#xD;
      disease (MRD) at three different time points in relation to allogeneic HCT for pediatric AML.&#xD;
      The study is a collaboration between the Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortium&#xD;
      (PBMTC) and the Resource for Clinical Investigations in Blood and Marrow Transplantation&#xD;
      (RCI-BMT) of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). The&#xD;
      study will enroll pediatric AML patients who undergo myeloablative HCT at PBMTC sites. The&#xD;
      eligibility criteria for this non-therapeutic study mirror widely accepted criteria for&#xD;
      allogeneic HCT in pediatric AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study tests the hypothesis that assessment of pre-transplant and post-transplant MRD&#xD;
      predicts 2-year outcomes following transplant. Two MRD methodologies are being studied: flow&#xD;
      cytometry and WT1 PCR. The secondary hypothesis is that combining these 2 methodologies will&#xD;
      improve the accuracy in predicting 2-year outcomes following transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well established that the level of minimal residual disease (MRD) during chemotherapy&#xD;
      is a strong predictor of relapse in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [33,&#xD;
      34]. Within this population, MRD levels have the potential to predict those patients who will&#xD;
      respond well to standard therapy, thus allowing clinicians to tailor therapy and minimize&#xD;
      toxicity while ensuring maximal cure rates [10]. MRD levels before allogeneic hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation (HCT) also predict the risk of relapse post-HCT [25], leading to&#xD;
      the clinical practice of reducing MRD levels as much as possible before transplant. By&#xD;
      contrast, in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the prognostic value of MRD levels&#xD;
      prior to HCT remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long-term objective is to improve the cure rate for children with AML. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that MRD levels before HCT will provide a powerful tool to select the best&#xD;
      candidates for transplant, guide decision making in stem cell source and preparative therapy,&#xD;
      and optimize the timing of the transplant. Measurements of MRD post-HCT will allow informed&#xD;
      decisions about withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy, administration of donor lymphocyte&#xD;
      infusions, or alternative targeted therapies.&#xD;
