  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is set out to find a human model for negative symptoms based on&#xD;
      clinical observation that chronic cannabis users express negative symptoms and characterize&#xD;
      by the same neurocognitive and electrophysiology characteristics like patient suffer from&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Towards that end the first part of the study is set out to explore weather&#xD;
      chronic cannabis user's express negative symptoms similar to patient suffer from&#xD;
      schizophrenia. The second part of the study will explore the neurocognitive and&#xD;
      electrophysiology characteristics of those cannabis users that express negative symptoms.&#xD;
      This data will be compared to parallel data of schizophrenia patients with predominantly&#xD;
      negative symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several lines of biological and genetic evidence support the cannabinoid hypothesis for&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Particularly, it is most significant clinically that the possible involvement&#xD;
      of the cannabinoid system in the neural basis for the negative symptoms. This hypothesis&#xD;
      based on clinical findings that chronic cannabis use causes a combination of symptoms&#xD;
      including apathy, avolition, lack of interest, passivity, and cognitive impairments, the&#xD;
      so-called &quot;amotivational syndrome,&quot; which resembles the core negative symptoms of&#xD;
      schizophrenia in behavioral level as well as the brain level. Both are associated with the&#xD;
      functions or integrity of the frontal lobe due to its role in creating self-directed&#xD;
      behaviors, deficits in which may underlie alogia, anhedonia, and flat affect. Despite the&#xD;
      aforementioned similarities, to date, there is no documentation for such a relationship.&#xD;
      Recognition that chronic cannabis users share the same or similar constellation of symptoms&#xD;
      and similar neurocognitive and electrophysiology characteristics could provide a key to&#xD;
      develop a human model for negative symptoms and an essential tool to comprehensive&#xD;
      understanding of the etiology of negative symptoms and development of an innovative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators Hypothesize That Chronic Cannabis Users Would Express the Same&#xD;
      Constellation of Behaviors as Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia; as well as similar&#xD;
      neurocognitive and electrophysiology characteristics&#xD;
