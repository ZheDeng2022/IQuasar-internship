  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian toxicity is a well-described side effect of traditional chemotherapy in premenopausal&#xD;
      women receiving treatment for early stage breast cancer. However, the impact of long-term&#xD;
      endocrine therapy on ovarian function is not established, and to our knowledge, has never&#xD;
      been directly studied. Understanding the effects of hormone therapy on ovarian aging will&#xD;
      help breast cancer patients of reproductive age make more informed and empowered decisions&#xD;
      regarding their treatment. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between&#xD;
      tamoxifen therapy and ovarian aging. Patients will be identified through the UCSF Cancer&#xD;
      Registry and California Pacific Medical Center Cancer Registry and will be evaluated based on&#xD;
      age and menopausal status. Women who read about the study from clinicaltrials.gov and contact&#xD;
      the study coordinator will also be considered for enrollment. The age of menopause onset will&#xD;
      be assessed through surveys and will be compared to the accepted national average age of&#xD;
      natural menopause. Biomarkers of ovarian reserve will be assessed in premenopausal women&#xD;
      between ages 25-45 and will be compared to those of healthy age- and ethnicity-matched&#xD;
      premenopausal controls from an ongoing RO1- funded prospective longitudinal ovarian aging&#xD;
      (OVA) study.&#xD;

    <description>The primary aim of this study is to determine the mean age of menopause onset in a cohort of women who have completed a course of tamoxifen therapy and to compare this age with the accepted national average age of natural menopause. Age of menopause onset which is defined as the year of the last menstrual period minus patient's birth year.</description>

    <description>A secondary aim is to compare biomarkers of ovarian reserve in premenopausal women between ages 25-45 who have been previously treated with tamoxifen with those of age- and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. The primary biomarker of interest is antral follicle count (AFC). Other biomarkers that will be measured include anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), inhibin B, FSH, and estradiol levels.</description>

      Serum AMH, FSH, estradiol, and Inhibin B will be measured. Blood will be collected and&#xD;
      processed by the UCSF Center for Reproductive Health. Serum samples will be stored at -80oC&#xD;
      in a designated freezer with an alarm system. Biomarker assessments will be performed by&#xD;
