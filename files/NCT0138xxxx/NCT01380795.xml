  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The knowledge concerning the biology of the human tumors do not stop widening, in particular&#xD;
      concerning the molecular mechanisms at the origin of the process of carcinogenesis and its&#xD;
      ability to become perpetual. The identification and the increasing knowledge of these&#xD;
      abnormalities allowed during these last years the development of therapeutic strategies&#xD;
      targeting specifically the molecular pathways involved in the carcinogenesis. It quickly lead&#xD;
      to numerous therapeutic successes in association with conventional chemotherapy, allowing a&#xD;
      better individualization of the treatment according to the biological characteristics of the&#xD;
      tumor of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However such therapeutics are effective only if the patients carries specific genomic&#xD;
      mutations making necessary the systematic research for one kind of mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problem is that currently the mutational status is frequently made on the tissue&#xD;
      resulting from the initial tumor biopsy, and as it is not excluded that the evolution of the&#xD;
      biology of the metastasis reports a different genomic status, the only theoretical solution&#xD;
      is then to make biopsy systematically on metastasis, what is not always technically possible.&#xD;
      The problem still complicates when the investigators know that the biology of the tumor may&#xD;
      evolve in time, particularly under treatment, with appearance of chemotherapy resistant&#xD;
      clones. The monitoring of the genomic status of the tumor thus appears to be a crucial stake&#xD;
      in the next years in cancer research as far as the efficiency of numerous therapeutic&#xD;
      targeted put at the disposal of the clinician, depends on it largely. The repeated access to&#xD;
      tumor tissue, during the follow-up of the patient in treatment, seems from then on&#xD;
      indispensable to guide prematurely the therapeutics, in particular by stopping a targeted&#xD;
      therapeutics which the investigators know that it is not any more going to be effective, and&#xD;
      so avoiding exposing the patient to useless toxicity of a treatment often extremely&#xD;
      expensive, and of which usage should have to be reserved to patient who could respond to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The access to the circulating tumor cells in the blood of patients is a repeatable, not&#xD;
      invasive technique (blood test) and henceforth accessible thanks to a technique using a&#xD;
      magnetic sorting of the tumor cells selected by an antibody directed against the tumor&#xD;
      antigen EpCAM. This new technology (CellSearch, Veridex system) totally standardized and&#xD;
      automated, allows from a total sample of blood of the patient, to determine the quantity of&#xD;
      circulating tumor cells (CTC).The number of CTC seems to constitute in recent studies, a&#xD;
      powerful prognosis tool at the moment diagnosis, but also during treatment, according to its&#xD;
      decrease or not under chemotherapy. In United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      recently approved the use of this system for the quantification of the CTCs in the care of&#xD;
      the patients affected by breast, colon, and prostate cancer. The CellSearch system will&#xD;
      probably become in the future years an indispensable tool to help the clinicians to encircle&#xD;
      better the prognosis of their patient. This technology already allows to realize besides a&#xD;
      quantification, the isolation of viable CTCs, from which the genetic material can be&#xD;
      extracted, amplified thus potentially analyzed. The investigators thus see all the interest&#xD;
      which such a device can represent in the non invasive monitoring of the patients under&#xD;
      treatment targeting molecular abnormality susceptible to evolve in time. The investigators&#xD;
      thus propose to study thanks to the system CellSearch the feasibility of the research for the&#xD;
      mutation of K-Ras and EGFR in the CTC of patients carriers of a metastatic non small cells&#xD;
      bronchial carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, the investigators research will be interested in the possible conflicts existing&#xD;
      between the primitive tumor and the CTCs for the various popular mutations. In case of&#xD;
      feasibility of the method, and the good initial concordance between the genomic status of the&#xD;
      CTCs and that of the tumor, the investigators shall describe the genomic evolution under&#xD;
      treatment monitoring the CTCs of the patients under targeted therapeutics. The investigators&#xD;
      shall describe then if the premature observation of modification precedes the appearance of&#xD;
      an effective resistance in treatments.&#xD;
