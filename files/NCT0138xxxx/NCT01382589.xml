  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether afamelanotide and narrow band UVB are&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo (NSV).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigational product, afamelanotide, is a synthetic analogue of the human alpha&#xD;
      melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). The earliest described function of alpha-MSH is&#xD;
      its ability to stimulate melanin synthesis in the skin and therefore stimulate pigmentation.&#xD;
      Vitiligo is the most common depigmentation disorder. Interventions in the treatment of&#xD;
      vitiligo include phototherapy with narrow-band (NB) ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation (NB-UVB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to look at the efficacy of afamelanotide, when combined with&#xD;
      narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) light, in patients with nonsegmental vitiligo.&#xD;
      Afamelanotide is expected to speed up the repigmentation induced by NB-UVB light, leading to&#xD;
      reducing frequency and doses of NB-UVB.&#xD;
