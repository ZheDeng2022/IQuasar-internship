      A research study to learn about the biologic features of cancer development, growth, and&#xD;
      spread. We are studying components of blood, tumor tissue, normal tissue, and other fluids,&#xD;
      such as urine, cerebrospinal fluid, abdominal or chest fluid in patients with cancer. Our&#xD;
      analyses of blood, tissue, and/or fluids may lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      cancer by the identification of markers that predict clinical outcome, markers that predict&#xD;
      response to specific therapies, and the identification of targets for new therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, an estimated 222,520 lung and bronchus cancers will be diagnosed in&#xD;
      2010, and 157,300 people will die of this disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need for&#xD;
      safer and more effective therapies for lung cancer.1 Lung cancer falls into two major&#xD;
      classifications, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) which accounts for approximately 87%, and&#xD;
      small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which accounts for the remainder. Thymomas are the most common&#xD;
      tumors of the anterior mediastinum, and typically occur in adults older than 40 years. While&#xD;
      surgical resection and radiation often effectively treat these tumors, a minority continue to&#xD;
      progress and eventually lead to death. Thymic carcinomas are a related subset of tumors that&#xD;
      more often metastasize and are more aggressive. Finally, mesothelioma often behaves as&#xD;
      aggressively as lung cancer, and is not frequently amenable to curative resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the role of molecular alterations has yet to be defined in the treatment of SCLC,&#xD;
      thymoma, and mesothelioma, there is an increasing recognition that molecular alterations in&#xD;
      NSCLC are important predictors of response to novel targeted therapies. Small molecule&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling&#xD;
      pathway, such as erlotinib and gefitinib, improve survival in the second-line treatment of&#xD;
      unselected patients with NSCLC. However, retrospective subgroup analysis of these clinical&#xD;
      trials has revealed that patients with particular clinical features were more likely to&#xD;
      benefit from therapy, such as those with tumors of adenocarcinoma histology, women, Asian&#xD;
      ethnicity, and light or never smokers. Conventional Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing of&#xD;
      tumors from multiple series of patients that had dramatic responses to gefitinib, as compared&#xD;
      with patients without responses, revealed the presence of characteristic genetic mutations in&#xD;
      the EGFR gene.4-6 The previously identified clinical markers of response to EGFR TKIs were&#xD;
      found to be commonly associated with the presence of these mutations; thus, these clinical&#xD;
      features are actually believed to be surrogates for the molecular biomarker of EGFR mutation.&#xD;
      Over 90% of EGFR tyrosine kinase domain mutations associated with sensitivity to EGFR&#xD;
      Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy fall into two categories, in-frame deletions in exon&#xD;
      19, and the L858R point mutation in exon 21. These mutations appear to specifically activate&#xD;
      both cell proliferation, via activation of the MAP kinase pathway, and survival signals, via&#xD;
      activation of the PI3 kinase pathway.7 Therefore, tumors with EGFR mutations are &quot;oncogene&#xD;
      addicted&quot; to EGFR survival signals, relying exclusively upon the EGFR signaling cascade to&#xD;
      maintain viability, which explains their exquisite sensitivity to TKI therapy. A number of&#xD;
      recent large randomized studies have conclusively demonstrated that clinical selection of&#xD;
      patients alone is inadequate, and instead establish EGFR mutation status as the single most&#xD;
      important predictive marker of response to EGFR-TKI therapy.8-10 In another emerging but&#xD;
      similar story, genetic fusion of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase to a&#xD;
      partner protein, EML4, appears to strongly predict sensitivity to the ALK TKI, crizotinib. 11&#xD;
      In addition, there is evidence that less common mutations in NSCLC, such as BRAF mutations&#xD;
      and ERBB2 (e.g. HER2) mutations, may also predict response to targeted therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, identification of genetic alterations in NSCLC is increasingly essential for&#xD;
      individualizing treatments and performing molecular diagnostics. While the investigators do&#xD;
      not anticipate benefits to individual patients, identification of molecular alterations in&#xD;
      small cell lung cancer, thymic malignancies, and mesothelioma may provide similar keys to the&#xD;
      utilization of novel therapies. This project aims to create a registry of patients and tumors&#xD;
      to further the characterization of molecular alterations in thoracic malignancies and develop&#xD;
      markers of early detection.&#xD;
