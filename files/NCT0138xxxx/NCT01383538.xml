      The purpose of this phase I study to determine the optimal dose for the combination of&#xD;
      IPI-926 plus FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, Leucovorin, Irinotecan, and Oxaliplatin)&#xD;
      chemotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents the fourth leading cause of cancer-related&#xD;
      mortality in the United States, with an estimated 36,800 deaths attributable to PDAC in&#xD;
      2010.(1) Over 90% of patients have inoperable disease at presentation, at which point&#xD;
      systemic therapy becomes the primary form of treatment. Single agent gemcitabine became the&#xD;
      standard of care for advanced pancreatic cancer a decade ago since demonstrating improved&#xD;
      survival when compared with fluorouracil. Since then, a number of phase III trials have&#xD;
      evaluated the benefit of adding additional cytotoxic or targeted agents to gemcitabine, as&#xD;
      shown in the table below. The PA.3 trial(2), which led to the approval of erlotinib in&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic cancer, was a landmark study in that it represented the first positive&#xD;
      phase III study of a combination regimen for this disease indication; however, while&#xD;
      erlotinib represents both an important proof of principle and a welcome addition to our&#xD;
      therapeutic armamentarium, it has failed to gain significant traction in this disease, as&#xD;
      many in the oncology community consider the marginal absolute improvement in median overall&#xD;
      survival to be of questionable clinical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLFIRINOX: A new standard of care for advanced PDAC? At the 2010 American Society of&#xD;
      Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting (ASCO), a French cooperative group presented results of a&#xD;
      potentially practice-changing phase III clinical trial (PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11).(18) In this&#xD;
      study, 342 patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer were randomized to&#xD;
      receive either gemcitabine monotherapy or the combination of biweekly infusional&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) (ref). The investigators&#xD;
      reported statistically significant improvements for the FOLFIRINOX arm in the primary&#xD;
      endpoint, overall survival (median of 11.1 months vs 6.8 months, P &lt; .0001); as well as&#xD;
      1-year survival rate (48.4% vs. 20.6%), median progression-free survival (6.4 vs. 3.3 months;&#xD;
      P &lt; .0001), and objective response rate (CR+PR, 31.6% vs. 9.4%; P = .0001)). Not&#xD;
      surprisingly, the more complex FOLFIRINOX regimen was associated with higher rates of grade&#xD;
      3/4 toxicities, including neutropenia (45.7% vs 18.7%), febrile neutropenia (5.4% vs. 0.6%),&#xD;
      fatigue (23.2% vs. 14.2%), and diarrhea (12.7% vs. 1.2%). Notably, while primary prophylaxis&#xD;
      with growth factor support was not mandated in this trial, 42.5% of patients did ultimately&#xD;
      receive such support. Moreover, most patients enrolled in this trial had non-pancreatic head&#xD;
      tumors (approximately 64%) which is the opposite distribution of what one might expect in a&#xD;
      representative pancreatic cancer population. Thus, it is conceivable that the FOLFIRINOX&#xD;
      regimen, with its high rates of neutropenia, may lead to unacceptable rates of infectious&#xD;
      complications (eg, ascending cholangitis and biliary sepsis), in patients with pancreatic&#xD;
      head tumors with indwelling endobiliary stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, this strikingly positive survival benefit, with a median overall survival&#xD;
      approaching one year in a purely metastatic cohort, has never before been observed in any&#xD;
      previous study, which raises the question of whether FOLFIRINOX should become the newly&#xD;
      adopted standard of care, at least in patients with preserved performance status (patients on&#xD;
      this trial were required to have an ECOG performance score of 0-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HEDGEHOG SIGNALING The Hedgehog(19) signaling pathway is important for normal mammalian&#xD;
      embryonic development and for adult tissue remodeling. Recent reports have demonstrated that&#xD;
      aberrant activation of the Hh pathway is associated with many types of cancer, including&#xD;
      basal cell carcinoma (BCC), medulloblastoma, pancreatic adenocarcinomas, small-cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (SCLC), metastatic prostate cancer, glioma, breast cancer, hepatocellular cancer, and&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies. High levels of Hh pathway activation, either through mutation of&#xD;
      pathway components or through constitutive expression of Hh pathway genes, appear to be&#xD;
      involved in both the initiation of cancer and tumor cell survival, as well as tumor growth&#xD;
      and metastasis. Given the therapeutic potential of Hh pathway inhibition in cancer, Infinity&#xD;
      has developed IPI-926, a potent and specific antagonist of the Hh pathway that binds&#xD;
      Smoothened (Smo), a key signaling transmembrane protein in this pathway, thereby diminishing&#xD;
      downstream promoters of cellular proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pancreatic adenocarcinomas are an ideal tumor class in which to evaluate the activity of a Hh&#xD;
      pathway inhibitor, as multiple lines of evidence support a role for Hedgehog signaling in&#xD;
      pancreatic tumorigenesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aberrant expression of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and its associated signaling components&#xD;
           (patched (PTC) and smoothened (SMO)) are frequently found in pancreatic cancer&#xD;
           specimens.(20-27)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacologic inhibition of hedgehog signaling produces antitumor effects in pancreatic&#xD;
           cancer cell lines27 and orthotopic xenograft models.(28,29) Studies involving global&#xD;
           sequencing analysis have identified this pathway as one of the central elements&#xD;
           undergoing transformation in nearly all pancreatic cancers.(21)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hedgehog signaling may play an important role in maintenance of pancreatic cancer stem&#xD;
           cells.(30-32)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The dense desmoplastic mesenchymal network that constitutes the stroma of pancreatic&#xD;
           adenocarcinomas coupled with poor vascularity may present a major challenge to effective&#xD;
           delivery of intravenous chemotherapy to the bulk of pancreatic tumor cell burden. Recent&#xD;
           evidence in a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer demonstrated that&#xD;
           IPI-926 can deplete tumor-associated stromal tissue and increase intratumoral mean&#xD;
           vessel density, resulting in enhanced delivery of concurrently administered systemic&#xD;
           agents such as gemcitabine, decreased tumor burden, and prolonged survival.(33)&#xD;

             or adequately treated Stage I or II cancer for which treatment was completed more than&#xD;
             one year ago and from which the patient is currently in complete remission; or any&#xD;
             other form of cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years.&#xD;

             thromboembolic event (e.g., pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) requiring&#xD;
             anticoagulation are eligible IF: they are appropriately anticoagulated and have not&#xD;
             had a Grade 2 or greater bleeding episode in the 3 weeks before Day 1. However, as&#xD;
             concurrent/pre-existing use of coumadin is not allowed, only low-molecular heparin&#xD;
