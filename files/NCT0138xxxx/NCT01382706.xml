      This phase II trial studies how well giving docetaxel and lapatinib ditosylate together as&#xD;
      second-line therapy works in treating patients with stage IV bladder cancer that cannot be&#xD;
      removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving docetaxel and lapatinib ditosylate together may kill&#xD;
      more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy of 1250 mg of lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) given in combination&#xD;
      with docetaxel in prolonging progression-free survival of subjects with metastatic,&#xD;
      previously treated transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) relative to historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy of 1250 mg of Lapatinib given in combination with docetaxel in the&#xD;
      objective response rates and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To study the tolerability and safety of 1250 mg of lapatinib given in combination with&#xD;
      docetaxel by assessing the incidence and nature of Grade 3, 4 and serious adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the expression status of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or human&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) in tumor tissue and/or circulating tumor cells&#xD;
      (CTCs) as potential predictors of response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the number of CTC's present in 7.5mLs of peripheral blood as a predictor for&#xD;
      disease progression and response of treatment in bladder cancer in the setting of combination&#xD;
      therapy of lapatinib and docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the effect of lapatinib in human at molecular level by targeting the&#xD;
      phosphorylation activity of the AKT/extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) on pathway prior and&#xD;
      during the treatment with lapatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and lapatinib&#xD;
      ditosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
