      Diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging is a well established method&#xD;
      for detecting acute injury to the brain and is used on all children undergoing an MRI brain&#xD;
      scan at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. The possibility of using DW MRI to study other&#xD;
      areas of the body, such as the spinal cord, has been recognised as having great clinical&#xD;
      potential. However, two main problems have hindered the clinical application of the&#xD;
      technique; firstly, the extreme motion sensitivity of the technique meant that respiratory&#xD;
      motion have hampered clinical studies. Secondly, the close proximity of the spinal cord to&#xD;
      the bones in the spinal column complicates the application of the techniques developed for&#xD;
      the brain to the spine. Recently, several techniques have been developed which address these&#xD;
      problems and these are now available on the MRI scanners used at Children's Healthcare of&#xD;
      Atlanta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We now wish to evaluate how well these techniques work on children in a routine clinical&#xD;
      setting. For this reason we wish to add a single scan of the spine to the imaging protocol of&#xD;
      children receiving a routine scan of the brain or spine. This will permit us to evaluate the&#xD;
      image quality in both normal and abnormal spines. We plan on enrolling 60 patients with&#xD;
      normal spines and 30 patients with abnormal spines. No additional sedation and/or contrast&#xD;
      will be required and the additional imaging time for the diffusion studies will be less than&#xD;
      10 minutes. Parental consent will be a pre-requisite for any patient to be enrolled into the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

      Background and significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging is a well established method&#xD;
      for detecting acute ischaemic injury in the brain and is being increasingly applied to the&#xD;
      study of brain structure and organisation (1,2). The technique provides information on the&#xD;
      motion of water molecules and uses no ionising radiation. The possibility of using DW MRI to&#xD;
      probe neuronal microstructures in highly ordered neuronal systems, such as the spinal cord,&#xD;
      has been recognised as having great clinical potential. However, the combination of&#xD;
      susceptibility artefacts from the surrounding bony structures, motion of the cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid (CSF), carotid and vertebral artery pulsations and respiratory motion have hampered&#xD;
      clinical studies. Recently, several techniques have been developed to address these problems&#xD;
      (3,4) and two of these methods will shortly be available for use at the Scottish Rite campus&#xD;
      of CHOA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to apply DW imaging of the spine to the following groups of patients :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with tethered cords.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with Chiari I malformations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Normal children undergoing a MRI of the spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the studies would be performed on children who have already been referred for a MRI&#xD;
      and the diffusion sequences would be performed after the requested MRI exam is complete. No&#xD;
      additional sedation and/or contrast would be required. Informed consent would be requested&#xD;
      from the parents for all of these studies. The additional imaging time required for the&#xD;
      diffusion studies would be less than 10 minutes. We plan on enrolling 60 patients with normal&#xD;
      spines and 30 patients with abnormal spines in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tethered cord. Tethered spinal cords are a group of complex developmental malformations of&#xD;
      the spinal cord of which the most common cause is children with repaired spina-bifida or&#xD;
      myelomeningocele. Although these are usually operated on shortly after birth, all repaired&#xD;
      myelomeningoceles have some degree of tethering. The basic problem is exacerbated because as&#xD;
      children grow their spinal cords do not grow as quickly as their spinal columns, so the&#xD;
      spinal cord must be able to freely ascend on the inside of the spinal column during growth.&#xD;
      If various abnormal structures are holding onto the spinal cord from below it stretches the&#xD;
      spinal cord, leading to chronic local ischaemia, which can in turn lead to a progressive loss&#xD;
      of function. The signs and symptoms associated with cord tethering are often non-specific and&#xD;
      are poorly understood. Diffusion MRI may be very useful in the monitoring of tethered cords&#xD;
      since initial studies on adults with cervical spondylosis have implied that it is more&#xD;
      sensitive than conventional MRI imaging in depicting pathological changes within the spinal&#xD;
      cord. Hence diffusion MRI has the potential to be a more sensitive method of determining if&#xD;
      the cord is under stress due to tethering and hence in need of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chiari I malformation A Chiari I malformation is a condition characterised by an abnormal&#xD;
      inferior projection of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, into the upper&#xD;
      cervical spinal canal. If the degree of projection is small then the condition is generally&#xD;
      referred to as tonsilar ectopia. Chiari I malformations may be associated with other&#xD;
      anomalies, most commonly hydrosyringomyelia (which in turn can lead to neurologic deficits&#xD;
      and scoliosis) and hydrocephalus. Symptoms of a Chiari I malformation most often begin during&#xD;
      infancy, although they may be delayed until adolescence or adulthood. Symptoms are often&#xD;
      non-specific and usually include headache, vomiting, muscle weakness in the head and face,&#xD;
      difficulty swallowing, and varying degrees of mental impairment. Paresis or paralysis of the&#xD;
      arms and legs may also occur. As they grow older, adolescents and adults with Chiari I&#xD;
      malformation who previously were asymptomatic may show signs of progressive brain impairment,&#xD;
      such as involuntary, rapid, downward eye movements. The pathophysiology of syrinx development&#xD;
      (hydrosyringomyelia) is understood to be a state of chronic interstitial edema of the spinal&#xD;
      cord due to an accumulation of extracellular fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diagnosis of Chiari I malformation is generally made using a conventional MRI scan and is&#xD;
      often an incidental finding during an evaluation of other abnormalities, making an&#xD;
      interpretation of the significance of the imaging findings difficult. Patients that have&#xD;
      symptoms which potentially indicate abnormally positioned tonsils can have normal imaging&#xD;
      findings, tonsilar ectopia or mild Chiari I malformation. In the case that the cerebellar&#xD;
      tonsils are not clearly abnormal, according to our conventional imaging diagnostic criteria,&#xD;
      it can be difficult to determine the cause of the symptoms. They may be caused by the low&#xD;
      tonsils, in which case a surgical decompression would be performed, or they may simply be&#xD;
      incidental findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further problem in determining a strategy for managing patients with a Chiari I&#xD;
      malformation is that the criteria for surgical intervention are nebulous. Some patients are&#xD;
      symptomatic with only a minor degree of tonsillar ectopia and others with severe displacement&#xD;
      of the cerebellar tonsils into the upper spinal canal have no symptoms. Since the correction&#xD;
      of a Chiari I malformation requires surgery it is generally reserved for patients showing&#xD;
      clear evidence of progressive clinical symptoms. Any technique that can provide information&#xD;
      on pathological changes within the spinal cord would be a very important complement to the&#xD;
      clinical data and the anatomical information provided by conventional MRI. At present it is&#xD;
      difficult to predict which patients are predisposed to developing syringomyelia on the basis&#xD;
      of conventional imaging findings alone and DW-MRI may be able to provide useful complementary&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal patients. To date the only information regarding the values for diffusion within the&#xD;
      spinal cord comes from a limited number of studies on normal, adult, volunteers. It is known&#xD;
      that the diffusion properties of the brain vary significantly with age and it is expected&#xD;
      that the diffusion properties of the spine will show a similar variation. Thus, in order to&#xD;
      be able to properly interpret the results of the studies on children with suspected pathology&#xD;
      it is necessary to have a control group in order to allow normal values for different age&#xD;
      ranges to be established.&#xD;
