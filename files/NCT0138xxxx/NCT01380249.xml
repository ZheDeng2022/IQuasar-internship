  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study in adult patients with advanced solid tumours is designed to evaluate&#xD;
      toxicity, drug exposure (pharmacokinetics) and drug action (pharmacodynamics) of a new&#xD;
      molecule, PDM08, administered twice a week cycles of 4 weeks. This drug has shown antitumoral&#xD;
      activity in several murine cancer models.&#xD;

      Phase I study, open, dose escalation, in adult patients with advanced solid tumours, to&#xD;
      evaluate tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ascending PDM08 doses&#xD;
      administered twice a week cycles of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After checking the safety of the first drug doses, a new dose escalation was proposed and&#xD;
      approved by the Ethic Committee and the Medicines Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is carried out in adult patients with advanced solid tumours whose&#xD;
      disease has progressed despite standard therapy, or for which there is no standard&#xD;
      antineoplastic therapy, or are refractory to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pharmacodynamic non clinical studies, PDM08 presented antitumour activity against&#xD;
      different tumour models including, renal, colon, lung, prostate and breast cancer models.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 weeks for each cohort.</time_frame>
    <description>Drug safety will be measured by the number and grade of adverse events, by participant, related to the drug in study (PDM08) in the cohorts studied: 560 μg, 1.12 mg, 2.24 mg, 3.5 mg and 14 mg, 28 mg and 56 mg administered twice a week for four weeks.&#xD;
