      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The blood-brain barrier helps protect the brain from infections and toxins in the blood&#xD;
      stream. But it can also prevent certain drugs from reaching the brain to treat diseases or&#xD;
      other problems. Researchers are interested in chemicals that will help show how the barrier&#xD;
      works. One possible chemical, (18F)FCWAY, may be useful for studying the barrier. More tests&#xD;
      are needed to determine how effective it is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test whether (18F)FCWAY can be used to help study the blood-brain barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study requires a screening visit and two scanning visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also&#xD;
           have blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first scanning visit, participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging scan to&#xD;
           provide baseline images of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the second visit, some participants will stay overnight in the hospital. They&#xD;
           will receive the drug tariquidar, which may help the (18F)FCWAY show the blood-brain&#xD;
           barrier more clearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the second scanning visit, all participants will have a positron emission tomography&#xD;
           scan with (18F)FCWAY to see how well the drug shows the blood-brain barrier on the scan.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We use the radioligand [(11)C]dLop (N-desmethyl-loperamide) in positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET) studies to measure function of P-gp, an efflux transporter at the blood-brain barrier.&#xD;
      Because [(11)C]dLop is an avid substrate for P-gp, we see almost no radioactivity in brain at&#xD;
      baseline in healthy volunteers. However, we do see increased radioactivity in brain in some&#xD;
      patients with dementia, or when we co-administer a medication which blocks the function of&#xD;
      P-gp. While [(11)C]dLop is useful for detecting increased radioactivity in brain, a&#xD;
      disadvantage of [(11)C]dLop is that it is not useful for detecting decreased radioactivity in&#xD;
      brain. The reason for this is that we have a floor effect, where we are unable to detect less&#xD;
      radioactivity than zero. Preclinical studies indicate that increases in P-gp activity (which&#xD;
      would manifest as decreased radioactivity in brain) correlate with drug-resistant epilepsy&#xD;
      and HIV. To better understand diseases associated with not only increased but also decreased&#xD;
      P-gp activity, we wish to identify a radioligand which is a moderate substrate of P-gp. We&#xD;
      suspect that [(18)F]FCWAY is a moderate substrate for P-gp, because some radioligand gets&#xD;
      into brain at baseline, but more gets into brain after administering a drug (disulfiram)&#xD;
      which inhibits P-gp. The objective of this study is to determine whether the serotonin 1A&#xD;
      antagonist [(18)F]FCWAY is a substrate of P-gp by determining whether the P-gp inhibitor,&#xD;
      tariquidar, increases uptake of the radioligand into brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study up to 45 healthy adults, ages 18-50. Participants must be free of medications,&#xD;
      with the exception of birth control pills, as medications may confound our data. or iii&#xD;
      patients who received a single PET scan as stated under i), will be invited back to have the&#xD;
      option of receiving the second PET scan with tariquidar. A maximum of 15 ubjects will receive&#xD;
      both scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults will undergo either 1) a single PET scan of the brain with [(18)F]FCWAY (at&#xD;
      baseline, or during infusion of intravenous tariquidar or 2) two PET scans (both a baseline&#xD;
      and a tariquidar scan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If [(18)F]FCWAY is a substrate of P-gp, pre-treatment with tariquidar will increase its brain&#xD;
      uptake of [(18)F]FCWAY and delay the time of peak uptake.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Subjects must be 18 to 50 years old.&#xD;

        prescription or over-the-counter, one week before and one week after receiving tariquidar.&#xD;

        Subjects must be able and willing to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects routinely taking prescription medications, except birth control pills. That is,&#xD;
        subjects should not discontinue mediations merely to participate in this study.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Head trauma resulting in a period of unconsciousness lasting longer than 10 minutes or a&#xD;
        history of seizures, because seizures may increase the function of P-gp.&#xD;

        study would be above the allowable limits.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Positive urine drug screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Unlikely to tolerate small, enclosed spaces, as in the MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Metallic foreign bodies that would be affected by the MRI magnet or fear of enclosed spaces&#xD;
        likely to make the subject unable to complete an MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Positive HIV status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inability to lie flat on camera bed for about 2 (Omega) hours.&#xD;
