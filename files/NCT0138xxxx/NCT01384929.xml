    <textblock>
      There is scant data on the casemix and practices in Indian intensive care units (ICUs). Most&#xD;
      of the available data comes from single centre studies. There is a dire need to have data&#xD;
      from Indian ICUs to reflect the vast spectrum of critical care illness, services and&#xD;
      practices. INDICAPS planned to collect data of all patients in the ICU on one particular day,&#xD;
      and four such days spread throughout a one-year period were selected: the second Wednesday of&#xD;
      July and October this year, i.e. July 14 and October 13, 2010 and the second Wednesday of&#xD;
      January and April next year, i.e. January 12 and April 13, 2011. As many ICUs all over the&#xD;
      country as possible were asked to participate. The investigators aimed to gather information&#xD;
      about ICUs, patients in ICUs, the types and severity of illness, monitoring and therapeutic&#xD;
      modalities used, types of infections,mortality rates, etc.&#xD;

      The following information will be analysed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case-mix, severity of illness, prevalence of infection, hemodynamic monitoring and therapy,&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation practices, nutrition and outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seasonal and regional variations in the above&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epidemiology and variations in antibiotic use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patterns of microorganisms and outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevalence and outcome of specific tropical febrile illnesses, including malaria, dengue&#xD;
           fever, leptospirosis, scrub typhus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevalence and outcome of toxins and poisonings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relation of ICU and hospital organizational issues to prevalence of infection and&#xD;
           outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Organisation of intensive care services&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End of life - Ethical decisions&#xD;
