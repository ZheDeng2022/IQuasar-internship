      This is a pilot study examining tendon collagen, collagen cross-linking, and markers of&#xD;
      tendon extracellular matrix metabolism in the Achilles tendon of diabetic patients with&#xD;
      ulcerations and amputations of the lower extremity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a pandemic problem with catastrophic effects on the physical, psychological, and&#xD;
      economic lives of patients and their families, and also places a significant burden on the&#xD;
      healthcare system. Changes in the integumentary system lead to plantar foot ulcerations,&#xD;
      which increase the risk of limb amputations and death. Specifically, limitation of ankle&#xD;
      joint dorsiflexion (equinus deformity) has been implicated as a major deforming force in the&#xD;
      development and chronicity of plantar foot ulcerations in the diabetic population. A better&#xD;
      mechanistic understanding of the intrinsic changes in the diabetic Achilles tendon would&#xD;
      assist in explaining and potentially preventing the development of chronic foot ulcerations&#xD;
      due to an equinus deformity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the relationship between limb loss progression and changes seen in&#xD;
      collagen metabolic markers in the diabetic Achilles tendon. This will be assessed by&#xD;
      collecting Achilles tendon samples in subjects who are at various stages of ulcer development&#xD;
      or limb loss and who also demonstrate an equinus deformity. All Achilles tendon samples will&#xD;
      be collected at the time of the Achilles lengthening procedure. There will be five subject&#xD;
      groups consisting of subjects who have been identified with: 1)preulcerative plantar foot&#xD;
      lesion 2)plantar ulceration without a history of amputation or require an amputation 3)&#xD;
      plantar ulceration who will be undergoing a digital amputation 4) plantar ulceration who will&#xD;
      be undergoing a transmetatarsal amputation or 5) plantar ulceration who will be undergoing&#xD;
      Chopart's or more proximal amputation. Further, systemic changes (vasculopathy, peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy, nephropathy) will also be correlated with the above. The independent variables&#xD;
      are the following: 1) collagen metabolic markers and 2)systemic changes. The dependent&#xD;
      variable is limb loss progression assessed categorically (5 groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 5 phases of this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1- Eligibility Assessment. Type I and Type II diabetic patients who present to the&#xD;
           Georgetown University Hospital Limb Salvage Center will be evaluated for inclusion into&#xD;
           our study based on inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2- Interview and examination. Subjects will complete a comprehensive medical&#xD;
           history, physical exam, and blood work (per Standard of Care. The PI or SI will perform&#xD;
           an ankle joint range of motion examination and a Semmes-Weinstein 5.07 monofilament&#xD;
           examination (per Standard of Care. A comprehensive metabolic panel will be ordered&#xD;
           including hemoglobin A1C, BUN, and CR (per Standard of Care). Patients will then be&#xD;
           referred to the vascular surgery department for noninvasive and/or invasive vascular&#xD;
           studies (per standard of care) and patient will be scheduled for surgery at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 3- Surgery and Tissue Collection. Surgery will be performed that may include ulcer&#xD;
           debridement, soft tissue or bone reconstruction, or amputation (per SOC- only patients&#xD;
           who have been identified as demonstrating an equinus deformity and agree to an Achilles&#xD;
           tendon lengthening procedure along with ulcer debridement, or soft tissue or bone&#xD;
           reconstruction, or amputation will be included in this study. Achilles tendon&#xD;
           lengthening is considered an adjunctive SOC procedure in the surgical management of the&#xD;
           diabetic foot). All subjects will have an Achilles tendon lengthening procedure&#xD;
           performed by the primary (PK) or sub-investigators (JS and CA). A tissue sample (20mg)&#xD;
           of the Achilles tendon will be collected at this time. This tissue will be preserved in&#xD;
           a dry ice container and shipped to Midwestern University for processing by the&#xD;
           sub-investigator (CC). The specimens will be labeled numerically with a predetermined&#xD;
           subject number. No patient identifying information will be on these samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 4- Tissue and Data Processing. Assays will be performed on the tissue samples to&#xD;
           measure specific metabolic markers of the diabetic Achilles tendon. Tendon collagen&#xD;
           concentrations will be determined via quantification of the collagen specific amino&#xD;
           acid, hydroxyproline by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and fluorometric&#xD;
           detection. The extent of collagen cross-linking will be determined by measuring the&#xD;
           amount of pyridinium cross-link hydroxylysylpyridinoline will also be assessed though&#xD;
           HPLC. RT-PCR will also be performed to determine the expression of various MMPs and&#xD;
           TIMPs. The blood markers will be processed at Georgetown University Hospital. The&#xD;
           Department of Vascular Surgery at Georgetown University will perform the noninvasive and&#xD;
           invasive studies and the results of their findings will be reported to the&#xD;
           investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 5-Data Analysis. The results from the physical examination, laboratory studies,&#xD;
           vascular studies, and tissue assays will be collected and evaluated.&#xD;
