      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed combination of&#xD;
      paracetamol, phenylephrine and chlorpheniramine in symptomatic treatment of common cold and&#xD;
      flu-like illness in adults in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. The investigators&#xD;
      included 146 healthy study subjects aged between 18 and 60 years who presented flu or common&#xD;
      cold moderate to severe onset of less than 3 days (72 hours). After clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      evaluation were randomized to receive active drug or placebo, five capsules a day, every 4&#xD;
      hours for 48-72h.The outcomes to assess the effectiveness involve the measurement of symptom&#xD;
      scores, overall duration of symptoms, return to usual activities, use of rescue medication,&#xD;
      improvement of the fever.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The upper respiratory infections are frequent in the population, and its treatment, in most&#xD;
      cases involves the use of symptomatic drugs. Paracetamol is used as an analgesic and&#xD;
      antipyretic, whereas chlorpheniramine and phenylephrine is an antihistamine with a&#xD;
      vasoconstrictor decongestant function. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of a fixed combination of paracetamol, phenylephrine and chlorpheniramine in&#xD;
      symptomatic treatment of common cold and flu-like illness in adults in a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, controlled trial.&#xD;

    <description>We assessed symptoms of common cold or flu-like illness with symptoms of global scale for assessing efficacy in clinical trial. The scale consists of 10 symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, headache, muscle pain, discomfort in the throat, sore throat, dysphonia, cough and fever). We used a Likert scale of intensity of 4 points where 0 no symptoms, 1 mild symptom, 2 moderate symptom, 3 severe symptom intensity.Overall duration of symptoms. Return to normal activity. Use of rescue medication for relief of symptoms. Improves fever by reducing the axillary temperature below 38.1 ° C</description>
