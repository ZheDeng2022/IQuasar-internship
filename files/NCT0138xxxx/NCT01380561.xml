    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single center, metabolite identification, mass balance, and PK study&#xD;
      in healthy male volunteers. The purposes of this study is to determine the excretion of total&#xD;
      [14C] derived radioactivity and the metabolite profile after a single oral dose of [14C]&#xD;
      asimadoline as well as to identify and quantitate the metabolites of asimadoline in plasma,&#xD;
      urine, and feces after single and multiple oral doses of asimadoline.&#xD;
