  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plague is an infectious disease of animals and humans caused by bacteria, Yersinia pestis.&#xD;
      Modern antibiotics are effective against plague, but if an infected person is not treated&#xD;
      promptly the disease is likely to cause illness or death. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate at the safety, immunogenicity (bodily defense reaction), and tolerability of a new&#xD;
      research vaccine. Up to 48 people will be enrolled in this study at the Center for Vaccine&#xD;
      Development at Saint Louis University. Four groups of 12 volunteers will be given vaccine or&#xD;
      placebo (inactive substance) one group at a time starting with the lowest dose working up to&#xD;
      the highest dose. Shots will be given in the arm 2 times separated by 28 days. Study&#xD;
      procedures include: physical exam, blood samples, and recording temperature and side effects&#xD;
      in a memory aid. Participants will be involved in study related procedures for about 13&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Yersinia (Y.) pestis, a gram-negative coccobacillus, causes an acute and often fatal disease&#xD;
      that may appear in 1 of several major manifestations: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic.&#xD;
      Transmission to humans most commonly occurs via a bite by infectious fleas and is associated&#xD;
      with regional lymphadenopathy or bubo. Pneumonic plague would be the most likely outcome in&#xD;
      the case of a bio-terrorism attack. Currently, there is no effective licensed vaccine that&#xD;
      protects against pneumonic plague. The investigational product, flagellin/F1/V in&#xD;
      phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.2, is a vaccine that is designed to provide protection&#xD;
      against respiratory exposure to Y. pestis, i.e., pneumonic plague. The general hypothesis to&#xD;
      be tested is that the flagellin/F1/V vaccine will induce a robust humoral immune response&#xD;
      against the F1 and V antigens of Y. pestis without serious adverse events (SAEs) when the&#xD;
      vaccine is given intramuscularly (IM) on 2 occasions separated by about 28 days at doses of&#xD;
      1, 3, 6 and 10 micrograms (mcg). Since the major rationale for this vaccine is protection&#xD;
      against respiratory exposure to Y. pestis following a bio-terrorism attack, the initial study&#xD;
      population will be 18-45 year old healthy volunteers. The primary objective of this study is&#xD;
      to assess the safety and immunogenicity of escalating dosages of Flagellin/F1/V vaccine among&#xD;
      healthy subjects given 2 doses of vaccine by the IM route on Days 0 and 28. The secondary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to evaluate the reactogenicity and cell mediated immune responses&#xD;
      of escalating dosages of Flagellin/F1/V vaccine among healthy subjects when given 2 doses of&#xD;
      vaccine by the IM route on Days 0 and 28. Participants will include up to 48 healthy male and&#xD;
      female volunteers. This study is designed as a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind&#xD;
      (within dosing group), dose escalation Phase I study. The study will consist of 4 groups to&#xD;
      be dosed sequentially. Each group will consist of 10 individuals that receive vaccine and 2&#xD;
      that receive placebo. Each subject will receive an IM vaccination on Days 0 and 28. The&#xD;
      initial dose to be evaluated will be 1 mcg/dose. Following assessment of safety and&#xD;
      reactogenicity data of each group by the Safety Monitoring Committee the vaccine doses will&#xD;
      be increased sequentially from 1, to 3, to 6, to 10 mcg/dose. Following vaccination, subjects&#xD;
      will return to the clinical site on Days 1, 14, and 28 following the initial vaccination and&#xD;
      on Days 1, 14, 28, 40, and 180 following the second vaccination. In addition, subjects will&#xD;
      be contacted by phone on Day 3 after each vaccination to review the memory aid, query for&#xD;
      adverse event (AEs)/SAEs and concomitant medications. All subjects will complete a subject&#xD;
      memory aid for 15 days following each vaccination (Day 0-14). Unsolicited, non-serious AEs&#xD;
      will be collected through Day 56 (Visit 8, 26-30 days following the final vaccination). SAEs&#xD;
      will be collected throughout the study period Day 393 (Visit 11, 365 days + 14 days after the&#xD;
      second vaccination). Blood samples for safety labs will be collected at screening, day of&#xD;
      initial vaccination and at 14 days after each vaccination. Specimens will be collected for&#xD;
      immunologic assays at the noted clinic visits, as well as at 6 months post the final&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
