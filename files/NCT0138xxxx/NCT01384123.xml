  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a heterogeneous multisystem disorder of unknown etiology which often presents&#xD;
      with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltration and ocular and skin lesions. In&#xD;
      addition to possible changes in forced vital capacity (FVC) and carbon monoxide transfer&#xD;
      factor (TLCO), a higher prevalence of clinical depression, reduced health status and exercise&#xD;
      intolerance have been observed in patients with sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced health status has been related to decreased pulmonary function, depressive symptoms,&#xD;
      and to respiratory muscle weakness. Exercise capacity is believed to be limited by dyspnea,&#xD;
      an insufficient heart rate response, decreased arterial oxygen tension during exercise,&#xD;
      excessive and inefficient ventilation and by respiratory muscle weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past, exercise capacity was shown to be limited by skeletal muscle weakness in&#xD;
      patients with chronic pulmonary or cardiac disease. 67% of the sarcoidosis patients studied&#xD;
      by Miller et al terminated their peak exercise test due to &quot;leg complaints&quot;. Skeletal muscle&#xD;
      weakness is therefore still assumed to be present in patients with sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with oral corticosteroids, clinical symptoms of depression, myositis, self-reported&#xD;
      complaints of fatigue and high circulating levels of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are all&#xD;
      present in patients with sarcoidosis and can all affect skeletal muscle force and exercise&#xD;
      capacity. Additionally, low levels of circulating insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), which&#xD;
      can be induced by high levels of TNF-α, and high circulating levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and&#xD;
      IL-8 (CXCL8) have been associated with skeletal muscle weakness. These interleukins are part&#xD;
      of the current concept of the immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis16 and may be raised in&#xD;
      patients with stable sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that pulmonary rehabilitation program can lead to improve in the&#xD;
      health status and anxiety among patients with chronic obstructive lung disease .However, no&#xD;
      study has evaluated the role of pulmonary rehabilitation among patients with sarcoidosis.&#xD;

        Fifty consecutive Pulmonary sarcoidosis patients who are treated at the outpatient&#xD;
        interstitial lung disease clinic in MEIR Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pulmonary Sarcoidosis will be diagnosed according to the latest ATS/ERS/WASOG statement on&#xD;
        sarcoidosis.1 Diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis. The morphologic diagnosis of pulmonary&#xD;
        sarcoidosis relies on three main findings: the presence of tight, well-formed granulomas&#xD;
        and a rim of lymphocytes and fibroblasts in the outer margin of granulomas; perilymphatic&#xD;
        interstitial distribution of granulomas (which allows transbronchial biopsies to be used as&#xD;
        sensitive diagnostic tools); and exclusion of an alternative cause&#xD;
