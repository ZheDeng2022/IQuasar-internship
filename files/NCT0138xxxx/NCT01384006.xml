      To expand the donor pool for pancreas allografts. For detailed description please see below.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator initiated prospective, non-randomized feasibility-study, comparing&#xD;
      recipients of EDC-pancreas allografts (SPK or PTA) with patients undergoing SPK or PTA with&#xD;
      standard criteria allografts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneous Pancreas Kidney transplantation (SPK) or Pancreas Transplantation alone (PTA)&#xD;
      are life saving procedures for patients with type 1 (juvenile) diabetes mellitus and impaired&#xD;
      renal function. Although the waiting lists for SPK and PTA are increasing, the numbers of&#xD;
      pancreas transplantations are declining in the Eurotransplant (ET) area&#xD;
      (www.eurotransplant.nl). One major reason for this decline is the fact that a large number of&#xD;
      pancreas allografts, potentially eligible for transplantation are excluded by the ET pancreas&#xD;
      allocation system (EPAS). Those criteria include an organ-specific cut-off for donor age &gt;50&#xD;
      years and/or BMI&gt;30. This means that donors that are older than 50 years or donors with a BMI&#xD;
      &gt;30 are, at the moment, not considered for solid organ transplantation. The pancreas will be&#xD;
      directly allocated for islet transplantation (Eurotransplant manual - version may 26, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The organ-specific cut-off was once established to provide donor pancreases for islet&#xD;
      transplantation. Although 173 pancreases were allocated and retrieved for islet&#xD;
      transplantation only 17 islet transplantations were performed in the whole ET area in 2008&#xD;
      (ET data). In Germany two islet transplantations were performed in 2009. Best results after&#xD;
      islet transplantation are achieved with organs obtained from young obese donors. Concerning&#xD;
      allocation, no conflict of interest exists between whole organ and islet transplantation, the&#xD;
      single active German islet center will take part in the EXPAND study. Meanwhile, according to&#xD;
      the suggestions by the EXPAND study group, extended donor pancreases are intended to be&#xD;
      offered regionally as &quot;rescue&quot; allocation to the centers. The centers should then decide if&#xD;
      this organ can be transplanted as whole organ or if it can be used for islets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the average age for a post mortal organ donor in the ET area is now 58 years, there is a&#xD;
      severe donor selection by age leading to organ shortage. In Germany in 2008 the total number&#xD;
      of organ donors was 1.198. However, only 510 donors had an age between 3 and 50 years and&#xD;
      thus were potentially eligible for pancreas donation. Out of the 510 donors only 183&#xD;
      pancreases (36% of all potential, age restricted pancreas donors) were retrieved and 127&#xD;
      (25%) were transplanted (DSO, Deutsche Stiftung für Organtransplantation e.V.). Altogether,&#xD;
      676 donors were not even screened for pancreas donation due to age, regardless to all other&#xD;
      medical conditions. In addition, approximately 13% were not eligible for pancreas donation&#xD;
      only due to BMI. Moreover, in the ET-area pancreases are allocated without local priority&#xD;
      leading to longer ischemic times due to transport ways. However, there are data from other&#xD;
      allocation areas throughout the world (UNOS or UK) showing that a good overall outcome after&#xD;
      PTx can be achieved with donors exceeding the defined allocation criteria defined by ET&#xD;
      (older than 50 or BMI&gt;30), if the cold ischemic time is kept short. In Great Britain, a local&#xD;
      retrieval and allocation system was installed in 2000 resulting in a steep increase in&#xD;
      pancreas transplantation. Moreover, within this new allocation system the currently worldwide&#xD;
      largest and most successful pancreas transplant program was initiated in Oxford in 2004 with&#xD;
      an extensive use of extended pancreas donors leading to excellent results. These extended&#xD;
      criteria avoided donor BMI restriction, and accepted donors with an age between 8 and 68&#xD;
      years. Meanwhile 350 SPK and PTA were transplanted with an excellent one year pancreas&#xD;
      survival of 91%, kidney survival 95% and a patient survival of 96%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the US, a retrospective analysis of OPTN registries compared 8.850 SPK from young donors&#xD;
      vs. 776 SPK from donors &gt;45 years. It showed that patients transplanted from an older donor&#xD;
      have equal survival compared to those who were waiting for a young donor for more than 1.5&#xD;
      years. However the earlier transplanted patient is instantly off dialysis and insulin. Good&#xD;
      results were already achieved with extended pancreas donors in the US and also in one German&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on those findings, a new pancreas allocation system was established in the USA where&#xD;
      standard pancreases (donor age &lt; 50y or BMI &lt; 30) are allocated first on local, then on&#xD;
      regional and then on national levels and extended pancreas (donor age &gt; 50 years or BMI &gt; 30)&#xD;
      are allocated locally only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, these data indicate the requirement for a new allocation system also in the ET&#xD;
      area to be able to provide a sufficient number of organs for patients on the waiting list. We&#xD;
      therefore suggest a new pancreas allocation system where donors with an age of 50-60 years or&#xD;
      a BMI of 30-34 are allocated regionally within a cold ischemic time &lt; 12 h. To prove the&#xD;
      hypothesis that extended pancreas allograft donors can be used safely with equal outcome in&#xD;
      recipients a prospective comparative multicenter feasibility-study is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A good example of a successful change of allocation rules is the European Senior Donor&#xD;
      Program (ESDP) for kidneys, the so called &quot;old for old&quot; program. Within this program kidneys&#xD;
      from donors &gt;65 years are allocated regionally to patients &gt;65 years with a relatively short&#xD;
      ischemic time without HLA matching. For this purpose a comparative study was performed to&#xD;
      prove the efficacy of this allocation change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard immunosuppression for SPK or PTA includes induction therapy with antibodies.&#xD;
      Maintenance therapy is mostly performed with a tacrolimus / mycophenolate mofetil&#xD;
      combination. The usage of calcineurin inhibitors for maintenance therapy is characterized by&#xD;
      a clear transition from cyclosporine to tacrolimus. Myfortic® vs. Cell Cept® shows beneficial&#xD;
      effects after SPK in a large single center comparison. Corticosteroids are administered to&#xD;
      the majority of patients; however, steroid-avoidance and steroid-withdrawal protocols are&#xD;
      increasingly common.&#xD;

    <description>Pancreas allograft survival at 3 months after transplantation has been defined as primary endpoint. Patients that are insulin-free and have a normal fasting glucose level 60 - 140 mg/dl (3.3 - 7.8 mmol/l) in peripheral venous blood are regarded as having a functioning organ. Thus, all patients that have a pathologic fasting glucose level at 3 months will be counted as event with regards to the primary endpoint of pancreas allograft survival.</description>
