  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in transplant pharmacotherapy have led to improved one-year patient and graft&#xD;
      survival in kidney transplant recipients, but have not translated to enhanced long-term&#xD;
      survival. An explanation for the disparity in outcomes is the negative role of antibodies in&#xD;
      transplant graft survival. There currently does not exist maintenance immunosuppression that&#xD;
      targets antibodies and standard of practice aims at removing circulating donor specific&#xD;
      antibodies upon detection of antibody mediated graft damage but not prior to the detection of&#xD;
      rejection. There exists an insufficiency of data regarding patient and donor characteristics,&#xD;
      changes in immunosuppression, the risk of viral donor and patient seropositivity and the risk&#xD;
      of non-compliance on the development of antibodies. By measuring antibody levels in the blood&#xD;
      at specific time periods after transplant, we may have a better understanding of what types&#xD;
      of patients will develop antibodies, when these antibodies appear and how changes to&#xD;
      transplant medications may affect antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project will examine the multifactorial risks associated with the development&#xD;
      and appearance of donor-specific antibodies in the first year post-kidney transplant. The&#xD;
      data collected will provide a historical perspective and preliminary pilot data to support a&#xD;
      proposal for prospective antibody monitoring and to justify pre-emptively treating the&#xD;
      antibodies in the absence of clinical signs of rejection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Organ transplantation is an effective treatment for several end-stage organ diseases.&#xD;
      Preventing rejection of transplanted organs remains the premier challenge. According to the&#xD;
      humoral theory, donor specific antibodies (DSA) are the major cause of chronic rejection and&#xD;
      allograft loss. Despite this, and evidence that links human leukocyte antigen (HLA)&#xD;
      antibodies to allograft dysfunction and loss, doubt remains about the cause-and-effect&#xD;
      relationship and confirmation of this evidence is necessary to help facilitate change in&#xD;
      transplant practice. Prospective monitoring for de novo DSA in the serum of patients who have&#xD;
      received a transplant may allow for earlier detection, evaluation, and characterization of&#xD;
      factors leading to the development of antibodies prior to the development of clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of graft dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contribution of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I and Class II&#xD;
      antibodies to transplant outcomes is well documented. However, there is emerging evidence&#xD;
      that antibody mediated rejection and the severity of outcomes may involve proteins and&#xD;
      antibodies that go beyond HLA Class I and II. A number of assays are available for testing&#xD;
      for these additional antibodies and proteins but they are currently not used for widespread&#xD;
      patient monitoring in part due to lack of data justifying their commercial use. This pilot&#xD;
      study will prospectively evaluate for the presence and/or emergence of these unique&#xD;
      antibodies, (I.E. MICA antigen, IgG3 and C1Q) in serial samples of serum, and confirm or&#xD;
      reject the utility of incorporating these assays into routine patient monitoring which might&#xD;
      provide earlier evidence of emerging rejection. Serum samples will be stored indefinitely for&#xD;
      future kidney transplant research projects.&#xD;
