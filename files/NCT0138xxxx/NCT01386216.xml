  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of administration of marrow-derived&#xD;
      autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) concentrate and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel for&#xD;
      the treatment of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Critical limb ischemia (CLI) continues to be an important cause of atherosclerotic morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality despite conventional therapies. Modulation of angiogenesis is a promising&#xD;
      alternative to surgical revascularization. Trials of isolated angiogenic growth factor&#xD;
      therapies using recombinant proteins or gene transfer have been conducted, but with&#xD;
      disappointing results because it is unlikely that a single angiogenic factor is solely or&#xD;
      even primarily responsible for angiogenesis. Emerging stem cell therapies represent a new&#xD;
      approach to the modulation of angiogenesis. Pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) hold&#xD;
      promise because they can reproduce a pro-angiogenic milieu in the ischemic limb rather than&#xD;
      upregulate a single angiogenic factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this CLI study, the Magellan® System is utilized for the preparation of autologous cell&#xD;
      concentrate at the point of care. The bone marrow aspirate is obtained from the patient and&#xD;
      concentrated with the cell concentration kit, and delivered intramuscularly to the affected&#xD;
      limb for the treatment of impaired ischemic tissue in order to improve perfusion, reduce pain&#xD;
      and revascularize tissues in patients who have inadequate tissue blood flow, prohibitive&#xD;
      medical comorbidities, or failed previous treatments for revascularization for the prevention&#xD;
      of amputation.&#xD;
