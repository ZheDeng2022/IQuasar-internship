  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by abnormalities in speech and&#xD;
      communication, impaired social functioning, and repetitive behaviors and interests. The term&#xD;
      &quot;Autism spectrum disorders&quot; or ASD is often used to include autistic disorder, Asperger&#xD;
      syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS).&#xD;
      Epidemiological research suggests that ASDs affect at least 60 per 10,000 youth, with&#xD;
      estimates as high as 120 per 10,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity of autistic features is not easily defined and the use of different diagnostic tools&#xD;
      compounds the ability to lay a clear cut definition. It is, though, generally accepted that&#xD;
      children with autism and normal IQ (&gt;70) are &quot;high functioning&quot; regardless of the severity of&#xD;
      their autistic features. The investigators will use the terms &quot;autism&quot; and &quot;ASD&quot;&#xD;
      interchangeably, and the term &quot;low functioning autism&quot; will be used to describe those&#xD;
      children with autism who have, or are presumed to have, IQ&lt;70.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of autism has been studied extensively in the last decade. Abnormal&#xD;
      neuronal connectivity has been implicated in a growing body of research. In addition, areas&#xD;
      of over and/or under neuronal activation have been detected on functional MRI(Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive technique that allows to&#xD;
      affect brain activity. The pulses are administered by passing high currents through an&#xD;
      electromagnetic coil placed adjacent to a patient's scalp. The pulses induce an electric&#xD;
      field in the underlying brain tissue. When the induced field is above a certain threshold,&#xD;
      and is directed in an appropriate orientation relative to the brain's neuronal pathways,&#xD;
      localized axonal depolarizations are produced, thus activating the neurons in the relevant&#xD;
      brain structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      rTMS has been studied in individuals with high functioning autism. rTMS treatment was found&#xD;
      to have an electrophysiological effect and to reduce repetitive behaviors and improved social&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of existing pilot data suggesting effect of rTMS treatment in individuals with&#xD;
      high functioning autism, the investigators propose a pilot study to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      rTMS in children and adolescents with low functioning autism.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female outpatients 10-19 years of age. Although we assume that the effect of&#xD;
             rTMS may be greater in younger children, in whom secondary behavioral issues may be&#xD;
             less established, the study will focus on children older than age 10 years for 2&#xD;
             reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Some cooperation is needed by the children to undergo a rTMS treatment. ii. We&#xD;
             would like to establish the efficacy and safety profile of this treatment in older&#xD;
             children with autism before we expose younger children, who may need sedation, to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision&#xD;
             criteria. Children will have had a diagnosis of ASD prior to the study given by a&#xD;
             pediatric neurologist, child psychiatrist or developmental pediatrician. Diagnosis&#xD;
             will be confirmed by Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-G) and Autism&#xD;
             Diagnostic Interview (ADI-R)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. VABS-II score in the low-very low range. This study is recruiting low functioning&#xD;
             individuals with Autism. Although some of the assessment tools (i.e. ASRS) are&#xD;
             standardized and validated on individuals without intellectual disabilities, there has&#xD;
             been experience using these tools in children with autism in all intellectual levels.&#xD;
             In addition, because we are measuring a change over time and not endorsing a&#xD;
             diagnosis, we feel that using these tools is sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have normal physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. TAS (Transcranial magnetic stimulation Safety Screen questionnaire) is negative or&#xD;
             mitigated as per parent prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients born prior to 37 weeks gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with any primary psychiatric diagnosis other than autism at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with a medical history of neurological disease, including, but not limited&#xD;
             to, movement disorder, tuberous sclerosis, fragile X, and any other known genetic&#xD;
             syndromes, or known abnormal MRI/structural lesion of the brain or a history of&#xD;
             traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a medical history of epilepsy/seizure disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with a family history of epilepsy in a first degree relative (parent or&#xD;
             sibling)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with a medical condition other then autism&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients prescribed with psychoactive medication(s) less then 4 weeks prior to joining&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with a medical history head trauma associated with prolonged loss of&#xD;
             consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of metal foreign body in the head, excluding oral devices&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of known anatomical brain abnormality&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Hearing loss&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. participation in an ongoing other interventional study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Discontinuation criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient or legal guardian refuses to continue&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The RC decides that the patient is not suitable to continue the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Severe side effects&#xD;
