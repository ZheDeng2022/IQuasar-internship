  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many authors have recognized the need to overcome the different barriers to continuity of&#xD;
      cancer care, such as inadequate communication between specialists and family physicians (FP),&#xD;
      insufficient information provided for the long-term follow-up care and difficulties to&#xD;
      transfer back to FP the responsibility for cancer care at the end of treatments. This study&#xD;
      aims to assess the effectiveness of a multi-faceted intervention to improve continuity of&#xD;
      care for patients with lung cancer. Newly diagnosed lung cancer patients who have a FP will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to either the intervention group or to usual care and they will be&#xD;
      followed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months ( or until death for those with a&#xD;
      survival of less than 18 months). The intervention comprises 4 components: 1) systematic&#xD;
      appointments with FP at 3-month interval ; 2) transmission to FP of a standardized&#xD;
      comprehensive summary before each appointment; 3) systematic transmission to the oncology&#xD;
      team of patients' information resulting from FP visits; 4) development of a priority access&#xD;
      to FP for cancer patients. In both groups, outcomes related to patients and to care processes&#xD;
      will be measured at baseline and then after 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months (or until death for&#xD;
      those with a survival of less than 18months). Patients' principal family caregiver will be&#xD;
      invited to participate to the study and they will complete questionnaires at baseline, at 6&#xD;
      months and at the end of the study. In addition, patients' FP will also be invited to&#xD;
      complete a questionnaire at baseline and at the end of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer patients from both the intervention and the control group will complete validated&#xD;
      questionnaires at baseline and then after 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months (or until death for&#xD;
      those with a survival of less than 18months) to assess their perceived collaboration between&#xD;
      their FP and the oncology team (from an adaptation of Nielsen et al.'s validated&#xD;
      questionnaire (2003)), their quality of life (from the EORTC-QLQ-C30), pain and other symptom&#xD;
      relief (from the EORTC-QLQ-LC13), their level of distress, anxiety and depression (from the&#xD;
      HADS), their self-efficacy (from an adaptation of Lorig et al.'s validated questionnaire&#xD;
      (1996)). Several processes of care will also be measured at the same intervals: number of&#xD;
      exchanges of information, number of visits to FP, number of answered/unanswered calls from&#xD;
      FP, delay to return patients' calls, responsibility for care by FP at the terminal phase of&#xD;
      cancer, service utilization (ER visits, hospitalization, community health services). The&#xD;
      investigators will also measure in patients' principal family caregivers, their perceived&#xD;
      collaboration between FP and the oncology team (same questionnaire than the one used for&#xD;
      patients but adapted to family caregivers), their distress (from the IDPESQ), psychological&#xD;
      burden (from the CBS-EOLC) and self-efficacy (same questionnaire than the one used for&#xD;
      patients but adapted to family caregivers . Finally, measures related to FP will include&#xD;
      their perceived collaboration with the oncology team (same questionnaire than the one used&#xD;
      for patients and family caregivers but adapted to FPs).&#xD;
