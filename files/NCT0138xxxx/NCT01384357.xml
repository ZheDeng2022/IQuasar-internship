      The objective of the present study was to compare ultrasound (US) characteristics and&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy (US-CNB) with US-guided fine-needle aspiration (US-FNA)&#xD;
      in the assessment of different malignant cervical lymphadenopathies. Patients with malignant&#xD;
      cervical lymphadenopathie with either US-FNA or US-CNB over a 3-year period from 2007 July to&#xD;
      2010 Dec were retrospectively reviewed. There are two major study groups according to the&#xD;
      treatment status of the patient's population, including patients who had pathology proofed&#xD;
      previous cancer and with clinically cervical lymphadenopathies after treatment. The second&#xD;
      group included patients with cervical lymphaenopathies but without previous diagnosis of&#xD;
      malignancy and treatment. The results of cytology, or pathology and time of needle biopsy to&#xD;
      final diagnosis were traced and recorded. Morphologic US parameters and vascular features&#xD;
      were thoroughly evaluated and compared in different disease.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of infection signs, lateral neck lymphadenopathies should be suspected as&#xD;
      metastatic carcinoma or lymphoma until proved otherwise. Previously, the most commonly used&#xD;
      sampling techniques in the head and neck are the open excisional biopsy and fine-needle&#xD;
      aspiration (FNA) cytology. Open biopsy and lymph node excision provides material suitable for&#xD;
      histological analysis but is invasive and may entail general anesthesia and hospital&#xD;
      admission. Besides, excisional and incisional biopsy of cervical metastases results in a 2-3&#xD;
      times increased incidence of local treatment failure when compared with FNA cytology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-resolution ultrasound is widely used imaging modality to evaluate the morphology,&#xD;
      internal architecture, size and shape of cervical lymph nodes. In the head and neck, the&#xD;
      image guidance technique most commonly used has been ultrasound. The real-time capability and&#xD;
      ease of use makes ultrasound the procedure of choice. The evidence of improved efficacy of&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided FNA over palpation-guided FNA in the head and neck also has been well&#xD;
      documented, leading to its acceptance as the standard procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disadvantages of FNA include a high rate of nondiagnostic samples and incomplete&#xD;
      classification of lymphoma with delayed diagnosis. The core-needle biopsy (CNB) is an&#xD;
      alternative to the established ways of tissue sampling and used very successfully for many&#xD;
      years. As the histologic architecture of the lesion is preserved, it provides a sample that&#xD;
      is adequate for histopathologic and immunohistochemical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there was only one prospective investigation comparing ultrasound guided&#xD;
      CNB with FNA in the head and neck region. However, the studied population was heterogeneous&#xD;
      and case numbers were limited. The result revealed no significant difference between both&#xD;
      methods. The objective of the present study was to compare ultrasound-guided CNB with FNA in&#xD;
      the assessment of different malignant cervical lymphadenopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective study will be performed including consecutive patients over a 3-year period&#xD;
      from 2007 July to 2010 Dec. All patients were seen at our institution with malignant cervical&#xD;
      lymphadenopathies. The biopsies were performed on an outpatient basis, unless the patient was&#xD;
      hospitalized for alternative reasons. Equipment for sonographic studies consisted of a color&#xD;
      Doppler US unit (Philips HDI 5000, Bothell, WA, US) and a 5-12 MHz broadband linear array&#xD;
      transducer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphologic US parameters and vascular features were thoroughly evaluated and recorded on the&#xD;
      PACS system (Marotech Inc, Seoul, South Korea) for the largest nodal lesion in each patient.&#xD;
      Every lymph node was assessed first with gray-scale sonography for morphologic parameters in&#xD;
      horizontal and then longitudinal sections. The short-axis diameter, long-axis diameter and&#xD;
      diameter ratio of short to long axis (S/L ratio) were measured. Echogenicity with respect to&#xD;
      the surrounding soft tissue was assessed and classified as hypoechoic, isoechoic, or&#xD;
      hyperechoic. Lymph node margin was defined as regular or irregular. Echogenic hilus was&#xD;
      distinguished between its presence or absence. Internal echo pattern was divided into&#xD;
      heterogeneity or homogeneity. Vascular patterns were then surveyed by power Doppler&#xD;
      sonography and categorized as the group of avascular or hilar type versus that of mixed,&#xD;
      spotted, or peripheral type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the data on history, physical examination, and ultrasound result, we decided that&#xD;
      ultrasound guided needle biopsies would be the first line of investigation for these lesions.&#xD;
      Informed consent for the procedure was obtained from all the patients before biopsy. In&#xD;
      general, FNA was carried out with the array probe guiding the placement of a 22-gauge fine&#xD;
      needle within the largest node after sterilization without anesthesia. For CNB, the skin was&#xD;
      sterilized and locally anaesthetized with 2% lidocaine. A modified non-advancing, disposable,&#xD;
      spring-loaded cutting biopsy needle (Temno biopsy system, Allegiance Healthcare Corporation,&#xD;
      McGaw Park, IL, USA) with 15-mm side-notch of 9 cm length and 18-gauge were used. All&#xD;
      biopsies were done by the same experienced otolaryngologist (Li-Jen Liao) under real-time&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance with freehand technique. Three times of tissue core biopsies were done&#xD;
      for each patient. After the biopsy, all patients were asked to compress the puncture site and&#xD;
      were evaluated for possible complications such as bleeding or bruising for half an hour&#xD;
      before leaving the examination room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specimens were put in 10% formalin solution for pathologic studies. In the Department of&#xD;
      Pathology, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embeddedm sections from the biopsies were stained with&#xD;
      hematoxylin and eosin for morphologic examination. Further immunohistochemical studies were&#xD;
      performed as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two major study groups according to the treatment status of the patient's&#xD;
      population. The first group included patients who had pathology proofed previous cancer and&#xD;
      with clinically cervical lymphadenopathies after treatment. The second group included&#xD;
      patients with cervical lymphaenopathies but without previous diagnosis of malignancy and&#xD;
      treatment. The disease groups were further classified as metastatic nodes from nonthyroid&#xD;
      primary (META), lymphoma (LYM) and metastatic nodes from papillary carcinoma of the thyroid&#xD;
      (PAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of cytology and pathology were graded as false negative, suspicious and positive&#xD;
      for malignancy. The final diagnoses of patients were established by the histopathology. The&#xD;
      time of needle biopsy and final diagnosis were traced and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistically, continuous variables were compared by performing the Kruskal-Wallis test.&#xD;
      Category data were compared by using the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. The time&#xD;
      from procedure to final diagnosis were expressed in K-M plot and tested with Log-rank test.&#xD;
      All statistical analyses were accomplished using SAS software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute,&#xD;
      Inc, Cary, North Carolina).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will know the differential US characteristics in different malignant cervical&#xD;
      lymphadenopathies. Besides, we will know US-FNA or US-CNB is preferred in which situation.&#xD;
