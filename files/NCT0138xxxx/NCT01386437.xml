      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The immune system is made up of special cells, tissues, and organs that fight infections.&#xD;
      Problems with this system may lead to frequent, severe, or unusual fungal infections. These&#xD;
      infections are often difficult to treat. Researchers want to collect blood and tissue samples&#xD;
      from people who have unusual, persistent or severe fungal infections or immune problems that&#xD;
      increase the risk of these infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect medical information and samples for a long-term study of people with immune&#xD;
      system problems that lead to fungal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People with a history of fungal infections caused by immune system problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents, children, and siblings of this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers not related to the first two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This long-term study may last for up to 10 years. Those in the study may need to provide&#xD;
           new information about every 6 months. The procedures for each person may vary with the&#xD;
           particular diagnosis and the extent of fungal infection. Healthy volunteers may have&#xD;
           only one or two visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit, those in the study will have a full medical history and physical&#xD;
           exam. They will also provide blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research procedures may include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva, urine or stool testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mouthwash collection for DNA testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of cheek cells, nail clippings, or vaginal fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of leftover tissue or body fluid from previous medical procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin or oral mucous membrane biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of white blood cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Followup visits will involve a physical exam and updated medical history. Blood, saliva,&#xD;
           urine, or nail clipping samples may be taken for ongoing studies. Any additional tests&#xD;
           or exams required by the study doctors may also be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may withdraw from the study pool at any time.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This protocol is a natural history study designed to investigate the clinical, microbiologic,&#xD;
      genetic and immunologic correlates of primary immune deficiencies and other conditions&#xD;
      associated with mucocutaneous and invasive fungal infections (IFIs). The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      chronic mucocutaneous mycoses and IFIs are caused by abnormalities in immune function in&#xD;
      these patients that can be identified using modern methods in molecular and cell biology and&#xD;
      immunology. For inclusion, patients must have a history of or an active mucocutaneous or&#xD;
      invasive fungal infection, but may or may not have a defined primary or acquired&#xD;
      immunodeficiency state. Patients will undergo evaluations that include history/physical&#xD;
      examination and blood, saliva, and possible tissue sampling for genetic and immunological&#xD;
      testing. Patient relatives may also be screened for clinical, microbiological, genetic and/or&#xD;
      immunological correlates of host defense abnormalities. Healthy volunteers will be enrolled&#xD;
      as a source of control blood, saliva, and possible tissue sampling, and for genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this protocol is to use modern methods in molecular and cell biology and&#xD;
      immunology to elucidate the immunopathogenesis of fungal disease in humans. A better&#xD;
      understanding of primary immunodeficiency and identification of fungal and host risk factors&#xD;
      for fungal infection may provide new insights into pathogenesis and identify targets for&#xD;
      development of novel therapies. Enrolled subjects may be followed for up to 10 years to&#xD;
      undergo additional clinical evaluation and sampling. Follow-up may occur every 6 months or&#xD;
      more frequently depending on clinical course, the underlying risk factor(s), and the type of&#xD;
      fungal infection. Under some circumstances, standard medical treatment will be provided for a&#xD;
      fungal infection or immune deficiency.&#xD;

        The study population will be drawn from referrals from the NIH Clinical Center staff,&#xD;
        physicians at outside medical facilities, the Clinical Center Volunteer Program, and&#xD;
        self-referrals. Patients may be evaluated as inpatients, or at the NIAID outpatient clinic&#xD;
        depending on the severity of the clinical manifestations of their infection. The patients'&#xD;
        genetic relatives will be evaluated at the NIAID outpatient clinic. Patients or relatives&#xD;
        who meet the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria, but who are not able to travel to the NIH&#xD;
        Clinical Center may be enrolled in the study and evaluated for immune and genetic defects&#xD;
        using send-in blood samples or clinical specimens @@@(e.g., previously obtained biopsy&#xD;
        specimens or saliva). Healthy volunteers must be seen at NIH and will not have the option&#xD;
        to mail in samples.&#xD;
