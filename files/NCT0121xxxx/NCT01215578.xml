      The purpose of this study is to identify predictive molecular markers of response to&#xD;
      continuous daily sunitinib at dose of 37.5 mg used in patients with poorly-differentiated&#xD;
      Advanced/Inoperable NEURO-Endocrine Tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To distinguish molecular markers based on their expression at the initial biopsy, their&#xD;
           detection by proteomic analysis and demonstrating that tumor or vascular cells are&#xD;
           straightaway sensitive to sunitinib (markers sensitivity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of these markers at the initial biopsy predict the sensitivity to&#xD;
           sunitinib(Positive predictive value of markers)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are rare malignancies (1-2% of digestive cancers); and there is,&#xD;
      in recent years, a slow but steady increase in their incidence. Despite the joint efforts of&#xD;
      several research groups, which led to the new WHO classification (2002), the natural history&#xD;
      of the disease remains heterogene and the resistance to conventional cytotoxic treatment&#xD;
      remains the common denominator of these tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, the prognosis of patients with metastatic disease remains poor despite numerous&#xD;
      treatments (including: IFN, DTIC, 5-FU, doxorubicin, somatostatin analogues, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      None of which showed a benefit in terms of survival. The main therapeutic objective is still&#xD;
      to get a palliative effect on the symptoms and / or limit a few months tumor progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many publications showing that angiogenesis is one of the major mechanisms of tumor&#xD;
      progression in TNE. But the multiple signaling pathways involved, the existence of&#xD;
      alternative routes and their relationship to apoptosis inducing molecules remain unknown.&#xD;
      Sunitinib is a new molecule in the family of tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting multiple&#xD;
      receptors which VEGFR, KIT, PDGF-R, FLT3 and RET. Since 2006 year, Sunitinib has been&#xD;
      approved to treat advanced kidney cancer also called advanced renal cell carcinoma (a&#xD;
      typically chemoresistant disease for which there was no active treatment available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many retrospective studies in patients showing that the TNE overexpress one or more targets&#xD;
      of sunitinib. In Phase I trial, an antitumor activity has been identified in neuroendocrine&#xD;
      tumors. In a phase II trial including 100 patients with well-differentiated TNE and&#xD;
      carcinoids, sunitinib is associated with a response rate of 10%, and 82% of clinical benefit&#xD;
      in the form of tumor stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, an international randomised phase III trial initiated in well differentiated&#xD;
      forms, but no studies are underway for poorly-differentiated TNE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of this suggests that sunitinib could represent an important therapeutic option for&#xD;
      moderate, or poorly differentiated inoperable TNE and needs to be explored in this pathology&#xD;
      by identifying predictive biomarkers of response.&#xD;
