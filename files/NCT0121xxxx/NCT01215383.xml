      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among individuals with schizophrenia, there is an increased prevalence of obesity,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia ,diabetes mellitus and related conditions such as cardiovascular disease. People&#xD;
      with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, depression or bipolar disorder, have&#xD;
      worse physical health and reduced life expectancy compared to the general population. Number&#xD;
      of epidemiological studies of patients with schizophrenia have documented a higher incidence&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease than in the general population, and patients with schizophrenia may&#xD;
      be at an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease even in the absence of antipsychotic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Affinity for the H1 receptor is most closely linked to increased weight gain, although&#xD;
      affinity for D2, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C and a2-receptors may also be involved. Drug affinity for the&#xD;
      H1, M3 and 5-HT2C receptors is correlated with an increased risk of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration in the blood is independently and&#xD;
      inversely associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease(CVD). However many&#xD;
      patients with 'normal' or even 'elevated' plasma HDL experience clinical events. HDL may not&#xD;
      always be atheroprotective and in some conditions, it paradoxically enhances the process of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. In addition to its role in reverse cholesterol transport, HDL shows many&#xD;
      other protective properties towards atherosclerosis. HDL inhibits the chemotaxis of monocytes&#xD;
      , prevents endothelial dysfunction and apoptosis, prohibit slow-density lipoprotein (LDL )&#xD;
      oxidation, and stimulates the proliferation of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells.&#xD;
      These anti-inﬂammatory, antioxidative, antiaggregatory, anti-coagulant, and pro-ﬁbrinolytic&#xD;
      activities are exerted by different components of HDL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the functional properties of HDL in psychiatric patients before and during&#xD;
      antipsychotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood will be drawn at baseline before the initiation of antipsychotic drugs and 2 months&#xD;
      under the antipsychotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full lipid profile including triglycerides, LDL-C, Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, apo&#xD;
      AI, apoAII and apoB100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum Paraoxanase Activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      LDL oxidation and resistance to oxidation (measured by conjugated diens formation during&#xD;
      incubation in the presence of copper).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HDL composition: total and unesterified cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids, TBARS&#xD;
      content before and after exposure to AAPH as a major indicator of oxidative stress, PON&#xD;
      activity using phenylacetate as a substrate, apoA1and PAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum parameters e.g. Diacyl glycerol acyltransferase activity, free ApoA1 and LCAT activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 [H]-Cholesterol efflux will be measured by incubating J744 macrophages with serum.&#xD;
      Radioactivity will measured by β counter in the cell lysate and the medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-way AVOVA and Student's t-test for paired samples will be used for comparison of multiple&#xD;
      groups and paired samples, respectively. p&lt;0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
