    <textblock>
      Our proposed study is designed to test the safety of a new vaccine against melanoma. The&#xD;
      induction of immune activity against cancers such as melanoma is a promising approach to&#xD;
      cancer treatment, but to date, only a few clinically significant immune responses have been&#xD;
      seen following vaccine therapy. This is an important problem, since there are very limited&#xD;
      treatment options for patients with metastatic melanoma (melanoma that has spread to lymph&#xD;
      nodes and organs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies suggest that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that block inhibitory receptors on immune&#xD;
      cells can enhance the immune responses against cancer, but the intravenous injection of such&#xD;
      mAbs has caused severe side effects in animals and humans. In our laboratory, we have&#xD;
      developed a method to deliver mAbs and other proteins that block such inhibitory receptors&#xD;
      locally at the site where immune responses against melanoma proteins are stimulated by&#xD;
      vaccination, enhancing anti-melanoma immunity while avoiding the side-effects associated with&#xD;
      intravenous injection of these immune modulators. This is achieved by loading dendritic&#xD;
      cells, a type of immune cell, with RNA that encodes the immune modulator. The RNA-loaded&#xD;
      dendritic cells then make the immune modulatory proteins and release them locally. By mixing&#xD;
      these dendritic cells with additional dendritic cells loaded with melanoma proteins, the&#xD;
      immune modulators are released at the site where anti-melanoma immune cells are stimulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase I trial, subjects with metastatic melanoma will undergo the process of&#xD;
      leukapheresis, in which white blood cells are removed from the body. Monocytes, a type of&#xD;
      immune cell, will then be purified from the white blood cells and cultured under conditions&#xD;
      that will change them into dendritic cells. Half of these dendritic cells are then loaded&#xD;
      with melanoma antigen RNA, which will lead to the production of melanoma antigen proteins&#xD;
      within the dendritic cells. The remaining half of the dendritic cells will be either&#xD;
      untreated or loaded with RNA encoding immune modulators so that these dendritic cells will&#xD;
      release immune modulators at the site of vaccination. These dendritic cells will be mixed&#xD;
      with the melanoma antigen-loaded dendritic cells and injected as a vaccine into lymph nodes.&#xD;
      Each subject will receive six weekly injections of their own dendritic cells. Safety and&#xD;
      toxicity will be closely monitored. In addition, immune responses against melanoma, as well&#xD;
      as clinical responses, will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A variety of trials of immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma have clearly demonstrated that&#xD;
      immune responses against melanoma can be induced, but only a few patient have responded&#xD;
      clinically, suggesting that new strategies to enhance anti-cancer immune responses are&#xD;
      needed. Most of these immunotherapy trials have focused on antigen delivery and providing&#xD;
      stimulatory antigen-specific signals to T cells. However, the induction of antigen-specific T&#xD;
      cell-mediated immune responses is regulated not only by stimulatory signals, but also by&#xD;
      inhibitory receptor-mediated signals. Studies have demonstrated that administering mAbs&#xD;
      targeting such immune-modulating receptors on T cells enhances vaccine-induced anti-tumor&#xD;
      immunity, suggesting that such an approach might improve the efficacy of clinical cancer&#xD;
      vaccines. However, systemic administration such mAbs has been associated with severe,&#xD;
      sometimes fatal, autoimmunity. We have developed an approach for targeted delivery of such&#xD;
      immune modulatory proteins and mAbs, using immune modulator RNA-transfected dendritic cells&#xD;
      (DC), to sites where anti-tumor T cells are induced. Our preliminary studies indicate that&#xD;
      this approach may eliminate the adverse effects associated with systemic administration&#xD;
      immune modulators, while also enhancing vaccine-induced immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the objective of this proposed Phase I immunotherapy trial is to determine the&#xD;
      safety and obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of vaccination of human subjects with&#xD;
      melanoma tumor associated antigen (TAA) RNA-transfected mature monocyte-derived DC&#xD;
      coadministered with additional untransfected DC (Study Arm A), DC transfected with RNA&#xD;
      encoding a soluble GITR-L fusion protein (Study Arm B), DC transfected with RNA encoding the&#xD;
      humanized heavy and light chains of an antagonistic anti-CTLA-4 mAb (Study Arm C), or DC&#xD;
      transfected with combined GITR-L and anti-CTLA-4 mAb RNA (Study Arm D). All study subjects&#xD;
      will undergo leukapheresis for collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and&#xD;
      purified monocytes will be cultured with the cytokines GM-CSF and IL-4 to produce immature&#xD;
      DC. After the induction maturation with a standard cytokine cocktail, half of the DC will&#xD;
      then be transfected with RNA encoding melanoma TAAs MART, tyrosinase, and gp100, and MAGE-3,&#xD;
      while the remaining half of the DC will be either untransfected (Study Arm A) or will be&#xD;
      transfected with immune modulator RNA (Study Arm B, C, and D). DC will be cryopreserved.&#xD;
      Subjects will then be immunized with these DC, weekly for six intranodal injections. For each&#xD;
      subject, safety and toxicity will be assessed, and anti-tumor immune responses will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
