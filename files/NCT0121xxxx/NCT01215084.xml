    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the Pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety&#xD;
      profiles of fampridine-PR 10 mg in Chinese and Japanese adult healthy volunteers. The&#xD;
      secondary objective of this study is to compare the PK and safety profiles of fampridine-PR&#xD;
      10 mg among the Chinese, Japanese, and Caucasian adult healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Caucasian group is included to allow comparison of pharmacokinetic and safety data from&#xD;
      different race groups to be performed with data obtained from the same study under the same&#xD;
      controlled conditions.&#xD;
