  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to provide information on whether psychotherapy (&quot;talk therapy&quot;)&#xD;
      combined with the drug MDMA is safe and helpful for subjects with posttraumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD). The study will compare the effects of a low, a medium and a full dose of&#xD;
      MDMA on symptoms of PTSD in 24 veterans, firefighters or police officers. MDMA dose will be&#xD;
      assigned at random, and the investigators and the subject will not know the dose given. The&#xD;
      researchers will also investigate depression symptoms. The researchers believe that the full&#xD;
      dose of MDMA will produce a greater reduction in PTSD symptoms than the two lower doses.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental disorder, that can develop&#xD;
      after service in the armed forces. Psychotherapy performed along with MDMA is an innovative&#xD;
      form of therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder. This study will follow on the findings of&#xD;
      an initial pilot study in a sample largely made up of people whose PTSD did not develop from&#xD;
      serving in the military. This study will investigate whether MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is&#xD;
      safe and efficacious in a sample of veterans and whether maintaining an effective&#xD;
      double-blind can be better addressed by performing a dose comparison study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, dose comparison study with an open-label cross-over&#xD;
      segment that will assess the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in veterans&#xD;
      with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder. Twelve of 24 participants will receive the full&#xD;
      dose of 125 mg, six will receive 75 mg and six will receive 30 mg (active placebo dose). An&#xD;
      independent rater blind to condition will assess symptoms of PTSD and depression, general&#xD;
      quality of life and posttraumatic growth prior to any psychotherapy sessions one month after&#xD;
      the second experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After undergoing three 90-minute non-drug introductory psychotherapy sessions with a&#xD;
      male/female co-therapist team, study participants will undergo two eight-hour long&#xD;
      experimental sessions scheduled three to five weeks apart, during which they will randomly&#xD;
      receive either 30, 75 or 125 mg MDMA on both occasions, followed by a supplemental dose of&#xD;
      half the initial dose. Participants will undergo integrative psychotherapy in between each&#xD;
      experimental session, including on the day after each session. Vital signs and psychological&#xD;
      distress will be measured throughout each experimental session, and suicidality will be&#xD;
      assessed throughout the course of the study. Spontaneously reported side effects will be&#xD;
      collected on the day of each experimental session, and for six days afterward. PTSD symptoms,&#xD;
      symptoms of depression, general psychological function, posttraumatic growth and quality of&#xD;
      sleep will be assessed one month after the second experimental session, and the blind will be&#xD;
      broken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who received 125 mg MDMA will continue to have a third experimental session, and&#xD;
      they will be assessed two months after the third experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who received 30 or 75 mg MDMA may take part in an open-label crossover segment&#xD;
      that will follow nearly identical procedures, except that there will only be one introductory&#xD;
      session prior to the first experimental session. There will be three experimental sessions.&#xD;
      Symptoms of PTSD, depression and posttraumatic growth will be assessed at the start of the&#xD;
      study. They will also be assessed one month after the second and two months after the third&#xD;
      experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be assessed 12 months after their final experimental session. PTSD and&#xD;
      depression symptoms and posttraumatic growth will be assessed, and participants will complete&#xD;
      a questionnaire concerning the costs and benefits of being in the study.&#xD;
