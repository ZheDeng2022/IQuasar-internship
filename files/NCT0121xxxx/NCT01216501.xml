  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In children, radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) or cryoablation are highly effective&#xD;
      treatments for supraventricular tachycardia treatment. General anesthesia is often required&#xD;
      to ensure comfort during the prolonged procedure and to assure immobility in order to&#xD;
      facilitate accurate mapping and subsequent ablation of the accessory pathway and/or&#xD;
      arrhythmogenic focus. Successful anesthetic management of this patient population requires&#xD;
      adequate suppression of sympathetic responses during the procedure while electrophysiological&#xD;
      parameters remain unaltered for mapping purposes and subsequent ablation. Although&#xD;
      Sevoflurane (SEVO) and Isoflurane (ISO) are two commonly used and evaluated volatile&#xD;
      anesthetic agents for ablation procedures, comparison of those agents has not been performed&#xD;
      previously not in adults, not in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Time required for basic EP intervals, successful induction of SVT and successful&#xD;
      RFCA or cryoablation in children will not be different between patients undergoing&#xD;
      Sevoflurane or Isoflurane-based anesthesia.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Hypothesis Time required for basic EP intervals, successful induction of SVT and successful&#xD;
      RFCA or cryoablation in children will not be different between patients undergoing&#xD;
      Sevoflurane or Isoflurane-based anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients The study group will include otherwise 200 lthy patients aged 4 to 18 years, with an&#xD;
      ASA physical status I or II, who are scheduled for elective radiofrequency ablation or&#xD;
      cryoablation to interrupt abnormal foci and/or accessory pathways at Schneider Children's&#xD;
      Medical Center of Israel (SCMCI). Written informed consent will be obtained from the patients&#xD;
      (from age 12), parent(s) or legal guardian of all participants. Duration of the study- 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: healthy patients aged 4 to 18 years, with an ASA physical status I or II,&#xD;
      who are scheduled for elective radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation to treat SVT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: patients with accompanying cardiac defects or other diseases, suspected&#xD;
      Malignant Hyperthermia, contraindication to volatile anesthetics use and patients/ parental&#xD;
      refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia The investigators will use the standard anesthesia protocol. Routine monitoring&#xD;
      includes electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure measurement, capnography and pulse&#xD;
      oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are randomly divided into two groups according to the last digit of their&#xD;
      9-digit identification number: patients with an odd number are allocated to Sevoflurane (SEVO&#xD;
      group) and patients with an even number are allocated to and Isoflurane (ISO group).&#xD;
      Preanesthetic medication consists of midazolam given either orally (0.5 mg/kg up to a maximum&#xD;
      of 10 mg) or intravenously (2.0 mg) when intravenous (IV) access is established before&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia is induced either via facemask with Sevoflurane (Abbot&#xD;
      Laboratories Ltd., UK) in 66% nitrous oxide and 33% oxygen or IV with Propofol (Diprivan, B&#xD;
      Braun, Germany) 2.5 mg/kg. In patients who undergo mask induction intravenous line is&#xD;
      established after losing the consciousness, Sevoflurane is discontinued and Propofol (2.5&#xD;
      mg/kg) is administerd IV. Before tracheal intubation the lungs will be preoxigenated with&#xD;
      100% O2. Pancuronium (0.1 mg/kg) and Fentanyl (2-4 µg/kg) will be used to facilitate tracheal&#xD;
      intubation. After tracheal intubation, the fresh gas flow will be set to 1 l/min O2 and 1&#xD;
      l/min room air for the remainder of the procedure. Thereafter, anesthesia will be maintained&#xD;
      with the assigned study drug (SEVO or ISO) in an oxygen/air 50% mixture. In the ISO group,&#xD;
      the Isoflurane will be started with an inspiratory fraction of 1MAC and in the SEVO group the&#xD;
      Sevoflurane will be started with an inspiratory fraction of 1MAC adjusted for age.&#xD;
      Pancuronium is used as the neuromuscular drug during the intraoperative period, as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After induction of anesthesia, a standard baseline programmed stimulation&#xD;
      electrophysiological protocol is performed using transvenous endocardial electrodes that&#xD;
      allow calculating the following parameters: right atrial refractory period, atrioventricular&#xD;
      node effective refractory period, accessory pathway effective refractory period, and right&#xD;
      ventricular effective refractory period. Decremental pacing of the right atrium or ventricle&#xD;
      allows determining the shortest cycle length during antegrade and retrograde conduction,&#xD;
      which is also called the &quot;Wenckebach cycle length,&quot; with a 1:1 conduction over the normal&#xD;
      atrioventricular node and accessory pathway. Right atrial or ventricular extrastimulus&#xD;
      testing involves pacing at a standard drive cycle length of 200, 400 or 600 ms, followed by&#xD;
      an extrastimulus coupled (steps of 20 ms from 600-300 ms and steps of 10 ms less than 300 ms)&#xD;
      to every eighth drive beat. Baseline intervals measured during sinus rhythm include&#xD;
      intraatrial conduction time (PA interval), and atrial-His interval. During induced&#xD;
      reciprocating tachycardia, conduction times of each component of the reentrant circuit is&#xD;
      measured and included cycle length and atrial-His, His-ventricular, and ventriculoatrial&#xD;
      intervals. All electrophysiological measurements is recorded using a standard digitizing&#xD;
      tablet at a paper speed of 100 mm/s. Programmed stimulation is performed using a Mennen&#xD;
      stimulator, and data is displayed, recorded, and analyzed using a standard computerized&#xD;
      multichannel system. If the clinically suspected SVT will not induced during the baseline&#xD;
      protocol, isoproterenol (0.03-0.07 µg • kg- 1 • min-1) will be infused, and the protocol&#xD;
      repeated until SVT will be induced. After conclusion of the diagnostic study, ablation of the&#xD;
      abnormal substrate(s) will be performed using a commercial radiofrequency generator (ATKAR).&#xD;
      If needed, the muscle relaxation will be reestablished using pancuronium 0.05mg/kg to allow&#xD;
      the ablation be performed during apnea to avoid respiration-related intrathoracic movement.&#xD;
      This approach permits application of radiofrequency energy near vital structures, such as the&#xD;
      atrioventricular node, with reduced concern of potentially dangerous catheter dislodgement.&#xD;
      The final diagnostic electrophysiological study will be repeated at baseline and with&#xD;
      isoproterenol (0.03-0.07 µg • kg- 1 • min- 1). Extubation will be performed after the patient&#xD;
      awake. Post procedural care will be provided in the recovery room, and patients will be&#xD;
      transferred to a ward when hemodynamically stable, fully conscious and able to protect the&#xD;
      airway, without pain and severe nausea or active vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following time intervals will be analyzed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Onset of SVT time - T1 (start of first diagnostic electrophysiological study until induction&#xD;
      of first SVT); Diagnostic electrophysiological study time - T2 (start of first diagnostic&#xD;
      electrophysiological study until start of ablation); RFCA/ cryoablation procedure time - T3&#xD;
      (start of first diagnostic electrophysiological study until end of final diagnostic&#xD;
      electrophysiological study); Wake-up time - T4 (from end of wound dressing to patient exit&#xD;
      from the operating room to the post-anesthesia care unit); Total anesthesia time -T5 (from&#xD;
      patient entry to operating room to exit from operating room).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient will enter the laboratory in SVT or if SVT will be induced by initial catheter&#xD;
      placement, the &quot;onset of SVT time&quot; is designated &quot;0 min.&quot; Additionally, the investigators&#xD;
      will compare the antegrade effective refractory period of the accessory pathway (antegrade&#xD;
      APERP), ventricular effective refractory period (VERP), atrial effective refractory period&#xD;
      (AERP), AH interval, and cycle length of circus movement tachycardia (CMT-CL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will compare the incidence of postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting (PONV) in both groups of patients after the procedure (globally and between the&#xD;
      patients, who needed Transesophageal Echocardiography - TEE and not). In the case of PONV,&#xD;
      Ondansetron (Zofran) will be ordered in the dose of 0.1mg/kg IV. If the PONV continues after&#xD;
      ondansetron administration, the second dose of this drug will be given at the dose of 0.1&#xD;
      mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electrophysiologist, who performs the procedure, the patients and their parents are&#xD;
      blinded to randomization status. Time points periods will be recorded by the nurse, blinded&#xD;
      to the randomization status. The incidence of PONV will be recorded by the nurse in the post&#xD;
      anesthesia care unit (PACU), who is blinded to randomization status.&#xD;
