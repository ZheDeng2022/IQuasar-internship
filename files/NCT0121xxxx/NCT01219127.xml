      Management of chronic diabetic foot skin ulcers require multidisciplinary approaches&#xD;
      including diabetic control, wound care, antibiotic, shoe wear off-loading, and surgery in&#xD;
      selected cases. The results are inconsistent and irregular, and most studies reported&#xD;
      unsatisfactory results. Many adjunctive therapies are implemented in the care of chronic&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcers including hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO), ultrasound, recombinant human&#xD;
      platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rPDGF-BB), vacuum assisted wound closure (VAWC) and&#xD;
      acellular matrix. HBO is the most commonly utilized at the investigators institution. Mixed&#xD;
      results of HBO in chronic diabetic foot ulcers are reported. Several studies reported that&#xD;
      the beneficial effects of HBO, but none showed universal success. Therefore, the development&#xD;
      of a new effective method of treatment for chronic diabetic ulcers is extremely valuable.&#xD;
      Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) acts as mechanotransduction that produces the&#xD;
      therapeutic benefits through complex biological pathways including neovascularization and&#xD;
      tissue regeneration. ESWT also showed bacteriostatic effects in experiments. Some studies&#xD;
      reported the effectiveness of ESWT in acute and chronic soft tissue wounds. Others reported&#xD;
      effectiveness of ESWT in chronic ulcers with 50% completely healed with 6 sessions of&#xD;
      treatment. With this background, it appears that ESWT may be effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic diabetic foot ulcers. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ESWT&#xD;
      in chronic foot ulcers, and to compared with that treated with HBO, and to study the&#xD;
      molecular and blood flow perfusion before and after ESWT.&#xD;

      【Background and Purpose】Management of chronic diabetic and ulcers require multidisciplinary&#xD;
      approaches including diabetic control, wound care, antibiotic, shoe wear off loading, and&#xD;
      surgery in selected cases. The results are inconsistent and irregular, and most studies&#xD;
      reported unsatisfactory results. Many adjunctive therapies are implemented in the care of&#xD;
      chronic skin ulcers including hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO), ultrasound, recombinant human&#xD;
      platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rPDGF-BB), vacuum assisted wound closure (VAWC) and&#xD;
      acellular matrix. HBO is the most commonly utilized at our institution. Mixed results of HBO&#xD;
      in chronic skin ulcers are reported. Several studies reported the beneficial effects in&#xD;
      chronic skin ulcers, but none showed universal success. Therefore, the development of a new&#xD;
      effective method of treatment for chronic skin ulcers is extremely valuable. Wang et al&#xD;
      demonstrated that extracorporeal shockwave acts as mechanotransduction that produces the&#xD;
      therapeutic benefits through complex biological pathways including neovascularization and&#xD;
      tissue regeneration. Gerdesmeyer et al showed bacteriostatic effects of shockwave in&#xD;
      experiments. Schaden et al reported the effectiveness of extracorporeal shockwave in acute&#xD;
      and chronic soft tissue wounds. Saggini et all reported effectiveness of ESWT in chronic skin&#xD;
      ulcers with 50% completely healed within 6 sessions of treatment. However, no working&#xD;
      mechanism of ESWT was discussed. With this background, it appears that extracorporeal&#xD;
      shockwave may be effective in the treatment of chronic diabetic ulcers. We have conducted a&#xD;
      pilot study using orthowave 180 (TRT, Woodstock, GA) in the treatment of chronic ulcers. The&#xD;
      preliminary results of a pilot study in 26 patients with 31 ulcers showed healed or &gt;50%&#xD;
      improved ulcers in 90%, 10% unchanged and none worse. The results of the pilot study was&#xD;
      published by the Journal of Surgical Research 2009; 152: 96-103. The poster exhibit of this&#xD;
      study won the 1st place award in the category of tumor and metabolism of the 75th AAOS annual&#xD;
      meeting in San Francisco, CA in March 2008. This study continues the research using&#xD;
      derma-PACE (derma-pulse acoustic cellular expression). Derma-PACE (Sanuwave, Alpharetta, GA)&#xD;
      is a new shockwave device designed for the treatment of diabetic ulcers. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Derma-PACE shockwave device in the treatment&#xD;
      of chronic diabetic ulcers, and to compare the results with that of hyperbaric oxygen&#xD;
      therapy, and to investigate the blood flow perfusion, histopathological examination and&#xD;
      immunohistochemical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      【Patient selection】This study is approved by The Institutional Review Board on Human Studies.&#xD;
      The procedures are performed in accordance with the standards of the Ethical Committee and&#xD;
      the Declaration of Helsinki in 1975. All patients are required to sign an informed consent&#xD;
      prior to participation in the study. The inclusion criteria include patients with recurrent&#xD;
      chronic diabetic ulcers of the extremities for longer than 3 months duration. The exclusion&#xD;
      criteria include patients with cardiac arrhythmia or pacemaker, pregnancy, skeletal&#xD;
      immaturity patients with malignancy, patients with joint sepsis, ulcers around the skull,&#xD;
      spine and chest wall, and patients with poor compliance. A power analysis revealed that a&#xD;
      sample size of 32 in each group would be required to establish the statistical significance&#xD;
      with α = 0.05 and power = 0.8. We anticipate a drop-out rate of 10 to 15% for various reasons&#xD;
      during the course of treatment. Therefore, we plan to recruit 100 patients in the study.&#xD;
      Patients are randomly divided into two groups with 50 patients in the shockwave group, and 50&#xD;
      patients in the HBO group who are treated with HBOT. All patients receive the same protocol&#xD;
      of diabetic control, wound care, antibiotics and corrective shoe wear etc. Pre-treatment&#xD;
      evaluations include complete history and physical examination, chemistry and coagulation&#xD;
      profiles, detailed past surgical and medical treatments. The ankle-brachial index (AKI) and&#xD;
      HBA1C are assessed individually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      【Technical descriptions】 【Shockwave application】The derma-PACE device is set at E2 @ 4 Hz&#xD;
      with the energy level at 0.11 mJ/mm² energy flux density. The dosage of shockwave is wound&#xD;
      size dependent. The treatment area includes the actual wound area extended 1.0 cm periphery&#xD;
      in every direction. The number of pulses = treatment area (cm²) x 8, but in any case at least&#xD;
      500 shocks. The treatment is performed twice/week for a total of 6 treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      【Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy】Patients receive hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) in a sealed&#xD;
      multi-place chamber at a pressure of 2.5 atmospheres absolute (ATA). The treatment starts&#xD;
      with the compression of air pressure from 1 ATA to 2.5 ATA in 15 minutes. Patients breathe&#xD;
      with 100% medical grade O2 with mask for 25 minutes and take off the mask for O2 break for 5&#xD;
      minutes, and then, repeat breathing 100% O2 with mask for another 25 minutes and off mask for&#xD;
      O2 break for 5 minutes. At the end of treatment, the chamber air pressure is decompressed&#xD;
      from 2.5 ATA with O2 mask to 1 ATA in 15 minutes. Each patient receives HBO daily, five days&#xD;
      a week for a total of 40 treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      【Evaluation parameters:】The evaluation parameters include clinical assessment, local blood&#xD;
      flow perfusion, bacteriological examination, histopathological evaluation and&#xD;
      immunohistochemical analysis from the biopsy specimens. The ulcers are quantitatively&#xD;
      assessed using the S(AD)SAD classification for the size, shape and configuration with&#xD;
      photo-documentation before and after treatment. The neuropathic sensory change of the foot is&#xD;
      examined with pin-prick test. The circulatory status of the affected limb is evaluated with&#xD;
      digital palpation of the dorsalis pulsation and ultrasound Doppler perfusion scan. Local&#xD;
      blood flow perfusion scan, bacterial culture and sensitivity, and biopsy from the periphary&#xD;
      of the ulcer including normal skin is performed before and after treatment, and the specimens&#xD;
      are subjected to histomorphological examination and immunohistochemicial stain. The data&#xD;
      before and after treatment within the same group and the data between the two groups will be&#xD;
      analyzed statistically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      【Anticipated work schedules and results:】We estimate to enroll 2 to 3 patients per week, and&#xD;
      it will take approximately one year to recruit sufficient number of patients. It will require&#xD;
      12 additional months for follow-up. Therefore, we estimate a total of three years to complete&#xD;
      this study. We anticipate favorable results of ESWT in chronic diabetic ulcers. We also&#xD;
      anticipate superior results with ESWT over HBO therapy. Furthermore, we anticipate the&#xD;
      improvement in local blood flow perfusion, antibacterial effect as well as angiogenesis and&#xD;
      tissue regeneration effects after ESWT. This novel method of treatment may bring in a new&#xD;
      insight in the management of chronic diabetic ulcers. Shockwave has the potential to cure&#xD;
      chronic skin ulcers without surgery and directly benefits thousands of patients who suffer&#xD;
      from this disastrous disease.&#xD;
