    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the combination of two anticancer drugs, everolimus&#xD;
      (RAD001) and lenalidomide in patients whose cancer is no longer responding to standard&#xD;
      treatment or patients who are unable to tolerate the standard treatment for their cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the combination of two anticancer drugs, everolimus&#xD;
      (RAD001) and lenalidomide in patients whose cancer is no longer responding to standard&#xD;
      treatment or patients who are unable to tolerate the standard treatment for their cancer. The&#xD;
      investigators seek to establish the safety of taking these two medications together and to&#xD;
      determine the appropriate doses of the two drugs when given together as well as identify&#xD;
      potential side effects when the drugs are administered together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another purpose of this study is to find out if the medication works for the patient's kind&#xD;
      of cancer and side effects of the combination of RAD001 and lenalidomide by looking at the&#xD;
      patient's response to the treatment. The investigators want to find out what effects, good or&#xD;
      bad, the drugs have on the patient's cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also look at specific substances called biomarkers in the patient's blood and&#xD;
      in the tumor tissue which are involved in the growth of tumor cells and determine if the&#xD;
      levels of these biomarkers are related to the patient's response to treatment or development&#xD;
      of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An expansion cohort is currently enrolling patients with adenoidcystic carcinoma,&#xD;
      neuroendocrine and kidney cancer.&#xD;

          -  Histologic or cytologic confirmation of a solid malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form. Because no dosing or&#xD;
             adverse event data are currently available on the use of everolimus in combination&#xD;
             with lenalidomide in patients &lt; 18 years of age, children are excluded from this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;

             must be evidence of progression since the radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with advanced refractory solid malignancies or intolerant of standard&#xD;
             therapy for the stage of the disease (because there is currently no standard approved&#xD;
             therapy for adenoidcystic carcinoma, therefore there is no requirement of prior&#xD;
             therapy for this patient population).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All previous cancer therapy, including radiation, hormonal therapy and surgery, must&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
