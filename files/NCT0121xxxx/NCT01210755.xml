      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the effect of the two new anticoagulants,&#xD;
      Dabigatran and Rivaroxaban, can be reversed by non-specific and specific inhibitors. For&#xD;
      Dabigatran the investigators will test the non-specific inhibitors: prothrombin complex&#xD;
      concentrate (PCC), recombinant activated coagulation factor VII, and activated&#xD;
      prothrombin-complex (FEIBA). For Rivaroxaban the investigators will test a specific&#xD;
      Rivaroxaban decoy (FXa-GLAless). This will be done in a laboratory using blood plasma from&#xD;
      healthy male volunteers.&#xD;

      Background and objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the most widely prescribed long term anticoagulant drugs are anti vitamin K agents&#xD;
      (AVK). They should be used with caution because they are drugs that have a narrow therapeutic&#xD;
      range: the difference between the effective dose and toxic dose is small. Their use thus&#xD;
      requires careful laboratory monitoring. They can cause bleeding complications in the case of&#xD;
      overdose. The AVKs have two antidotes: Vitamin K and prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC).&#xD;
      These reverse the anticoagulant effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, new types of anticoagulants have been marketed in particular Rivaroxaban&#xD;
      (Xarelto ®) and Dabigatran (Pradaxa ®). The way they act is different from that of AVK. They&#xD;
      have the advantage of having a wider therapeutic range. Their use is therefore easier. They&#xD;
      do not require such regular monitoring. However, currently, no antidote has been evaluated to&#xD;
      reverse the effect of these anticoagulants in case of emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the effect of the two new anticoagulants can&#xD;
      be reversed by non-specific and specific inhibitors. For Dabigatran we will test the&#xD;
      non-specific inhibitors prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), recombinant activated&#xD;
      coagulation factor VII, and activated prothrombin complex (FEIBA). For Rivaroxaban we will&#xD;
      test a specific Rivaroxaban decoy (FXa-GLAless). This will be done in a laboratory using&#xD;
      blood plasma from healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a proof of concept, single centre, randomized, open, controlled, cross-over,phase IV&#xD;
      study involving 10 healthy volunteers Each volunteer will be asked to attend an enrolment&#xD;
      visit in which they will be given information about the study and asked to sign a written&#xD;
      consent form. They will have an electrocardiogram test, their blood pressure and pulse will&#xD;
      be measured, their medical history noted, and samples of blood and of urine will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the second visit they will be given one dose of either Rivaroxaban (20mg) or of Dabigatran&#xD;
      (150mg), allocated randomly, and 5 samples of blood (in total 67.5mL)will be taken over a&#xD;
      period of 4 hours via a catheter. The blood samples will be immediately centrifuged and&#xD;
      frozen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 3rd visit, 15 days later, the volunteer will have a medical examination prior to&#xD;
      taking the other drug. This visit will then follow the same procedure as the 2nd visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 4th visit a medical examination will be made and blood and urine samples taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma samples will be analysed and challenged with the inhibitors in the biochemistry and&#xD;
      haematology departments of Grenoble University Hospital.&#xD;
