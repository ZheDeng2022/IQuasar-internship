  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitroglycerin is a nitric oxide donor which is mainly known as a vasodilating agent used in&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease. It has also been shown to increase tumor blood flow in animal and&#xD;
      human tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of nitroglycerin to chemotherapy in non small cell lung cancer has been shown to&#xD;
      generate very favorable response rates with respect to standard treatment schedules[5].&#xD;
      Theoretically nitroglycerin might reduce resistance to chemotherapy via a plethora of&#xD;
      different effects: better tumor perfusion, direct effects of NO on cancer cells, increase in&#xD;
      activated p53 protein and via an increased blood flow in the tumour with as consequence a&#xD;
      higher drug concentration in the tumor [6] .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In mice, nitric oxide donors such as isosorbide dinitrate have been shown to decrease tumor&#xD;
      hypoxia by better tumor perfusion, which could enhance radiotherapy responses [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date these combined effects have not been tested in humans. In this trial we would like to&#xD;
      demonstrate the effect of nitroglycerin on tumor perfusion and hypoxia in non small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (using DCE and HX4 scanning), providing a rationale for further study and to test the&#xD;
      effect of combining nitroglycerine to standard treatment of NSCLC&#xD;
      (radiotherapy/chemotherapy).&#xD;

      Namely, the failure of many different tumor types to show a lasting response chemotherapy or&#xD;
      radiotherapy might be attributable to a lack of oxygen supply (called &quot;hypoxia&quot; from hereon)&#xD;
      in a large part of the cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor hypoxia is a well-known factor negatively influencing outcome in many solid tumors,&#xD;
      including lung cancer, head and neck cancer, etc. Hypoxic cells are more radio-resistant,&#xD;
      more chemo-resistant and more prone to develop distant metastases than normoxic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitroglycerin, due to it's vasoactive effects, tends to redistribute the blood supply to the&#xD;
      tumor, increasing tumor blood flow, hereby theoretically decreasing hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that NO donating drugs can alter tumor blood flow and oxygenation status in&#xD;
      animal models [7]. In a randomized phase 2 trial by Yasuda nitroglycerin has been&#xD;
      successfully combined at a dose of 25 mg daily for 5 days each chemo cycle with cisplatin and&#xD;
      vinorelbine in non small cell lung cancer, enhancing chemotherapy response, possibly due to&#xD;
      better delivery of the anti-cancer drugs in the tumor[5]. The toxicity profile between the 2&#xD;
      arms was not significantly different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of nitroglycerin or other donating drugs on cancer have been found to be&#xD;
      numerous: not only is there an increase in tumor bloodflow, also direct effects on&#xD;
      stabilization of p53 and degradation of Hif-1 alpha have been found[6]. Decreased hypoxic&#xD;
      biomarkers (eg VEGF, P-glycoprotein) have been found in patients with NSCLC treated with&#xD;
      nitroglycerin patches for 3 days prior to surgery when compared to non-treated individuals&#xD;
      [8]. There might also be a supplementary effect on the MHC-molecules, rendering tumor cells&#xD;
      more &quot;visible&quot; to the immune system [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, hypoxia has been shown in vitro to increase the invasiveness of cancer cells in&#xD;
      an NO-mediated manner, which can be blocked by NO-donors.[10] An interesting study in this&#xD;
      respect is a non-randomized phase 2 trial by Siemens et al, in which a very low dose of&#xD;
      nitroglycerin (Minitran 5 patch (18 mg) cut in 6 pieces, delivering 0.033 mg/h in stead of&#xD;
      0.2 mg/h normally) was given to patients with biochemical recurrence (PSA-failure) after&#xD;
      primary therapy. After 24 months the PSA doubling time was more than 31 months versus 12.8&#xD;
      months before the start of therapy, demonstrating the inhibitory effect of nitroglycerin on&#xD;
      prostate cancer cells. [11]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to these effects and the effect on tumor bloodflow and decrease of hypoxia nitroglycerin&#xD;
      might also be interesting as a radiosensitizing agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently a Mexican phase 2 trial is recruiting 40 patients to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      nitroglycerin added to concurrent chemoradiotherapy in NSCLC stage III. (Clinical trials.gov&#xD;
      identifier NCT00886405).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is not only to demonstrate the effect of nitroglycerin on&#xD;
      perfusion and hypoxia through (HX4-)scanning of patients, but also documenting the efficacy&#xD;
      of the approach of giving nitroglycerin in an on/off (12h/12h) schedule to people receiving&#xD;
      (chemo-)/radiotherapy, whilst monitoring toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The on-off schedule is chosen because of the existence of a tolerance effect on the vascular&#xD;
      system, hence diminishing the effect of nitroglycerin already after the first 24 hours.&#xD;
