  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children treated for a brain tumor (BT) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) show elevated&#xD;
      rates of working memory impairment. Working memory (WM) is the ability to hold and manipulate&#xD;
      information online; for example, when an individual mentally rehearses a phone number in&#xD;
      order to dial it without writing it down. A computer-based working memory intervention has&#xD;
      been successful in children diagnosed with ADHD and stroke survivors. Individuals&#xD;
      participating in the intervention showed improvements on working memory measures as well as&#xD;
      more complex problem solving skills. Neuroimaging (brain scans) conducted before and after&#xD;
      training showed changes in brain activation suggestive of underlying changes in brain systems&#xD;
      that support working memory. This study investigates the effectiveness of this computer-based&#xD;
      working memory intervention for childhood cancer survivors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants randomized to the intervention arm will complete the computerized working memory&#xD;
      training program. This computer-based training program is completed in the home and requires&#xD;
      approximately 30 minutes every weekday for five weeks. The program software guides the child&#xD;
      through eight rotating exercises each day, with increasing difficulty based on the child's&#xD;
      level of performance. Exercises train both visuospatial and verbal WM using child-friendly&#xD;
      activities. A research team member will serve as a coach who monitors weekly progress online&#xD;
      and offers support through weekly phone calls with the study participants and their&#xD;
      caregivers. This individual will not complete post-intervention assessments to maintain study&#xD;
      blind. A home computer with internet connection and speakers is required. A laptop computer&#xD;
      and/or wireless internet access will be provided to families whose only obstacle to&#xD;
      participation is lack of computer access or internet connectivity in the home setting.&#xD;
      Families randomized to the WM intervention will complete a tutorial with study staff that&#xD;
      provides instruction in using a computer, the internet and the WM training software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate the benefits of this working memory&#xD;
      intervention in a sample of childhood cancer survivors and look at brain-based changes that&#xD;
      may occur as the result of working memory intervention. To achieve this goal, we plan to&#xD;
      study childhood cancer survivors randomly assigned to the working memory intervention or a&#xD;
      passive waitlist. Both groups will participate in cognitive testing pre-, post-, and six&#xD;
      months post intervention. Intervention participants will also partake in neuroimaging exams&#xD;
      before and after the intervention. Findings from this study have direct potential to support&#xD;
      a nonpharmaceutical cognitive intervention for cancer survivors that is a safe and effective&#xD;
      alternative to stimulant medications with great promise for improving quality of life.&#xD;
