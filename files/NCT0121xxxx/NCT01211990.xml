      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - State-of-the art care for children with cancer or rare diseases is not available in all&#xD;
      countries. Owing to the proximity of Latin America and the growing numbers of Latinos already&#xD;
      in the United States, many international patients receiving specialized medical care in U.S.&#xD;
      hospitals are from Spanish-speaking countries. Although there are benefits associated with&#xD;
      obtaining specialized care in the United States, linguistic barriers and cultural differences&#xD;
      as well as the general stresses of caring for a child with a serious illness may affect&#xD;
      families ability to obtain adequate care for their children. Researchers are interested in&#xD;
      exploring the experiences and needs of international Latino families receiving medical care&#xD;
      for their child in the United States in order to help health care centers provide more&#xD;
      appropriate resources and improve the overall quality of culturally sensitive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To understand the experiences of international Latino families who are receiving treatment&#xD;
      for their child or have enrolled their child in a research study in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caregivers of a child between birth and 25 years of ages who are from Latin America&#xD;
           (which includes Mexico, all countries in Central America and South America, and&#xD;
           Spanish-speaking Caribbean countries) and who have traveled to the United States to&#xD;
           enroll their child in a research protocol and/or seek treatment for their child s&#xD;
           medical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caregivers must have a child enrolled on a research protocol at the time of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caregivers must have been away from their country of origin for a minimum of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study requires a single interview that should take approximately 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete the interview with a member of the research team who is&#xD;
           bilingual or fluent in Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked open-ended questions about why they chose to come to the&#xD;
           United States, how they are adjusting to living and getting medical care for their child&#xD;
           in the United States, and what hopes they have for treatment outcomes and future medical&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will record the interviews to be reviewed later. The recordings will be used&#xD;
           for this study only.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of individuals who choose to travel out of their native country for medical&#xD;
      treatment in the United States has been growing (Purnell &amp; Paulanka, 1998). State-of-the art&#xD;
      care for children with cancer or rare diseases is not available in all countries, especially&#xD;
      those where the ubiquity of cancer is a new phenomenon (Granda-Cameron, 1999). Due to the&#xD;
      proximity of Latin America and the growing numbers of Latinos already in the United States,&#xD;
      many, though not all, of the international patients being treated in U.S. hospitals are from&#xD;
      Spanish-speaking countries (Coatsworth, Duncan, Pantin, &amp; Szapocznik, 2006). While there are&#xD;
      benefits associated with obtaining care in the United States such as improved access to&#xD;
      specialized medical services, barriers posed by linguistic and cultural differences may play&#xD;
      a role in the provision of adequate care for these children and their families. Additional&#xD;
      challenges associated with receiving care in another country include failure to adhere to&#xD;
      medical regimen due to breakdowns in communication, increased stress upon the caregiver to&#xD;
      navigate a foreign health system and adjust to a foreign culture, and being uprooted from&#xD;
      supportive social networks and family members (Flores, Abreu, Schwartz, &amp; Hill, 2000).&#xD;
      Parents of children with more severe and/or complex diseases may find themselves settling in&#xD;
      the United States at the cost of leaving behind loved ones and careers in their country of&#xD;
      origin. Provision of optimal care for these patients includes addressing the adjustment needs&#xD;
      of their families; the caregiver-patient relationship has a significant influence on the&#xD;
      child s physical and psychological outcomes (Brown et al., 2008). Exploring the experiences&#xD;
      and needs of internationalfamilies that come to the United States seeking medical care for&#xD;
      their child may help health care centers to provide more appropriate resources and may&#xD;
      improve the overall quality of culturally-sensitive care provided to these families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This is a pilot, exploratory study designed to obtain greater understanding about&#xD;
      the unique experiences of international families, mostly Latino families, who choose to&#xD;
      participate in clinical research or seek medical treatment in the United States. Due to the&#xD;
      lack of research on this phenomenon, the study will utilize qualitative methods to&#xD;
      extrapolate the main themes that characterize this experience. The end goal of the study is&#xD;
      to identify unique risk and protective factors that link directly to feasible interventions,&#xD;
      so that we can provide this growing population with the standard of care expected by the&#xD;
      mission of the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify factors affecting the decision by international caregivers to seek treatment in&#xD;
      the United States, with a specific focus on how medical information is obtained and utilized&#xD;
      in the decision-making process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the experience of international caregivers in adapting to the medical and social&#xD;
      culture of the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the thoughts and concerns of international caregivers regarding termination of&#xD;
      treatment and subsequent re-entry into their native country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the presence and kind of positive growth experiences that occur in international&#xD;
      families seeking medical care in the United States&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop a set of concrete risk and protective factors associated with this experience in&#xD;
      order to link to feasible interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (The term caregiver in this protocol is used to encapsulate any individual, such as a parent,&#xD;
      close relative, foster parent, or head of household, who attends to the needs of the ill&#xD;
      child.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a study taking place at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). All caregivers of a&#xD;
      child between the ages of 0-25 from a foreign country who have traveled to the United States&#xD;
      for the purpose of enrolling in a research protocol and/or seeking treatment for their child&#xD;
      s medical condition will be invited to participate in this study. Caregivers who immigrated&#xD;
      to the United States for reasons other than obtaining these services for their child s&#xD;
      condition will not be eligible to enroll in this study. Given the present demographic&#xD;
      populations at NIH, it is expected that participants will include, but not be limited to,&#xD;
      individuals from the Caribbean, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Chile, Peru, Guatemala, and&#xD;
      Mexico. This sampling frame ensures that the presence of black, white, and mixed race&#xD;
      individuals will be represented, acknowledging ethnicities that are often overlooked in&#xD;
      studies focusing specifically on the experience of a given ethnic or racial group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socioeconomic situation of the families is expected to vary widely; at NIH, individuals who&#xD;
      meet the criteria for this study are from all different socioeconomic strata and have varying&#xD;
      levels of education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a qualitative study that will utilize narrative interview techniques to gather data,&#xD;
      and content analysis techniques to analyze data. Data will be gathered according to theories&#xD;
      of saturation of content, while collecting sufficient data to ensure credibility and face&#xD;
      validity (Mays &amp; Pope, 2000). NVivo, a validated quantitative research tool will be used for&#xD;
      data analysis.&#xD;
