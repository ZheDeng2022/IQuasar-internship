      The clinical evaluation of the HOMESWEETHOME project sets out to assess the long-term effects&#xD;
      of continuous assistance offered by the HOMESWEETHOME services to older people living&#xD;
      independently. The trial will test the hypothesis that while providing a level of safety&#xD;
      equivalent to or better than that enjoyed in older people&quot;s homes, there is a significant&#xD;
      positive effect on the quality of life (QoL) and the duration of independently living of&#xD;
      older people.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HOMESWEETHOME clinical trial is conducted as a multi-centre randomised control trial&#xD;
      (RCT), across four pilot sites. The trial design, analysis and reporting follow the &quot;Revised&#xD;
      CONSORT - Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials - Statement&quot; and subsequent additions to&#xD;
      the CONSORT statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOMESWEETHOME services are expected to result in an outcome that is superior to usual care&#xD;
      alone in reducing deterioration of health related quality of life and function associated&#xD;
      with age and chronic disease. This effect will be measured by assessing different outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical evaluation of the HOMESWEETHOME project sets out to assess the long-term effects&#xD;
      of continuous assistance offered by the HOMESWEETHOME services to older people living&#xD;
      independently. The trial will test the hypothesis that while providing a level of safety&#xD;
      equivalent to or better than that enjoyed in older people&quot;s homes, there is a significant&#xD;
      positive effect on the quality of life (QoL) and the duration of independently living of&#xD;
      older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted in four sites within the European Union, these sites will have the&#xD;
      number of participants randomised into Intervention Group and Control Group, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Belgium - City of Antwerp 30 + 30&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catalonia - Town of Badalona 15 + 15&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ireland - North Eastern Region 30 + 30&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Italy - Town of Latina 30 + 30 The main inclusion criteria for participants&quot; entry into&#xD;
           the trial will be based on frailty. Frailty is a concept associated with adverse&#xD;
           outcomes such as higher morbidity, more hospitalisations and falls, and a lower quality&#xD;
           of life. Furthermore, frailty predicts - better than age - the evolution to disability&#xD;
           and death. Participants must also be 65 years or over, and living at home. The main&#xD;
           reasons for excluding participants will be based on their physical or mental (in)ability&#xD;
           to take part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary clinical outcome for the trials will be measured based on the Health Status&#xD;
      Questionnaire Short Form 36 (SF-36) (v2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be measured using Edmonton Frailty Scale (EFS), Comprehensive&#xD;
      Geriatric Assessment (CGA), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), and Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression Scale (HADS). A number of medical events will also be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be taken at trial start, trial mid-term, and trial end. Measurements will&#xD;
      be entered, anonymously, into a database for analysis of results. The trial population size&#xD;
      has been subjected to a statistical power analysis, to ensure statistical significance of&#xD;
      project results.&#xD;
