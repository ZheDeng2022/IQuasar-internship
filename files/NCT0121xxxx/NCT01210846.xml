  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain QTc data, to assess the effects of tivozanib on ECG&#xD;
      morphology, and to determine the pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) relationship between&#xD;
      any observed changes in cardiac repolarization (defined by QTcF duration) and the serum&#xD;
      concentration of tivozanib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tivozanib is a novel and potent pan-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor&#xD;
      (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent activity against all 3 VEGFRs (VEGFR-1, -2, and&#xD;
      -3). In nonclinical models and studies performed in humans, tivozanib has shown strong&#xD;
      antiangiogenesis and antitumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open-label, non-randomized, exploratory single-arm trial evaluating the ECG&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetic (PK)-ECG relationship, if any, of tivozanib in subjects with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ECG intervals and morphology following treatment&#xD;
      with tivozanib in subjects with advanced solid tumors and to determine the relationship, if&#xD;
      any, of the change in QTc duration with serum concentration of tivozanib over time in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

        fenprocoumon, or similar agents. If previously receiving these types of agents, a minimum&#xD;
        washout of 1 week and documented PT of &lt; 1.5 × ULN will be required prior to start of&#xD;
        therapy. Full dose anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated&#xD;
        heparin administered subcutaneously is allowed. Low dose oral anticoagulation (eg, 1-2&#xD;
        mg/day warfarin) is allowed provided PT remains &lt; 1.5 × ULN during the study.&#xD;
