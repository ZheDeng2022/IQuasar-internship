  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this study are to examine whether treatment with transdermal nicotine&#xD;
      improves computer-based laboratory and clinical measures of impulsive and compulsive&#xD;
      behaviors in Parkinson's Disease subjects who have recently experienced an impulse control&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, a group of behavior changes collectively called Impulse Control Disorders&#xD;
      (ICDs) have been identified in Parkinson's Disease (PD). ICDs have a broad range of possible&#xD;
      symptoms such as compulsive gambling, shopping, hypersexual behavior, overeating; spending&#xD;
      excessive amounts of time on hobbies, tasks, or other organized activities; walking or&#xD;
      driving without a goal or purpose; hoarding or overuse of PD medications. It is estimated&#xD;
      that as many as 30% of people with PD experience ICDs during the course of their condition.&#xD;
      ICDs are believed to occur due to effects of dopamine enhancing medications in areas of the&#xD;
      brain which regulate behavior (rather than their intended target areas that regulate&#xD;
      movement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reduction or discontinuation of PD medications can be helpful in reducing ICDs.&#xD;
      Unfortunately reduction in medication is often impractical or not possible because people&#xD;
      with PD rely on these medications to improve their movement symptoms. There are currently no&#xD;
      scientifically proven treatments for ICDs except for PD medication reductions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acetylcholine is a chemical in the brain which works to regulate the effects of dopamine. It&#xD;
      has been known for many years that nicotine imitates many of the actions of acetylcholine. In&#xD;
      preliminary studies, nicotine has been shown to reduce impulsive behavior in Attention&#xD;
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. By administering nicotine across the skin using a patch, we&#xD;
      hope to better understand whether nicotine may act to improve impulse control disorders in PD&#xD;
      without needing to reduce or stop PD medications. Several studies have shown that nicotine is&#xD;
      tolerated well by people with PD, and does not appear to worsen motor/movement symptoms. The&#xD;
      amount of nicotine in each patch used in this study is the same as patches that are used in&#xD;
      people who are trying to quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot within-subject crossover placebo-controlled study, subjects with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease who have recently experiencing an impulse control disorder will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Subjects will randomized to one of two treatment groups. During the first portion&#xD;
      of the study, the first treatment group will receive transdermal nicotine (nicotine by skin&#xD;
      patch) and the second treatment group will receive an identical placebo patch which does not&#xD;
      contain any nicotine. Over the course of the study, each of the two groups will switch to&#xD;
      receive whichever treatment they were not initially receiving (for example-the first&#xD;
      treatment group will later receive the placebo patch and the second treatment group will&#xD;
      later receive the nicotine patch). Each treatment group will receive the nicotine patch or&#xD;
      placebo patch for an equal number of weeks, but at different times during the study. Clinical&#xD;
      and laboratory computer based measurements of impulsive and compulsive behaviors, memory&#xD;
      testing, sleep quality/ sleepiness, and Parkinson's disease symptoms will be assessed at each&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;

    <description>The Stop Signal Task is best described as a laboratory measure of inhibitory control. The task itself requires quick execution of a thought or action, and the occasional inhibition of this behavior. On the computerized task subjects are asked to respond as fast as they can to symbols (ex. letters) presented on a computer screen.</description>

    <measure>Set shifting task</measure>
    <time_frame>12-20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It has been considered a measure of executive function because of its reported sensitivity to frontal lobe dysfunction. As such, the WCST allows the clinician to assess the following &quot;frontal&quot; lobe functions: strategic planning, organized searching, utilizing environmental feedback to shift cognitive sets, directing behavior toward achieving a goal, and modulating impulsive responding.</description>
