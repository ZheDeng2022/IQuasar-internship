    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combination of oxaliplatin and capecitabine with or without bevacizumab that can be given to&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancer that has spread to the liver. The safety of these drug&#xD;
      combinations will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin is designed to keep new cancer cells from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine is designed to interfere with the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is designed to block the growth of blood vessels that supply nutrients necessary&#xD;
      for tumor growth. This may prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells. Bevacizumab is no&#xD;
      longer FDA approved to treat breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      &quot;arm&quot; based on the results of your screening tests. All patients will receive oxaliplatin and&#xD;
      capecitabine. If your doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you will also receive&#xD;
      bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Arm 1, you will receive oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Arm 2, you will receive oxaliplatin and capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be assigned to a dose level of capecitabine based on when you joined this study. Up&#xD;
      to 4 dose levels of capecitabine will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at&#xD;
      each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new&#xD;
      group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects&#xD;
      were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of capecitabine is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose levels of oxaliplatin and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be assigned to a dose level of capecitabine based on when you joined this study. Up&#xD;
      to 4 dose levels of capecitabine will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at&#xD;
      each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new&#xD;
      group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects&#xD;
      were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of capecitabine is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose levels of oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, after the highest tolerable dose is found for each arm, if a certain tumor type&#xD;
      is found to have responded well to the study drug combination, 14 participants with that&#xD;
      tumor type will receive the study drugs at that dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each arm, after the highest tolerable dose of the study drug combination is found, up to&#xD;
      20 extra participants with any tumor type will receive that dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, after the highest tolerable dose is found for each arm, if a certain tumor type&#xD;
      is found to have responded well to the study drug combination, 14 participants with that&#xD;
      tumor type will receive the study drugs at that dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter Placement for Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be hospitalized to receive the study drug combination. On the day of your admission&#xD;
      to the hospital, you will have a catheter (a sterile flexible tube that will be placed in the&#xD;
      hepatic artery [a blood vessel in the liver] while you are under local anesthesia) through&#xD;
      which you will receive the study drugs. The catheter will be placed and removed during each&#xD;
      cycle. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be&#xD;
      required to sign a separate consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You must lay in bed for the entire time that the catheter is in place. The catheter will&#xD;
      either be removed right after your chemotherapy or it may remain in overnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of oxaliplatin and bevacizumab, you will receive a total of 28 doses of&#xD;
      capecitabine, 1 dose twice daily. You will then receive bevacizumab by vein over 1Â½ hours.&#xD;
      The first time you receive bevacizumab, it will be given over 90 minutes. If you tolerate it&#xD;
      well, the rest of the doses will be given over 30-60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1-14 of each cycle, you will take capecitabine by mouth 2 times each day. You should&#xD;
      take it with a cup (8 ounces) of non-carbonated water within 30 minutes after a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each 21-day cycle, you will receive oxaliplatin through the catheter over 2&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of oxaliplatin and bevacizumab, you will receive a total of 28 doses of&#xD;
      capecitabine, 1 dose twice daily. You should take it with a cup (8 ounces) of non-carbonated&#xD;
      water within 30 minutes after a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit, you will be asked about any other drugs you may be taking and about any&#xD;
      side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to test your blood's ability to clot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of every even cycle (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to test for tumor markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have scans to check the status of the disease. This may include a chest x-ray,&#xD;
           CT scan, MRI scan, a PET scan, and/or a PET/CT scan. If the study doctor thinks it is&#xD;
           more appropriate for you, other types of scans may need to be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drug combination for as long as the doctor thinks it is in&#xD;
      your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug combination if the&#xD;
      disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease is only in your liver and you have responded to treatment, you may be eligible&#xD;
      to receive surgery. If eligible, you will receive surgery 6 weeks after taking your last dose&#xD;
      of study drugs if you are in Arm 1 or 4 weeks after taking your last dose of study drugs if&#xD;
      you are in Arm 2. The study doctor will discuss this with you in more detail and you will&#xD;
      sign a separate consent form if you have surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 6 weeks after your last dose of study drugs, the following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT scan, MRI scan, PET scan, or PET/CT scan to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease. If the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest, other types of scans&#xD;
           may also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Oxaliplatin is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of colorectal cancer. Bevacizumab is FDA approved and commercially available&#xD;
      for the treatment of colorectal and lung cancers. Capecitabine is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of colorectal and breast cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Giving the study drugs together for advanced cancer is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 116 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
