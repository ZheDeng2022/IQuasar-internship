    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if adding or increasing the dose of&#xD;
      CellCept while lowering the dose of tacrolimus (Prograf or Advagraf) or cyclosporine&#xD;
      (Neoral), and/or steroids can reduce the likelihood of developing coronary heart disease in&#xD;
      the next 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will calculate the change in risk of developing coronary heart disease&#xD;
      using the Framingham score. The Framingham score is a mathematical equation that includes the&#xD;
      following information: Age, Gender, Diabetes status, Smoking status, Lipids, Blood Pressure.&#xD;
      The Framingham score estimates how likely it is that someone will develop coronary heart&#xD;
      disease over the next 10 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Kidney transplant recipients are required to take medications called immunosuppressants to&#xD;
      lower their immune systems to help protect the donated kidney. The medications have improved&#xD;
      over the years and as a result the donated kidneys are generally working longer. This allows&#xD;
      the Transplant Team to focus more on the long term complications of kidney transplantation&#xD;
      such as cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been few prospective (looking forward) research studies looking at kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipient cardiovascular risk factors after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We know that immunosuppressive medications have a number of serious side effects that can&#xD;
      increase cardiovascular disease risk factors such as high blood pressure, high lipids (fats&#xD;
      in the blood), and high blood sugar. Medications such as tacrolimus, cyclosporine and&#xD;
      prednisone work well to protect the donated kidney but are also known to increase the risk of&#xD;
      developing or worsening cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CellCept is another type of immunosuppressive agent. CellCept is not associated as much with&#xD;
      the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study being done to collect information about cardiovascular risk factors in&#xD;
      kidney transplant recipients and to see if adjusting the immunosuppressive medications can&#xD;
      help to lower the overall risk for developing heart disease in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study plans to enroll 45 participants from 2 different transplant centres in&#xD;
      Canada: St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto and St. Paul's Hospital in Saskatoon. The study&#xD;
      duration is approximately 7 months per participant. The study will be looking for&#xD;
      participants who are 30 years of age or older and who are at least 6 months after the&#xD;
      transplant operation.&#xD;

    <description>Introduction of CellCept or increase in the dose of CellCept to a maximum of 2 g/day. In patients not already receiving CellCept, azathioprine (AZA), enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) or sirolimus (SRL) will be discontinued and replaced by CellCept in divided doses to a maximum of 2 g/day. CNI doses will be reduced to conform to the target trough levels in the low-dose CNI arms of the ELITE-Symphony study +/- steroid dose reduction. Any CNI dose change will require measurement of CNI trough levels at 7 days post dose change +/- 3 days.&#xD;
Target CNI trough levels in the Symphony study:&#xD;
Low-dose CsA: Initial oral dose of 1-2 mg/kg bid, to achieve a target trough level of 50-100 ng/mL.&#xD;
Low-dose TAC: Initial oral dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day divided into two doses* with a target trough level of 3-7 ng/mL (*Advagraf may also be used at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg once daily with a target trough level of 3-7 ng/mL)</description>
