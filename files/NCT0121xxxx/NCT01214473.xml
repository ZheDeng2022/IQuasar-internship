  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal sepsis (serious infection) continues to be one of the major causes of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in the newborn period around the world. India, with one of the world's largest&#xD;
      populations, continues to struggle with extremely high infant and neonatal mortality rates.&#xD;
      Sepsis accounts for 50% of deaths among community born (and 20% of mortality among&#xD;
      hospital-born) infants. Closely linked with this is a burgeoning problem of antimicrobial&#xD;
      resistance, which is increasingly restricting the therapeutic options for medical care&#xD;
      providers. Friendly bacteria called &quot;Probiotics&quot; have been used in multiple infectious and&#xD;
      inflammatory disease states in humans. Fructooligosaccharides are sugars found naturally in&#xD;
      many fruits and vegetables and also in human breast milk. These sugars reach the colon&#xD;
      undigested and serve as food for the friendly bacteria. The current study uses a probiotic&#xD;
      preparation containing Lactobacillus plantarum and fructooligosaccharides as an attempt to&#xD;
      prevent neonatal infections. Currently no conclusive data are available on the utility of&#xD;
      probiotics in such conditions. If successful, such inexpensive preventive therapy can be made&#xD;
      available to general public in resource poor countries. Similar preparations can also be used&#xD;
      in the western world to prevent similar infectious conditions of the neonatal period,&#xD;
      especially in preterm infants where sepsis continues to be a major cause of hospital stay and&#xD;
      death.&#xD;

      Our current study is an attempt to put the well known concept of probiotics through rigorous&#xD;
      scientific testing before it could be recommended as a prophylactic therapy against neonatal&#xD;
      infections. The study will be conducted in India in 8,442 infants who will receive once daily&#xD;
      dosing of probiotics for one week. They will be followed for 60 days at home. We have&#xD;
      designed the study with enough power to detect a 20% drop in the incidence rate and plan to&#xD;
      collect multiple other demographic data from the mothers and infants to help us discern the&#xD;
      possible contribution of other confounding risk factors that have been implicated as&#xD;
      cofactors in neonatal infection and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized controlled clinical trial involving probiotics (Lactobacillus&#xD;
      plantarum 10 billion bacteria and 150 mg of fructo-oligosaccharide). We will use our well&#xD;
      established three tier monitoring system in the villages. Infants with any adverse event&#xD;
      (including sepsis and other infections) will be brought to attached study hospitals for&#xD;
      clinical care. Blood and/or CSG culture will be done using Bactec blood culture system and&#xD;
      treatment will be provided based on clinical judgment and microbiological analysis of the&#xD;
      blood/CSF and/or other findings such as chest X-ray. Data entry will be done on site and&#xD;
      transmitted to the principal investigator's institution in the U.S. A data safety monitoring&#xD;
      board convened by expert clinicians, neonatologists, and biostatisticians will monitor the&#xD;
      study yearly and more frequently if required. Analyzed data will be published in appropriate&#xD;
      journals.&#xD;
