      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that affects numerous people worldwide.&#xD;
      Researchers are interested in actively recruiting individuals with TB for research and&#xD;
      treatment studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect blood and other samples to study the natural history of tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals 2 years of age and older who have either active or latent tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Latent TB patients: Participants will have a single study visit with a physical&#xD;
           examination and medical history, and will provide blood samples for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active TB patients: Participants will have an initial visit with a physical examination&#xD;
           and medical history, and will provide blood samples for testing. Participants will also&#xD;
           provide sputum samples if required, and may have an optional skin punch biopsy to&#xD;
           collect a sample of skin tissue for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment for active TB will be provided as part of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active TB participants may be asked to return for study visits every 1-2 months while&#xD;
           receiving treatment....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a slow-growing bacterium that establishes latent&#xD;
      infection in millions of persons worldwide, but only leads to disease in 10% or less of these&#xD;
      individuals. It typically causes pneumonia, however dissemination to almost any other organ&#xD;
      is possible. Drug resistance of the organism, co-infection with HIV, and paradoxical&#xD;
      reactions upon treatment are all factors that may complicate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Host defense against mycobacterial infections is important. Specific defects within the&#xD;
      innate immune system lead to Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial infections. HIV&#xD;
      infected individuals and persons treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor antibodies are&#xD;
      highly susceptible to tuberculosis (TB) infection. Genetic influence on susceptibility to TB&#xD;
      disease is complex and does not seem to be confined to a single gene or pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advancement in molecular techniques has expanded our understanding of the pathogenesis and&#xD;
      epidemiology of MTB. Identification of gene mutations that confer antibiotic resistance are&#xD;
      being exploited as alternatives to conventional drug susceptibility testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The natural history of all forms of TB disease (including co-infection with HIV and other&#xD;
      infections) will be followed, and MTB isolates and blood from 100 infected patients will be&#xD;
      obtained in order to study organism virulence and host immune function and genetic/epigenetic&#xD;
      factors. While it is recognized that the number of TB cases that occur in the Washington, DC&#xD;
      area and nationally is low, it is imperative that a mechanism is in place to evaluate and&#xD;
      treat these patients at the NIH Clinical Center. This protocol will also allow NIH infectious&#xD;
      diseases trainees to manage challenging cases of TB.&#xD;

        Patients will be referred by their physicians for study participation. In many cases,&#xD;
        participants will be referred by physicians at their local health department tuberculosis&#xD;
        clinics (where they often receive DOT for TB treatment). Family members may be recruited&#xD;
        through requests made by the index case that family members contact study personnel for&#xD;
        participation. A patient can be referred at any time point while he or she is receiving&#xD;
        active treatment for tuberculosis. Male and female patients will be accepted without&#xD;
        preference. Patients age 2 and older are eligible; however, severe infections may require&#xD;
        highly specialized pediatric teams and institutions. Some referrals of pediatric cases will&#xD;
        not be able to be handled appropriately at the NIH and may be deemed ineligible for&#xD;
        admission, as determined by the Principal Investigator (PI). NIH employees and members of&#xD;
        their immediate families may participate in this protocol.&#xD;
