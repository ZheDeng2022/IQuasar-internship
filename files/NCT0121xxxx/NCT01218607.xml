      Volume overload due to left-to-right shunting in patients with atrial septal defect type&#xD;
      secundum causes pulmonary vascular disease over a long period of time. Pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      resistance can be assessed non-invasively using bicycle stress echocardiography. By measuring&#xD;
      cardiac output and pulmonary artery pressures at different stages of exercise, a&#xD;
      pressure-output plot can be obtained. The slope of the pressure-output plot reflects&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular resistance. In patients undergoing ASD repair after the age of 40 years,&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular resistance was higher when compared to age-matched controls, indicating&#xD;
      the presence of mild pulmonary vascular disease. Bosentan has been shown to decrease&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that in patients with an ASD type secundum, who underwent ASD&#xD;
      repair after the age of 40 years, administration of bosentan decreases pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      resistance as assessed by bicycle stress echocardiography.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
           Atrial septal defect (ASD) represents approximately 10% of all congenital heart diseases&#xD;
           and is the third most common form of congenital heart defect. The incidence of&#xD;
           congenital heart disease in Belgium is 1%, with ASD accounting for 25% of the cases&#xD;
           (Data from the database of congenital heart diseases UZ Leuven.) Characterized by a free&#xD;
           communication between the left and the right atrium, it may take the form of an ostium&#xD;
           secundum defect (in the region of the fossa ovalis); an ostium primum defect (in the&#xD;
           lower part of the atrial septum and associated with mitral regurgitation) or a sinus&#xD;
           venosus defect (in the upper atrial septum and associated with anomalous drainage of one&#xD;
           or more pulmonary veins)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with atrial septal defect (ASD) initially present with a left-to-right shunt,&#xD;
           which may cause elevated pulmonary artery pressures at rest and/or during exercise.&#xD;
           However, this persistently elevated pulmonary blood-flow also causes progressive lesions&#xD;
           of the pulmonary vasculature, as first described by Heath and Edwards. The earlier&#xD;
           stages present with medial hypertrophy and/or intimal proliferation and are largely&#xD;
           reversible after closure of the defect. Later stages, however, are irriversible: the&#xD;
           origin of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Eventually, this volume and pressure&#xD;
           overload of the right heart may lead to heart failure and/or arrhythmias. As PVR exceeds&#xD;
           systemic resistance, the shunt is reversed (right-to-left shunt) leading to systemic&#xD;
           arterial desaturation (and the related consequences: polyglobulia, hyperuricemia,&#xD;
           decreased renal function and abnormal coagulation): the Eisenmenger syndrome (ES). When&#xD;
           occlusive fibrotic lesions have developed later in life, closure of the ASD, although&#xD;
           still feasible, may not result in complete normalization of pulmonary artery pressures.&#xD;
           Moreover, it has been shown that closure after the age of 40 years is associated with&#xD;
           worse outcome. It has been suggested that an abnormal increase in pulmonary artery&#xD;
           pressures during exercise reflects mild pulmonary vascular disease. However, pulmonary&#xD;
           artery pressures are defined by both cardiac output and pulmonary vascular resistance.&#xD;
           During exercise, the relationship between pulmonary artery pressures and cardiac output&#xD;
           is slightly curvilinear because of a natural distensibility of the pulmonary arterioles.&#xD;
           Using bicycle stress echocardiography, pulmonary vascular resistance can be estimated&#xD;
           either as a ratio of pulmonary artery pressure and cardiac output at each stage (total&#xD;
           PVR) or by using linear regression analysis of the pressure-flow plots (dynamic PVR).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prognosis of patients with unrepaired ASDs is thought to be shortened and repair can&#xD;
           avoid right ventricular (RV) failure, pulmonary hypertension, thrombo-embolic events and&#xD;
           atrial dysrrhythmias. So, when the defect is discovered early, an ASD is usually closed&#xD;
           in childhood, unless the defect is considered not to be clinical significant. Sometimes,&#xD;
           as most patients with an isolated ASD are asymptomatic during childhood, an ASD comes to&#xD;
           medical attention at an older age.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with a corrected ASD have a poorer prognosis than patients in a control group,&#xD;
           especially in the presence of PAH, which confers an eightfold increased probability of&#xD;
           functional limitations. In the Euroheart survey PAH was present in 12% of patients with&#xD;
           a closed ASD. As PAH is a progressive disease, early diagnosis and treatment may improve&#xD;
           outcome in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A first analysis of data obtained from the registry of ASD showed that in the&#xD;
           transcatheter closed ASD patients, mPAP was the only independent predictor of atrial&#xD;
           arrhythmia after ASD repair. Moreover, our first prospective study showed that it is&#xD;
           possible to identify patients with mild pulmonary vascular disease using stress&#xD;
           echocardiography and that patients with an ASD closed at later age were unable to&#xD;
           decrease pulmonary vascular resistance during exercise, resulting in a higher pulmonary&#xD;
           vascular resistance at peak exercise when compared to a control group. This was&#xD;
           reflected in a steeper pressure-flow plot when compared to healthy controls. Endothelin&#xD;
           has shown to influence vasomotor tone, especially during exercise. Moreover, Faoro et al&#xD;
           showed that bosentan decreased pulmonary vascular resistance as assessed with&#xD;
           pressure-flow plots during hypoxia. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the&#xD;
           effect of an dual endothelin receptor antagonist on total pulmonary vascular resistance&#xD;
           during exercise in an older ASD patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 DRUG PROFILE&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mechanism of action&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bosentan is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) with affinity for both&#xD;
           endothelin A and B (ET-A and ET-B) receptors. Bosentan decreases both pulmonary and&#xD;
           systemic vascular resistance resulting in increased cardiac output without increasing&#xD;
           heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The neurohormone endothelin-1 (ET-1) is one of the most potent vasoconstrictors known&#xD;
           and can also promote fibrosis, cell proliferation, cardiac hypertrophy, and remodeling&#xD;
           and is pro-inflammatory. These effects are mediated by endothelin binding to ET-A and&#xD;
           ET-B receptors located in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells. ET-1&#xD;
           concentrations in tissues and plasma are increased in several cardiovascular disorders&#xD;
           and connective tissue diseases, including pulmonary arterial hypertension, scleroderma,&#xD;
           acute and chronic heart failure, myocardial ischaemia, systemic hypertension and&#xD;
           atherosclerosis, suggesting a pathogenic role of ET-1 in these diseases. In pulmonary&#xD;
           arterial hypertension and heart failure, in the absence of endothelin receptor&#xD;
           antagonism, elevated ET-1 concentrations are strongly correlated with the severity and&#xD;
           prognosis of these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bosentan competes with the binding of ET-1 and other ET peptides to both ET-A and ET-B&#xD;
           receptors, with a slightly higher affinity for ET-A receptors (Ki = 4.1-43 nM) than for&#xD;
           ET-B receptors (Ki = 38-730 nM). Bosentan specifically antagonises ET receptors and does&#xD;
           not bind to other receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although an ASD seems an easily correctable defect, patients with a repaired ASD have a&#xD;
           poorer prognosis than patients in a control group, especially in the presence of PAH,&#xD;
           which confers an eightfold increased probability of functional limitations. In the&#xD;
           Euroheart survey PAH was present in 12% of patients with a closed ASD. Whether it is&#xD;
           useful to treat mild to moderate pulmonary vascular disease after repair of an ASD with&#xD;
           specific PAH treatment in order to have a positive effect on exercise capacity and even&#xD;
           outcome outcome still needs to be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As outlined in section 1.1, the investigators were able to identify patients with mild&#xD;
           pulmonary vascular disease using bicycle exercise echocardiography. Patients with an ASD&#xD;
           repaired after the age of 40 years appeared to have higher PVR when compared to healthy&#xD;
           controls. Moreover, in older patients a higher mPAP at diagnosis was an independent&#xD;
           predictor for the occurrence of late atrial arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Therefore, the present study will investigate whether bosentan has a beneficial effect&#xD;
           on PVR as measured with bicycle stress echocardiography in patients with repaired ASD&#xD;
           and WHO FC II mild pulmonary vascular disease using dynamic PVR as a surrogate endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3.1 DOSE AND POSOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment will be initiated at a dose of 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and then&#xD;
           increased to the maintenance dose of 125 mg twice daily for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dosage in elderly patients: No dosage adjustment in required in patients over the age of&#xD;
           65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary efficacy objective is to assess the efficacy of the dual active endothelin&#xD;
           receptor antagonist bosentan in patients with WHO functional class II mild to moderate&#xD;
           PAH after surgical or interventional closure of an ASD .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, monocentric, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy of dual active endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan in patients&#xD;
      with WHO FC II, mild pulmonary vascular disease after ASD repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis of the study is that in patients receiving specific PAH treatment no&#xD;
      change in PVR is observed. This trial aims to demonstrate to efficacy of bosentan to lower&#xD;
      PVR as assessed by bicycle exercise echocardiography in patients with surgically or&#xD;
      transcatheter closed ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 RANDOMISATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to treatment groups with equal probability of assignment&#xD;
      to each treatment arm (allocation ratio 1:1). The randomisation schedule will be generated&#xD;
      using validated software. The investigators will remain blinded to the randomisation schedule&#xD;
      until after the final database is locked. The randomisation schedule will be examined only if&#xD;
      required by an emergency. Any such break should be documented clearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study design is considered as a pilot trial, it primarily aims at defining means and&#xD;
      standard deviations in both treatment arms in order to allow for future sample size&#xD;
      calculations.&#xD;
