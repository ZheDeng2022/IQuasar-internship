      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some&#xD;
      block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill&#xD;
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving temozolomide together with bevacizumab&#xD;
      may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving temozolomide together with bevacizumab to see&#xD;
      how well they work in treating patients with metastatic melanoma of the eye.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of temozolomide in combination with bevacizumab in treating&#xD;
           patients with metastatic uveal melanoma not amenable to curative surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine response rate in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine duration of response in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine progression-free survival of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine overall survival of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of treatment with this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the CT perfusion imaging for functional imaging of response in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacogenetic influence of constitutional VEGF-A polymorphism on the&#xD;
           efficacy and toxicity of bevacizumab. (ancillary)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-7 and 15-21 and bevacizumab&#xD;
      IV over 30-90 minutes on days 8 and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses.&#xD;
      Patients achieving at least stable disease then receive bevacizumab monotherapy IV every 2&#xD;
      weeks as maintenance therapy in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease progression.&#xD;
      Patients undergo CT perfusion imaging at baseline, day 28, and at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected at baseline and then periodically for VEGF-A genetic polymorphism&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.&#xD;
