      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders have a high prevalence of&#xD;
      cannabis use. Understanding some of the environmental factors that maintain cannabis use,&#xD;
      such as socially triggered cravings, is a critical step in improving treatment for cannabis&#xD;
      dependence. In recent years, virtual reality has been studied to determine whether it can be&#xD;
      used to induce craving by using life-like cue settings. Researchers are interested in using&#xD;
      virtual reality systems to study cannabis cravings in individuals with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine if virtual reality cues will elicit cannabis craving in persons with&#xD;
      schizophrenia who have a history of cannabis use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorders, are on a stable antipsychotic medication, and who have a lifetime&#xD;
      history of at least 50 cannabis uses and average cannabis use of once per month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves an initial screening visit, a study visit, and a followup visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, and will&#xD;
           complete questionnaires about their history of marijuana and other drug use.&#xD;
           Participants will also learn how to use the virtual reality equipment at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the study visit, participants will respond to marijuana cues using the virtual&#xD;
           reality system while researchers monitor their heart rate, blood pressure, and sweat&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the followup visit, participants will complete questionnaires about their mood and&#xD;
           any cravings for marijuana.&#xD;

      Objective: The use of cannabis is prevalent in people with schizophrenia, and has been linked&#xD;
      both to onset of illness and worsening of symptoms. Craving in persons with schizophrenia who&#xD;
      use cannabis has not been widely studied. The occurrence of craving may lead to relapse in&#xD;
      substance use disorders. Therefore, craving paradigms in people with schizophrenia need to be&#xD;
      optimized in order to test new treatments on craving measures in this population. Thus, the&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and effects of virtual reality cues on&#xD;
      craving intensity for cannabis in patients with schizophrenia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: We will enroll 25 persons with a DSM IV diagnosis of schizophrenia who have&#xD;
      a lifetime history of at least 50 lifetime uses of cannabis and cannabis use an average of at&#xD;
      least once per month (or, if inpatients, average use of once per month prior to&#xD;
      hospitalization) with a goal of 16 completers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This study uses a comparison-controlled, within-subject design. All subjects will&#xD;
      undergo a baseline assessment and acclimation period and then participate in an experimental&#xD;
      condition in which four cues will be presented in separate rooms in the VR program. These&#xD;
      include two cannabis cues and two neutral cues in four different rooms. A follow up session&#xD;
      for craving and symptom assessments will occur one week after the experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each of the four cues, the Cannabis Craving Scale (CCVAS), Cannabis Attention&#xD;
      scale (CAS), the Marijuana Craving Questionnaire-Short Form (MCQ-SF), and a visual analog&#xD;
      cigarette craving item will be administered to measure craving during the virtual reality&#xD;
      session. The CCVAS and CAS will be projected into the VR environment and participants will&#xD;
      respond via hand controller. The MCQ-SF will also be administered, as well as the Mood form ,&#xD;
      to assess mood, at baseline as well as at the end of each of the 4 cues. Before and after the&#xD;
      experimental session participants will also be rated on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale&#xD;
      (BPRS), Schedule for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), side effects, and the&#xD;
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The Immersion Questionnaire and Imagery Realism&#xD;
      Presence Questionnaire (PQ) will be given at the conclusion of the experimental session.&#xD;
      Before and after the session, as well as during the experiment participants will be monitored&#xD;
      for physiological reactivity (heart rate, blood pressure, and skin conductance response) to&#xD;
      cues of cannabis use as well as neutral cues measured.&#xD;
