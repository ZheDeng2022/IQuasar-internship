    <textblock>
      This phase II open-label study will be performed to evaluate the response rate of brain&#xD;
      metastases from lung and breast tumors under treatment with WBRT and lapatinib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with breast or lung cancer who have developed brain metastases will be treated with&#xD;
      WBRT (30Gy in 10 fractions) and lapatinib 1250mg once daily, followed by lapatinib treatment&#xD;
      1500mg once daily for a total duration of 6 weeks. At the 6 weeks timepoint, radiological&#xD;
      assessment with brain MRI will take place to evaluate the response of the patients.&#xD;
      Subsequent to the 6 weeks treatment period with lapatinib, the patients may discontinue&#xD;
      lapatinib as monotherapy and the physicians can proceed with any therapy, according to their&#xD;
      discretion. The patients will be followed-up every 12 weeks for disease progression and&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
