      RATIONALE: Preoperative 5-Fu based chemoradiation has become standard treatment for stage 2/3&#xD;
      rectal cancer. However whether these patients, especially T3N0-1M0 patients, really need&#xD;
      radiation for local control after total mesentery excision being applied in routine practice&#xD;
      is still unknown. And whether new drugs adding in can achieve better local and distant&#xD;
      control is worth investigating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying 5Fu based radiation therapy or FOLFOX&#xD;
      based radiation or FOLFOX alone, comparing them to see how well they work when given before&#xD;
      surgery in treating patients with intermediate risk resectable rectal cancer. It is not yet&#xD;
      known whether 5-Fu based or FOLFOX based radiation therapy or even FOLFOX alone is more&#xD;
      effective in treating rectal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Compare the objective response rate and the rate of local-regional relapse in&#xD;
      patients with resectable rectal cancer treated with either 5-Fu or FOLFOX based&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy or FOLFOX alone without radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the rate of pathologic complete response in patients treated with these&#xD;
           regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the local recurrence rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.Determine the increase in the number of patients who are able to undergo sphincter-saving&#xD;
      surgery after treatment with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.Correlate genetic patterns and the presence or absence of specific tissue biomarkers with&#xD;
      response and prognosis in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.Compare preoperative quality of life (QOL) of patients treated with oral capecitabine&#xD;
      versus continuous infusion with fluorouracil. pelvic auto-nerve function 5.Determine the&#xD;
      impact of oxaliplatin on neurotoxicity in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. 7.Compare the convenience of&#xD;
      care in patients treated with these regimens. 8.Determine the impact of the type of surgical&#xD;
      management on QOL at 1 year postoperatively in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multi-center study. Patients are stratified according to&#xD;
      participating center, gender, clinical tumor stage (stage II vs. stage III), and surgical&#xD;
      intent (sphincter saving vs. non-sphincter saving). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously and undergo radiotherapy once daily&#xD;
           5 days a week for 5-6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: Patients receive FOLFOX for 4 cycles and undergo radiotherapy as in arm I from&#xD;
           the second cycle of FOLFOX.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm C: Patients receive FOLFOX for 4 cycles Within 4-6 weeks after the completion of&#xD;
           chemo radiotherapy, patients with responding or stable disease undergo surgery. Patients&#xD;
           with progressive disease are treated at the discretion of the investigator and continue&#xD;
           to be followed. Patients with progressive disease in arm III should received radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at completion of chemo radiotherapy, and at 1 year&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 495 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Ages Eligible for Study: 18-75 Years old Genders Eligible for Study: Both Accepts&#xD;
      Healthy Volunteers: No&#xD;
