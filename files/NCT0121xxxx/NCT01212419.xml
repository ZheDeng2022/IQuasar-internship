      Objectives: Sleep characteristics have been used for prediction of neuro-developmental&#xD;
      outcome. The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of morphine and midazolam on the&#xD;
      development of SWC in newborns &gt; 32 weeks' gestational age after major non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This prospective aEEG study included infants &gt; 32+0 weeks' gestation admitted&#xD;
      to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at The Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne who were&#xD;
      undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. The BrainZ Monitor (BRM2, Version 8.0, BrainZ&#xD;
      Instruments, New Zealand) was applied post-operatively. The time of onset and quality of SWC&#xD;
      and the maximum levels of morphine and midazolam as predictors of time to SWC were then&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Forty-seven eligible infants were included. Emergence of SWC was observed at a mean&#xD;
      of 13 hours post-surgery. The maximum dose of morphine or midazolam was not predictive of&#xD;
      time to SWC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions: Despite high doses of continuous infusions of morphine and midazolam SWC was&#xD;
      observed on aEEG in neonates &gt; 32 weeks' gestational age soon after major non-cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. The main type of aEEG background pattern was not affected by the maximum dose of&#xD;
      either morphine or midazolam. Abnormalities in aEEG in post-surgical patients are not always&#xD;
      drug related.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence of neurodevelopmental impairment in survivors of non-cardiac&#xD;
      surgery (1,2,3,4). Psychosocial maldevelopment and emotional problems have been reported to&#xD;
      occur more commonly in children with repaired abdominal wall defects, and routine assessment&#xD;
      of survivors of non-cardiac surgery has been recommended throughout later childhood (5,6).&#xD;
      These reports also emphasize the need for further study of children who undergo major&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery in the neonatal period so that the neurological substrate for subsequent&#xD;
      abnormal neurodevelopment can be better understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) is being increasingly used to monitor&#xD;
      cerebral activity at the bedside in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (7). Widely used&#xD;
      scoring systems for aEEG incorporate consideration of background activity, presence of sleep&#xD;
      wake cycling (SWC) and seizures (8). There are several aEEG reports indicating that analgesic&#xD;
      and sedative agents routinely used in neonates suppress amplitude and therefore alter&#xD;
      background activity (9,10,11,12,13) and it is believed that interpretation of aEEG in sedated&#xD;
      patients is unreliable. Most of these studies have been conducted investigating pre-term&#xD;
      infants or infants with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep characteristics have been reported as predictors of neurodevelopmental outcome&#xD;
      (14,15,16) and there is general agreement that indices of stability in SWC over time are&#xD;
      positively correlated with improved clinical outcomes. SWC is described as smooth sinusoidal&#xD;
      variations, mostly in the minimum amplitude. Phases with broader bandwidth represent&#xD;
      discontinuous background activity during quiet sleep, whilst the phases with narrower&#xD;
      bandwidth correspond to the more continuous activity during wakefulness and active sleep. SWC&#xD;
      develops with increasing maturation of the child. From 31 to 32 weeks' gestational age, quiet&#xD;
      sleep periods are clearly discernable in the aEEG trace as distinct periods with increased&#xD;
      bandwidth. At term-equivalent age these periods represent trace alternant&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) patterns (17). The average duration of quiet sleep periods is 24&#xD;
      to 28 minutes for infants between 32 and 36 weeks' gestational age. These periods are&#xD;
      slightly longer at night but are otherwise relatively stable and are not affected by&#xD;
      incubator covers or developmental care interventions (18). The internal trigger for SWC is&#xD;
      located in the brainstem and the presence of SWC in healthy term newborns is considered a&#xD;
      sign of brain stem integrity (19,20). In newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy sleep&#xD;
      organization can be altered and the presence of SWC on aEEG is considered to be a good&#xD;
      prognostic sign (21). Timing of onset of SWC has been shown to predict neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcome based on whether the SWC returns before or after 36 hours of a presumed hypoxic&#xD;
      insult (22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several reports indicating that analgesic and sedative agents routinely used in&#xD;
      neonates may lead to amplitude depression on aEEG. However, to our knowledge there are&#xD;
      currently no reports of aEEG studies and SWC in newborn infants requiring major non-cardiac&#xD;
      surgery during the neonatal period. Studying background activity and emergence of SWC on aEEG&#xD;
      in neonates requiring major non-cardiac surgery may provide useful information about the&#xD;
      relationship of analgesia and sedation and cerebral function in the post-operative infant.&#xD;
      Knowledge of the effects of drugs that may modify cerebral activity is important to the&#xD;
      interpretation of aEEG's in critically ill neonates requiring high doses of analgesics and&#xD;
      sedatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective observational aEEG study was to describe the influence of&#xD;
      analgesic and sedative medication on background pattern and the development of SWC in newborn&#xD;
      infants born &gt; 32 weeks' gestation after major non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;
