    <textblock>
      The literature on the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic pain is well established. Support for the efficacy of Mindfulness Based Stress&#xD;
      Reduction (MBSR) and other mindfulness based treatments for chronic pain is building.&#xD;
      Recently, research has demonstrated the efficacy of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy&#xD;
      (MBCT) in simultaneously addressing the outcome variables targeted by both CBT and&#xD;
      mindfulness based treatment modalities. Although the efficacy of MBCT depression and for&#xD;
      other populations has been investigated, there is no extant literature reporting on MBCT for&#xD;
      chronic pain. The current application proposes to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of&#xD;
      an MBCT protocoll adapted for chronic pain in a series of pilot groups with headache pain&#xD;
      patients. We selected headache pain patients for this trial because headache pain is a common&#xD;
      complaint in the general population, is the most frequently reported cause of pain in medical&#xD;
      practice, and is one of the most disabling conditions for both genders combined. To examine&#xD;
      the feasibility of the adapted protocol, the investigators will investigate a number of&#xD;
      treatment related outcomes such as recruitment, completion, and drop out rates. Both primary&#xD;
      and secondary outcome variables will be investigated to determine treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide a research base examining the feasibility and efficacy of MBCT for&#xD;
      pain. Results from this study will lay the foundation for future randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      comparing MBCT to attention control, and future comparative effectiveness studies of MBCT and&#xD;
      CBT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is well established as an efficacious treatment for a wide&#xD;
      variety of chronic pain conditions, including headache pain. A promising trend within the&#xD;
      behavioral medicine field in recent years has been the integration of mindfulness into&#xD;
      traditional treatment modalities and the development of innovative treatments based upon&#xD;
      these principles. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) maintains a patient-centered&#xD;
      approach that focuses upon mindfulness meditation as the key mechanism to teach people how to&#xD;
      cope with their pain, take better care of themselves, and to improve their overall quality of&#xD;
      life. MBSR has successfully been utilized in a number of disorders including chronic pain&#xD;
      1,2,3 and in general medical populations 4 Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT),5&#xD;
      originally developed to target relapse prevention in major depression, is essentially a&#xD;
      modification of MBSR to incorporate more traditional cognitive-behavioral interventions into&#xD;
      the extant MBSR framework. Studies of MBCT support its efficacy in eliciting cognitive&#xD;
      changes similar to those demonstrated in CBT, while still incorporating the more general&#xD;
      salutary effects seen in MBSR,6,7,8,9,10While MBCT has been applied to other populations,&#xD;
      there has been no published work to date adapting it to chronic pain patients. This is a&#xD;
      surprising gap in the literature given the effectiveness of both CBT and mindfulness&#xD;
      independently for chronic pain. Therefore, the present proposal seeks to begin to fill these&#xD;
      gaps by testing the feasibility and efficacy of MBCT for chronic pain in a series of pilot&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Specific Aims The proposed project is a feasibility study designed to test the MBCT&#xD;
      protocol for chronic pain treatment and to provide pilot data to support subsequent research&#xD;
      proposals to be submitted to the National Institutes of Health. In this initial trial the&#xD;
      investigators will use patients with primary complaints of headache pain and treat them at a&#xD;
      collaborating headache clinic. We selected this target population because headache pain is&#xD;
      highly disabling and is the most common pain related complaint treated in medical practice.&#xD;
      Furthermore, given the time frame of the study, it is more feasible to recruit patients where&#xD;
      the PI has an established and ongoing collaborative relationship. The proposed project&#xD;
      emphasizes the research area of health, medicine, and behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To examine feasibility of the treatment, data will be collected regarding participant&#xD;
      flow across each stage of the study design, including recruitment, participation, and&#xD;
      drop-out rates, and percentage of sessions attended. Furthermore, pre-treatment expectations,&#xD;
      post-treatment satisfaction, and global ratings of self-perceived improvement will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: It is expected that the feasibility of MBCT, as measured by the above indicators,&#xD;
      will be comparable to similar data for other psychosocial treatments for pain, such as CBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: As an initial test of the efficacy of MBCT for chronic pain, the investigators will&#xD;
      compare an immediate treatment condition to a delayed treatment (OT) control on pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention measures. Time constraints of the current project will necessitate&#xD;
      follow-up assessment to be part of future proposals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Participants in the immediate treatment condition will obtain significantly&#xD;
      greater pre-post treatment gains compared to OT on primary outcome measures of pain&#xD;
      acceptance, pain catastrophizing, and pain interference; and secondary outcome measures of&#xD;
      mindfulness, pain intensity, perceived disability, selfefficacy, quality of life, and&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term objectives: Future projects will include a randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      comparing MBCT to an attention control condition (education support group), and eventually a&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness stUdy of CBT vs. MBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovative aspects of the proposed study: This is the first examination of MBCT for chronic&#xD;
      pain, which incorporates specific components of mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      to form a comprehensive treatment approach.&#xD;
