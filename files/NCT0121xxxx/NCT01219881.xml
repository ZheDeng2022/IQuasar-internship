      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-arm trial including 68&#xD;
      subjects scheduled to undergo urological cystoscope surgeries under general anesthesia (GA)&#xD;
      with intubation through a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) at The Ohio State University Medical&#xD;
      Center (OSUMC). Double blinding will be based on both the subject and the research staff&#xD;
      being unaware of which trial arm the subject is randomized into. Eligible subjects that&#xD;
      provide voluntary and written informed consent will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day -14 to 0&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo screening procedures up to 14 days prior to administration of study&#xD;
      treatment. The research staff will collect the subjects' medical history (including reason&#xD;
      for surgery, scheduled surgical procedure, anesthesia modality, and scheduled surgery&#xD;
      length), demographics (including gender, age, and race), allergies, history of smoking,&#xD;
      history of alcohol or drug abuse, medications, history of postoperative nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      (PONV), and history of motion sickness. A physical examination will also be performed at this&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrolment, subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, from a pre-determined&#xD;
      randomization schedule, by the research pharmacist to one of two anesthetic treatment groups:&#xD;
      Anesthesia maintained under desflurane or anesthesia maintained under sevoflurane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to surgery, a urine or serum pregnancy test will be performed and vitals will be&#xD;
      collected. Subjects' baseline pain and nausea will be assessed using an eleven point numeric&#xD;
      rating scale (NRS-11)15, where 0 is equivalent to none and 10 is equivalent to severe, prior&#xD;
      to entering the operating room (OR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive function will be evaluated in terms of level of orientation, memory, and&#xD;
      concentration (SOMCT). The SOMCT evaluation is performed by requesting the subjects' to&#xD;
      recall the current year and month, one sentence, and to repeat in both numerical and reverse&#xD;
      order the sequence of the months through the year. These 6 variables yield scores ranging&#xD;
      from 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function (Appendix 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be premedicated with 0.5 to 2 mg midazolam IV in the pre-operative holding&#xD;
      area. The subject will be transported to the operating room and assisted onto the operating&#xD;
      table, and ASA standard monitoring will be applied as determined by the anesthesiologist and&#xD;
      must include an oxygen saturation monitor and bispectral index (BIS) monitor. The BIS monitor&#xD;
      will be applied prior to the induction of anesthesia. Subject vital signs and BIS values will&#xD;
      be recorded every 5 minutes throughout the operation and recorded on the anesthesia record.&#xD;
      The subject will be preoxygenated using spontaneous mask ventilation at 100% fraction of&#xD;
      inspired oxygen inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) and a fresh gas flow of 6 L/min of oxygen for&#xD;
      one to four minutes prior to induction. Anesthesia induction will be performed via bolus&#xD;
      injection of 2 mg/kg IV propofol and 1 to 2 mcg/kg of fentanyl intravenous (IV) bolus. After&#xD;
      completion of bolus injection of propofol, the inhaled anesthetic vaporizer will be opened to&#xD;
      1 MAC (5.4 to 7.4% for desflurane and 1.4 to 2.5% for sevoflurane) based on study&#xD;
      randomization for one to two minutes using masked ventilation. Following the masked&#xD;
      ventilation a jaw thrust maneuver will be performed, the fresh gas inflow (not vaporizer)&#xD;
      will be turned off, and a lubricated LMA will be inserted. The size and brand of of LMA will&#xD;
      be recorded. After verification of proper placement and a seal around the LMA, the inflow&#xD;
      will be immediately turned back to 4 to 6 L/min of 100% oxygen with the vaporizer set at 1&#xD;
      MAC for three minutes and the patient will be placed on volume or pressure control mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. Ventilation will be verified via documentation of bilateral breath sounds and&#xD;
      chest rise. Following three to five minutes, the inhalational anesthesia will be maintained&#xD;
      with either desflurane or sevoflurane (0.5 to 1 MAC) inspired in a 50:50 air/oxygen mixture&#xD;
      at a total gas flow rate of 1 L/min. This will be based on the randomization of the subject&#xD;
      prior to surgery to one of the two groups of inhaled anesthetics. Additional boluses of&#xD;
      fentanyl, propofol, or vasopressors will be administered as needed to maintain analgesia and&#xD;
      hemodynamics, including heart rate, spontaneous respiratory rate, and mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      (MAP), within 20% of baseline. At end of procedure, upon closure of surgical incision,&#xD;
      inhalational anesthetic agents will be discontinued and fresh gas flow will be increased to 6&#xD;
      to 8 L/min of 100% oxygen. All patients will be maintained with inhaled anesthestic that will&#xD;
      not be below 0.5 MAC for either desflurane or sevoflurane throughout the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each episode of coughing during induction of anesthesia until the subject is awake and&#xD;
      oriented will be recorded by a blinded observer and graded according to the scale below&#xD;
      Coughing is defined as; 1 if a single cough occurred and oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≥ 95 %; 2&#xD;
      if multiple coughs occurred and SpO2 ≥ 95 %; 3 if multiple coughs occurred and SpO2 &lt; 95 %; 4&#xD;
      if multiple coughs occurred, SpO2 &lt; 95 % and coughing requires administration of an IV&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Awakening from anesthesia (eye-opening) will be assessed by the research staff by asking the&#xD;
      subjects to follow verbal commands only (no touch) at one-minute intervals after the&#xD;
      discontinuation of volatile anesthetics. The time to appropriateness for extubation will also&#xD;
      be recorded in one-minute intervals after discontinuation of the inhalational agent. Prior to&#xD;
      removal of the LMA, the subject will be determined to be awake by &quot;eyes-open&quot; to command and&#xD;
      deemed appropriate by the anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia and procedure start and end time, admission and discharge time to the&#xD;
      post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and time to discharge from the hospital will also be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-anesthesia recovery (physical status) will be evaluated, according to the Aldrete&#xD;
      score16, 5 minutes after extubation and every 5 minutes until the subject reaches an Aldrete&#xD;
      score ≥ 9. Subjects should be able to move the extremities spontaneously or on command, to&#xD;
      breathe and cough, have systolic blood pressure values within 20 mmHg of the pre-anesthetic&#xD;
      levels or baseline levels, alert or arousable to quiet voice, and able to maintain SpO2 &gt; 90&#xD;
      % with supplementary O2 administration through a face mask at the lowest concentration needed&#xD;
      to ensure Pao2 between 100 and 200 mmHg (Appendix 1) After subjects have reached a&#xD;
      postoperative Aldrete score ≥9, the research staff will perform a SOMCT test to evaluate&#xD;
      postoperative cognitive function every 15 minutes for the first hour after surgery and at the&#xD;
      time of discharge from the PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 24 hours after surgery overall satisfaction will be assessed by asking the subjects about&#xD;
      their experience with the anesthetic medication using a 3 point rating scale, by personal&#xD;
      interview or phone call, by a blinded research staff. Satisfaction will be rated on a scale:&#xD;
      2 being equivalent to highly satisfied, 1 being equivalent to satisfied and 0 being&#xD;
      equivalent to dissatisfied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All medications taken in the 24 hours prior to treatment will be recorded. Any drug with&#xD;
      potential antiemetic properties, intraoperative medication, and daily consumption of opioids&#xD;
      will be recorded for 24 hours postoperatively or until discharge from the hospital or&#xD;
      whichever comes first. Adverse events and serious adverse events will be recorded from time&#xD;
      of consent until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety parameters will be assessed by monitoring vital signs, adverse events, and either&#xD;
      urine or serum pregnancy test. A physical exam will be performed at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) will be recorded from&#xD;
      time to consent until discharge. For each adverse event, the relationship to the study&#xD;
      medication, severity, expectedness of an adverse event and outcome will be determined by the&#xD;
      principal investigator and recorded in the study source accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case a subject withdraws from the study because of a serious adverse event (SAE), the&#xD;
      local Institutional Review Board (IRB) will be notified within 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event definition&#xD;
&#xD;
      An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation&#xD;
      subject who has been administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to&#xD;
      have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended&#xD;
      sign, symptom, abnormal laboratory finding, or a temporal disease associated with the use of&#xD;
      a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned hospital admissions and/or surgical operations for an illness or disease that existed&#xD;
      before the subject was enrolled in a clinical study are considered part of the subjects'&#xD;
      medical history and are not to be considered AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse event&#xD;
&#xD;
      A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results in death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is life-threatening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Requires in-subject hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is another medically-significant event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment,&#xD;
           may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent&#xD;
           one of the outcomes listed above&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal criteria from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      According with the Declaration of Helsinki, participants have the right to withdraw from the&#xD;
      study at any time for any reason. The principal investigator also has the right to remove a&#xD;
      subject from the study. Reasons for which a subject may be removed from the study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An adverse event&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The request of the subject, his/her legal representative or caregiver, investigator,&#xD;
           whether for administrative or any other reasons&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non - compliance with medication, protocol violation or unreliable, behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or other clinically significant&#xD;
           abnormalities identified by the principal investigator according to his clinical&#xD;
           judgment. These will be followed by appropriate tests and/or procedures until these&#xD;
           values have returned to normal, to clinically acceptable levels, or can be attributed to&#xD;
           other causes other than study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator may withdraw an enrolled and treated subject from the study for&#xD;
      any of the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occurrence of a serious or intolerable adverse event&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergence of a clinically significant change in a laboratory parameter(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject requests to be discontinued from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A protocol violation sufficiently serious as to require subject withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General or specific changes in the subject's condition that render further treatment&#xD;
           unreasonable or unsafe within the standards of clinical practice in the judgment of the&#xD;
           principal investigator or treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any subject may leave the study at any time. If the subject decides to stop participating in&#xD;
      the study, there will be no penalty. The subjects will not lose any benefits to which they&#xD;
      are otherwise entitled.&#xD;
