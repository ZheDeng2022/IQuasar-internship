  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine addiction continues to be a major problem in the U.S. with no FDA-approved&#xD;
      pharmaceutical therapy. Finding effective treatment for cocaine addiction has long been a&#xD;
      challenge to scientists and clinicians. Psychosocial interventions known as behavior&#xD;
      therapies are the cornerstone of cocaine addiction treatment. However, there is an urgent&#xD;
      need to further improve treatment outcomes, especially during early recovery and the&#xD;
      protracted withdrawal phase of the treatment since many patients drop out or relapse during&#xD;
      this phase. Our clinical experience and studies suggest that integrative Meditation (IM)&#xD;
      helps reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms and increases treatment retention. The benefit&#xD;
      of IM is well supported by tension-reduction theory and attention-networks framework in&#xD;
      addiction treatment. The proposed study will implement a therapy development study to add IM&#xD;
      as a self-care component to the current outpatient treatment of cocaine addiction to improve&#xD;
      treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the proposed study include: 1) to conduct a 12-week controlled trial&#xD;
      with outpatient cocaine users to assess feasibility of recruiting and retaining cocaine&#xD;
      addicts and to determine effect size of IM-augmented treatment in comparison with&#xD;
      Nondirective Therapy (NT) control, with both groups receiving standard outpatient treatment&#xD;
      as usual (TAU), thereby facilitating future larger scale therapy development study; and 2) to&#xD;
      examine the changes in attention networks and negative mood as possible mediators of&#xD;
      treatment outcomes between the two groups.&#xD;

      Randomization Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet DSM-IV cocaine dependence or abuse and other inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to an IM or NT group, using an adaptive urn randomization procedure, which&#xD;
      adjusts for gender, referral source (self-referred or count-mandated), psychiatric medication&#xD;
      (yes/no), and type of cocaine addiction (polydrug vs. cocaine only). Simple randomization may&#xD;
      not be adequate to assure a balance between the groups of known predictive indicators. While&#xD;
      the primary basis of assignment remains randomization, urn randomization biases assignment&#xD;
      towards balance between groups based on variables known to be related to treatment outcome&#xD;
      when sample sizes are intermediate. Randomization reduces the possibility that one group will&#xD;
      be assigned a disproportionate number of the few patients in certain subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of the Treatment Procedure Twelve treatment sessions over 12 weeks will occur in the&#xD;
      outpatient facility once a week, about 30 minutes each session. Treatment outcomes will be&#xD;
      assessed at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24 (3 months after treatment). The follow-up assessments can&#xD;
      occur either at the outpatient facility, or at our offices in University of Maryland (Kernan&#xD;
      Hospital). We will make the follow-up sessions at both sites equivalent to each other, and&#xD;
      provide financial compensation for individuals who travel to our campus. For those who do not&#xD;
      want to come to the University, we will ensure that the follow-up sessions at the treatment&#xD;
      facility will be held in a private room separate from the location of staff and patients to&#xD;
      ensure privacy. Subjects are clearly assured that no one at the treatment facility will have&#xD;
      access to their treatment outcome data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We considered having the same therapists deliver both treatments to limit therapist-specific&#xD;
      effects independent of the actual treatment condition. Upon further consideration, we decided&#xD;
      that this approach could potentially lead to overlap in the delivery of the two treatments&#xD;
      and/or unintentional biases in the implementation of the control treatment. Therefore, we&#xD;
      decided to have a total of four therapists of similar experience. Two will deliver the IM&#xD;
      therapy, and other two will provide NT. The therapists for both groups will have similar&#xD;
      qualifications. To prevent bias, the therapists of NT will be blinded to the study&#xD;
      hypotheses. Treatment fidelity will be monitored through sample audio records of selected&#xD;
      sessions to ensure the separation of treatment protocols. If diffusion occurs, further&#xD;
      training will be utilized. To further prevent bias, none of the therapists will be involved&#xD;
      in outcome assessment, and they will be blind to participant responses. Assessment measures&#xD;
      will be conducted by research staff available for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of IM Treatment Procedure Basically, IM with RFB is a combining transitions&#xD;
      behavior therapy designed for different stages of addiction treatment. Following three stages&#xD;
      and corresponding treatment contents will be included in the 12-week treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stage 1: Treatment Engagement and Detoxification (week 1-2). In our pilot study some&#xD;
           addicts had difficult sitting still for 15-mins meditation with eyes closed, but they&#xD;
           could do breathing exercise with eyes open. In this study we will use 6 breaths/minute&#xD;
           as near resonant-frequency at the beginning of IM training. Each subject will receive a&#xD;
           MP3 player with customized RFB guiding program that include waving sound (audio) and&#xD;
           moving bar (visual) to assist the subject to do RF breathing. The subject is required to&#xD;
           do abdominal RFB at least 15 min per day open-eye in the first week, and close-eye in&#xD;
           the second week, then gradually switching to a combination of RFB and IM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stage 2: Recovery and transition by reducing craving and irritability (week 3-6). Based&#xD;
           on prior feedback on RFB, from week 3 on therapist will introduce IM technique one by&#xD;
           one to the client to practice. Week 3: introduce 16-mins IM, start with close-eye RFB,&#xD;
           relaxing body section by section through slow breathing, and attention plus breathing to&#xD;
           warm up lower abdomen. Week 4: RFB &amp; IM as a coping tool, therapist helps clients find&#xD;
           the key trigger situation for stress or relapse, and apply RFB and IM technique as a&#xD;
           copying strategy. Week 5: add guided imagery into IM (21 mins) to help detoxify brain&#xD;
           and body, to learn scan body part by part with increased sensation inside. Week 6:&#xD;
           review and catch-up if miss any prior sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. State 3: Revitalization and Relapse Prevention (week 7-12). Through experience of body&#xD;
           scan by guided imagery, discuss the balance working toward change and accepting&#xD;
           experiences that arise. Integrate IM techniques into daily life. Week 7: customize&#xD;
           guided imagery for other problems, balance acceptance and change; Week 8: introduce full&#xD;
           version of IM (25 mins) with technique of reversed abdominal breathing, which helps&#xD;
           recharge the body with vital energy and calmness; conclude IM by integrating&#xD;
           breath-mind-body into oneness - an optimal level of mind-body integration. Week 9:&#xD;
           techniques of handling random thoughts during meditation, and learn to separate thoughts&#xD;
           from action, a key issue in dealing with craving or relapse. Week 10: how to use IM&#xD;
           techniques to handle different relapse triggers, do not have to act on thoughts. Week&#xD;
           11: different ways to integrate IM technique into daily life, make IM part of routine.&#xD;
           Week 12: review, feedback, and provide local sources for more meditation practice and&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The success of IM for addiction depends on therapist facilitation and quality of subject's&#xD;
      daily practice (home-work). The description of each facilitation meeting and assigned&#xD;
      homework are listed in the therapist manual available upon request. In general, each session&#xD;
      the therapist will 1) get feedback from prior session and daily IM practice; 2) teach new&#xD;
      components of IM step by step; 3) link IM technique to the addiction problem and prevention&#xD;
      of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nondirective Therapy (NT for control group) NT is a procedure in which the therapist refrains&#xD;
      from directing the client, but instead reflects back to the client what the latter has said,&#xD;
      sometimes, restating the client's remark. NT has been used as a control treatment in previous&#xD;
      therapy development studies and was consider a good control in psychotherapy research. NT is&#xD;
      chosen for this study to control for non-specific effects that show to contribute to outcome&#xD;
      such as therapeutic alliance and therapist competency. Thus, both treatment conditions will&#xD;
      contain individual therapy interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol for the individualized NT will mirror the layout of IM therapy -12 weekly&#xD;
      meetings, 30 minutes each. Subjects in NT group will be instructed to do Diaphragmatic&#xD;
      Breathing (DB) exercise and will be given assigned homework (writing journal) and track&#xD;
      progress. DB is incorporated into the NT as treatment providing non-specific effects&#xD;
      associated with attention and homework completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In short, Both IM and NT groups will get the same amount of extra contact with therapist (30&#xD;
      mins/week) in addition to their regular treatment, with breathing exercise (RFB or DB) and&#xD;
      homework (IM or writing journal). Both treatment conditions will be audio-taped for&#xD;
      evaluation of fidelity and differentiation. This design will make the study outcomes more&#xD;
      reliable and transferable for the future therapy development studies.&#xD;
