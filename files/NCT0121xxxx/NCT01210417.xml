      In the prehospital setting it would be helpful to assess primary changes in central blood&#xD;
      volume or preload (venous return, stroke volume, diastolic ventricular volume) that occur&#xD;
      during the stability phase following injury when regulatory mechanisms are still functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obviously in this setting a non invasive bedside beat-to-beat index would be helpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulse Transit Time (PTT) is the sum of Pre-Ejection Period (PEP), the time interval between&#xD;
      the onset of ventricular depolarization and the ventricular ejection, and Vascular Transit&#xD;
      Time (VTT), the time it takes for the pulse wave to travel from the aortic valve to the&#xD;
      peripheral arteries (Obrist et al. 1979). PEP variations are known to correlate with&#xD;
      reductions in central blood volume induced by head-up tilt (Chan et al., 2007b, 2008). The&#xD;
      same authors also demonstrated that PTT variations follow closely PEP variations and&#xD;
      therefore central blood volume variations (Chan et al., 2007b). Following central blood&#xD;
      volume reductions induced by head-up tilting ventricular diastolic filling time increases&#xD;
      involving an increase in PEP and PTT. Chan et al. (Chan et al., 2007b) concluded that PTT&#xD;
      could have been used to assess early central hypovolemia and suggested that joint analysis of&#xD;
      PTT and RR intervals could help in predicting the extent of blood volume loss. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that sympathetic drive associated with trauma would act on cardiac&#xD;
      contractility through beta activity thus shortening PTT without reducing RR interval to the&#xD;
      same extent in healthy hearts. We also hypothesized that progressive hypovolemia would lead&#xD;
      to a rising of PTT (augmented diastolic filling time) and a RR interval shortening (relative&#xD;
      tachycardia). In this study the investigators propose and index based on the beat-to-beat&#xD;
      PTT/RR ratio to assess central hypovolemia in traumatic patients enrolled by our Helicopter&#xD;
      Emergency Medical System (HEMS) in a prehospital setting.&#xD;
