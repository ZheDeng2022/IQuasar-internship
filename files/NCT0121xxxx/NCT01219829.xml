  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research purpose of this project is to create a registry, and blood and tissue bank for&#xD;
      individuals at high-risk for pancreatic cancer. We plan to conduct histopathological and&#xD;
      molecular analysis of resected pancreatic tissue prospectively collected from a cohort of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. In&#xD;
      order to improve outcomes of this disease, significant research efforts have focused on&#xD;
      understanding the changes that occur in the pancreas prior to tumor occurrence. The types of&#xD;
      changes most often associated with tumor have been named pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia&#xD;
      (PanIN). It is not yet clear how to identify the PanIN lesions most likely to develop into&#xD;
      cancer and the length of time required for this progression. In order to evaluate these&#xD;
      questions, we are interested in examining the microscopic and genetic characteristics of&#xD;
      PanIN lesions in two &quot;high-risk&quot; patients: 1) patients who underwent surgery for pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer and developed tumor recurrence after surgery and 2) patients with a strong family&#xD;
      history of pancreatic cancer or with a genetic syndrome that puts them at risk for pancreas&#xD;
      cancer. The surgical specimens from these patients will be evaluated by a pathologist for&#xD;
      evidence of widespread PanIN lesions. In addition, PanIN lesions will be tested for&#xD;
      abnormalities in several major genes that are known to be important in pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
