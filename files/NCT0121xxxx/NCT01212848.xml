      The purpose of this study is to determine whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of suicidal thinking in individuals with a depressive episode and&#xD;
      either posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), history of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), or&#xD;
      both conditions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests that depression in general, and suicidal ideation in particular, results&#xD;
      from a dysfunctional regulatory pathway involving prefrontal cortical governance over limbic&#xD;
      activity. Repeated daily non-invasive stimulation of the prefrontal cortex with TMS would&#xD;
      theoretically strengthen and reset this cortical control pathway and reduce suicidal ideation&#xD;
      and restore healthy circuit behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to assess the efficacy of TMS therapy in the treatment of&#xD;
      suicidal ideation in patients with depressive episode(s) and either PTSD or mild TBI or both.&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that participants who receive repetitive TMS (Group 1) relative to sham&#xD;
      treatment (Group 2) three times daily over three days will evidence more improvement in&#xD;
      suicidal ideation from baseline to the end of day 3. Participants will be followed for six&#xD;
      months following treatment to assess safety and long-term efficacy of TMS.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Veteran inpatients aged 18-70 years inclusive, with a depressive episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Must also have either or both&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. a diagnosis of PTSD as defined by DSM-IV supported by the SCID, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. a diagnosis of mild TBI, either complicated (i.e., with imaging abnormalities) or&#xD;
                  uncomplicated, as defined by INTRuST criteria. The American Congress of&#xD;
                  Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) definition of mild TBI will be utilized for this&#xD;
                  study (Kay et al., 1993). That definition will be operationalized using the&#xD;
                  INTRuST Screening Instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Admitted because of suicidal ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. SSI score &gt; 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. HRSD question #3 &gt; 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Comorbid (non-principal) diagnoses of psychiatric disorders not explicitly listed in&#xD;
             the following Exclusion Criteria section are generally permitted (with final&#xD;
             eligibility determination by Site Principal Investigator clinical assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects must be able to speak English and complete study forms, adhere to treatment&#xD;
             regimens, and be willing to return for regular visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. After full explanation of the study, subjects must demonstrate their willingness to&#xD;
             participate by signing the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who have clinically unstable medical disease (cardiovascular, renal,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, pulmonary, metabolic, endocrine, other); CNS disease deemed&#xD;
             progressive; moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients with mild TBI,&#xD;
             however, will not be excluded from study participation. The ACRM definition of mild&#xD;
             TBI will be utilized for this study (Kay et al., 1993). That definition will be&#xD;
             operationalized using the INTRuST TBI Screening Instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Females who are pregnant or currently breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current or history of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder (except psychosis NOS&#xD;
             when the presence of sensory hallucinations are clearly related to the subject's&#xD;
             trauma), bipolar Type I disorder, or dementia (vascular, Alzheimer's disease, other&#xD;
             types). Patients with bipolar Type II disorder will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who repeatedly abused or were dependent upon drugs (excluding nicotine and&#xD;
             caffeine) within 6 days of study entry will be excluded, (with the exception of&#xD;
             alcohol abuse which, at the discretion of the primary site investigator, may be&#xD;
             permitted*).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects actively participating (or planning to enroll) in an evidence-based&#xD;
             exposure/cognitive treatment for PTSD during the trial, or who have been enrolled in&#xD;
             one during the past 6 weeks; participation in other psychotherapeutic modalities must&#xD;
             have been stable for 3 months prior to enrollment and remain stable throughout&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects currently taking medications that have short half-lives, lower the seizure&#xD;
             threshold, and do not have evidence of antidepressant efficacy. These include high&#xD;
             dose theophylline, or stimulants such as methylphenidate. Patients taking buproprion&#xD;
             have to be on a stable dose and take less than or equal to 300 mg/day. Stable means&#xD;
             the same dose for 5 half-lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with metal in their head (other than dental implants), implanted devices in&#xD;
             their head (shunts, cochlear implants).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with a history of seizures or a seizure disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects with borderline personality disorder or who have clear evidence of secondary&#xD;
             gain as a reason for admission.&#xD;
