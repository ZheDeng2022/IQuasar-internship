  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research trial is to determine if safinamide (experimental drug) can&#xD;
      improve cognition in cognitively impaired but non-demented Parkinson's disease patients. The&#xD;
      word &quot;experimental&quot; means the trial drug is not approved by Health Authorities (government&#xD;
      authorities) and is still being tested for safety and effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately one hundred (100) patients will participate in this research trial. The&#xD;
      research trial will be conducted in approximately thirty (30) medical centers in the&#xD;
      following countries: Argentina, Canada, Italy, Peru, South Africa, Spain and USA. The&#xD;
      research trial will last until June 2012.&#xD;

    <measure>Parkinson's Disease Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Total score reduction in the PD-CRS at 12 weeks compared to the Baseline. The PD-CRS detects early cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. It is composed of 2 scales, the subcortical scale (items 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) and the cortical scale (items 2, 6). The total score of the subcortical scale is from 0 to 114. The total score of the cortical scale is from 0 to 20. The PD-CRS Total score represents the sum of scores on the cortical and subcortical scales. It ranges from 0 to 134. The more points, the less the impairment.</description>

    <measure>Dementia Rating Scale - 2 (DRS-2) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DRS-2 will provide a general measure of cognitive ability in PD subjects. It has thus been chosen as a tool to compare cognitive performance in PD across different trials. Administered at Baseline, Week 12 and Week 24. The DRS-2 consists of 36 tasks divided into 5 subscales (Attention, Initiation/Perseveration, Construction, Conceptualization, and Memory). The maximum score on each subscale is as follows: Attention = 37; Initiation/Perseveration = 37; Construction = 6; Conceptualization = 39, Memory = 25. The DRS-2 total score = 144 (the more points, the less the impairment).</description>
