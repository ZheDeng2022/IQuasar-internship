    <textblock>
      Researchers at the the University of Michigan are conducting a research project to assess how&#xD;
      a course of radiation therapy changes the way blood flows through the liver. To be able to do&#xD;
      this, the researchers will be using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans completed before,&#xD;
      during, and after radiation therapy. MRI's will be done on 4 or 5 occasions. On each&#xD;
      occasion, you will be injected with a fluid called gadolinium (a contrast agent) before&#xD;
      getting an MRI. This contrast agent makes it easier for the Researchers to see your organs in&#xD;
      the scans, and causes any abnormal areas to become very bright on the MRI. This agent will be&#xD;
      injected into a vein in your arm or leg. Each MRI scan will last approximately 45 minutes.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this research is to assess how a course of radiation therapy changes the way blood flows through the liver. Researchers want to use the information collected from this research for future research, to see if this change in blood flow indicates that an individual patient is at higher risk for complications from the radiation therapy, specifically Radiation-Induced Liver Disease (RILD). To be able to do this, the researchers will be using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans completed before, during, and after radiation therapy.</description>
