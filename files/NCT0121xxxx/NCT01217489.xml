    <textblock>
      The Signascan Electrical Impedance Mammography (EIM) Study is a pilot study of a non-invasive&#xD;
      medical device - a novel approach to breast cancer detection using Electrical Impedance&#xD;
      Mammography (passing minute electrical currents through the tissues and detecting the changes&#xD;
      to the currents as a result of the tissues, which can differentiate between normal and&#xD;
      malignant tissue). The trial is a prospective trial of diagnostic capability of the device,&#xD;
      as compared with standard care (diagnosis provided by the concurrent NHS investigation -&#xD;
      imaging, surgery etc) performed for female patients attending the symptomatic breast clinic&#xD;
      for investigation. The aim is to assess the diagnostic efficacy in detecting 100 true&#xD;
      malignancies, and continue to recruit until 300 patients with true malignancies have been&#xD;
      recruited if necessary.&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the accuracy of identification of breast malignancy, localisation and tissue&#xD;
           characterisation, utilising the non-invasive / non-ionising imaging technique of&#xD;
           Electrical Impedance Mammography Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparative analysis to other imaging modalities for detecting malignant breast disease.&#xD;
           Since the Signascan EIM images will be being undertaken in parallel to other imaging&#xD;
           modalities it will be possible to perform comparative analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of whether Electrical Impedance Mammography (EIM) can also be used to&#xD;
           identify and tissue-characterise the range of benign clinical breast masses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of Study Design A pilot study of a system for impedance-based breast screening,&#xD;
      designed as a prospective diagnostic pilot study. The procedures for the study will be&#xD;
      'additive', and run in parallel to existing NHS care, therefore no normal investigation or&#xD;
      treatment will be withheld. All participant involvement will be during one visit to the&#xD;
      hospital, which will be a visit the patient would be making anyway in the course of their&#xD;
      routine NHS care pathway. Participation will last only for the time taken to discuss, consent&#xD;
      (15 min) and perform (10 min) the scan. Therefore total duration of involvement will be&#xD;
      approximately 25 minutes. The pilot study will run for a period of two years, and will aim to&#xD;
      include 300 cases of malignant breast disease. Interim analysis will be performed on the&#xD;
      first 100 patients. Concepts of blinding/randomization do not apply as they would in a&#xD;
      therapeutic trial. Control data will come both from patients' (when normal) contralateral&#xD;
      breasts, and from the group of patients scanned but subsequently diagnosed as having benign&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Primary and Secondary Endpoints/Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of success rate of the Signascan EIM method in accurately detecting the&#xD;
      presence of malignancy in the breast, and not reporting malignancy in normal breast.&#xD;
      (Accuracy' measured as degree of sensitivity (%) and specificity (%) proven in the pilot&#xD;
      study population.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of ability of the Signascan EIM method to differentiate different types of&#xD;
      malignancy (i.e. discerning differences between ductal and lobular carcinoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of ability of the Signascan EIM method to differentiate different types of&#xD;
      benign tissues (i.e. discerning differences between cystic and fibroadenomatous change).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants Participants to be included will be women referred for NHS investigation&#xD;
      of symptomatic breast lump, following self-examination or picked up by GP. They will&#xD;
      generally be in the age range 40-60 years but no eligible patients over 18 yrs will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study on the basis of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study procedures will be performed in one visit scheduled for existing NHS care.&#xD;
      Beforehand, where possible, each potential participant will have had a letter and one-page&#xD;
      information sheet sent out with the letter inviting them to their NHS appointment. Since 1st&#xD;
      January 2010, all referrals to a breast clinic must be seen within 14 days, therefore advance&#xD;
      written notice is not possible as many appointments are made by telephone. In these instances&#xD;
      patients will be offered a 1 page information sheet when they report to the clinic reception.&#xD;
      They will then have time to read and consider it while waiting to be seen and while waiting&#xD;
      for investigations to be performed. In these instances judgment will be made by the&#xD;
      responsible clinician as to whether it is appropriate to invite the patient to join the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order, the procedures in the clinic (total time 20-25 mins) will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. verbally invite potential participant to study, and go over full-length PIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. answer questions and conduct informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. participant changes into gown&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. position participant on scanning couch&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. push button and perform scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. participant dresses and is free to go.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written and verbal versions of Informed consent will be presented to the subject detailing no&#xD;
      less than: the exact nature of the study; the implications and constraints of the protocol;&#xD;
      the known side effects and any risks involved in taking part. It will be clearly stated that&#xD;
      the participant is free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without&#xD;
      prejudice to future care, and with no obligation to give the reason for withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be allowed as much time as wished to consider the information, and the&#xD;
      opportunity to question the Principal Investigator, their GP or other independent parties to&#xD;
      decide whether they will participate in the study. Written Informed Consent will then be&#xD;
      obtained by means of subject dated signature, signature of the person who presented informed&#xD;
      consent and, if different, the Principal Investigator (or named Co-Investigator). A copy of&#xD;
      the signed Informed Consent will be given to the subject. The original signed form will be&#xD;
      retained at the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Assessments The assessment confirming eligibility and data necessary for the study will&#xD;
      be performed by the participants' ordinary NHS healthcare professionals (the John Radcliffe&#xD;
      breast surgery team under Miss Jane Clarke (Consultant breast surgeon) and the associated&#xD;
      team of surgeons and nursing staff). The assessment will be as per the standard NHS&#xD;
      first-line assessment of symptomatic breast lesions in the population under study. This will&#xD;
      tend to include clinical history-taking, clinical breast examination, and standard scanning&#xD;
      methods as appropriate. Specific data will be retained for study purposes, including&#xD;
      demographic data and other details of medical history and any disease process that may affect&#xD;
      the study. This would include breast disease in either breast, prior surgery, and significant&#xD;
      systemic comorbidities. Additionally, since hormone status may affect the impedance profiles&#xD;
      of breast tissue, data on dates of menstrual cycles will be collected also. Miss Clarke and&#xD;
      team will identify and approach suitable patients to invite them to join the study, on their&#xD;
      assessment visit.&#xD;
