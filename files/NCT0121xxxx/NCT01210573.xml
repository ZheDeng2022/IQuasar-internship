      To observe and document ventilation parameters in the advanced heart failure population,&#xD;
      through the course of illness, which often includes cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT),&#xD;
      left ventricular assist device (LVAD), and transplant. Findings from this cohort are&#xD;
      anticipated to be of sufficient interest to the scientific community to merit publication and&#xD;
      are likely to provide preliminary data for future hypothesis generation and subsequent&#xD;
      prospective, randomized controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A compact, inexpensive apparatus has recently become commercially available for performing&#xD;
      sub-maximal exercise testing (SHAPE Medical, St Paul, MN), including gas exchange analysis&#xD;
      and will be used in this study. This apparatus is not investigational.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPXT) has a long history in the evaluation and management&#xD;
      of cardiovascular diseases, particularly in patients with advanced heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular exercise testing is a safe, well-developed, and validated method for risk&#xD;
      stratification and objective documentation of exercise capacity in patients with severe heart&#xD;
      failure (1,2). Recent studies have also shown that exercise testing has prognostic power for&#xD;
      heart failure hospitalization and mortality (3,4), but limited published data are available&#xD;
      in a large group of advanced heart failure patients, such as those with cardiac&#xD;
      resynchronization therapy (CRT) and left ventricular assist devices (LVAD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced or suspected advanced heart failure. Typical patients screened for this study will&#xD;
      be patients who have been referred to the University of Minnesota for evaluation for advanced&#xD;
      heart failure options, such as cardiac transplant or mechanical circulatory support. This is&#xD;
      a somewhat heterogeneous population, but all have been diagnosed by referring physician as&#xD;
      having sufficiently severe heart failure to seek tertiary care. Most are anticipated to have&#xD;
      severely depressed ejection fraction (&lt;30% and typically &lt;20%), but patients with preserved&#xD;
      ejection fraction and either hypertrophy or restrictive cardiomyopathy will also be eligible.&#xD;
      Patients pulmonary hypertension, on any therapy (other than diuretics alone), are also felt&#xD;
      to be at high risk of developing right heart failure and may also be included. Patients who&#xD;
      have already undergone LVAD or cardiac transplant are also considered to have advanced heart&#xD;
      failure and are eligible to participate, regardless of the severity of their symptoms at the&#xD;
      time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers may be included for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomized, observational investigation of sub-maximal exercise ventilation&#xD;
      parameters in patient diagnosed with, or suspected to have, advanced heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of follow-up will be up to five years. Some subjects will undergo only one exercise&#xD;
      test. Patients who present with heart failure but subsequently undergo CRT implantation, LVAD&#xD;
      implantation, or cardiac transplant will be asked to repeat the submaximal exercise test. The&#xD;
      timing between any of these events is unpredictable, so the duration of follow-up cannot be&#xD;
      predicted. Subjects will be followed for change of status for up to 5 years. The total number&#xD;
      of tests that any one person could potentially have is 5 (baseline plus one after each&#xD;
      therapy), although we expect that most participants would not be asked to undergo more than 3&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients without a device: Patients start at rest for 2 minutes and will wear a face mask&#xD;
      and breathing parameters are recorded using the SHAPE-HF system (SHAPE Medical St. Paul, MN)&#xD;
      that measures respiratory airflow and the constituent respiratory gases, oxygen and carbon&#xD;
      dioxide. The SHAPE-HF system will continue to monitor and the patient then will start walking&#xD;
      on a treadmill with a variable speed of 1-3 mph and a variable grade of 0-6%. The total&#xD;
      treadmill time will be no more than 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with a device: patients will be at rest and the adjustments of their device will&#xD;
      be made by a study physician or device coordinator, done routinely in clinical practice. This&#xD;
      will take up to 15 minutes and during this time; participants will wear a face mask and&#xD;
      breathing parameters are recorded using the SHAPE-HF system (SHAPE Medical St. Paul, MN) that&#xD;
      measures respiratory airflow and the constituent respiratory gases, oxygen and carbon&#xD;
      dioxide. Device parameters will be returned to baseline settings following this part of the&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-maximal exercise testing approximately 30 minutes in duration will be performed on a&#xD;
      treadmill at a slow and constant pace, the speed of the treadmill will range from 1-2 mph and&#xD;
      the grade will range from 0-2% depending on the patient's exercise tolerance. The exercise&#xD;
      will be split into two rounds of exercise up to 15 minutes each. Subjects may rest as long as&#xD;
      they would like between the two tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first round, participants will wear a face mask and breathing parameters are recorded&#xD;
      using the SHAPE-HF system. (See section 13B for sample report).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second round, every two minutes, up to 15 minutes, participants will be asked to take&#xD;
      8 breaths using a breathing bag containing a standard mixture of gases (0.7% acetylene, 21%&#xD;
      oxygen, 9% Helium and the balance of nitrogen)-this gas mixture is routinely used in&#xD;
      pulmonary function laboratories to measure lung function and has the same amount of oxygen as&#xD;
      room air. Acetylene mass spectroscopy is then used to measure cardiac output noninvasively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither the SHAPE-HF system, nor the methods of gas exchange during exercise are&#xD;
      investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are treated with cardiac resynchronization therapy and/or ventricular assist&#xD;
      device may have minor adjustments made to their device parameters every 2 minutes during the&#xD;
      testing. The adjustments will be made by a study physician or device coordinator, as&#xD;
      mentioned before, done in routine practice. Device parameters will be returned to baseline&#xD;
      settings following the test.&#xD;
