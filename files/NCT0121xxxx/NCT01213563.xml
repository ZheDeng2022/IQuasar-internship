    <textblock>
      Gastric bypass surgery has been proposed as an effective treatment strategy for type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but thus far algorithms for the management of T2DM immediately&#xD;
      after surgery have not been established. The investigators designed an algorithm to achieve&#xD;
      good glycaemic control in patients with insulin-requiring T2DM upon discharge after gastric&#xD;
      bypass surgery, and evaluated this algorithm for feasibility, efficacy, and safety.&#xD;

      This is a prospective randomised controlled intervention study on obese human subjects with&#xD;
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus undergoing obesity surgery (n=80). Patients will be recruited from&#xD;
      those already due to undergo bariatric surgery within the context of the obesity clinic&#xD;
      (Imperial College London). Patients will be randomised to either of two treatment protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol A-Conservative Management: On admission to hospital all pre-operative oral&#xD;
      antidiabetic agents and insulin are stopped and glucose monitoring is carried out every four&#xD;
      hours at the same time as routine observations. Actrapid insulin is administered with glucose&#xD;
      as per standard sliding scale (Appendix A). Just prior to discharge, total insulin&#xD;
      administered over the previous 24 hour post-operative period is calculated. Based on the&#xD;
      results of ward based glucose monitoring, post-operative patients can be divided in two broad&#xD;
      categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group includes patients who are able to maintain euglycaemia without exogenous&#xD;
      insulin administration. These patients are discharged home on their preoperative Metformin&#xD;
      dose and are advised to continue monitoring their fasting glucose levels at home. If fasting&#xD;
      glucose levels of less than 4 or more than 10mmol/l are recorded at home, the patients are&#xD;
      encouraged to contact the obesity clinic physicians for advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group includes patients experiencing hyperglycemic episodes in the immediate&#xD;
      post-operative period. These patients are discharged home on their preoperative Metformin&#xD;
      dose and once daily insulin Glargine as decided by the discharging doctor (or based on half&#xD;
      their last 24 hour requirements) and are advised to continue monitoring their fasting glucose&#xD;
      levels at home. If fasting glucose levels of less than 4 or more than 10mmol/l are recorded&#xD;
      at home, the patients are encouraged to contact the obesity clinic physicians for advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol B-Intensive management: On admission to hospital all pre-operative oral antidiabetic&#xD;
      agents and insulin are stopped and glucose monitoring is carried out every four hours at the&#xD;
      same time as routine observations. Actrapid insulin is administered as per standard sliding&#xD;
      scales (appendix A). Just prior to discharge, total insulin administered over the previous 24&#xD;
      hour post-operative period is calculated. Based on the results of ward based glucose&#xD;
      monitoring patients are discharged home on metformin 1000mg BID and/or the equivalent amount&#xD;
      of Glargine insulin requirement in previous 24 hours prior to discharge. These patients are&#xD;
      also advised to continue glucose monitoring at home and will be contacted every day and their&#xD;
      medication adjusted to maintain a fasting glucose between 5 and 7mmol/l. When this is&#xD;
      consistently achieved the investigators will stop calling, but patients will be encouraged to&#xD;
      continue monitoring their blood sugars and contact the investigators should they experience&#xD;
      any problems with their glycaemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venesection will take place at 10 days, 3, 6 and 12 months post-operatively and yearly&#xD;
      thereafter for fasting glucose and HbA1c as part of the routine care of patients of the&#xD;
      obesity clinic. As part of clinical management we will ensure that all patients with diabetes&#xD;
      will have a kidney (2 samples of morning urine albumin creatinine ratio), nerve (nerve&#xD;
      conduction study, including thermal threshold testing) and eye (retinal photograph) tests&#xD;
      once before and within 1, 2 and 3 years after surgery. These tests are all non invasive and&#xD;
      except from the nerve tests are performed routinely for all patients with diabetes at least&#xD;
      yearly and if performed in the community they will not be repeated.Therefore, other than the&#xD;
      nerve conduction studies, there will be no extra burden to the patients as a result of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
