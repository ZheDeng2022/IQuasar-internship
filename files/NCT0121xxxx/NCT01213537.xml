    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effect of a pacemaker device used in heart failure&#xD;
      patients which is called Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT). Specifically the&#xD;
      investigators aim to investigate if the CRT pacemaker has an effect on breathing stability in&#xD;
      these patients and particularly breathing stability at night. Our theory is that the CRT&#xD;
      pacemaker may improve the stability of breathing in patients with heart failure.&#xD;

      AIM To investigate the effect of Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT) on chemosensitivity&#xD;
      in patients with Chronic Heart Failure with and without Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE To conduct a physiological observational study to measure hypercapnic ventilatory&#xD;
      responses in a group of CHF patients before and 3 months after implantation of clinically&#xD;
      indicated CRT devices. Additionally to conduct nocturnal polysomnography to establish if any&#xD;
      change in chemosensitivity is related to the presence of SDB at baseline and, where present,&#xD;
      any change in SDB after implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS Primary hypothesis: CRT implantation will be associated with a reduction in the&#xD;
      hypercapnic ventilatory response from baseline to 3 months post implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional hypothesis: This reduction in hypercapnic ventilatory response after CRT&#xD;
      implantation will be greatest in those CHF patients with SDB at baseline.&#xD;
