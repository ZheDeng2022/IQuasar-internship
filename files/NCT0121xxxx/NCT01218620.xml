      This randomized phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of RO4929097 in treating&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors. RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the extent that RO4929097 induces its own metabolism using a 20mg dose on&#xD;
      Regimen I and a 50mg dose on Regimen II by comparing Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 10 plasma&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of the strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole, on RO4929097&#xD;
      plasma pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the effect of the strong inducer of CYP3A4, 2D6 and 2C9, rifampin on&#xD;
      RO4929097 plasma pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the effect of RO4929097 on the plasma pharmacokinetics of CYP450 substrates;&#xD;
      midazolam (CYP3A4), omeprazole (CYP2C19), tolbutamide (CYP2C9) and dextromethorphan (CYP2D6)&#xD;
      after single dose and chronic administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the influence of polymorphisms in CYP3A4, 3A5, 2C9, ABCB1, and 2D6 on RO4929097&#xD;
      plasma pharmacokinetics V. To assess any evidence of clinical activity (CR, PR, SD) in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen I (low-dose of RO4929097): Patients receive low-dose RO4929097 orally (PO) once daily&#xD;
      on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and midazolam hydrochloride IV over 1 minute, omeprazole PO,&#xD;
      tolbutamide PO, and dextromethorphan hydrobromide PO on days 1 and 10. After completion of&#xD;
      course 1, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: Patients receive low-dose RO4929097 PO once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and&#xD;
      ketoconazole PO once daily on days 1-10 for course 2 only. For course 3 and beyond, patients&#xD;
      receive low-dose RO4929097 on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: Patients receive low-dose RO4929097 PO once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and&#xD;
      rifampin PO once daily on days 1-10 for course 2 only. For course 3 and beyond, patients&#xD;
      receive low-dose RO4929097 on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen II (high-dose of RO4929097): Patients receive high-dose RO4929097 PO once daily on&#xD;
      days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and midazolam hydrochloride IV, oral omeprazole, oral tolbutamide,&#xD;
      and oral dextromethorphan hydrobromide on days 1 and 10. After completion of course 1,&#xD;
      patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: Patients receive high-dose RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and oral&#xD;
      ketoconazole once daily on days 1-10 for course 2 only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: Patients receive high-dose RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and oral&#xD;
      rifampin once daily on days 1-10 for course 2 only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all arms, treatment with RO4929097 repeats every 21 days for &gt;= 3 courses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during study for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics studies and evaluation of SNPs in CYP2D6, CYP2C9, ABCB1, and CYP3A4/5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preclinical studies indicate that RO4929097 is a substrate of CYP3A4 and inducer of&#xD;
             CYP3A4 enzyme activity; caution should be exercised when dosing RO4929097 concurrently&#xD;
             with CYP3A4 substrates, inducers, and/or inhibitors; furthermore, patients who are&#xD;
             taking concurrent medications that are strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of&#xD;
             CYP3A4 should be switched to alternative medications to minimize any potential risk;&#xD;
             if such patients cannot be switched to alternative medications, they will be&#xD;
             ineligible to participate in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Caution should be exercised when dosing ketoconazole, rifampin, omeprazole, midazolam,&#xD;
             tolbutamide, and dextromethorphan concurrently with CYP3A4 substrates, inducers,&#xD;
             and/or inhibitors; furthermore, patients who are taking concurrent medications that&#xD;
             are strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of CYP3A4 should be switched to&#xD;
             alternative medications to minimize any potential risk; if such patients cannot be&#xD;
             switched to alternative medications, they will be ineligible to participate in this&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of RO4929097on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;
             dose are unknown; for this reason and because Notch signal pathway inhibitors are&#xD;
             known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and men must use two forms of&#xD;
             contraception (i.e., barrier contraception and one other method of contraception) at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for&#xD;
             at least 12 months post-treatment; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner are participating in this study and for 12 months&#xD;
             after study participation, the patient should inform the treating physician&#xD;
             immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women randomized to Regimen I (Arm B) and Regimen II (Arm B), and receiving rifampin&#xD;
             will need to use an additional, non-hormonal birth control during cycle 2; rifampin&#xD;
             induces enzymes responsible for hormone metabolism, making hormonal birth control&#xD;
             ineffective; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, or radiographically evaluable metastatic&#xD;
             disease (e.g. osseous metastases) with evidence of disease progression (e.g. new&#xD;
             lesions or rising tumor markers)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treated, stable brain metastases are allowed; patients must be four weeks from&#xD;
             radiation with stable brain imaging and off any medications used to treat brain&#xD;
             metastases, excepting those anti-epileptics not metabolized by cytochrome P450&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered (=&lt; grade 1) from clinically significant adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier; prior palliative radiotherapy is allowed if&#xD;
             greater than 2 weeks have elapsed and patient has also recovered to baseline or grade&#xD;
             &lt; 1 from any treatment adverse effects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to RO4929097, or other agents used in study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, and a&#xD;
             history of torsades de pointes or other significant cardiac arrhythmia other than&#xD;
             chronic, stable atrial fibrillation, or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because RO4929097 is a gamma-secretase&#xD;
             inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there&#xD;
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with RO4929097, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with RO4929097; these potential risks may also apply to other agents&#xD;
             used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible&#xD;
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with RO4929097; in addition,&#xD;
             these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
