  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer patients have one of the worst prognoses among all cancer types with a 5&#xD;
      year survival rate of less than 5%. Despite significant changes during the last decade in our&#xD;
      molecular knowledge on this disease, the prognosis and management of pancreatic cancer have&#xD;
      remained unchanged. With the advances in molecular biology, newer biologic agents such as&#xD;
      erlotinib, are adding some benefit to the conventional cytotoxic agents. There is a growing&#xD;
      body of literature suggesting that type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) may be associated with the&#xD;
      development of pancreatic cancer, but this association is complex. Because various DM&#xD;
      medications can affect directly the key factors mediating the association between DM and&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer, understanding the effect of anti-diabetic therapies on pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      is a critical step in fully characterizing the role of type 2 DM in the development of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer. Indeed, two epidemiologic studies have found that diabetic patients&#xD;
      treated with metformin were less likely to develop cancer, but those treated with insulin&#xD;
      were more likely to die of various kinds cancer. Not only does metformin ameliorate&#xD;
      hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, both of which are associated with the adverse impact of&#xD;
      DM on cancer, metformin also has direct metabolic effects through activation of adenosine&#xD;
      monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK regulates many metabolic enzymes and also&#xD;
      inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway via phosphorylation and&#xD;
      stabilization of the tumor suppressor gene TSC2. But there is an intensive cross-talk between&#xD;
      various pathways. Inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, of which&#xD;
      mTOR is one of the effector proteins, for instance may result in escape via the&#xD;
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and vice verse. Indeed, epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor (EGFR) activation leads to activation of the MAPK pathway and the PI3K&#xD;
      pathway. Thus, since it is clear that blocking one pathway will not always be sufficient to&#xD;
      produce a response in the presence of other activated pathways, the best change of success&#xD;
      will be realized when using a combination of agents that inhibit separate pathways known to&#xD;
      be critical to the survival of the tumour. In line with these observations, combining a small&#xD;
      molecule against the EGFR and inhibition of the PI3K pathway by metformin might account for&#xD;
      potential candidates of the above combinatorial approach. Therefore, in this study, the&#xD;
      investigators want to determine the activity and safety of concurrent interruption of the&#xD;
      MAPK and PI3K pathways by the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib and metformin,&#xD;
      combined with gemcitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      In this phase II randomized, placebo controlled study, patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic cancer will be randomized to treatment with gemcitabine, erlotinib and&#xD;
      metformin, or gemcitabine, erlotinib and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 (iv, 30 minutes) will be given weekly, for 3 weeks,&#xD;
      followed by one week without treatment. Erlotinib will be administered at a daily dose of 100&#xD;
      mg at least one hour before or 2 hours after the ingestion of food. Metformin/ placebo will&#xD;
      be administered at a dose of 500 mg twice daily. If well tolerated the dose will be increased&#xD;
      to 1000 mg twice daily in the second week.&#xD;
