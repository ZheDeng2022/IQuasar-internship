  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effects of Trientine Hydrochloride in prevention of post-laser (pan-retinal&#xD;
      photocoagulation) macular edema in the eyes for subjects with diabetic retinopathy. Trientine&#xD;
      hydrochloride can limit secondary inflammatory damage to retinal vessels following the&#xD;
      administration of pan-retinal photocoagulation therapy for severe non-proliferative diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy or retinal neovascularization due to diabetic retinopathy, resulting in less&#xD;
      macular edema and improved visual outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with new-onset severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or retinal&#xD;
      neovascularization who present to the retinal service of the UBC/VGH Eye Care Centre will be&#xD;
      offered participation in this study. Subject inclusion criteria will parallel those of the&#xD;
      DRS (Diabetic Retinopathy Study) and ETDRS (Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study).&#xD;
      One PRP session will consist of between 800 to 1000 laser burns. Subjects with discomfort&#xD;
      during laser (a known side-effect) will be treated with local anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As noted, participating subjects will all receive PRP according to present standards of care;&#xD;
      however, subjects will be randomized to either a 10-day course of oral Trientine at 1500mg&#xD;
      administered for 7-days prior to and 3 days after the PRP sessions, or a placebo. Serum&#xD;
      copper levels and urinary copper levels will be evaluated before and after Trientine&#xD;
      administration to determine the amount of free copper present systemically at the time of PRP&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ocular outcomes will include visual acuity testing (ETDRS), fluorescein angiography and&#xD;
      ocular coherence tomography (OCT). These studies will be used to evaluate retinal morphology&#xD;
      and photoreceptor function pre and post laser. All these evaluations are considered part of&#xD;
      the routine evaluation of diabetic retinopathy in subjects being treated with PRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be assessed at day 2-post laser, week 1, and Day 28-30. Further&#xD;
      clinical PRP treatment will be administered if necessary after Day 28-30 at the discretion of&#xD;
      the patients' ophthalmologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will involve comparing the retinal thickness measurements between&#xD;
      subjects undergoing PRP with and without Trientine use. Secondary analyses will involve&#xD;
      evaluations of visual acuity and fluorescein angiography. As well, changes in visual acuity,&#xD;
      angiographic leakage, and retinal thickness will be regressed against serum copper levels.&#xD;
      Sample size calculations suggest 15 subjects per arm should be adequate to demonstrate a 40%&#xD;
      reduction in retinal thickness with a power of 80% comparing subjects receiving Trientine to&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are randomized to Trientine will receive 1500 mg Trientine PO daily for 10 days.&#xD;
      Subjects, study-coordinators, and investigators will be masked to treatment group. The&#xD;
      primary analysis will be a comparison of OCT thickness measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single centre study involving 30 subjects (15 cases and 15 controls). A 1:1&#xD;
      randomization will be employed (Trientine 1500 mg: Placebo). No normal subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
