      Aims Aspirin combined with clopidogrel is the treatment of choice for acute coronary&#xD;
      syndromes. Although the maintenance of aspirin until surgery does not affect postoperative&#xD;
      bleeding after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, the latter may be dramatically&#xD;
      increased when clopidogrel is continued over a period of 5 days preoperatively. Methods and&#xD;
      results: This prospective observational study will include 136 consecutive patients scheduled&#xD;
      for first-time CABG. Postoperative bleeding and blood transfusion requirements will be&#xD;
      compared (non inferiority)between patients pretreated during a period of 5 days prior surgery&#xD;
      by either aspirin alone or combined with clopidogrel. Tranexamic acid will be systematically&#xD;
      used in all these patients considered as high risk for bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In concusion, this study has to to test the hypothesis that with tranexamic acid also,&#xD;
      bleeding in the aspirin + clopidogrel group is not 25% more important than in the aspirin&#xD;
      alone group after CABG surgery, according to the previous study using aprotinin.&#xD;

      Impact of combination of clopidogrel with aspirin on postoperative bleeding and platelets&#xD;
      functions in coronary surgical patients treated prophylactically with tranexamic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction Major cardiac events are known to be reduced in patients with acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome by an association of aspirin with clopidogrel (1)(2). In cardiac surgery as well,&#xD;
      aspirin treatment has been shown to reduce major cardio-vascular events and mortality in&#xD;
      postoperative period after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) without any increase of&#xD;
      postoperative bleeding (3)(4). In a recent study performed in our department, Ouattara and&#xD;
      al. have shown in cardiac surgery that the combination of aspirin with clopidogrel does not&#xD;
      increase postoperative bleeding, transfusion or surgical reexploration after CABG when&#xD;
      aprotinin is used during surgery, by comparison to aspirin alone (5). In conclusion, the&#xD;
      authors suggested no disruption of aspirin and clopidogrel when patients are treated with&#xD;
      this association before surgery. Unfortunately, since the trials of Mangano and al. (6) and&#xD;
      of the BART investigators (7), aprotinin, a plasmin inhibitor derived from bovine lung&#xD;
      tissues, has been withdrawn for safety reasons. Therefore, physicians are restrained to use&#xD;
      instead tranexamic acid, a synthetic molecule that inhibits conversion of the inactive&#xD;
      plasminogen to plasmin, to minimize bleeding and to reduce exposure to blood products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that with tranexamic acid also, bleeding in&#xD;
      the aspirin + clopidogrel group is not 25% more important than in the aspirin alone group&#xD;
      after CABG surgery, according to the previous study using aprotinin. In the present study,&#xD;
      the functionality of the platelets tested before the surgical procedure will be compared to&#xD;
      level of the first 24 hours bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Selection of patients This prospective observational study will be conducted at the&#xD;
      Institute of Cardiology in the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France. It is planned to&#xD;
      start in december 2009 to november 2010. Care of patients will conform to standard procedures&#xD;
      currently used in our institute, which will not be modified by the study. Platelet function&#xD;
      will be measured in residual blood samples, after ethical committee approval (Comité de&#xD;
      Protection des Personnes VI - Ile de France). A written informed consent is not resquested&#xD;
      from patients. Nevertheless, written information will be delivered for each of them. During&#xD;
      the planned 11 months of investigation, all patients undergoing isolated first-time coronary&#xD;
      artery by-pass grafting will be enrolled. Patients admitted for emergency procedure,&#xD;
      following failed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and off-pump coronary&#xD;
      surgery, will be excluded. Because antithrombotic therapy management may differ during the&#xD;
      postoperative period, we will exclude patients in whom a mechanical support or intra-aortic&#xD;
      balloon pump will be required for a difficult weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Finally,&#xD;
      we will exclude all patients who will not have received any oral antiplatelet agents within 5&#xD;
      days prior surgery, those who will have been preoperatively exposed to platelet glycoprotein&#xD;
      IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and those with history of haematological disease. Patients treated with&#xD;
      aspirin and clopidogrel and in whom clopidogrel will be stopped more than 5 days before&#xD;
      surgery will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative management Patients will be monitored with arterial and central venous&#xD;
      catheterizations. All patients will be considered at high risk for postoperative bleeding as&#xD;
      they will receive at least one antiplatelet agent and therefore will be administered&#xD;
      tranexamic acid (Exacyl®, Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France) according to the following&#xD;
      standardized protocol: infusion of 10 mg/kg for 20 minutes during anaesthesia induction,&#xD;
      followed by a continuous infusion until the end of surgery, according to renal function of&#xD;
      patients as described by Nuttall et al. (8) (See table below). The rest of intraoperative&#xD;
      management will be the same as previously described by Ouattara and al. (5). Briefly, before&#xD;
      aortic cannulation, an initial loading dose of heparin will be directly administered by the&#xD;
      surgeon into the right atrium and then anticoagulation will be maintained by additional bolus&#xD;
      during the extracorporeal circulation. Non-pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass will be ensured&#xD;
      at a flow of 2.4 L/min/m2. The temperature of systemic perfusion during cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass (hypothermia &lt;32°C, mild hypothermia 32-36°C, and normothermia &gt;36°C) will be left to&#xD;
      the discretion of the attending surgeon. After discontinuation of the cardiopulmonary bypass,&#xD;
      heparin will be neutralized by protamin sulfate (0.008-0.01 mg/IU of total heparin dose&#xD;
      intraoperatively used). Intraoperative cell salvage will be systematically used (Electa,&#xD;
      Dideco, Mirandola, Italy). The use of inotropes for difficult weaning from cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass will be left to the discretion of the attending anaesthesiologist. Discontinuation of&#xD;
      the cardiopulmonary bypass will be done when central body temperature (estimated by vesical&#xD;
      temperature) will be above 35°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creatinine Tranexamic acid dose &lt; 140 µmol/L 2 mg/kg/h 140 - 290 µmol/L 1,5 mg/kg/h 291 - 580&#xD;
      µmol/L 1 mg/kg/h &gt; 580 µmol/L 0,5 mg/kg/h Table: dosing of tranexamic acid according to renal&#xD;
      function, from Nuttall and al. (8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative antithrombotic therapy The early postoperative antithrombotic therapy will be&#xD;
      based on intravenous bolus of 100 mg aspirin given 6 h after the arrival in intensive care&#xD;
      unit, as previously described. The day after surgery, enoxaparin 40 mg will be given once&#xD;
      daily subcutaneously. The perioperative blood transfusion will be done according to the&#xD;
      French National recommendations (9). In patients preoperatively treated by combined&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy, clopidogrel will be re-introduced the day after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiplatelet therapy efficiency monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative platelet function will include :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Platelet aggregation tests Aggregation studies will be performed within 3 hours after&#xD;
           blood collection by Pascale Gaussem (INSERM U765, HEGP), as published elsewhere (10).&#xD;
           Aggregation tests are performed on platelet-rich plasma adjusted to 250x109/L platelets&#xD;
           using the following agonists: arachidonic acid 1.5 and 2 mmol/l (Helena biosciences&#xD;
           Europe) to explore aspirin effect, Horm collagen 1 µg/ml to explore global platelet&#xD;
           function (Nycomed Pharma) and ADP 10 and 20 µmol/l (Biopool) to explore clopidogrel&#xD;
           effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A whole blood platelet impedance aggregation test will be performed using the&#xD;
           Multiplate® (IL) device and various agonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Flow cytometry assays VASP phosphorylation: clopidogrel effect VASP&#xD;
           (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) is measured in whole blood with a commercial kit&#xD;
           (Platelet VASP; Diagnostica Stago, Biocytex) on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton&#xD;
           Dickinson). The results are expressed as the platelet reactivity index (PRI, %).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secretory capacity of platelets Platelet secretion will be tested by their capacity to expose&#xD;
      surface P-selectin (CD62P) after activation with the thrombin receptor peptide agonist (TRAP)&#xD;
      as published elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating platelet-leukocyte complexes Circulating activated platelets form complexes with&#xD;
      leukocytes via CD62P-PSGL interaction. These complexes are quantified on a population of 5000&#xD;
      leukocytes. Complexes are identified by flow cytometry as the cell population stained with&#xD;
      both anti-CD41-PE (platelet marker) and anti-CD45-FITC (leukocyte marker) and are expressed&#xD;
      as a percentage of total leukocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints The primary outcome will be the chest blood output during the first 24 hours. Size&#xD;
      sample calculation : bleeding with aspirin alone is estimated around 400±200 mL after CABG&#xD;
      (5). Excessive bleeding will be defined by an increment of at least 25% of this basal value&#xD;
      collected through chest tubes during the first 24 postoperative hours. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will be the rate of re-exploration for excessive bleeding, transfusion requirement, prolonged&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation (&gt;10 h), and intensive care unit length of stay (&gt;72 h).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis With an estimated distribution of 60% / 40% between aspirin alone and&#xD;
      aspirin + clopidogrel groups and assuming an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.20 and a&#xD;
      mean amount of postoperative bleeding after CABG in the aspirin-alone group of 400 +/- 200&#xD;
      mL, we calculate that at least 136 patients at all (85 in aspirin alone and 51 in aspirin +&#xD;
      clopidogrel) are required to demonstrate that the amount of bleeding in the&#xD;
      aspirin+clopidogrel was not more than 25% increased compared to the bleeding in aspirin alone&#xD;
      group (non inferiority study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, supposing a few patients lost to follow up and several technical problems after&#xD;
      sample collection in platelets function analysis, the final number of patients to include is&#xD;
      estimated to be 150 and thus the predicted duration of inclusion will be 44 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be compared using Fisher's exact test and continuous variables&#xD;
      using the Mann-Witney U test. The postoperative hemoglobin levels and platelet counts will be&#xD;
      compared using analysis of variance for repeated measurements completed using a Newman-Keuls&#xD;
      test for post-test analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this study is not randomized, the patients receiving clopidogrel preoperatively may not&#xD;
      have the same peri-operative risk of excessive bleeding than those who do not. Therefore, we&#xD;
      will perform separate multivariable risk adjustment to analyze the perioperative risk&#xD;
      associated with clopidogrel treatment. For each patient, a propensity score, indicating the&#xD;
      likelihood of having clopidogrel, will be calculated. The propensity score-matched analysis&#xD;
      will allows us to determine whether preoperative clopidogrel therapy is independently&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of excessive postoperative bleeding. All preoperative&#xD;
      variables as well as second-order interaction terms will be entered into the model.&#xD;
      Calibration and discrimination of the final logistic model will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics and the receiver operating characteristic curve, respectively.&#xD;
      Comparison of mean bleeding between several groups (according to propensity score quintiles)&#xD;
      will be performed using analysis of variance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be expressed as mean+SD, median, and 5th-95th percentiles or percentage of patients&#xD;
      as specified. All P-values will be two tailed and a value less than 0.05 will be required to&#xD;
      reject the null hypothesis.&#xD;
