  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that steroid use is a benefit in the treatment of chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation (AE). But it is still debated about the&#xD;
      regimen and dosage of steroid use. From this retrospective review of medical charts, the&#xD;
      researchers investigated the therapeutic impact of various steroid dosages in COPD with AE.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Data collection from medical charts was conducted at Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, a&#xD;
      tertiary-care hospital with around 900 beds. Patients who were admitted from January 2008 to&#xD;
      December 2008 and diagnosed as having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute&#xD;
      exacerbation (code ICD-9: 491.21) were included in this study. The study was approved by the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board of the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital (FEMH:098097-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data, medical histories and medicine prescriptions at outpatient clinics,&#xD;
      emergency and inpatient departments were collected. The initial presentations of acute&#xD;
      exacerbation and laboratory data were also summarized from the records of the emergency&#xD;
      department. The reports of pulmonary function tests within 6 months before or after the&#xD;
      exacerbations were included while reviewing the charts. The probability of concomitant&#xD;
      pneumonia (pAECOPD) was determined by attending physicians and reviewed by the investigator&#xD;
      according to the radiologic findings. If there were incoherent opinions about the probability&#xD;
      of pneumonia between the physicians and the investigator, it was determined by another&#xD;
      independent pulmonologist. The highest daily doses and total doses of systemic steroids were&#xD;
      calculated and recorded as the equivalent doses of prednisolone (1 mg methylprednisolone is&#xD;
      equal to 1.25 mg prednisolone; 1 mg hydrocortisone is equal to 0.25 mg prednisolone). The&#xD;
      subjects were divided into 3 groups according to the highest daily dose of steroids as&#xD;
      follows: patients receiving more than 60 mg/day were designated to the HD group; those&#xD;
      receiving less than or equal to 60 mg/day to the LD group; and those who did not receive any&#xD;
      steroids during admission to the NIL group. The length of stay (LOS) was defined as the&#xD;
      duration from admission to the emergency department to discharge. Hyperglycemia, psychosis,&#xD;
      nosocomial infections and active peptic ulcer diseases were regarded as acute side effects of&#xD;
      systemic steroids. Hyperglycemia was defined as a new blood sugar level of more than 200&#xD;
      mg/dl in patients without a history of diabetic mellitus, or an increment in diabetes&#xD;
      medications. The relapse rate within 30 days was assessed by outpatient follow-up records.&#xD;
