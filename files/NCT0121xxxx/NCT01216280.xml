  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of multiple oral doses of&#xD;
      Natura-alpha capsule administered to patients with active ulcerative colitis. This will be a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study. Up to 75 patients will&#xD;
      complete this study (20 to 25 patients per treatment group) at approximately 10-12 clinical&#xD;
      sites in the Unites States. Patients will be assigned at a 1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo,&#xD;
      Natura-alpha 10 mg or Natura-alpha 20 mg, b.i.d. Replacement patients may be added, pending&#xD;
      Sponsor approval, if it appears that less than 60 patients will complete the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will have moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Disease Activity Index (DAI) score of 6 to 10 (inclusive);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopic evidence of active ulcerative colitis (DAI mucosal appearance sub score of&#xD;
           ≥2) as assessed by flexible sigmoidoscopy unless colonoscopy is clinically indicated;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rectal bleeding (DAI sub score of ≥1);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of moderate disease (DAI sub score ≥2). Patients&#xD;
           will be randomized to receive placebo, 10 mg Natura-alpha or 20 mg Natura-alpha.&#xD;
           Patients will self-administer their assigned dose orally for 28 consecutive days, twice&#xD;
           per day (b.i.d) at approximately 8:00 am and 8:00 pm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness and safety of Natura-alpha will be evaluated at baseline, and after 7, 14&#xD;
      and 28 days of treatment. Additional follow-up measurements will take place 7 and 28 days&#xD;
      post cessation of treatment (Day 35 and Day 56, respectively). Stool samples for fecal&#xD;
      calprotectin (FC) tests and optional blood samples (15 ml) for cytokine tests will be&#xD;
      collected and analyzed at sponsor-selected sites and lab for exploratory analyses to be&#xD;
      performed at a later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical response will be assessed by the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) on the basis of&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy (Walkiewicz, Werlin et al. 2008) and mucosal appearance (DAI category).&#xD;
      Sigmoidoscopy including histopathological examination to assess disease severity and changes&#xD;
      in tissue inflammation will be conducted before and after treatment (Day 1, Day 28) by the&#xD;
      same endoscopist at each site and read by one sponsor selected central pathologist.&#xD;
      Truelove-Richards histological grading system will be applied for disease histological&#xD;
      scoring (Pullan, Rhodes et al. 1994; Zhong, Huang et al. 2005; Liang and Ouyang 2008). Safety&#xD;
      labs and adverse events (AEs) will be monitored for the duration of the study (including the&#xD;
      7 day follow up visit).&#xD;
