      Background Denmark has a record-high incidence of, and mortality rate for, ovarian cancer.&#xD;
      There are 600 new cases of ovarian cancer each year. In 2008 the state issued a guarantee of&#xD;
      early diagnosis and treatment of all cases of suspected cancer, and surgical treatment has&#xD;
      been centralised and standardised in fast track programmes. However, the investigators do not&#xD;
      know how women with ovarian cancer experience the period prior to surgery and how they can&#xD;
      optimally prepare for treatment and care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The two principal aims of the study are to describe health and coping in Danish women&#xD;
      surgically treated for ovarian cancer; and to examine to what extent it is possible, from&#xD;
      both a patient and professional perspective, to improve the health and everyday life of&#xD;
      patients with ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods The study is conducted within the scientific theoretical framework of&#xD;
      hermeneutics, involving the overall concepts of health promotion and rehabilitation. The&#xD;
      study will be carried out in 4 stages between September 2008 and September 2011. Stage 1: A&#xD;
      health-related characterisation of Danish women with ovarian cancer through a registration&#xD;
      process. Stage 2: Qualitative research interviews with patients, to gain knowledge about&#xD;
      spontaneous preoperative coping strategies and resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3: The preoperative preparation programme will be developed and clinically tested. The&#xD;
      effect of participation will be measured by self-assessed health and coping before and after&#xD;
      surgery. The study period runs from the time the decision is taken to operate until eight&#xD;
      weeks after discharge. The study takes place at the Department of Gynaecology at Aarhus&#xD;
      University Hospital, Skejby in Denmark, which is a regional centre of surgical treatment of&#xD;
      gynaecological cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results The study provides insight into the preoperative coping strategies and general health&#xD;
      of Danish women suffering from ovarian cancer. The development and testing of the&#xD;
      preoperative preparation programme contributes to knowledge about optimisation of&#xD;
      preoperative preparation. This might have a positive impact on the participants' general&#xD;
      health and level of functioning during their treatment. Furthermore, the project contributes&#xD;
      to knowledge of the preoperative coping strategies and experiences of (female) cancer&#xD;
      patients in general.&#xD;
