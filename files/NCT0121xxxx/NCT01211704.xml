  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary specific aim is to examine the efficacy of Paliperidone extended release&#xD;
      Paliperidone Palmitate Injection (INVEGA® SUSTENNA™) compared to placebo in decreasing manic&#xD;
      symptoms in patients with comorbid DSM-IV bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the Paliperidone Palmitate Injection (INVEGA® SUSTENNA™)&#xD;
      treated group will have a statistically significant advantage on improvement in manic&#xD;
      symptoms. They will also have higher rate of treatment response and remission.&#xD;

      Subjects who meet study inclusion criteria will be randomized to receive an add-on&#xD;
      Paliperidone Palmitate ( INVEGA® SUSTENNA™ ) according to the following schedule described in&#xD;
      the medication prescribing information: INVEGA® SUSTENNA™ (PALIPERIDONE PALMITATE)&#xD;
      Extended-Release Injectable Suspension ). Tolerability of the paliperidone will be&#xD;
      established by either 1) a documented history of having taken either paliperidone or&#xD;
      risperidone in the past without any untoward effects or allergic reactions, or 2) by&#xD;
      prescribing oral paliperidone 6mg per day for three days with absence of any allergic or&#xD;
      severe untoward side effects for those with no prior history of having taken these&#xD;
      medications, prior to initiating treatment with INVEGA® SUSTENNA™ according to the&#xD;
      manufacturers' recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized to INVEGA® SUSTENNA™ or placebo in equivalent ml doses&#xD;
      according to the following schedule: Day 1: INVEGA® SUSTENNA™ 234mg vs. placebo injection&#xD;
      (equivalent ml); Day 8 (week 1) INVEGA® SUSTENNA™ 156mg vs. placebo injection (equivalent&#xD;
      ml); Day 36 (week 5): INVEGA® SUSTENNA™ 117 mg vs. placebo injection (equivalent ml) ( this&#xD;
      latter dose could range from 39mg to 156mg according to tolerability and clinical symptoms of&#xD;
      bipolar disorder); Day 64 (week 9) no injection; weeks 10 and 11 safety assessment follow-up&#xD;
      ( see Study Schematics below). Both treatment groups will participate in standardized&#xD;
      individual medication adherence counseling. Subjects with bipolar disorder and who are&#xD;
      actively drinking will be recruited into the study. Subjects who have been stable on&#xD;
      treatment as usual medications for bipolar disorder for at least three weeks, and who meet&#xD;
      all the inclusion criteria will be randomized to receive the double blind study medication&#xD;
      consistent of either Paliperidone Palmitate injection ( INVEGA® SUSTENNA™ )or placebo (1:1&#xD;
      ratio). To optimize the likelihood of balanced groups, the investigators will use urn&#xD;
      randomization with the following variables: Gender (males vs. females), treatment as usual&#xD;
      medication (divalproex sodium vs. other mood stabilizers), presenting bipolar subtype (manic&#xD;
      vs mixed) and baseline drinking severity (&lt; vs. &gt; 50% heavy drinking days (&gt; 4 standard&#xD;
      drinks for females and &gt; 5 standard drinks per males) in the month prior to enrollment).&#xD;
      After randomization, subjects will be assessed weekly at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,9 of&#xD;
      the double-blind treatment phase a and at week 10 and 11 for safety observation follow-up..&#xD;
      The investigators propose to test the above hypotheses in 75 subjects at three sites (25&#xD;
      subjects per site) All subjects will receive a weekly Standardized supportive individual&#xD;
      medication adherence counseling session.&#xD;

        active liver disease (elevated t. bilirubin &gt; 1.5 mg/dl, or elevation to three-time normal&#xD;
        range of liver enzymes, SGOT, SGPT, or g-GTP). 7) Any medication that is effective for&#xD;
        alcohol dependence such as disulfiram, naltrexone, acamprosate, or topiramate.&#xD;
        Carbamazepine for potential clinically significant drug-drug interaction. Other exclusion&#xD;
        criteria include pregnancy, women who are breastfeeding, inability or unwillingness to use&#xD;
        contraceptive methods, and inability to read or understand study forms and agrees to&#xD;
        informed consent, or based on the judgment of the investigative team that the study may not&#xD;
        be in the best interest of the subject either due to additional safety concerns or other&#xD;
        factors that may interfere with study participations.&#xD;
