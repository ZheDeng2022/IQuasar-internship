  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imatinib (IM) is first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase.&#xD;
      The drug is associated with high rates of cytogenetic responses with minimal toxicity in&#xD;
      approximately 80% of patients. In 20% of patients however, the disease is either initially&#xD;
      unresponsive to IM (Imatinib), resistance develops within a few months, or blast crisis&#xD;
      occurs early and unexpectedly following an initial response. An increasing body of clinical&#xD;
      evidence indicates that single agent molecularly targeted therapy (as in Gleevec/Imatinib)&#xD;
      will not cure most patients with CML, as molecular remissions are rare. There is currently no&#xD;
      clinically useful predictive tests to identify AT DIAGNOSIS those patients who are destined&#xD;
      to be IM failures. The authors of this study have recently demonstrated that CML&#xD;
      stem/progenitor cells are biologically insensitive to IM and are also genetically unstable&#xD;
      and rapidly generate IM-resistant mutants in vitro and in vivo. The team recently discovered&#xD;
      that the CD34 stem/progenitor cells of newly diagnosed CML patients who subsequently fail to&#xD;
      respond to IM treatment show a reduced response to IM and a higher frequency of BCR-ABL&#xD;
      mutations by comparison of 14 IM non-responders with 11 IM-responders. If this finding can be&#xD;
      validated in a larger prospective cohort of patients, this predictive test could be used to&#xD;
      more rationally design treatment plans with early addition of alternative therapies ie:&#xD;
      Dasatinib or combination therapies for patients according to their individual risk profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical response of newly diagnosed chronic phase CML patients to IM can be predicted by&#xD;
      certain biological properties of their CD34 stem/progenitor cells which are variable among&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      level of expression of BCR-ABL, OCT1, ABCB1/MDR and ABCG2 transcripts in their CD34+ cells&#xD;
