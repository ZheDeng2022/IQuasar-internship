    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine the preliminary efficacy of administration of bafetinib in subjects with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), as measured by the objective response rate (ORR), which is a combination of CR (PSA ≤0.12 ng/mL) and PR (≥50% reduction in PSA from baseline).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>At six months.</time_frame>
    <description>The safety of bafetinib in this population assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), abnormal findings on physical examination, laboratory tests, and vital signs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>At six months.</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the time from enrollment to first documentation of objective PSA or tumor progression, or to death due to any cause in the absence of previous documentation of objective tumor progression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective tumor response</measure>
    <time_frame>At six months.</time_frame>

&#xD;
          -  Hormone-refractory prostate cancer having progressed despite androgen deprivation&#xD;
             therapy that resulted in a castrated level of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dL) or orchiectomy;&#xD;
