  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is designed to confirm the mechanism behind the increase in serum&#xD;
      creatinine observed during GSK1349572 therapy; specifically, the study will determine whether&#xD;
      GSK1349572 has any effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or effective renal plasma flow.&#xD;
      Absent such effects, one may conclude that the small increases in serum creatinine observed&#xD;
      are due to the inhibition of the tubular secretion of creatinine via organic cation&#xD;
      transporter 2 (OCT2) consistent with in vitro data. .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GSK1349572 is an integrase inhibitor being developed for the treatment of human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) on behalf of Shionogi-ViiV&#xD;
      Healthcare LLC. In healthy subjects and in dose-ranging clinical trials of GSK1349572,&#xD;
      subjects showed a small, reversible increase in serum creatinine concentrations as compared&#xD;
      to the control groups; this occurred early during study drug administration and did not&#xD;
      progress over time. In vitro data demonstrate that GSK1349572 inhibits the organic cation&#xD;
      transporter (OCT2), which mediates the tubular secretion of creatinine; drugs such as&#xD;
      cimetidine with similar effects on OCT2 lead to a nonpathological increase in creatinine with&#xD;
      no effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The current study is designed to confirm the&#xD;
      mechanism behind the increase in serum creatinine observed during GSK1349572 therapy;&#xD;
      specifically, the study will determine whether GSK1349572 has any effect on GFR or effective&#xD;
      renal plasma flow. Absent such effects, one may conclude that the small increases in serum&#xD;
      creatinine observed are due to the inhibition of the tubular secretion of creatinine via&#xD;
      OCT2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be given GSK1349572 50mg once daily, 50mg twice daily or placebo once daily for&#xD;
      14 days. Changes in the subject's GFR will be measured through administration of iohexol and&#xD;
      effective renal plasma flow will be measured using Para-Aminohippurate (PAH) on days -1, 7&#xD;
      and 14. Changes in serum creatinine and other renal biomarkers will be evaluated at baseline&#xD;
      and at various time points throughout the study.&#xD;
