  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of doula support on childbirth outcomes&#xD;
      of women who are eligible for and attempting to have a Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC).&#xD;
      Doulas are paraprofessionals who provide women with continuous physical and emotional support&#xD;
      throughout the course of labour. They also conduct home visits in the prenatal and postpartum&#xD;
      periods in order to provide women with information on childbirth-related topics and&#xD;
      breastfeeding support. They do not perform clinical tasks. Their value lies in the&#xD;
      psycho-social care that they provide. It is hypothesized that women who receive doula support&#xD;
      alongside standard care will have a lower rate of epidural analgesia use and greater cervical&#xD;
      dilation at time of epidural administration, as compared to those who receive standard care&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A two-armed randomized controlled trial will be conducted at BC Women's Hospital. The&#xD;
      experimental group will receive both standard clinical care and doula support. The control&#xD;
      group will receive standard clinical care without doula support. The main outcomes being&#xD;
      looked at are use of epidural analgesia and cervical dilation at time of epidural&#xD;
      administration. These outcomes have been chosen because of the association between the use of&#xD;
      epidural analgesia and both a prolonged length of labour and the need for assisted deliveries&#xD;
      (i.e. forceps assisted deliveries, vacuum assisted deliveries, and cesarean births). If it is&#xD;
      found that providing doula support for women who are eligible for and attempting to have a&#xD;
      VBAC reduces or delays the use of epidural analgesia, then it could be hypothesized that&#xD;
      doula support for this population may also shorten the length of labour and reduce the need&#xD;
      for assisted deliveries, thereby justifying ongoing research in this area.&#xD;

    <description>The following secondary outcomes will be measured:&#xD;
Use of nitrous oxide analgesia during labour.&#xD;
Use of narcotic analgesia during labour (type and amount).&#xD;
Number of visits to the assessment room before admission.&#xD;
Mode of delivery (cesarean section, spontaneous vaginal, or forceps/vacuum).&#xD;
Indication(s) for repeat cesarean (if applicable).&#xD;
Length of time between admission and the start of active pushing.&#xD;
Length of time between the start of active pushing and delivery.&#xD;
Length of time between delivery and discharge.</description>
