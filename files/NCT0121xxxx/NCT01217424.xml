      RATIONALE: Reflexology and aromatherapy massage may lessen symptoms in patients with cancer.&#xD;
      It is not yet known whether reflexology is more effective than aromatherapy massage in&#xD;
      relieving symptoms in patients with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying reflexology to see how well it works&#xD;
      compared with aromatherapy massage in relieving symptoms in patients with cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether reflexology is as effective as aromatherapy massage for alleviation&#xD;
           of self-selected symptoms in patients with cancer in an outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the difference between the two therapies with respect to Visual Analogue&#xD;
           Scale (VAS) relaxation scores before and after each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to gender (male vs female), treatment&#xD;
      (chemotherapy vs other) and their first concern choice (pain vs other). Patients are&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (Reflexology): Patients undergo 45-60 minutes of reflexology for 4 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (Aromatherapy massage): Patients undergo 45-60 minutes of of aromatherapy massage&#xD;
           for 4 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete questionnaires (Measure Yourself Concerns and Well-being [MYCAW]&#xD;
      questionnaire and Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]) at baseline, before and after each session,&#xD;
      and after completion of all four sessions.&#xD;
