      Cardiovascular diseases belong to the major causes of mortality in western populations, and&#xD;
      atherosclerosis is the lesion responsible for clinical events, such as acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis remains asymptomatic until a clinical event occurs, and in the pre-clinical&#xD;
      stage it may be difficult to diagnose. As disease surrogate, a large number of risk factors&#xD;
      for atherosclerosis are being recognized. Some of them are responsible for the&#xD;
      epidemiologically very serious metabolic syndrome, which accounts for development of&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes or arterial hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health providers in continental diet-based countries suggest to embracing Mediterranean diet&#xD;
      in order to contribute in reducing cardiovascular mortality. However, countries in the&#xD;
      Mediterranean area are experiencing a shift in dietary habit towards continental diet with&#xD;
      potential harmful change in mortality rates. Oxidative stress, including free radical-driven&#xD;
      reactions and antioxidant status are considered important mediators to be considered in the&#xD;
      diet-mediated effect on health. Important metabolic functions are also mediated by certain&#xD;
      fatty acids. A comprehensive study of oxidative stress, including free radical-driven&#xD;
      products and protective antioxidants, and fatty acids metabolism has never been reported in&#xD;
      healthy subjects. In particular, high sensitive mass-spectrometry methods to study oxidative&#xD;
      stress and fatty acids metabolism are rarely applied to epidemiological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present grant project is therefore to assess in a large cross-sectional study&#xD;
      the prevalence of oxidative stress markers, and fatty acids and to find any causal relation&#xD;
      between these variables and metabolic syndrome. This population sample will be followed&#xD;
      prospectively not only for time of the present grant project, but we would like to study&#xD;
      metabolic variables with relation to the development of oxidative stress-mediated diseases,&#xD;
      in particular those of cardiovascular system, on a longitudinal basis (prospective&#xD;
      epidemiological study for at least 10 years). At same time we should be able to define the&#xD;
      importance of individual markers of oxidative stress and fatty acids for early detection of&#xD;
      these diseases.&#xD;

      Background Cardiovascular diseases belong to the major causes of mortality in western&#xD;
      populations. Atherosclerosis of arterial system may result in ischemic heart disease (IHD)&#xD;
      and peripheral artery disease with possible fatal consequences such as acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis is a chronic and slowly growing pathological lesion that remains asymptomatic&#xD;
      until a clinical event occurs. In the pre-clinical stage atherosclerosis may be difficult to&#xD;
      diagnose. As disease surrogate, a large number of risk factors for atherosclerosis are being&#xD;
      recognized. Some of them are responsible for the epidemiologically very serious metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome, which accounts for development of hyperlipidemia (from preventive point of view&#xD;
      only 25% of population has normal blood lipid levels), obesity, diabetes or arterial&#xD;
      hypertension. In all of these conditions, oxidative stress represents a substantial&#xD;
      pathogenic factor through deleterious chemical reactions that damage biomolecules, including&#xD;
      formation of atherogenic- oxidatively-modified LDL particles (1) or direct destruction of&#xD;
      cells and tissues by free radicals (2-4). Lifestyle, in particular dietary schemes, belongs&#xD;
      to important factors contributing to the formation and development of atherosclerosis. The&#xD;
      usefulness of dietary components in contributing to low cardiovascular mortality in&#xD;
      populations of the mediterranean basin is well recognized. After pioneering studies by Ancel&#xD;
      Keys (5), Mediterranean diet has become popular worldwide as health diet. Several components&#xD;
      of this diet have been advocated in contributing to counteract atherosclerosis, including a&#xD;
      panel of antioxidants and unsaturated fatty acids. Health providers in continental diet-based&#xD;
      countries suggest to embracing Mediterranean diet in order to contribute in reducing&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality. However, countries in the Mediterranean area are experiencing a&#xD;
      shift in dietary habit towards continental diet with potential harmful change in mortality&#xD;
      rates. Recently, Trichopoulou et al. (6) reported on adherence to mediterranean diet and&#xD;
      survival in a Greek population. These authors found that adherence to this diet is associated&#xD;
      with a significant reduction in mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Italy is being challenged in lifestyle and dietary habit issues because such a drift has&#xD;
      already caused an increase in obesity prevalence in children. Paradoxically, this is much&#xD;
      higher in the south of Italy that is expected to be more strictly associated with&#xD;
      mediterranean style.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not known, however, which components of the Mediterranean diet act protectively in the&#xD;
      organism. It is suggested that certain components of the diet may importantly affect&#xD;
      oxidative stress (7) and thereby also occurrence of cardiovascular (8) and tumor diseases&#xD;
      (9). There are also very interesting data on the relation between regional dietary habits and&#xD;
      diet composition, and the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases. From this point of view&#xD;
      Mediterranean region seems to be exemplary. Low incidence of cardiovascular diseases was&#xD;
      demonstrated here already in 50´s in spite of relatively high fat intake, whose major source&#xD;
      was, however, olive oil rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants such as&#xD;
      polyphenolic compounds 12(10). Mediterranean diet was proved also in controlled studies to&#xD;
      have marked protective effects on development of cardiovascular diseases (11, 12), but also&#xD;
      total mortality (6) probably by action of antioxidant substances increasing total antioxidant&#xD;
      capacity (13). The role of dietary factors on total antioxidant status was described in&#xD;
      numerous studies, which showed marked increase of antioxidant potential after administration&#xD;
      of vitamin A (14), vitamin C (15), tomatoes or tomato products containing high amounts of&#xD;
      antioxidative terpen lycopene or lycopene together with olive oil (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, it is emerging that previously unrecognized products of lipid metabolism&#xD;
      may have profound effects on metabolic syndrome and potentially on the induction of diabetes.&#xD;
      Palmitoleate has been recognized as an adipose-tissue derived lipid hormone that strongly&#xD;
      stimulates muscle insulin action and suppresses hepatosteatosis (17). If palmitoleate acts as&#xD;
      a lipid hormone in human is not known. In human, other fatty acids have been demonstrated to&#xD;
      be altered in clinical conditions opposite to obesity. In fact, in cystic fibrosis patients,&#xD;
      who are usually malnourished, we detected an increase in saturated and monounsaturated fatty&#xD;
      acids (18) and a decrease in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. C24:0 was positively correlated&#xD;
      with BMI, plasma cholesterol and vitamin E, and significantly negatively correlated with&#xD;
      oxysterols.Taken together, these data possibly identifies C24:0 as an indicator of adequate&#xD;
      nutriture, coupled with the observation that C24:0 levels were reduced in patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive study of oxidative stress, including free radical-driven products and&#xD;
      protective antioxidants, and fatty acids metabolism has never been reported in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. In particular, high sensitive mass-spectrometry methods to study oxidative stress&#xD;
      and fatty acids metabolism are rarely applied to epidemiological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present grant project is therefore to assess in a large cross-sectional study&#xD;
      the prevalence of oxidative stress markers, and fatty acids and to find any causal relation&#xD;
      between these variables and metabolic syndrome. This population sample will be followed&#xD;
      prospectively to study metabolic variables with relation to the development of oxidative&#xD;
      stress-mediated diseases, in particular those of cardiovascular system, on a longitudinal&#xD;
      basis (prospective epidemiological study for at least 10 years). At same time we should be&#xD;
      able to define the importance of individual markers of oxidative stress and fatty acids for&#xD;
      early detection of these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the time of proposed project, we want to examine, 500 healthy subjects divided in&#xD;
      decade groups in the range between 20-60 years and in a group over 60 years. To do this we&#xD;
      have identified a healthy cohort among blood donors. Blood donors are requested to be in&#xD;
      healthy conditions but they are not devoid of cardiovascular risk factors, including&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be informed in detail with the study proposal according to ethic principles and&#xD;
      prior enrollment will sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all examined subjects detailed medical history will be taken with special interest for&#xD;
      diseases of cardiovascular system and risk factors for atherosclerosis. A complete physical&#xD;
      exam including basic anthropometric examinations (BMI calculation and determination of waist&#xD;
      circumference) and EKG will be performed in all subjects. Blood and urine collection will be&#xD;
      performed to determine specific analytes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Routine determinations - basic biochemistry (total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol,&#xD;
           triglycerides, urea, creatinine, uric acid, glucose, AST, ALT, GMT, ALP, bilirubin),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Antioxidant vitamins in plasma - vitamins E, including α- and γ-tocopherol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Markers of cholesterol oxidation (7β-hydroxycholesterol, 7keto-cholesterol)&#xD;
           (determination by GC-MS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Markers of arachidonate oxidation, F2 isoprostanes (determination by GC-MS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Fatty acids profile (determination by GC-MS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since random population sample will be analyzed and measured variables will be determined on&#xD;
      the continuous time scale, the above mentioned population sample (500 subjects) is sensitive&#xD;
      enough to assess relations between metabolic syndrome and indicators of oxidative stress&#xD;
      markers and lipid metabolism. Epidemiological approach (analysis of stratified data, linear&#xD;
      and logistic regression, and statistical modelling of multipath relations) will be used to&#xD;
      suppress the effect of confounding factors (e.g. age, smoking, sex) on data interpretation.&#xD;
