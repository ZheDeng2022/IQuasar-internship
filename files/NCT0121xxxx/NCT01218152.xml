      Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a frequent autosomal dominant disorder, caused by&#xD;
      heterozygous mutations of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene (chr.17q11.2). One of the main&#xD;
      clinical features is the development of benign and malignant tumors. The most common benign&#xD;
      tumors in these patients are tumors of the peripheral nerve, named neurofibromas. Every NF1&#xD;
      patient has a life time risk of 8-13% to develop a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor&#xD;
      (MPNST) starting from a pre-existing neurofibroma. MPNSTs lead to a bad prognosis for the&#xD;
      patient, with an overall five-year survival of less than 25%. Complete resection is the&#xD;
      standard treatment, but this is often difficult due to the size of the tumors and the&#xD;
      location on important nerves, moreover the tumor is frequently metastatic at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis. For MPNSTs, like for other cancers, the extent and the spread of the disease at&#xD;
      time of diagnosis is an important factor in determining treatment outcome. In this regard,&#xD;
      the analysis of tumor derived cell-free circulating DNA in plasma of NF1 patients would open&#xD;
      up the possibility to diagnose and monitor the development and progression of MPNSTs using a&#xD;
      small blood sample. In cooperation with P. Schöffski (UZLeuven), we plan to collect blood&#xD;
      samples from cancer patients to optimize the DNA extraction procedure starting from plasma&#xD;
      samples. It is known that patients with cancer have a higher amount of free circulating DNA&#xD;
      in plasma than individuals without cancer and therefore we want to optimize the DNA&#xD;
      extraction procedure on plasma from patients with cancer. In the meantime, matching MPNST and&#xD;
      plasma samples from NF1 patients will be collected and sent to us from the University of&#xD;
      Eppendorf (Victor Mautner) to optimize the array CGH protocol for the detection of copy&#xD;
      number changes in plasma DNA of NF1 patients with MPNSTs.&#xD;

      Introduction Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder occuring in 1&#xD;
      out of 3500 living newborns. The disease is caused by heterozygous mutations of the NF1 gene,&#xD;
      located on chromosome 17q11.2. The NF1 gene encodes the tumor suppressor neurofibromin, a&#xD;
      negative regulator of the RAS oncogene. Clinically, NF1 patients have café-au-lait maculae,&#xD;
      freckling, Lisch nodules and neurofibromas. Cognitive problems, bone lesions and optic&#xD;
      pathway gliomas are also common in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurofibromas are benign neoplasms of the peripheral nerve sheath, which can appear anywhere&#xD;
      in the body of NF1 patients. Neurofibromas are composed of different cell types like Schwann&#xD;
      cells, fibroblasts, mast cells and perineurial cells. If in Schwann cells of NF1 patients the&#xD;
      wild-type NF1 allele is inactivated, a neurofibroma will be formed. There are 3 types of&#xD;
      neurofibromas: cutaneous, subcutaneous and plexiform. Cutaneous neurofibromas appear during&#xD;
      adolescence as isolated nodules in or under the skin, respectively. Plexiform neurofibromas&#xD;
      are congenital and can spread along a large segment of a peripheral nerve. Subcutaneous&#xD;
      neurofibromas are discrete nodules located on peripheral nerves and the timing of their&#xD;
      origin is not known, but they are probably also prenatal in origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every NF1 patient has a life time risk of 8 to 13% to develop a malignant peripheral nerve&#xD;
      sheath tumor (MPNST). This risk is even twice as high for a subpopulation of NF1 patients,&#xD;
      namely patients with an NF1 microdeletion. MPNSTs are difficult to diagnose in early phase&#xD;
      because of the large number of tumors and diverse locations often seen in these patients.&#xD;
      These tumors infiltrate easily in surrounding tissue and frequently give rise to metastases.&#xD;
      At this moment, the only available treatment is surgical removal of these MPNSTs. Complete&#xD;
      resection is often difficult due to the size of the tumors and the location on important&#xD;
      nerves and the fact that the tumors are frequently already metastasized at diagnosis. The&#xD;
      five-year survival of patients with MPNSTs is less than 25%. For MPNSTs, like for other&#xD;
      cancers, the extent and the spread of the disease at time of diagnosis is an important factor&#xD;
      in determining treatment outcome. In this regard, tumor markers have been developed to screen&#xD;
      for tumors, but only a subset of cancers secrete specific proteins that can be used as a&#xD;
      marker. An increasing interest grew in new markers like circulating nucleic acids. The&#xD;
      detection of cell-free circulating nucleic acids in plasma, serum and other body fluids of&#xD;
      healthy and diseased individuals opened up the possibility to diagnose and monitor the&#xD;
      disease, which might also be applicable to NF1 patients with MPNSTs. The presence of&#xD;
      extracellular circulating nucleic acids in the blood of healthy and sick persons was first&#xD;
      described by Mandel and Métais in 1948. In 1977 the group of Leon was the first to quantify&#xD;
      cell-free DNA in serum. They found that cancer patients tended to have elevated levels of&#xD;
      circulating DNA compared to healthy control individuals, and that the amount of DNA was even&#xD;
      bigger in patients with metastases compared to localized disease, but nothing was known about&#xD;
      the origin of the DNA. Significant progress in plasma/serum DNA research was made, when the&#xD;
      presence of tumor-associated microsatellite alterations was reported in the plasma and serum&#xD;
      of cancer patients. According to these findings, it has been suggested that the circulating&#xD;
      DNA could have potentials for the diagnosis and prognosis of malignancies. Still, the&#xD;
      mechanism of DNA release is not fully clarified, and different hypotheses have been&#xD;
      suggested. A first hypothesis that the circulating DNA originates from DNA leakage due to&#xD;
      necrosis or apoptosis of tumor cells, became controversial when it was reported that the DNA&#xD;
      level decreased after radiotherapy. Another hypothesis about micrometastases was also&#xD;
      rejected because the number of cells in plasma didn't match the amount of circulating DNA. A&#xD;
      third hypothesis is the spontaneous and active release of tumoral DNA in the blood by&#xD;
      proliferating cells. However there is no convincing explanation for the latter mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research protocol A first part of the study will be the optimization of the technique of DNA&#xD;
      extraction from plasma. Different DNA extraction methods described in the literature will be&#xD;
      tested on samples collected in cooperation with Prof. Dr. Patrick Schöffski (UZLeuven). When&#xD;
      blood is taken from cancer patients for routine testing, an additional 5 mL (in EDTA tube)&#xD;
      will be available for our experiments. Blood samples will be collected within a few hours&#xD;
      after sampling and processed within 24 hours in our lab (lab for neurofibromatosis research).&#xD;
      The blood samples will be centrifuged at 1600 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant plasma will&#xD;
      be collected, without disturbing the buffy coat, and re-centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 10&#xD;
      minutes to remove particles. The supernatant plasma will be aliquoted into 0.5 mL volumes.&#xD;
      The samples will be stored at -80°C until further use. Per patient, different aliquots will&#xD;
      be extracted using different methods, like phenol-chloroform extraction and commercial kits,&#xD;
      according to the literature. Genomic reference DNA will be extracted from the buffy coat&#xD;
      using phenol-chloroform extraction. Depending on the type of DNA extraction, we expect&#xD;
      differences in quantity and quality of the DNA. The method with the highest yield and best&#xD;
      DNA quality will be chosen to extract DNA from plasma of NF1 patients with MPNSTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second part of this work will be the optimization of the microarray experiment using plasma&#xD;
      DNA. Plasma samples from NF1 patients with MPNSTs will be collected in collaboration with the&#xD;
      group of Victor Mautner from the Eppendorf University in Germany. Direct processing of blood&#xD;
      samples will be done in Germany and frozen buffy coats and plasma aliquots will be sent to&#xD;
      Leuven in an encoded way. Together with the buffy coats and plasma, frozen tissue of the&#xD;
      patients MPNST will be sent as well. DNA from the tumor will be extracted using&#xD;
      phenol-chloroform extraction. Microarray CGH will be performed on both the tumor and the&#xD;
      plasma DNA with buffy coat DNA as reference to exclude copy number variable regions from the&#xD;
      list of copy number changes. The array profiles of the plasma DNA will be checked for the&#xD;
      tumor-related copy number changes. In that way, the array protocol can be further optimized&#xD;
      in order to detect tumor specific copy number abnormalities in the cell-free DNA from plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is performed by Eline Beert, PhD student in the lab for neurofibromatosis&#xD;
      research, and Radost Ratcheva, a master thesis student in the lab of neurofibromatosis&#xD;
      research, as part of achieving the degree of 'Doctor in Biomedical Sciences' and 'Master in&#xD;
      Biomedical Sciences', respectively, with Prof. Dr. Eric Legius as promotor and main&#xD;
      researcher. Only the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and the UZ Leuven, but no commercial&#xD;
      partners (like companies) will participate in this study. The results obtained from the&#xD;
      described experiments have to be considered as pure scientific information and none of it&#xD;
      will be reported to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples of the UZLeuven cancer patients will only be used to optimize the DNA&#xD;
      extraction procedure, the extracted DNA will be quantified but it will not be further&#xD;
      analyzed and will be destroyed afterwards.&#xD;
