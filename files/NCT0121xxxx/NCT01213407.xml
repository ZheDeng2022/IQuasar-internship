      A randomised, open-label, 2-arm, multi-centre, phase II clinical study with one group&#xD;
      receiving standard therapy with Temozolomide, radiotherapy, and Trivax; and a control group&#xD;
      receiving standard therapy with Temozolomide and radiotherapy only; after tumour resection of&#xD;
      at least 70% in both groups. The hypothesis is based on the assumption that time to&#xD;
      progression will be doubled in the treatment group.&#xD;

      Vaccination represents a success story in modern medicine and its principles have been found&#xD;
      to be valid in different species, at least in the case of infectious diseases. As of today,&#xD;
      there is little reason to believe that this would not be true in the case of tumours. It is&#xD;
      now generally acknowledged that human tumours carry a mutational antigenic (non-self)&#xD;
      repertoire of immunogenic potential that may be a suitable target for antitumour immune&#xD;
      therapy. During the last years accumulating evidence from mouse experiments indicates that&#xD;
      one can immunise prophylactically against cancers as effectively as against an infectious&#xD;
      agent. However, in contrast to most experimental mouse tumour models, human tumours have in&#xD;
      general been within their host for a long time and thus had the opportunity to influence&#xD;
      their microenvironment and the larger immunological environment. Antigens capable of&#xD;
      mediating specific rejection were found in human as well as in mouse tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of the clinical trials using dendritic cell (DC) -based cancer vaccination techniques&#xD;
      were designed for the treatment of melanoma. Other important diseases in which DC-based&#xD;
      cancer vaccination was studied include prostate cancer, B cell lymphoma, renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma, glioma and glioblastoma, breast and ovarian cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and&#xD;
      selected solid paediatric tumours. In most of these trials some in vivo and/or in vitro&#xD;
      evidence for the generation of anti-tumour immunity was found and even complete or partial&#xD;
      remission of the tumour was observed in selected cases. The first phase III trial&#xD;
      demonstrating the efficacy of DC cancer vaccination for the treatment of prostate cancer was&#xD;
      reported recently (www.dendreon.com). Also patients suffering from glioblastoma multiforme&#xD;
      appear to benefit from DC cancer immune therapy. The side effects observed in DC cancer&#xD;
      vaccinations were usually described to be mild and not limiting the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We developed a DC cancer vaccine technology, Trivax, advancing the design of DC cancer immune&#xD;
      therapy in one critical aspect. It is the first such vaccine that is enable for releasing the&#xD;
      immune modulatory cytokine interleukin (IL) -12. Trivax is comprised of IL-12 secreting DCs&#xD;
      and a mixture of protein tumour antigens derived from the individual patient's tumour cells.&#xD;
      No synthetic tumour antigen component is involved. Both components of Trivax are derived from&#xD;
      the individual patient and are used for the treatment of only this patient. Trivax therefore&#xD;
      represents a fully individualised somatic cell therapy medicine. Trimed's early clinical&#xD;
      evaluations in patients suffering from kidney cancer, prostate cancer, bone tumours, and&#xD;
      malignancies of childhood have confirmed the safety and the feasibility of the Trivax&#xD;
      technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (ICD-O M9440/3) is the most malignant astrocytic tumour,&#xD;
      composed of poorly differentiated neoplastic astrocytes. Histopathological features include&#xD;
      cellular polymorphism, nuclear atypia, brisk mitotic activity, vascular thrombosis,&#xD;
      micro-vascular proliferation and necrosis. GBM typically affects patients of various age&#xD;
      beginning in childhood and up to high age. It is preferentially located in the cerebral&#xD;
      hemispheres. GBM may develop from diffuse astrocytomas WHO grade II or anaplastic&#xD;
      astrocytomas (secondary GBM), but more frequently, they manifest after a short clinical&#xD;
      history de novo, without evidence of a less malignant precursor lesion (primary GBM). In&#xD;
      spite of modern oncological treatment, the prognosis of GBM remains dismal, with a median&#xD;
      survival of little over 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GBM-Vax is a randomised, open-label, 2-arm, multi-centre, phase II clinical study with both&#xD;
      groups undergoing surgery and receiving standard therapy with Temozolomide and radiotherapy;&#xD;
      and the treatment group that in addition to the standard therapy receives cancer immune&#xD;
      therapy with Trivax. Our aim is to extend therapy options presently including surgery,&#xD;
      irradiation and Temozolomide with DC cancer vaccination to improve the poor prognosis of&#xD;
      patients with GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Progression free survival measured as percentage of non-progressive patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed GBM 12 months after a post-operative MRI scan treated according to the current&#xD;
      standard (surgical resection, irradiation, oral chemo-therapy with Temozolomide), and Trivax,&#xD;
      an autologous DC cancer vaccine charged with autologous tumour protein, as add-on therapy&#xD;
      (group A), in comparison to patients receiving standard treatment without Trivax (group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression free survival measured as percentage of non-progressive patients with newly&#xD;
           diagnosed GBM 18 and 24 months after a post-operative MRI scan receiving standard&#xD;
           treatment and Trivax as add-on therapy (group A), in comparison to patients receiving&#xD;
           standard treatment without Trivax (group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extension of overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed GBM receiving standard&#xD;
           treatment and Trivax as add-on therapy, in comparison to patients receiving standard&#xD;
           treatment without Trivax.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life in patients treated with Trivax as an add-on therapy using ECOG (Eastern&#xD;
           Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status compared to qual-ity of life of patients&#xD;
           receiving standard therapy (for study patients older 18 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects In total, 56 patients will be enrolled in the study. The study consists of&#xD;
      2 arms and at least 28 patients should be randomly assigned to one of the two arms. It is&#xD;
      expected to recruit the study patients within a period of one year. Randomisation is based on&#xD;
      stratification according to study sites at a 1:1 ratio. Patients younger than 18 years will&#xD;
      not be randomised but will all receive add-on therapy with Trivax. We feel that it would be&#xD;
      not just to expect from children to understand and accept that there is a new treatment&#xD;
      available but only every second patient will receive it. Obviously, patients younger than 18&#xD;
      years will not be analysed together with adult patients in the context of the study; and&#xD;
      paediatric patients will not count towards the recruiting number of 2 x 28. Thus, the results&#xD;
      obtained in paediatric GBM patients will not influence the outcome of the study in patients&#xD;
      older than 18 years.&#xD;
