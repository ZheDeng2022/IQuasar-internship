      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Food allergies are characterized by abnormal immune system responses to certain foods, such&#xD;
      as peanuts, strawberries, and shellfish. Some individuals with these allergies have immediate&#xD;
      allergic reactions on contact with the food in question and need immediate treatment to&#xD;
      prevent severe complications. In contrast, eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorders&#xD;
      are related disorders in which white blood cells in the intestinal tract react to certain&#xD;
      foods, causing abdominal pain, nausea, and other digestion problems. Researchers are&#xD;
      interested in studying these conditions to better understand how the immune system responds&#xD;
      to food allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine how the immune system responds to food allergens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine how certain white blood cells contribute to disease in individuals with food&#xD;
           allergies and other inflammatory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who have a history of (a) severe allergic&#xD;
           reaction to peanuts (and have peanut-specific antibodies), (b) allergy or inflammatory&#xD;
           disease, or (c) eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorder (with at least two&#xD;
           documented food allergies).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age who have no known allergies or asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have a screening visit and a procedure visit. The procedure visit&#xD;
           will take place within 30 to 60 days of the screening visit, and will take 3 to 4 hours&#xD;
           depending on the procedure(s) done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, and will&#xD;
           provide blood samples for testing. Participants with peanut or other allergies will have&#xD;
           additional tests to determine their levels of sensitivity to certain foods. Participants&#xD;
           with eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorder will provide stool samples for&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the procedure visit, participants with peanut allergies and participants with other&#xD;
           allergies will provide blood samples and have leukapherisis to collect white blood cells&#xD;
           for examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the procedure visit, healthy volunteers and participants with eosinophil-associated&#xD;
           gastrointestinal disorder will provide blood samples and have leukapherisis to collect&#xD;
           white blood cells for examination. In addition, some but not all of these participants&#xD;
           will have a procedure called esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which will examine the&#xD;
           esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. Participants who are scheduled to have EGD will&#xD;
           be asked to fast for 6 hours before the procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy refers to a number of disorders characterized by clinical diseases associated&#xD;
      with abnormal immune responses to food antigens. Classical IgE mediated anaphylactic food&#xD;
      allergy is characterized by immediate hypersensitivity, and has a prevalence of approximately&#xD;
      6% and 3% in children and adults, respectively. In contrast, eosinophil associated&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs), including eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and eosinophilic&#xD;
      gastroenteritis (EG), are food allergy associated disorders characterized by eosinophilic&#xD;
      inflammation of the gut, typically without anaphylaxis. Progress in the treatment and&#xD;
      management of these food allergies requires further understanding of the immunological&#xD;
      pathogenesis of these disorders. A subset of peripheral blood food allergen specific&#xD;
      interleukin (IL) -5 producing T cells that are present in EGID but not peanut allergic&#xD;
      subjects has recently been characterized. The primary objective of this study is to determine&#xD;
      if similar IL-5 producing T cells are present in the gut of EGID subjects. To this end, both&#xD;
      EGID and healthy non-allergic subjects will be enrolled and gastrointestinal biopsies will be&#xD;
      obtained for intracellular cytokine staining, RT-PCR and ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, this protocol will supply blood and leukapheresis samples for exploratory&#xD;
      studies on immunologic mechanisms underlying anaphylactic food allergy and EGIDs. A total of&#xD;
      up to 400 subjects recruited from outside physician referrals and support groups, as well as&#xD;
      from those in existing National Institutes of Health (NIH) protocols will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      Clinical Center study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Have a documented clinical history compatible with EGID, peanut allergy, or other&#xD;
             allergic and inflammatory diseases or be healthy without known allergic conditions.&#xD;

        In addition to the above inclusion criteria for all subjects, the subjects in the following&#xD;
        groups must meet additional group-specific inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with EGID must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be greater than or equal to 18 years of age&#xD;

                  gastroenteritis -including gastrointestinal symptoms-, and histological evidence&#xD;
                  of stomach or duodenal eosinophilia with no other known etiology for the&#xD;
                  eosinophilia despite careful clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Eosinophilic esophagitis: Have a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis, including evidence&#xD;
        of esophageal dysfunction with a peak count of greater than or equal to 25 eosinophils per&#xD;
        high powered field, for which the biopsy was obtained while under proton pump inhibitor&#xD;
        treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
