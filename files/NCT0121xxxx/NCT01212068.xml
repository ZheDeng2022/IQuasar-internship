      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People with epilepsy often have auditory processing disorders that affect their ability&#xD;
           to hear clearly and may cause problems with understanding speech and other kinds of&#xD;
           verbal communication. Researchers are interested in developing better ways of studying&#xD;
           what parts of the brain are affected by hearing disorders and epilepsy, and they need&#xD;
           better clinical tests to measure how individuals process sound. These tests will allow&#xD;
           researchers to examine and evaluate the effects of epilepsy and related disorders on&#xD;
           speech and communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A procedure called a magnetoencephalography (MEG) can be used to measure the electrical&#xD;
           currents involved in brain activity. Researchers are interested in learning whether MEG&#xD;
           can be used to detect differences in the processing of simple sounds in patients with&#xD;
           epilepsy, both with and without hearing impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To measure brain activity in hearing impaired persons with epilepsy and compare the results&#xD;
      with those from people with normal hearing and epilepsy as well as people with normal hearing&#xD;
      and no epilepsy. This research is performed in collaboration with Johns Hopkins Hospital and&#xD;
      epilepsy patients must be candidates for surgery at Johns Hopkins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 to 55 years of age who (1) have epilepsy and have hearing&#xD;
           impairments, (2) have epilepsy but do not have hearing impairments, or (3) are healthy&#xD;
           volunteers who have neither epilepsy nor hearing impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with epilepsy must have developed seizures after 10 years of age, and must&#xD;
           be candidates for grid implantation surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will require one visit of approximately 4 to 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a full physical examination and medical history,&#xD;
           along with a basic hearing test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain, followed by&#xD;
           a MEG scan to record magnetic field changes produced by brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During MEG recording, participants will be asked to listen to various sounds and make&#xD;
           simple responses (pressing a button, moving your hand or speaking) in response to sounds&#xD;
           heard through earphones. The MEG procedure should take between 1 and 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment at NIH is not provided as part of this protocol.&#xD;

      Objective: Auditory processing disorders are common in patients with epilepsy and adversely&#xD;
      impact verbal communication. The neural bases of auditory disorders remain poorly understood,&#xD;
      impeding development of objective clinical tests. The overall goal of this project is to&#xD;
      develop an objective clinical measure of auditory processing using computational modeling of&#xD;
      functional brain connectivity. To address this goal, we will use novel functional&#xD;
      connectivity methods to analyze magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and intracranial&#xD;
      electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: We will acquire MEG data from 48 patients with intractable epilepsy prior&#xD;
      to their undergoing grid electrode placement for neurosurgery evaluation at Johns Hopkins&#xD;
      Hospital. ECoG data will be acquired at JHU under an ongoing study. Approximately half the&#xD;
      patients will have auditory processing impairments. We will also acquire MEG from 20 healthy&#xD;
      control subjects with no auditory processing impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Three planned studies use a within-subject, repeated measures design. The MEG studies&#xD;
      will be conducted before patients have subdural electrodes implanted for intracranial&#xD;
      mapping. The MEG studies and connectivity analyses will be performed at NIH. The ECoG studies&#xD;
      will take place at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Data will be acquired using the same auditory&#xD;
      stimuli and tasks for both the MEG and ECoG parts of the study. The same functional&#xD;
      connectivity analyses will be performed on the two data sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The main outcome measures will be (1) functional connectivity patterns in&#xD;
      intracranial ECoG data that differentiate epilepsy patients with auditory impairments from&#xD;
      those without auditory impairments; and (2) corresponding patterns in MEG data. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures will consist of relationships between the intracranial ECoG connectivity&#xD;
      measures and the MEG connectivity measures.&#xD;
