      This is a standard pharmacokinetic interaction study. Subjects will be randomized to be&#xD;
      either group A or B. Group A. Subjects will have 3 hospitalizations to complete. Each&#xD;
      hospitalization will be about 12-24 hours depends on each regimen. Subjects in A group who&#xD;
      receive regimen 1 of primaquine (PQ) on the first admission (visit 2) will receive regimen 2&#xD;
      of primaquine and chloroquine combination (PQ and CQ) on second admission (visit 3) after 1&#xD;
      week wash out period and will finish with regimen 3 of Chloroquine (CQ) on the third&#xD;
      admission (visit 4) after 8 weeks wash out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in B group who receive regimen 1 of primaquine (PQ) will receive regimen 2 of&#xD;

      primaquine and chloroquine combination (PQ and CQ)on third admission(visit 4) with 8 week&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chloroquine and primaquine, has been first therapy for Plasmodium vivax and ovale malaria for&#xD;
      over 50 years, and has been part of National policy in Thailand for decades. Primaquine is&#xD;
      the only available hypnozoitocidal drug for P.vivax and gametocytocidal agent for Plasmodium&#xD;
      falciparum malaria. Despite this enormous use knowledge about the mechanism of activity,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic properties, resistance and toxicity of primaquine are limited. Primaquine at&#xD;
      the previously used dose for radical cure (15 mg base/day for 14 days) is also weakly&#xD;
      effective against asexual stages of P. vivax malaria [4] The higher dose of 30 mg daily&#xD;
      evaluated for malaria prophylaxis is now also generally recommended for radical cure. In the&#xD;
      standard radical cure regimen, primaquine is usually given after the 3-day course of&#xD;
      chloroquine, but there has been no study to inform timing of dosing so this decision is&#xD;
      arbitrary. Despite the multistage specificity against the malaria parasite, and extensive&#xD;
      recommendations, primaquine is currently underused because of uncertainties over safety,&#xD;
      efficacy and dosage. Primaquine is an oxidant drug and causes haemolysis in patients with&#xD;
      glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD). Although several studies of the&#xD;
      metabolites of the primaquine and chloroquine have been conducted over the past few years&#xD;
      remarkably little is known about the interaction between these two commonly coadministered&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is open-label pharmacokinetic study. Healthy 16 volunteers will be recruited to&#xD;
      the established volunteer facility at single site at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases to&#xD;
      determine the pharmacokinetic properties of primaquine and it's main active metabolites and&#xD;
      evaluate any interaction with chloroquine.in order to provide clinical guidance for the&#xD;
      optimum primaquine/chloroquine treatment regimens.&#xD;
