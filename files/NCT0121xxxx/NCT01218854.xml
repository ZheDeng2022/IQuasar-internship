  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Currently, standard procedures for biopsies that are guided by computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      imaging involve CT scans and a computer program to plan and illustrate where the physician&#xD;
      will place the needle to obtain the required cells or tissue. Inserting the biopsy needle at&#xD;
      the planned angle is not an easy task, because the appropriate angle of insertion must be&#xD;
      estimated based on prior experience. Researchers are studying experimental techniques that&#xD;
      might provide better guidance about the right angle to insert the biopsy needle and thereby&#xD;
      improve the collection of the appropriate biopsy cells or tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the effectiveness of two biopsy needle guidance methods in CT-guided tissue&#xD;
      biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are scheduled to have CT-guided tissue biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a tissue biopsy guided by CT scans and either a laser system or a&#xD;
           plastic block to illustrate the appropriate angle of insertion. The skin will be numbed&#xD;
           with anesthetic to minimize discomfort during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before inserting the biopsy needle, the study physician will hold the needle in place so&#xD;
           that a Food and Drug Administration-approved medical GPS (electromagnetic tracking)&#xD;
           system can measure the needle angle as it enters the tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the needle angle data has been collected, researchers will proceed with the actual&#xD;
           biopsy procedure as it would normally occur, using standard methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No additional treatment will be provided as part of this protocol.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently, standard/conventional CT-guided biopsies proceed as follows the physician:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. obtains a pre-procedural CT scan,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. plans the needle s angle based on this CT scan,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. selects the angle at which the needle should be inserted based on the&#xD;
                pre-procedural CT scan,&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. inserts the needle while aiming to replicate that planned needle angle by using&#xD;
                only their visual-spatial abilities, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. re-images the patient to confirm needle location followed by needle&#xD;
&#xD;
                repositioning, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improving upon these standard methods of needle placement could have&#xD;
&#xD;
      widespread benefits (e.g. improved diagnostic tissue sampling, decreased&#xD;
&#xD;
      needle repositionings, etc.) We will be studying three needle angle selection systems. The&#xD;
      laser-assisted needle angle selection system or LNASS, is a custom fabricated device that&#xD;
      uses a Class II pointer similar to ones used for pointing at slides during lectures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the angle difference between L-NASS (Method A) and the standard method&#xD;
           (clinician intuition/conventional method)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the angle difference between B-NASS (Method B) and the standard method&#xD;
           (clinician intuition)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the angle difference between the mobile device-NASS or MD-NASS (C) and the&#xD;
           standard method (clinician intuition/conventional method)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ages Eligible for Study: 18 Years and older&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genders Eligible for Study: Both&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Must be undergoing a scheduled CT-guided biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Must have ability to follow breathing instructions like holding breath (if&#xD;
                procedure is to be performed without general anesthesia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No serious concurrent medical illness that would preclude the patient from making a&#xD;
           rational informed decision on participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any known allergy to plastics or polymers (since the Ultem polymer could theoretically&#xD;
           induce a rash in these patients, even though it is hypoallergenic).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pacemakers or automatic implantable cardiac defibrillators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gross body weight above the CT table limit (450 pounds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary outcome measure for the first arm is:&#xD;
&#xD;
           --The difference between planned and achieved needle angle of a laser-assisted needle&#xD;
           angle selection system with the standard method (clinician s intuition or conventional&#xD;
           method) of CT-guided biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary outcome measure for the second arm is:&#xD;
&#xD;
           --The difference between planned and achieved needle angle of a block with pre-drilled&#xD;
           needle angles with the standard method (clinician s intuition or conventional method) of&#xD;
           CT-guided biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary outcome for the third arm is:&#xD;
&#xD;
           --The difference between planned and achieved needle angle of a mobile device-assisted&#xD;
           needle angle selection system with the standard method (clinician's intuition or&#xD;
           conventional method) of CT-guided biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tool for measuring the needle angles will be an FDA-approved electromagnetic&#xD;
           tracking system, which tracks needle movement and position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These comparisons will be done as a bystander study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Needle guidance system will only be used initially to select the angle during a&#xD;
           superficial, shallow needle insertion at the skin surface (less than 1 cm deep).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At no time will the needle enter tissue that it wouldn t have otherwise entered as none&#xD;
           of the system will be used to perform the biopsies at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The key portions of the procedure will not be altered in any substantive way.&#xD;
