    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  estimate the degree of memory loss, if any following radiotherapy to the base of skull&#xD;
           or brain as measured by standard neurocognitive battery testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  describe radiotherapy dose-related changes in vascular perfusion, in spectroscopic&#xD;
           parameters of neuronal injury and changes in the degree and directionality of tissue&#xD;
           water diffusivity (diffusion tensor imaging) as a measure of white axonal injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to relate these imaging characteristics to the degree of memory loss.&#xD;

      Data suggests that regions of the normal brain exposed to radiation doses that has otherwise&#xD;
      been regarded as safe and not limited by current radiation treatment planning may contribute&#xD;
      to the risk of late neurocognitive injury. Radiation dose-dependent subclinical vascular&#xD;
      effects have been reported in irradiated normal brain tissue and have been hypothesized to be&#xD;
      a potential mechanism of action. Direct neuronal injury is another potential mechanism of&#xD;
      injury. 1)Estimate the degree of cognitive loss following RT. 2) Demonstrate evidence of&#xD;
      radiation induced subclinical vascular and neuronal injury in adjacent brain regions&#xD;
      receiving exit doses of radiation. Subjects will include patients with malignancies of the&#xD;
      skull of the skull base or patients with low grade glioma who require radiotherapy. Baseline&#xD;
      MRI imaging of the brain utilizing established techniques will be used to identify and&#xD;
      characterize the regions of interest anatomically adjacent to the regions of intended high&#xD;
      dose irradiation. The MRI data for the ROIs will be registered with the radiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment planning CT in order to create a single volume of data where each voxel corresponds&#xD;
      to a vector containing the multi-parametric information. Subsequent repeat MRI imaging will&#xD;
      be at 1.5, 4.5, 12 and 24 months following completion of the radiotherapy for patients with&#xD;
      low grade glioma and 1.5 and 12 months post radiotherapy for patients with malignancies&#xD;
      involving the skull base. Both cohorts will repeat standard neurocognitive evaluation at 1.5,&#xD;
      4.5,12 and 24 months following completion of radiotherapy. Analysis: Neurocognitive domains&#xD;
      will be evaluated at the designated time points.&#xD;
