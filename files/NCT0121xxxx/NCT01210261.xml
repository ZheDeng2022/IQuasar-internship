  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition of disordered breathing characterised by&#xD;
      intermittent partial and/or complete upper airway obstruction during sleep. The participants,&#xD;
      naive to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), recently diagnosed with OSA, will&#xD;
      undergo two automatic CPAP titration studies with collection of polysomnographic (PSG) data.&#xD;
      The data will be analysed to assess effectiveness of Compumedics auto-CPAP device in the&#xD;
      normalisation of sleep disordered breathing in OSA patients, with respect to another&#xD;
      auto-CPAP device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Auto-titrating CPAP (APAP) using algorithms based on detection of flow limitation and snoring&#xD;
      have been developed. Auto-titration devices adjust nasal pressure to the minimum pressure&#xD;
      needed to maintain airway patency at any point in time and can accommodate a range of&#xD;
      background states that affect airway collapsibility and hence CPAP pressure requirement&#xD;
      including sedation, alcohol, airway inflammation, body position and sleep state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compumedics Limited has developed an APAP device (Somnilink SPAP based on the new algorithm&#xD;
      technology of characterising breaths and determination of inspiratory flow limitation. The&#xD;
      objectives of this new technology are to enable accurate detection of inspiratory intervals&#xD;
      for irregular breathing patterns that are likely to occur during REM sleep, sleep onset and&#xD;
      wakefulness as well as to provide correct characterisation of inspiratory flow limitation.&#xD;
      These features could translate in delivery of superior treatment because of improved&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of respiratory event detection and earlier pressure response to&#xD;
      inspiratory flow limitation. Demonstration of superiority of the Somnilink SPAP device&#xD;
      relative to existing APAP treatment devices will be subject of future clinical trials (beyond&#xD;
      the scope of this protocol). An early clinical trial of a pre-production version of Somnilink&#xD;
      SPAP with the pressure control algorithm identical to the production version established&#xD;
      non-inferiority for AHI relative to a reference APAP (Resmed Autoset Spirit) with the&#xD;
      differential AHI estimate of -0.91 [-2.80; 0.91] (Mean [95%CI]). The Somnilink SPAP device is&#xD;
      now available as a production version (CE and TGA approved) and the purpose of the current&#xD;
      study is to establish its non-inferiority compared to an existing APAP device (Resmed Autoset&#xD;
      S8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be administered on the two nights of polysomnographic studies (PSG) by&#xD;
      means of continuous air pressure delivery under the variable pressure levels determined by&#xD;
      the APAP device to maintain the upper airway patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population of adult patients newly diagnosed with OSA after undergoing a diagnostic PSG&#xD;
      study in the sleep laboratory with no previous CPAP treatment experience and complying with&#xD;
      the eligibility criteria (as outlined below) will be studied.&#xD;
