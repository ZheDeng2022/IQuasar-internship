    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial is studying how well RO4929097 works in treating patients with&#xD;
      stage III, or stage IV melanoma that can be removed by surgery. RO4929097 may stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the molecular effects of Notch signaling inhibition using gamma-secretase&#xD;
      inhibitor RO4929097 (RO4929097) in patients with resectable stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV intact&#xD;
      melanoma tumors in the neoadjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess any indication of clinical activity of RO4929097 in these patients. II. Assess the&#xD;
      effect of RO4929097 on Akt-mediated downstream biomarkers in melanoma tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the effect of RO4929097 on the melanoma stem cell subpopulation. IV. Identify&#xD;
      patient-specific micro-RNA signatures that may correlate with response to therapy,&#xD;
      recurrence, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the clinical feasibility of measuring circulating melanoma tumor cells in the&#xD;
      blood and correlating levels with recurrence and/or survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Correlate the shedding of collagen cryptic epitopes in the serum and urine with tumor&#xD;
      response and risk of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Measure the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RO4929097 in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Evaluate the impact of RO4929097 on serum markers of angiogenesis. IX. Measure serum&#xD;
      autoimmune biomarkers and correlate with clinical response and outcome in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 (RO4929097) once daily on days 1-3,&#xD;
      8-10, and 15-17. Within 35-56 days after completion of therapy, patients with stable or&#xD;
      responsive disease undergo surgery. Patients may continue RO4929097 for 28 days after surgery&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo tumor tissue biopsies at baseline and after completion of study therapy for&#xD;
      4E-BP1 and Akt-mediated downstream biomarkers, stem cell subpopulation, and patient-specific&#xD;
      micro-RNA signatures studies by IHC and PCR assays. Blood and urine samples are also&#xD;
      collected at baseline and periodically during study for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      studies, circulating melanoma endothelial cells and progenitor cell levels, collagen cryptic&#xD;
      epitopes, serum markers of angiogenesis, and autoimmune biomarker analysis by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
