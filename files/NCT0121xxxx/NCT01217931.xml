      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare 6 different 2-drug &quot;sequences&quot; of&#xD;
      everolimus, bevacizumab, or pazopanib to learn how they may affect metastatic kidney cancer.&#xD;
      For the 2-drug sequence, participants will receive 1 of these drugs and may start taking&#xD;
      another of these drugs after that. Researchers will also study the safety of these 2-drug&#xD;
      sequences.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus is designed to block the growth of cancer cells, which may cause cancer cells to&#xD;
      die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is designed to block the growth of blood vessels that supply nutrients necessary&#xD;
      for tumor growth. This may prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pazopanib is designed to block a protein that may cause uncontrolled tumor growth. Blocking&#xD;
      this protein may prevent cancer from growing and spreading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the roll of dice) to 1 of 6 groups. There is an equal chance of being assigned to each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 will receive pazopanib, possibly followed by bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 will receive pazopanib, possibly followed by everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 will receive everolimus, possibly followed by bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4 will receive everolimus, possibly followed by pazopanib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 5 will receive bevacizumab, possibly followed by pazopanib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 6 will receive bevacizumab, possibly followed by everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease gets worse while you receive your first assigned drug, you will stop taking&#xD;
      the drug. Then if you are not having side effects, you will start taking your second assigned&#xD;
      drug 2-4 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus is taken by mouth 1 time per day (at about the same time each day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is given by vein over 30-90 minutes, 1 time every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pazopanib is taken by mouth 1 time per day (at about the same time each day on an empty&#xD;
      stomach).&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may be able to receive the bevacizumab doses at your local doctor's office. Ask your&#xD;
      study doctor about this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week during Weeks 1-4, your blood pressure will be checked (either at home, at the&#xD;
      clinic, or by your local doctor) if you are taking pazopanib or bevacizumab. If you are&#xD;
      checking your own blood pressure at home, you should keep a log to write down your blood&#xD;
      pressure. Bring the log to your next clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2 weeks, urine will be collected for routine tests if you are receiving bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 4 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If you are receiving&#xD;
           everolimus, you will fast (have nothing to eat or drink except water) starting the night&#xD;
           before these tests. The doctor will discuss this with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests if you are receiving everolimus or pazopanib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 8 weeks, the following tests and procedures will be performed. If you are receiving the&#xD;
      study treatment at your local doctor's office, you must return to MD Anderson for these tests&#xD;
      and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If you are receiving&#xD;
           pazopanib, this blood will also be used to check your thyroid function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have CT scans of the chest and abdomen to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will fill out 5 questionnaires about the quality of your life and about how you are&#xD;
           feeling. This should take about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every year, you will have an MRI of the brain to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every year, you will have an ECHO or MUGA scan to check the health of your heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anytime the doctor decides it is needed, you will have scans such as a CT scan of the pelvis,&#xD;
      an MRI scan of the abdomen or brain, ECHO or MUGA scan, and/or a bone scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 1 year, if the disease has not gotten worse, you may have less clinic visits and tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking a study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will no longer be able to take a study drug if intolerable side effects occur,&#xD;
      or if the disease gets worse after you take your second assigned study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When you are finished taking the study drug(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your End-of-Treatment visit, the study staff will contact you by phone, e-mail, or you&#xD;
      will come in for a clinic visit. You will be asked about how you are feeling and any side&#xD;
      effects you may have had. Each follow-up will take about 5 minutes. Follow-up will take place&#xD;
      every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the third year, and 1 time a year&#xD;
      after that. The last follow-up will be about 5 years after the last patient is enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Everolimus, bevacizumab, and pazopanib are all FDA approved&#xD;
      and commercially available for kidney cancer. The investigational part of this study is to&#xD;
      find out which order these drugs should be given in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 240 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

             lowering medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test&#xD;
             (serum/plasma or urine) within 7 days prior to beginning treatment on the study due to&#xD;
             the possible teratogenic effect&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients of child fathering or childbearing potential must agree to practice a form of&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. No patient with any concurrent active malignancy, i.e. a patient requiring or&#xD;
             receiving systemic therapy for another malignancy at the same time of treatment for&#xD;
             RCC&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must not have received any prior targeted therapy (anti-VEGF agents or mTOR&#xD;
             inhibitors), including adjuvant therapy, and must not have received any prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy for mRCC. However, patients who had received prior immunotherapy, such as&#xD;
             cytokines or vaccines, are permitted to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must not be scheduled to receive another experimental drug while on this&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents,&#xD;
             breast-feeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Therefore, HIV-positive patients receiving&#xD;
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with some of these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients must not have a clinical history of coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis.&#xD;
             Patients may be on therapeutic anticoagulation preferably a low-molecular weight&#xD;
             heparin. If the patients are on warfarin, the INR should be maintained within a&#xD;
             therapeutic level and must be checked weekly for the first four weeks, then every 2&#xD;
             weeks for 4 additional weeks. Thereafter, they may be followed at the discretion of&#xD;
             the treating provider. Antiplatelet agents are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Concomitant treatment with rifampin, St. John's wort, or the cytochrome p450&#xD;

             allowed on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patients with significant baseline proteinuria defined as 300 or greater by screening&#xD;
             U/A will be excluded if they have &gt; 1,000 mg proteins in a 24-hour urine collection or&#xD;
             if they have a random urine protein over creatinine (UPC) ratio &gt;1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days&#xD;
             prior to study enrollment or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during&#xD;
             the course of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess&#xD;

&#xD;
         22. Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one week&#xD;
             of study entry or during study period. Close contact with those who have received&#xD;
             attenuated live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus. Examples&#xD;
             of live vaccines include intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio,&#xD;
             BCG, yellow fever, varicella and TY21a typhoid vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Patients with severely impaired lung function as defined as spirometry and DLCO that&#xD;
             is 50% of the normal predicted value and/or 02 saturation that is 88% or less at rest&#xD;

&#xD;
         24. Liver disease such as cirrhosis or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).&#xD;
             Note: A detailed assessment of Hepatitis B/C medical history and risk factors must be&#xD;
             done at screening for all patients. HBV DNA and HCV RNA PCR testing are required at&#xD;
             screening for all patients with a positive medical history based on risk factors&#xD;
             and/or confirmation of prior HBV/HCV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Patients receiving chronic, systemic treatment with steroids in pharmacological doses&#xD;
             or immunosuppressive agents are excluded. Patients who receive steroids for&#xD;
             physiological replacement, e.g., after adrenalectomy are not excluded. Topical or&#xD;
             inhaled corticosteroids are also allowed.&#xD;
