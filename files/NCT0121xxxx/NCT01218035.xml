  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      zoledronic acid on the biologic incorporation of cementless hip prosthesis in postmenopausal&#xD;
      female patients.The study population consists of postmenopausal female patients scheduled for&#xD;
      total hip replacement because of degenerative hip osteoarthritis. The patients will receive&#xD;
      either a single dose of 5 mg zoledronic acid or placebo intravenously after surgery before&#xD;
      hospital discharge. The patients will be followed-up for 1 year. Zoledronic acid therapy has&#xD;
      been shown to promote bone ingrowth into porous implants in pre-clinical models. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesis is that zoledronic acid, given as a single intravenous infusion&#xD;
      after hip replacement surgery, enhances bone ingrowth into porous surface of cementless hip&#xD;
      prostheses. As a primary outcome, the therapy is expected to reduce periprosthetic bone loss&#xD;
      measured by DXA. Enhancement of bone ingrowth is expected to increase primary stability of&#xD;
      the hip prosthesis and this effect can be detected with high-precision three-dimensional RSA&#xD;
      imaging modality and in a faster functional recovery of the patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the patients enrolled in the study will receive the standard of care with respect to&#xD;
      surgical prosthetic replacement of the diseased hip. The patients will receive a&#xD;
      custom-modified (RSA marked) hydroxyapatite-coated prosthesis with ceramic-on-ceramic bearing&#xD;
      surfaces (SYMAX-TRIDENT, Stryker). The prosthesis modification provided by the manufacturer&#xD;
      has a CE mark. The patients in the active-treatment group will receive a single 5 mg dose of&#xD;
      zoledronic acid intravenously just prior to release from the hospital (about 5th day&#xD;
      post-surgery) as an adjunct therapy. The control group will receive a placebo (saline)&#xD;
      infusion. The active and placebo infusion vials will be provided by Norvartis Pharmaceutical.&#xD;
      After surgery, before the administration of zoledronic acid or placebo, each patient will be&#xD;
      re-screened for the level of serum calcium. In the case of postoperative hypocalcemia, the&#xD;
      infusion will be postponed for a minimum of 3-4 weeks and the infusion will be given after&#xD;
      the repeated measurements of serum calcium. All patients will receive calcium and D-vitamin&#xD;
      supplementation throughout the study period. Efficacy will be assessed on the basis of&#xD;
      clinical, radiographic (RSA, DXA, Spiral CT, conventional radiography) and laboratory&#xD;
      criteria. The clinical benefit of zoledronic acid therapy is defined in terms of faster&#xD;
      functional recovery, which will be analyzed in two ways: (1) the functional outcome (muscle&#xD;
      strength, gait analysis and pedometry) will be repeatedly evaluated before and after surgery,&#xD;
      and (2) the subjective outcome of the procedure as well as the general health assessment will&#xD;
      be determined at each follow-up visits using standardized outcome measures. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to test whether a single infusion of zoledronic acid reduces&#xD;
      periprosthetic bone loss measured by DXA at 12 months. Statistical significance of&#xD;
      differences in periprosthetic bone mineral density between active-treatment and placebo&#xD;
      groups will be analyzed using repeated analysis of variance.&#xD;
