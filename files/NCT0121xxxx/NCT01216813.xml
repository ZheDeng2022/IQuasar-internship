      RATIONALE: Gathering information from patients who have undergone treatment for upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancer or gynecological cancer may help doctors learn more about patients'&#xD;
      physical and psychosocial rehabilitation needs and plan the best treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the physical and psychosocial rehabilitation needs&#xD;
      of patients after diagnosis and treatment of upper gastrointestinal cancer or gynecological&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the patients' perspective of their physical and psychosocial rehabilitation&#xD;
           needs following the diagnosis and treatment for an upper gastrointestinal or a&#xD;
           gynecological cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess patients' experiences of the physical and social impact of cancer in the&#xD;
           treatment and post-treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore patients' met and un-met needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the patients' opinion of how it might be possible to manage any of the issues&#xD;
           that arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To generate theories and a hypothesis from the data collected for use in a future&#xD;
           interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: The study consist of a series of focus groups that take place in a private room&#xD;
      within the Royal Marsden Hospital in the United Kingdom. Patients attend only one focus group&#xD;
      session, which is audio-tape recorded. The focus groups discuss and explore the patient's&#xD;
      needs and experiences using a semi-structured interview question schedule over 60-90 minutes.&#xD;
      The groups are single-sex groups to allow the patients to express themselves freely with&#xD;
      respect to any sensitive topics they may wish to discuss. If individual patient issues arise&#xD;
      from the group discussions, the lead researcher may refer the patient to a member of the&#xD;
      hospital team, the patient's physician, or for appropriate psychological support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the focus group dialogue and patients' baseline demographic information are&#xD;
      analyzed. The results from this study are used to design an interventional study in the&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Department.&#xD;
