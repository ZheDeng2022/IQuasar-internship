  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a novel exercise&#xD;
      intervention for individuals who live with multiple sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators investigated the effect of a vestibular exercise program designed to help&#xD;
      people with MS with two common problems: fatigue and difficulties with balance while standing&#xD;
      and walking. Our primary aim was to compare the results from persons with MS that&#xD;
      participated in the vestibular exercises (Experimental group) to individuals who participated&#xD;
      in a more typical rehabilitation exercise program consisting of stretching and endurance&#xD;
      exercise (Exercise Control group) or people who did not receive exercise treatment (Control&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a 14-week randomized controlled trial. Thirty eighty participants were followed&#xD;
      for four weeks before being randomly assigned to one of the three groups. Each participant&#xD;
      had an equal chance of being assigned to either the Experimental group, Exercise Control&#xD;
      group or the Control group. The Experimental group received a standardized vestibular&#xD;
      exercise program that included upright postural control (balance) and eye movement exercises&#xD;
      (6 one-hour sessions over 6 weeks). The Exercise Control group received endurance training&#xD;
      using a stationary bicycle and leg stretching exercises (6 one-hour sessions over 6 weeks).&#xD;
      Both exercise groups received the same 5 minutes of fatigue management education.&#xD;
      Measurements of self-reported fatigue, dizziness and depression, and performance of a&#xD;
      computerized, standing upright postural control test and walking capacity test were measured&#xD;
      to determine benefits from the interventions. Participants in the Control group did not&#xD;
      exercise, however if they chose, received the treatment within the clinical setting upon&#xD;
      completion of their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that: 1) participants in the Experimental group would improve&#xD;
      significantly in fatigue and balance; 2) improvements found in the Experimental group would&#xD;
      be significantly greater than improvements in the Exercise Control group and Control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Analyses occur at: Baseline; at 10 weeks of follow-up (Baseline to&#xD;
      post-intervention; and at 14 weeks of follow-up (post-intervention to post-four week&#xD;
      unsupervised follow-up.&#xD;
