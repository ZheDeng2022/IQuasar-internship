  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hand-foot syndrome (HFS), also known as palmar-plantar erythrodysethesia (PPE), occurs in a&#xD;
      25%-50% of patients treated with several commonly used anti-cancer drugs including&#xD;
      capecitabine and sunitinib. These drugs are known to improve survival in many cancers,&#xD;
      including cancers of the colon, stomach, liver, breast, kidney, and GI stromal tumors (GIST).&#xD;
      Worldwide, over 400,000 patients per year are treated with one of these agents. HFS involves&#xD;
      skin changes, such as swelling, peeling, and blistering of the palms and soles, which is&#xD;
      often painful and debilitating. As a result, HFS-related symptoms can frequently lead to dose&#xD;
      reduction and/or discontinuation of otherwise effective anti-cancer treatment. There is no&#xD;
      treatment for HFS other than dose reduction or stopping treatment. This proposal could&#xD;
      quickly lead to treatments to prevent and/or treat HFS and help patients avoid debilitating&#xD;
      side effects while continuing otherwise effective treatments for their cancer.&#xD;

      The primary objective is to evaluate whether topical sildenafil reduces the severity of hand&#xD;
      foot syndrome or palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) associated with sunitinib and&#xD;
      capecitabine. The secondary objective is to describe any toxicities associated with topical&#xD;
      sildenafil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of topical sildenafil for&#xD;
      patients with grade 1-3 hand foot syndrome related to chemotherapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 20 evaluable patients with grade 1-3 PPE will be treated with topical&#xD;
      sildenafil:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 patients with PPE related to sunitinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 patients with PPE related to capecitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility and screening criteria are met, subjects will be given 2 types of topical&#xD;
      cream, one containing 1% sildenafil citrate and one containing placebo control. Subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized to apply sildenafil citrate cream to either the right or left hand/foot;&#xD;
      placebo cream will be applied to the opposite hand/ foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical history, physical examination and photography of the hands and feet will be&#xD;
      performed every two weeks for the first 2 months for patients on sunitinib and then every 4-6&#xD;
      weeks thereafter. For patients on capecitabine (which is given on an every 3 week schedule),&#xD;
      these evaluations will be done every 3 weeks. Additional visits may be performed if&#xD;
      clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If PPE resolves, less frequent administration and lower doses will be permitted to maintain&#xD;
      responses. For consistency, patients may first reduce treatment to twice per day at the dose&#xD;
      at which the PPE resolved. If this dosing schedule is effective then lower concentrations,&#xD;
      e.g. 0.5%, may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient cream assignment will be un-blinded at the 8 or 9 week time period (depending on the&#xD;
      chemotherapy). However, patients with a 2 grade improvement in PPE in one hand versus the&#xD;
      other (e.g. grade 3 improves to grade 1, or grade 2 improves to grade 0) that is maintained&#xD;
      for at least 2 weeks, will be eligible for early un-blinding and treatment with active&#xD;
      sildenafil for both hands and both feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may receive topical sildenafil for up to 6 months on study.&#xD;
