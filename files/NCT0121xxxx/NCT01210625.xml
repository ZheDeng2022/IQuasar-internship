  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that daily oral intake of starch-entrapped alginate&#xD;
      microspheres (called Nutrabiotix fiber) is well tolerated, exhibits no or minimal &quot;typical&quot;&#xD;
      side effects of fiber (e.g. bloating, loose stool, flatulence), can be used as an ideal&#xD;
      vehicle to deliver anti-oxidants/anti-inflammatory natural and synthetic substances/agents;&#xD;
      and promote gut health by improving bowel habit, by changing the gut microbiota and&#xD;
      increasing production of short chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, in the colon and&#xD;
      decreasing production of protein putrification (prebiotic effects).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of our research program is to show that targeted colonic delivery of&#xD;
      natural specific fermentable carbohydrates will maintain and promote gut health by changing&#xD;
      the gut microbiota [prebiotic effect], by increasing &quot;protective and growth promoting&quot;&#xD;
      factors such as butyrate, and enhancing intestinal barrier function. These health-promoting&#xD;
      functions may prevent and treat a wide range of disorders associated with an abnormal&#xD;
      microbiota (dysbiosis) and/or disrupted gut barrier function. Examples of disorders&#xD;
      associated with dysbiosis and disrupted gut barrier (leaky gut) are allergic disorders,&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease, diverticular disease, colon polyps and cancer, alcoholic liver&#xD;
      disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH- the most common liver disease in the USA), and&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS, the most common GI illness in the US with a high loss of&#xD;
      productivity and a high rate of utilization of health care resources).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrabiotix fiber is a prebiotic and is able to promote gut health through changes in the&#xD;
      stool microbiota composition favoring saccharolytic bacteria like Bifidobacteria and&#xD;
      diminishing proteolytic bacteria like Clostridia. This change in the intestinal microbiota&#xD;
      composition should result in increases in the products of carbohydrate fermentation [SCFA]&#xD;
      and decreases in the products of protein breakdown [indoles and phenols] in the stool. Also,&#xD;
      the fiber is well tolerated and without side effects and is an effective fiber that increases&#xD;
      stool bulk and regulates bowel movement.&#xD;

          2. Abnormal liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, or bilirubin &gt;1.5 times&#xD;
             normal range);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Abnormal renal function tests (BUN or creatinine &gt;1.5 times normal range);&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Low serum albumin (&lt;3 g/dL);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5) Abnormal TSH level;&#xD;
&#xD;
        (6) High CRP;&#xD;
&#xD;
        (7) Significant GI symptoms (except for constipation or occasional rectal bleeding due to&#xD;
        hemorrhoids);&#xD;
&#xD;
        (8) Prior intestinal resection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        (9) Patient history of GI diseases [except for hemorrhoids or occasional (&lt;3 times a week)&#xD;
        heartburn];&#xD;
&#xD;
        (10) Antibiotic use within last 12 weeks prior to enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        (11) Lean (BMI &lt;25) or obese (BMI&gt;30) subjects because obesity could be associated with&#xD;
        abnormal microbiota;&#xD;
&#xD;
        (12) Significant cardiac or respiratory diseases (defined by requiring daily medication for&#xD;
        management of their diseases);&#xD;
&#xD;
        (13) Severe hypertension (defined as uncontrolled hypertension in spite of therapy, or&#xD;
        requirement of more than one medication to treat hypertension; well-controlled, mild&#xD;
        hypertension may be included);&#xD;
&#xD;
        (14) Insulin-requiring and/or poorly controlled diabetes (well-controlled diabetics with&#xD;
        HbA1c &lt;6 may be enrolled);&#xD;

&#xD;
        (18) Plan to have a major change of the dietary habit during the following 5 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        (19) Subjects younger than 18 or older than 65. Older subjects are excluded in this initial&#xD;
        study because of high co-morbidity in older subjects. Children are excluded for this&#xD;
        initial Phase I study where the safety is not established;&#xD;
&#xD;
        (20) Pregnant and lactating women due to lack of information about safety of the product in&#xD;
        pregnant and lactating women.&#xD;
