    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well giving bevacizumab and combination chemotherapy&#xD;
      together before surgery works in treating patients with locally advanced esophageal or&#xD;
      stomach cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in&#xD;
      different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor&#xD;
      cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Giving bevacizumab and combination chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor&#xD;
      smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving these&#xD;
      treatments after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate two-year disease-free survival in patients with resectable esophageal and&#xD;
      gastroesophageal (GE) junction cancer treated with perioperative bevacizumab and leucovorin&#xD;
      calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess, by pathological examination after surgical resection, complete and partial&#xD;
      response to neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize overall and progression free survival. III. To compare baseline and&#xD;
      post-chemotherapy/bevacizumab tissues for biomarkers predicting response or resistance to&#xD;
      this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To investigate safety in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEOADJUVANT THERAPY: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1. Patients also receive FOLFOX chemotherapy comprising oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and&#xD;
      leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours&#xD;
      on days 1-2. Treatment with bevacizumab repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses and treatment&#xD;
      with FOLFOX repeats every 2 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGERY: Patients then undergo planned surgical resection 4-6 weeks after 6 courses of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and at least 8 weeks since the last dose of bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADJUVANT THERAPY: Beginning 8-10 weeks after surgery, patients receive bevacizumab IV,&#xD;
      oxaliplatin IV, leucovorin calcium IV, and fluorouracil IV as in neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 1 year,&#xD;
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
