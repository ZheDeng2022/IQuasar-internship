    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the Medifast 5 &amp; 1 Plan to a&#xD;
      food-based, reduced-energy diet plan. The study will be conducted over 52 weeks, including a&#xD;
      26-week weight-loss phase and a 26-week weight-maintenance phase. 120 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled, with 60 randomized to the Medifast 5 &amp; 1 Plan and 60 randomized to food-based,&#xD;
      reduced-energy diet plan. Multiple measures will be performed at baseline, 26 weeks, and 52&#xD;
      weeks, including anthropometry, body composition, blood pressure, blood assays, and appetite&#xD;
      sensations.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomized to the Medifast group will enroll online in the Medifast 5 &amp; 1 Plan. This plan consists of 5 portion-controlled, nutritionally-balanced Medifast Meals plus one Lean &amp; Green Meal each day. Medifast Meals come in individual packets that are mixed with water and microwaved or refrigerated, and are available in a wide variety of foods and flavors. There are &gt;70 Medifast Meal choices, and Medifast Meals may be used interchangeably, so any five Medifast Meals can be chosen for the 5 &amp; 1 Plan. The Medifast 5 &amp; 1 Plan provides approximately 800 to 1,000 kcal/d. The Lean &amp; Green Meal consists of a lean meat plus salad and/or vegetables selected by the participant. Intervention participants will have online access to Medifast dietitians, Medifast trainers, a Medifast message board, and a Medifast chat room, allowing them to interact with others on the Medifast 5 &amp; 1 Plan.</description>
