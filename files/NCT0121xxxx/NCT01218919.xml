      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a rechargeable Deep Brain&#xD;
      Stimulation as an adjunctive treatment for reducing some of the symptoms of advanced,&#xD;
      levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease that are not adequately controlled with medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first observational study for the use of the BRIO™ rechargeable constant current&#xD;
      device, using a lead with an active electrode tip for deep brain stimulation in Parkinson&#xD;
      subjects. The current study was designed to conform to normal medical practices, taking into&#xD;
      consideration the current day economic constraints, while assessing the best set of&#xD;
      circumstances for the successful sustained reduction of some of the symptoms of advanced,&#xD;
      levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease that are not adequately controlled with medication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective, observational, non-randomized, multi-centered study&#xD;
      for a total of 10 years in duration. It is a 10 year study from system implantation and&#xD;
      activation with a yearly database lock and report, with the subjects being used as their own&#xD;
      control. The primary outcome assessment will occur at three months. Following completion of&#xD;
      the primary outcome assessment, patients will have an annual visit up to 10 years post&#xD;
      implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of measures within the same person from pre-treatment to post-treatment will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the implantation procedure, each subject will undergo a trial of stimulation in the&#xD;
      operating room among other potential assessments to determine proper lead placement. The&#xD;
      device may be internalized after a successful intra-operative trial or at a later date&#xD;
      according to investigator site practice. The date that all components are implanted and&#xD;
      programmed will be classified as &quot;Day 0&quot;. After system activation the subject will return to&#xD;
      clinic for post-operative evaluations at 1 month (+/-14 days), 3 months (+/-14 days), 6&#xD;
      months (+/-14 days) and 12 months (+/-30 days). Thereafter, a long term data collection&#xD;
      program will be followed for 10 years post-implant.&#xD;
