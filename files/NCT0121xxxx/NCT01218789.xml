  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a one year open-label treatment of&#xD;
      tasimelteon in male and female subjects with Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (N24HSWD) occurs when individuals, primarily those without&#xD;
      light perception, are unable to synchronize their endogenous circadian pacemaker to the&#xD;
      24-hour light-dark cycle, and the timing of their circadian rhythm instead reflects the&#xD;
      intrinsic period of their endogenous circadian pacemaker. As a result, the circadian rhythm&#xD;
      of sleep-wake propensity in these individuals moves gradually later and later each day if&#xD;
      there circadian period is &gt; 24 hours and earlier and earlier if &lt; 24 hours. These individuals&#xD;
      will be able to sleep well at night when their sleep-wake propensity rhythm is approximately&#xD;
      aligned with the 24-hour light-dark and social cycle. However, after a short time, the&#xD;
      endogenous sleep-wake propensity rhythm and the 24-hour light-dark cycle will move out of&#xD;
      synchrony with each other, and they may have difficulty falling asleep until well into the&#xD;
      night. In addition to problems sleeping at the desired time, the subjects experience daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness and daytime napping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multicenter, open-label study. The study has two phases: the screening phase&#xD;
      and the evaluation phase. The screening phase is comprised of a screening visit where a&#xD;
      patient's general health and initial eligibility will be evaluated. The evaluation phase is&#xD;
      comprised of a baseline visit and a 52 week segment. Patients that meet all entry criteria&#xD;
      for the study at baseline visit will enter the treatment segment where patients will be asked&#xD;
      to take 20 mg tasimelteon daily approximately 60 minutes prior to their target bedtime for 52&#xD;
      weeks in an open-label fashion. An optional sub-study extension phase is available to&#xD;
      subjects who complete the first year of treatment and consists of continued open-label&#xD;
      treatment for up to 3 years additional.&#xD;
