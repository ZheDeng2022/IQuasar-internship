  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of In-Home Cognitive Behavioral&#xD;
      Therapy (IH-CBT) in comparison to Present-Centered Therapy (PCT), a supportive therapeutic&#xD;
      approach. IH-CBT is adapted form of CBT that is provided to depressed mothers participating&#xD;
      in ongoing home visitation services. IH-CBT has been adapted to fit the setting, population,&#xD;
      and context associated with home visiting. Mothers are recruited at 4 months postpartum. A&#xD;
      comprehensive assessment battery is administered at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6, 12,&#xD;
      and 18 months after the end of treatment. It is hypothesized that IH-CBT will be superior to&#xD;
      PCT in decreasing depression, improving overall functioning, enhancing parenting&#xD;
      effectiveness, and preventing relapse.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Home visitation is a prevention program for sociodemographically high risk, first-time&#xD;
      mothers and their children that is designed to optimize maternal life course and child&#xD;
      trajectories. Research indicates that maternal depression (1) is a significant problem in&#xD;
      home visitation with up to 45% of mothers experiencing clinically elevated symptoms while&#xD;
      only 14% receive treatment, and (2) can significantly interfere with the efficacy of home&#xD;
      visitation. Moreover, maternal depression negatively impacts mother-child interactions and&#xD;
      child functioning thus potentially precluding the dyad from fully benefiting from home&#xD;
      visitation. To address the high rate of maternal depression in existing home visitation&#xD;
      programs, In-Home Cognitive Behavior Therapy (IH-CBT) was developed through an R34 grant as a&#xD;
      treatment for mothers in home visitation experiencing depression postpartum. IH-CBT consists&#xD;
      of the core features of CBT that have been adapted to address the unique needs and challenges&#xD;
      of mothers receiving home visitation. Findings from the R34 indicate that IH-CBT is highly&#xD;
      effective at reducing depression, with 66.7% of depressed mothers no longer obtaining a&#xD;
      diagnosis of MDD at the end of treatment in contrast to a rate of 24.3% in mothers receiving&#xD;
      home visitation alone. In addition, mothers receiving IH-CBT reported increased social&#xD;
      support and reduction in other psychiatric symptoms, much of which was maintained at 3 month&#xD;
      follow-up. This study seeks to replicate IH-CBT with a larger sample, compare the treatment&#xD;
      to a more rigorous control condition (Present-Centered Therapy-PCT), and extend follow-up to&#xD;
      18 months in order to determine relapse rate. There is mixed evidence regarding the long-term&#xD;
      effectiveness of home visitation on depressed mothers and their children-critical outcomes&#xD;
      that, if adequately demonstrated, would significantly enhance the public health implications&#xD;
      of home visitation. Accordingly, the study also seeks to examine the impact of IH-CBT and&#xD;
      recovery from depression on parenting and children. Specifically, 220 mothers who are&#xD;
      enrolled in home visitation will be recruited through initial screening and subsequent&#xD;
      diagnosis of MDD. Subjects will be randomly assigned to IH-CBT + home visitation or PCT +&#xD;
      home visitation. Both IH-CBT and PCT will be implemented in 15 sessions with two booster&#xD;
      sessions provided 1 and 2 months after treatment. Measures of depression, psychiatric&#xD;
      comorbidity, adaptive functioning, social support, parenting, and child functioning will be&#xD;
      administered at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 6, 12 and 18 month follow-ups after&#xD;
      post-treatment. It is hypothesized that IH-CBT will be superior to PCT in (1) recovery from&#xD;
      depression, (2) risk of relapse and recurrence, and (3) increasing social support and&#xD;
      reducing overall psychiatric symptomatology. In addition, mothers who recover from depression&#xD;
      will show improvements in parenting and the mother-child relationship, and their children&#xD;
      will achieve improved cognitive, social, emotional, and biologic outcomes, relative to&#xD;
      non-recovered mothers and their offspring.&#xD;
