      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autoinflammatory diseases are illnesses that produce episodes of inflammation such as&#xD;
           fever, rash, or joint swelling. Some of these diseases can be treated with medications&#xD;
           that block the body's reaction to a protein called IL-1, which may be part of the cause&#xD;
           of the inflammation. IL-1 blocking agents are very helpful in treating autoinflammatory&#xD;
           diseases and have become the standard of care for treatment for some of these diseases.&#xD;
           However, more research is needed on related diseases that may be treated with new and&#xD;
           currently used IL-1 blocking agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  XOMA 052 is an experimental drug that is currently being tested as a possible treatment&#xD;
           for type 2 diabetes. Initial studies have shown that XOMA 052 neutralizes a specific&#xD;
           kind of IL-1, and is also active against certain indicators of inflammation. Researchers&#xD;
           are interested in determining whether XOMA 052 can be used to treat autoinflammatory and&#xD;
           related diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the effectiveness of XOMA 052 as a treatment for inflammation in adults with&#xD;
      the autoinflammatory diseases Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS)/Muckle-Wells&#xD;
      Syndrome (MWS) and Behcet's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FCAS/ MWS: Individuals at least 18 years of age who have a known history of the typical&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Behcet's Disease: Individuals at least 18 years of age who have evidence of active&#xD;
           disease, such as oral or genital ulcers or eye disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FCAS/MWS Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an overnight evaluation of their disease, including optional&#xD;
           tests (e.g., eye or skin exams). Participants who currently take medications to treat&#xD;
           their symptoms will stop taking the medication and will be monitored by study&#xD;
           researchers. At the first flare of symptoms, participants will begin to receive XOMA&#xD;
           052.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have further tests on days 3, 7, and 10 after the initial dose of XOMA&#xD;
           052. If the disease remains under good control, participants will have a clinical exam&#xD;
           every 5 days for up to 10 weeks until another disease flare occurs (determined either by&#xD;
           symptoms or by inflammation observed in laboratory studies). If the disease is not well&#xD;
           controlled with the initial dose of XOMA 052, participants will have additional doses&#xD;
           starting at day 7 until either the disease is controlled or researchers determine that&#xD;
           the medication is not effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have the option to continue XOMA 052 treatments for up to 1 year. XOMA&#xD;

      Autoinflammatory diseases are illnesses characterized by episodes of inflammation that,&#xD;
      unlike autoimmune disorders, lack the production of high titer autoantibodies or&#xD;
      antigen-specific T cells. There is growing genetic and clinical evidence that Interleukin-1&#xD;
      (IL-1) plays a pathogenic role in several of these diseases. This exploratory study aims to&#xD;
      examine the utility of the experimental drug candidate, XOMA 052 (XOMA (US), LLC) in the&#xD;
      treatment of adult subjects with the autoinflammatory disorders familial cold&#xD;
      autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) or Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS) associated with mutations in&#xD;
      cryopyrin-encoding CIAS1 and in adult subjects with Behcet's Disease (BD), a disease which&#xD;
      may be responsive to IL-1 blockade. XOMA 052 is a human recombinant IL-1beta antibody with&#xD;
      picomolar affinity for IL-1beta and a beta half-life of 22.4 days in humans. This agent is&#xD;
      currently in Phase 2 clinical studies for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes and initial&#xD;
      studies have shown activity against clinical and biochemical indicators of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is designed to address: 1) the utility of XOMA 052 in the treatment of FCAS&#xD;
      / MWS, in a disease known to respond to IL-1 blockade (FCAS / MWS) as shown by a response to&#xD;
      treatment with anakinra (Kineret(Registered Trademark), recombinant IL-1 receptor&#xD;
      antagonist), rilonacept (Arcalyst(Registered Trademark), IL-1 Trap, a fusion protein of the&#xD;
      IL-1 receptor and the Fc portion of IgG), and canakinumab (Ilaris(Registered Trademark),&#xD;
      IL-1beta blocking antibody); the latter two FDA approved for the treatment of this condition;&#xD;
      2) the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of treatment with XOMA 052 in FCAS / MWS; 3) the effect&#xD;
      of XOMA 052 on laboratory biomarkers in BD; and 4) an exploratory assessment of the utility&#xD;
      of XOMA 052 in the treatment of BD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For FCAS / MWS, biochemical and clinical correlates of autoinflammatory disease will be&#xD;
      measured at baseline following withdrawal of currently used IL-1 inhibitors. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive a course of therapy with XOMA 052 that is predicted to provide an estimated 4 weeks&#xD;
      of anti-inflammatory activity. If a favorable response is obtained, the continuation phase&#xD;
      will last twelve months. For BD, subjects will receive XOMA 052 for three to six months and&#xD;
      patients with a positive response will then be randomized to withdrawal or continuation of&#xD;
      drug for six months. Clinical and biochemical correlates of inflammation will be measured in&#xD;
      both patient groups at appropriate intervals to assess response and to further elucidate&#xD;
      disease mechanisms.&#xD;
