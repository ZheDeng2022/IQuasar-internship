  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With 11.000 deaths and 150.000 attempts each year in France, the suicide represents an&#xD;
      important public health problem. For each death by suicide, one can count 6 &quot;direct&quot; bereaved&#xD;
      people and 20 people in more indirect connection with this mourning (Terra 2001). In term of&#xD;
      impact, there is thus 300.000 people (annually) touched by the deaths by suicide and&#xD;
      3.750.000 people (annually) touched by the &quot;suicide attempt&quot; of a close relative. It seems&#xD;
      indeed important to have Public Health data on this cascade repercussion of the suicide&#xD;
      attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A suicide attempt propagates a suffering cascade on the various circles of the family and&#xD;
      close entourage, which can be measured in term of traumatic stress and medico-economic&#xD;
      impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective = To measure the medico-economic impact on the entourage, in the 3 months following&#xD;
      the suicide attempt and at 1 year.&#xD;

      Secondary objectives = To measure the impact of the suicide attempt in traumatic term of&#xD;
      stress on the close relatives of committing suicide confronted with the suicidal scene To&#xD;
      compare the evolution of consumption of care of the close relatives and of committing suicide&#xD;
      To measure the evolution of the general health condition of the close relatives and of&#xD;
      committing suicide&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants (committing suicide it and the relatives) will be recontacted by&#xD;
      telephone, after 3 months and to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consumption of care (number of consultations, drugs consumption) of the population of the&#xD;
      close relatives of committing suicide will be compared with the data of the Research&#xD;
      Institute and Documentation in Economy of Health (IRDES) on the French population (sample of&#xD;
      20.000 people, representative of 95% of the French households).&#xD;
