      Research Problem Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in the world that affects&#xD;
      approximately 300 million individuals worldwide. It is characterized by airway inflammation&#xD;
      and bronchoconstriction leading to airflow obstruction, however, the triggering factors&#xD;
      behind asthma development remains to be elucidated. Genetic risk factors have been suggested&#xD;
      to play a central role in asthma development. Twin studies supported a strong genetic&#xD;
      component to asthma, especially childhood asthma, with heritability estimates suggesting that&#xD;
      48-70% of asthma risk is attributed to genetic risk factors. Suggestive susceptibility genes&#xD;
      have been identified in European and American populations but not yet in the Middle East&#xD;
      including Saudi Arabia. Identified genes whether they are polymorphic variants of genes&#xD;
      encoding known pathophysiological molecules or novel genes identified by linkage or&#xD;
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are inconsistent in different populations thereby&#xD;
      adding to the need to undertake genetic studies on different ethnic populations and in&#xD;
      different countries. Here, the investigators hypothesize that polymorphic variation of novel&#xD;
      susceptibility genes form a major risk factor for asthma development, response to treatment&#xD;
      and progression in the Saudi population with strong diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Significance Since the manifestation of complex inflammatory disorders with strong&#xD;
      heritability is complex involving genetic and environmental interaction, each ethnically&#xD;
      distinct population must be examined to know whether gene-disease association exists in that&#xD;
      population. The objectives of this proposal are to discover novel asthma susceptibility genes&#xD;
      in the Saudi population. A better understanding of the genetic mechanisms of asthma will&#xD;
      enhance our knowledge of its pathophysiology. Asthmatic patients with distinct genotypes&#xD;
      respond differently to asthma medications. Therefore, improvements in diagnostics and&#xD;
      pharmacogenetics may be the first clinical developments of these extensive studies. This&#xD;
      embraces the concept of asthma subphenotypes and stratified medicine where interventions are&#xD;
      targeted at those individuals who will best benefit from them with minimal side effects.&#xD;
      Physicians looking after asthmatic patients will be able to provide better medical service&#xD;
      tailored to those patients, as well as to identify Saudi people at high risk for the&#xD;
      development of asthma, especially the more severe forms of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objectives The main objective of our proposal is to identify known and novel asthma&#xD;
      susceptibility genes in the Saudi population and to investigate their interaction with&#xD;
      clinical, environmental, and inflammatory factors contributing to asthma pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methodology In this proposal, the investigators will investigate the genetic factors&#xD;
      contributing to asthma susceptibility by determining in Saudi population, the presence of&#xD;
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been previously reported from linkage and&#xD;
      GWAS in other populations. Whole genome DNA will also be scanned for novel SNPs of selected&#xD;
      &quot;asthma genes&quot; using microarrays. This will enable us to identify new SNPs that contribute to&#xD;
      the risk of asthma specifically in the Saudi population. In addition, the investigators will&#xD;
      cross-reference all genetic and immunological parameters with the corresponding clinical data&#xD;
      in order to elucidate the impact of certain genes, or their products (e.g. cytokines), on the&#xD;
      clinical manifestation of asthma.&#xD;

    <measure>IL-4 receptor alpha and STAT6 single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with increased risk of asthma in a Saudi Arabian population.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>IL-4Rα rs1805010 and rs1801275 SNPs have been found to be significantly associated with asthma susceptibility in different ethnic groups; some STAT6 SNPs, including rs324011 and rs324015, have also been associated with asthma predisposition and/or IgE levels. Risk evaluations of IL-4Rα and STAT6 SNPs in association with asthma have never been evaluated in Saudi Arabian populations. Methods: Saudi Arabian patients with documented history of severe asthma (n=190) and healthy subjects (n=194) were recruited. Allelic and genotype association to asthma was assessed for IL-4Rα and STAT6 polymorphisms using nucleotide sequencing. Results: The IL4Rα rs1801275 SNP A/G-G/G genotypes, but not the A/A genotype, were significantly associated with asthma predisposition (OR=0.47; 95% CI=0.31-0.72; P&lt;0.001*; dominant model); Similarly, for STAT6 rs324011, odds were significantly higher that homozygous T/T genotype could be associated with asthma.</description>

        This is a multi-center observational study. Asthmatic patients attending major hospitals in&#xD;
        Riyadh with clear and well defined inclusion criteria (see below for details, Appendix I)&#xD;
        will be recruited. We anticipate recruiting 1000 asthmatic patients and comparable number&#xD;
        of control subjects. The controls will be recruited from people attending blood bank for&#xD;
        donation or other patients attending different clinics with history excluding atopic&#xD;
        diseases and asthma. Ethical approval for this study will be obtained from CMRC ethical&#xD;
        committee of the KKUH as well as other involved centers&#xD;
