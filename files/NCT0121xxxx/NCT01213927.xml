  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major public health problem, whose incidence is&#xD;
      increasing in developed countries and is the leading cause of death in patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis. The diagnosis and the early management are key issues that could improve the&#xD;
      prognosis. In France, alcoholic cirrhosis is the leading cause of HCC, while the aetiology of&#xD;
      underlying chronic liver disease is mainly hepatitis C (HCV) in Southern Europe and Japan,&#xD;
      and hepatitis B (HBV) in Asia and Africa. In the next years, due to the improved results of&#xD;
      anti-viral therapies, this trend should be reinforced with a decreasing proportion of HCC&#xD;
      related to viral cirrhosis and an increasing proportion of HCC related to alcoholic&#xD;
      cirrhosis. However, natural history of alcoholic cirrhosis remains poorly understood, most&#xD;
      studies being retrospective and including a small number of patients. This project is filed&#xD;
      by the consortium CIRRAL including French Academic hospitals centers currently involved and&#xD;
      referees in the field of alcoholic liver disease and HCC (8 at the moment, and more in the&#xD;
      next months). It is a national multicenter prospective study that will include 1200 patients&#xD;
      with alcoholic cirrhosis histologically proven over 3 years. The main goal of this cohort is&#xD;
      to describe the natural history of a large number of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis&#xD;
      prospectively followed, and to identify predictors of the occurrence of HCC.&#xD;

      Patients will be selected for the study if they met all the inclusion criteria, without any&#xD;
      of the non-inclusion criteria, ie compensated Child Pugh A alcoholic cirrhosis without viral&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis B or C, and without any detectable HCC. They will be offered, during a&#xD;
      consultation as part of their usual care, to participate in the study. An information note&#xD;
      will be issued. Patients agreeing to participate should date and sign informed consent. Usual&#xD;
      biological tests and liver ultrasonography will be performed if not done within 90 days prior&#xD;
      to inclusion. During this visit, 20 ml of blood will be collected for freezing and storage of&#xD;
      serum and plasma, and constitution of a DNA library.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the reviews conducted at baseline, patients with at least one exclusion criteria (ie&#xD;
      decompensation of cirrhosis, Child Pugh score ≥ 7, co-infection with HBV or HCV, or liver&#xD;
      focal lesion suggestive of HCC will be excluded (and their serum samples achieved for the&#xD;
      BioBank will be destroyed):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring: According to current guidelines, patients will have periodical surveillance with&#xD;
      liver ultrasonography and medical consultation at least every 6 months, blood tests at least&#xD;
      every year, periodic assessment of esophageal and gastric varices (every 1 to 3 years) and&#xD;
      prevention of their rupture if any. An additional blood sampling of 20 ml will be taken at&#xD;
      baseline and every year in order to perform serum, plasma, and DNA libraries; Data will be&#xD;
      standardized and centralized in a single database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Methods for censored data with competitive risks. Number of subjects to&#xD;
      include: The planned number is 1200 subjects included in 3 years. Assuming a minimal annual&#xD;
      incidence of HCC about 2% in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, and a proportion of lost to&#xD;
      follow-up of around 20% in this poorly compliant population, a sample of 3000 patients could&#xD;
      demonstrate the existence of predictive factors for the occurrence of HCC associated with a&#xD;
      relative risk at least equal to 2, with a power of 90%. However, the enrollment of 3000&#xD;
      patients recruited in three years is not a realistic goal. For practical reasons and since&#xD;
      the data currently available are very limited regarding the precise incidence of HCC and the&#xD;
      strength of association between risk factors and HCC in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis,&#xD;
      the minimum number of patients included in the cohort CIRRAL was set at 1200. Regarding an&#xD;
      expected percentage of patients lost to follow close to 20%, the final number of patients&#xD;
      with sufficient follow-up will be 1000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. description of the incidence of HCC occurrence in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. identification of predictive factors for the occurrence of HCC c) identification of&#xD;
           prognostic factors for survival. In addition, nested scientific projects will use the&#xD;
           database and collected samples of this prospective cohort, thus constituting significant&#xD;
           savings of resources. However, these nested scientific projects should include a&#xD;
           specific need of organization and financing clean, and may involve only a fraction of&#xD;
           the population included. The areas involved are very varied (immunology, genetics,&#xD;
           imaging, evaluation of fibrosis, biostatistics, , quality of life, economy, etc.).&#xD;
