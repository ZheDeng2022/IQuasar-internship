  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by a progressive decline in&#xD;
      lung function and increased symptoms such as breathlessness/dyspnoea, cough and&#xD;
      expectoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though subjective in nature, the symptomatology of COPD and mainly that of&#xD;
      breathlessness/dyspnoea has been studied with the use of objective measurement tools. Taking&#xD;
      into consideration that the symptoms experienced by the patient who suffers from a&#xD;
      progressive disease such as COPD can only be perceived and interpreted by the patient him- or&#xD;
      herself, and thus difficult to be quantified, COPD remains a challenge in clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a need to carry out qualitative studies that will provide insight into&#xD;
      the wide spectrum of COPD symptomatology from the patient's perspective. In addition, a&#xD;
      further mapping of the impact that COPD symptoms' perception has on a patient's life is&#xD;
      required, as well as of the different pathways through which symptoms' perception is&#xD;
      interpreted regarding the limitations of daily living activities, and the subsequent impact&#xD;
      on disease management. The more the physician learns on the embodied experience of COPD, the&#xD;
      better he/she may assist the patient in achieving optimal COPD management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus this cross-sectional observational study was designed aiming to obtain these data.&#xD;
      Specifically, the study aims to evaluate the most frequently used words by the patients and&#xD;
      the physicians to express the symptoms of COPD as well as the limitation of activities that&#xD;
      it causes.&#xD;
