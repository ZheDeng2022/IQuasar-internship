  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Andersen-Tawil Syndrome (ATS) is a rare genetic disorder that causes episodes of muscle&#xD;
      weakness, potentially life-threatening changes in heart rhythm, and skeletal developmental&#xD;
      abnormalities. The cause of some ATS cases remains unknown, and no specific treatments have&#xD;
      been established. The purpose of this study is to determine whether potassium supplements&#xD;
      and/or the medication acetazolamide affect the duration of muscle weakness and heart rhythm&#xD;
      abnormalities in people with ATS.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ATS is an ion channel disorder that causes episodes of muscle weakness and potentially&#xD;
      life-threatening heart arrhythmias. The majority of ATS cases are caused by a mutation in the&#xD;
      KCNJ2 gene, which is linked to potassium channels in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle;&#xD;
      other cases are presumed to be caused by an as yet undetermined gene lesion. To date, the&#xD;
      treatment for ATS has been largely anecdotal, and no treatments have been formally assessed&#xD;
      in a controlled clinical trial. This study will determine whether potassium supplements&#xD;
      and/or acetazolamide, which is a diuretic medication, affect the duration of muscle weakness&#xD;
      and heart rhythm abnormalities in people with ATS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last about 11 months. Participants will first attend a 3-day&#xD;
      inpatient visit that will include a medical history, physical examination, blood work, heart&#xD;
      rhythm testing by an electrocardiogram (ECG) and Holter monitor, strength testing, a health&#xD;
      questionnaire, and daily potassium supplementation. Participants will also track the number&#xD;
      and length of weakness episodes that they experience while in the hospital. On the last day&#xD;
      of the inpatient visit, participants will be provided with multiple bottles containing either&#xD;
      potassium or placebo. Participants will then return home for an 18-week treatment period that&#xD;
      will consist of six 3-week-long treatments of either potassium or placebo, with the treatment&#xD;
      schedule being randomly determined. Upon completing the first 18-week treatment period,&#xD;
      participants will attend a second 3-day inpatient visit that will include the same tests and&#xD;
      procedures as the first. The only difference will be that participants will receive&#xD;
      acetazolamide along with potassium. This will be followed by a second 18-week treatment&#xD;
      period that will consist of six 3-week-long treatments of either acetazolamide or placebo. At&#xD;
      the end of the second treatment period, participants will fill out another health&#xD;
      questionnaire. Throughout both 18-week treatment periods, participants will phone in daily to&#xD;
      track any muscle or heart problems. They will also provide blood samples on a weekly basis.&#xD;
      At Weeks 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and 17 of both treatment periods, participants will wear a Holter&#xD;
      monitor for 24 hours and then mail it in. A final outpatient visit will occur 8 weeks after&#xD;
      the end of the second treatment period and will include heart rhythm testing, muscle strength&#xD;
      testing, and blood work.&#xD;
