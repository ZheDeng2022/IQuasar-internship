      RATIONALE: A multimedia educational program may help patients with newly diagnosed prostate&#xD;
      cancer and breast cancer reduce distress, make informed treatment decisions, and improve&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well a multimedia educational program&#xD;
      works in patients with early-stage prostate cancer or breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether an innovative multimedia educational program will help newly diagnosed&#xD;
           prostate (project 1) and breast (project 2) cancer patients prepare for their journey as&#xD;
           cancer patients, promote informed treatment decision-making and reduce cancer-specific&#xD;
           distress, and among breast cancer patients at re-entry, facilitate an informed re-entry&#xD;
           transition to cancer survivorship and reduce cancer-specific distress (project 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether having Cancer Information Service (CIS) Information Specialists make a&#xD;
           scheduled telephone callback to callers in project 3 will augment and support use of the&#xD;
           CIS Research Consortium (CISRC) multimedia educational programs and further enhance the&#xD;
           study outcomes examined in this program of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether the hypothesized mediational variables account for significant&#xD;
           intervention effects in each of the three component projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine potential moderator variables to assess potential differences in intervention&#xD;
           efficacy by selected subgroups (e.g., age, education) within each component project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct an in-depth tracking study of utilization patterns for a detailed description of&#xD;
           different patterns of use, as well as elucidating those components or modules within the&#xD;
           program that had differential utilization by participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assist the CIS and other similar cancer information systems in disseminating one or more&#xD;
           of the CISRC interventions should they prove effective in this program of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct secondary analyses across projects (i.e., perceived need for and benefit from&#xD;
           the CISRC interventions and intervention efficacy across three high priority cancer&#xD;
           patient populations) that will be made possible by the use of a common theoretical&#xD;
           framework, the same or similar intervention and research design across projects, and a&#xD;
           common set of endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are assessed by demographic questions and a baseline interview conducted by Cancer&#xD;
      Information Service (CIS) Information Specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 intervention groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Patients receive a mailing containing standard CIS print materials. In project&#xD;
           1, patients receive &quot; Treatment Choices for Men with Early-Stage Prostate Cancer&quot; and&#xD;
           &quot;What You Need to Know About Prostate Cancer&quot;. In project 2, patients receive &quot;What You&#xD;
           Need to Know About Breast Cancer&quot; and &quot;Surgery Choices for Women with Early-Stage Breast&#xD;
           Cancer&quot;. In project 3, patients receive &quot;Facing Forward: Life After Cancer Treatment&quot;&#xD;
           and &quot;What You Need to Know About Breast Cancer&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Patients receive mailings appropriate to their project as in group 1. Patients&#xD;
           also receive the multimedia program via the Internet or CD-ROM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: In project 3 only, patients receive mailings appropriate to their project as in&#xD;
           group 1 and the multimedia program as in group 2. Patients also receive a CIS callback&#xD;
           intervention at 10-14 days from trained Information Specialists from the CIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 2 and 9 months.&#xD;
