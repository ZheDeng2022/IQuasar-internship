      The investigators seek to develop a clinical prediction rule (CPR) to identify patients with&#xD;
      a primary complaint of shoulder pain who are likely to benefit from manual therapy to the&#xD;
      neck and upper back regions. Manual therapy will include mobilizations (therapist moves the&#xD;
      joints in an oscillating fashion) and manipulations (therapist performs a high velocity low&#xD;
      amplitude movement) The investigators hypothesize that a cluster of signs and symptoms from&#xD;
      the subject history and physical examination will exist that maximize the accuracy of&#xD;
      identifying patients with a primary complaint of shoulder pain likely to benefit from this&#xD;
      manual therapy treatment based on a reference standard of patient-reported improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also seek to investigate the psychometric properties (how good a test is),&#xD;
      including test retest reliability of a modified version of the Fear Avoidance Beliefs&#xD;
      Questionnaire (FABQ) and the shortened Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) in patients&#xD;
      with shoulder pain. The investigators will also look at the convergent validity (determine if&#xD;
      measures that should be related are in reality related) and discriminant validity (show that&#xD;
      measures that should not be related are in reality not related) of the modified FABQ and the&#xD;
      TSK-11 in patients with shoulder pain.&#xD;

      The point prevalence of shoulder symptoms has been reported to range from 20-33% and the&#xD;
      incidence of shoulder complaints in the general population is increasing. Furthermore,&#xD;
      several authors have reported low rates of perceived recovery (patient reports of &quot;being&#xD;
      cured&quot;) for patients with a new episode of shoulder or neck pain.3-6 According to Bot et al,&#xD;
      less than 25% of patients with a first episode of shoulder pain reported recovery after 3&#xD;
      months, and only 32% stated they had recovered (no longer had symptoms) after 1 year. Other&#xD;
      studies have investigated the prognosis of shoulder pain in general practice. Croft et al&#xD;
      reported recovery rates of only 21% after 6 months and 49% after 18 months. Van der Windt et&#xD;
      al and Winters et al reported recovery rates of 51% and 59% after 12 to 18 months,&#xD;
      respectively. Finally, Rekola et al reported that 25% of patients with shoulder or neck pain&#xD;
      experienced at least one episode of recurrence within 12 months. These findings suggest that&#xD;
      shoulder pain can be recurrent and frequently progresses to the chronic stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Guide to Physical Therapist Practice describes 5 components of patient management;&#xD;
      examination, evaluation, diagnosis, prognosis, interventions and outcomes. Information&#xD;
      collected during the examination is evaluated in an attempt to improve decision making&#xD;
      regarding the most appropriate treatment strategy for the individual patient. Contrary to the&#xD;
      medical model which attempts to identify pathology to arrive at a diagnosis, the diagnostic&#xD;
      process in physical therapy involves classifying or labeling patients based on functional&#xD;
      limitations (restrictions in activities caused by a certain condition) and impairments (loss&#xD;
      or abnormality in function such as decreased strength or motion) in an attempt to&#xD;
      specifically direct treatment. Clinical decision making regarding treatment involves a&#xD;
      certain degree of uncertainty as to which interventions will maximize individual patient&#xD;
      outcomes. While the amount of quality evidence supporting physical therapy interventions is&#xD;
      increasing, this uncertainty can make it difficult to decide on an appropriate treatment&#xD;
      strategy. The American Physical Therapy Association has stated that identifying subgroups of&#xD;
      patients who are likely to benefit from specific treatments is a research priority. (APTA)&#xD;
      The Guide to Physical Therapist Practice indicates that interventions such as&#xD;
      mobilization/manipulation are utilized by physical therapists to manage patients who have&#xD;
      shoulder pain. There is growing evidence that impairments in the cervicothoracic spine may&#xD;
      contribute to shoulder pain, and that patients with shoulder pain may benefit from&#xD;
      manipulation in this region. Manipulation is defined as a manual therapy technique comprising&#xD;
      a continuum of skilled passive movements, including small-amplitude/high velocity movements&#xD;
      (thrust) and oscillations (non-thrust), that is targeted at joints and soft tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While it is not likely that all patients who have with shoulder pain will benefit from&#xD;
      manipulation (thrust and non-thrust) of the cervicothoracic spine, it is possible that a&#xD;
      subgroup exists that will experience rapid and dramatic improvement with the use of these&#xD;
      manual physical therapy techniques. It is our specific aim to develop a clinical prediction&#xD;
      rule (CPR) to identify patients with a primary complaint of shoulder pain who are likely to&#xD;
      benefit from cervicothoracic manipulation. The purpose of a CPR is to improve the clinician's&#xD;
      accuracy in predicting a diagnosis or an expected outcome. For example, CPRs exist to improve&#xD;
      the accuracy of diagnosing ankle fractures in individuals with acute injuries,predict the&#xD;
      likelihood of death within four years for individuals with coronary disease, or determine&#xD;
      when cervical radiographs are required for patients who have experienced neck trauma. The&#xD;
      process of developing and testing a CPR has been described in detail elsewhere. Although CPRs&#xD;
      can be developed to improve the accuracy of making a certain diagnosis, the focus of this&#xD;
      project is to develop a CPR to predict a certain treatment outcome. The development of a CPR&#xD;
      utilizes diagnostic properties of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative&#xD;
      likelihood ratios, which are based on the individual patient. Thus their interpretation can&#xD;
      be readily applied to an individual patient. Development of a CPR to accurately predict which&#xD;
      patients with shoulder pain will likely experience a clinically meaningful improvement in&#xD;
      pain and function with cervicothoracic spine manipulation before treatment would be immensely&#xD;
      helpful for clinicians in the decision-making process. Thus the purpose of this project is to&#xD;
      develop a CPR to identify patients with shoulder pain likely to benefit from cervicothoracic&#xD;
      spine thrust and non-thrust manipulation.&#xD;
