    <textblock>
      Preterm birth is the most common and costly complication in obstetrics. It complicates up to&#xD;
      11 % of all pregnancies and it is responsible for 70% of sick babies. Recently two studies&#xD;
      have shown that giving progesterone (a normal hormone made by the ovaries) prolongs gestation&#xD;
      in women who have had a preterm birth in an earlier pregnancy (and therefore are at risk for&#xD;
      another early delivery). There are other studies that show that this technique of giving a&#xD;
      weekly shot of progesterone does not prevent preterm birth. In addition, There are other&#xD;
      groups of patients who are at very high risk for preterm birth which have not been studied.&#xD;
      They include: 1.) Cervical cerclage (a stitch in the mouth of the womb); 2.) Multifetal&#xD;
      gestation (twins, triplets, etc.); 3.) Women with preterm (&lt;34 weeks) rupture of the&#xD;
      membranes; 4.) Women with preterm labor during the current pregnancy with intact membranes&#xD;
      who have been tocolyzed (have their labor stopped and are getting ready to go home). We&#xD;
      purpose to give weekly shots of progesterone or a placebo in a randomized fashion to women in&#xD;
      the first group who are at risk for preterm delivery due to an early birth in a previous&#xD;
      pregnancy as well as the other four groups listed. If progesterone given weekly is successful&#xD;
      at preventing early delivery as compared to the placebo group then great benefit for these&#xD;
      women as well as future pregnancies would be accrued.&#xD;

      A. Introduction Preterm birth occurs in 7-12% of all deliveries, but accounts for over 85% of&#xD;
      all perinatal morbidity and mortality.1 Despite many strategies for reducing the incidence of&#xD;
      preterm birth none have been totally effective. One treatment that showed promise in earlier&#xD;
      small trials was the prophylactic administration of progestational compounds.2,3 However, the&#xD;
      reports of efficacy were mixed with some showing benefits4,5 while others did not.6,7 More&#xD;
      recently, two randomized clinical trials have shown great promise8,9, and revealed a&#xD;
      significant decrease in preterm births among women who received 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone&#xD;
      caproate (17P)8, or 100mg of progesterone delivered by vaginal suppository per week.9 Indeed&#xD;
      support by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and March of Dimes as&#xD;
      well as others have made this treatment the standard of care in many areas of the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The limitations of these studies are that they have small numbers as well as a higher than&#xD;
      expected preterm delivery rate among placebo patients. Because of the previous controversy as&#xD;
      to the effectiveness of progesterone noted in the 70's - 80's it is incumbent upon other&#xD;
      centers to carry out new investigational trials in an effort to confirm their results.&#xD;
      Secondly, the studies were limited to singleton pregnancies who were &quot;at risk&quot; for preterm&#xD;
      delivery thus not surveying three groups with the highest preterm delivery rate: 1.)&#xD;
      Multifetal gestations and cervical insufficiency; 2.) Those who have preterm labor in the&#xD;
      current pregnancy that have been tocolyzed; 3.) Women with preterm premature rupture of the&#xD;
      membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study to confirm if possible, the findings of the most recent&#xD;
      investigations8,9 using the same patient population and in addition, we will study the effect&#xD;
      of progesterone vs placebo in preventing early delivery among multifetal gestations in women&#xD;
      who have been diagnosed with preterm labor in the current pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Specific Aim The aim of this study is to compare progesterone (100mg progesterone weekly)&#xD;
      to ascertain if there is a reduction in preterm birth and subsequent neonatal morbidity among&#xD;
      patients receiving the active drug. If weekly treatment with this agent can be shown to&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of preterm delivery and its surrogate adverse outcomes in the neonate,&#xD;
      it will have major impact upon patients and the health care delivery system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Rationale Progesterone as indicated in the Introduction has been shown in some, but not&#xD;
      all, studies to reduce incidence of preterm delivery and the adverse effects of prematurity.&#xD;
      Progesterone has been shown to reduce the number of oxytocin receptors in the myometrium and&#xD;
      be responsible in the near term pregnant women for blocking the onset of labor. Weekly use of&#xD;
      this compound, if effective, would be much superior to the tocolytic agents currently&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Benefit to Risk Ratio There is no known harm to mother/fetus/infant of progesterone&#xD;
      therapy. This compound has been used in early pregnancies at risk for abortion as well as&#xD;
      later in pregnancy to reduce the incidence of prematurity as noted in the Introduction. On&#xD;
      the beneficial side, if this treatment proves effective it could prolong pregnancy thus&#xD;
      reduce significant neonatal morbidity as well as the emotional cost and expense of such&#xD;
      pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Patient Population Patients will be recruited from the University of Mississippi Medical&#xD;
      Center Perinatal Clinics, Antepartum Service and Labor and Delivery area. All patients who&#xD;
      meet admission criteria will be offered participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Materials and Methods Patients seen in the University of Mississippi Perinatal Clinics,&#xD;
      Antepartum ward or Labor and Delivery area with preterm labor or who are at risk for preterm&#xD;
      labor and who meet other admission criteria (without having exclusion criteria) will be&#xD;
      offered participation of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will have the study explained to them,&#xD;
      including benefits risks and alternative therapy. Patients not desiring to participate in the&#xD;
      study will receive our current regimen of preterm birth prevention (observation, risk factor&#xD;
      assessment, steroids, progesterone, etc). If they accept inclusion into the study after the&#xD;
      above explanation they will be randomized by the use of sequentially numbered, sealed opaque&#xD;
      envelopes to either receive progesterone or a placebo injection on a weekly basis. Patients&#xD;
      with risk factors for preterm birth (prior preterm birth) will be separately randomized from&#xD;
      the multifetal gestations or cervical cerclage and the patients with preterm labor in the&#xD;
      current pregnancy as well as preterm rupture of the membranes will also separately randomized&#xD;
      (four groups total). Neither patients nor participants will know to which group (placebo vs.&#xD;
      progesterone) they are assigned as the pharmacy will keep the randomization schedule and will&#xD;
      dispense the two solutions in identical syringes for blinding purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will begin at different gestational ages dependent upon the four groups noted&#xD;
      above. For example, multifetal gestation due to their incidence of labor at earlier&#xD;
      gestational ages, will begin treatment at 20 weeks' gestation. Those in the preterm labor&#xD;
      with the current pregnancy group or premature rupture of membranes will begin their therapy&#xD;
      after admission to the hospital following stabilization. All patients will stop therapy at 34&#xD;
      completed weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After inclusion into the study, prenatal care will be exactly the same as is our standard for&#xD;
      such patients at risk for early delivery with the exception of the weekly administration of&#xD;
      the study medicine or placebo. For example, weekly prenatal visits, cervical examinations,&#xD;
      ultrasounds, steroids and/or tocolytic treatment (given when preterm labor is diagnosed) will&#xD;
      be the same regardless of the group to which the patient is randomized. All groups will have&#xD;
      one tube of blood drawn from the placental cord at the time of delivery. There will be no&#xD;
      additional visits or costs due to the study itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Data Analysis Data analysis will be by the standard statistical methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Number of Patients Needed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size estimation indicates that 320 patients (40 in each of four groups-treatment and&#xD;
      placebo) will be necessary to have an 80% power of detecting a significance of &lt; 0.05 in the&#xD;
      number of preterm births. It is anticipated that a time period of approximately two years&#xD;
      will be needed to enroll this number of participants.&#xD;
