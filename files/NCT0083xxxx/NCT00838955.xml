      This clinical trial is for patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma that has not responded to standard&#xD;
      treatment. The purpose of this study is to determine what effects, good or bad, Temsirolimus&#xD;
      has on Hodgkin Lymphoma. The study will also determine whether Temsirolimus is tolerated in&#xD;
      patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma who have been previously treated with chemotherapy.&#xD;

      Temsirolimus 25 mg IV infusion will be given once weekly on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each&#xD;
      cycle. Patients will be assessed for response with CT scans after the second cycle, and then&#xD;
      after every other cycle until disease progression is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with Temsirolimus until disease progression, or up to six cycles.&#xD;
      Continuation of therapy beyond cycles is at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed classical Hodgkin Lymphoma or Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkin&#xD;
             Lymphoma with progressive disease during or at the end of the previous therapy, as&#xD;
             defined by the IWG criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have nodular sclerosing, lymphocyte depleted, or mixed cellularity&#xD;
             Hodgkin Lymphoma (Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma), or Lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin&#xD;
             Lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline measurements and evaluations must be obtained within 4 weeks of registration&#xD;
             to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             or other appropriate imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A clearly defined, bidimensionally measurable lymph node or tumor mass measuring at&#xD;
             least 2 cm in diameter on a CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient should have had at least one line of prior chemotherapy. Patients relapsing&#xD;
             after treatment with radiation therapy alone are not eligible.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  AST (SGOT) &lt; than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
