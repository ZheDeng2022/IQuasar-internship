      This is a 12-week clinical trial investigating the effects of smoking cessation on sexual&#xD;
      functioning in men. This study consists of 3 sessions and provides 8 weeks of free nicotine&#xD;
      transdermal patches. It is hypothesized that men who quit smoking, compared to men who smoke&#xD;
      as usual, will demonstrate improved sexual functioning, measured both physiologically&#xD;
      (erectile functioning) and subjectively (self-reported sexual functioning).&#xD;

      Objective: Tobacco use constitutes the single most preventable cause of disease and death in&#xD;
      the world today and is responsible for introducing a number of diseases including many types&#xD;
      of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases. Extensive literature indicates&#xD;
      that cigarette smoking is an independent risk factor for introducing erectile impairment in&#xD;
      men. Controlled clinical trials examining the effects of smoking cessation on sexual&#xD;
      functioning are necessary in order to investigate whether quitting smoking improves sexual&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a 12-week clinical trial in which 80 male long-term smokers will be tested at&#xD;
      baseline (while smoking) and then randomized to an 8-week nicotine patch treatment regimen (n&#xD;
      = 50) or to a delayed treatment wait list condition (n = 30). All participants will be&#xD;
      reassessed at mid-treatment (4 weeks), and at 1-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures: Physiological (penile circumferential change via penile&#xD;
      plethysmography), and subjective (continuous self-report) sexual responses to erotic stimuli&#xD;
      will be examined, as well as global changes in self-reported sexual functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications: If participants do in fact demonstrate a significant increase in sexual arousal&#xD;
      and sexual functioning as a result of smoking cessation, these results may have the potential&#xD;
      for facilitating programs and interventions targeting the prevention and cessation of&#xD;
      cigarette smoking in men. This would alleviate enormous economic burdens caused by erectile&#xD;
      dysfunction and other smoking-related diseases.&#xD;
