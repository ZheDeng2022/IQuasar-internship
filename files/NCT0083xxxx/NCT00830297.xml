      Treat-to-target trial of basal Insulin in Post-transplant hyperglycemia (TIP): efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of a novel protocol in renal transplant recipients receiving a tacrolimus-based&#xD;
      immunosuppression&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, randomized safety and efficacy study of long-acting insulin (Insulatard®) as&#xD;
      therapy against post-transplant hyperglycemia in renal transplant recipients&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate superiority of long-acting insulin (Insulatard®) against post-transplant&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, in comparison to conventional treatment, and as evaluated by HbA1c&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the average post-transplant glucose levels in renal transplant patients under&#xD;
           conventional blood-glucose lowering therapy during a period of at least 14 days after&#xD;
           transplantation by measuring the capillary blood glucose levels four times daily in both&#xD;
           groups of patients (fasting, before lunch, before supper, after supper)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To detect the number of post-transplant patients who - without any history of&#xD;
           pre-transplant diabetes - develop at least one episode of post-transplant hyperglycemia&#xD;
           (&gt; 140 mg/dl before supper)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To detect the average number of hyperglycemic episodes in post-transplant patients with&#xD;
           at least one episode of post-transplant hyperglycemia and without any history of&#xD;
           diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the amount of (long-acting) insulin (in IU) needed in order to obtain a target&#xD;
           capillary blood glucose level in the range of 110 mg/dl to 120 mg/dl before supper in&#xD;
           post-transplant patients with incidence of hyperglycemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety of long-acting insulin in controlling post-transplant hyperglycemia&#xD;
           (especially with regards to episodes of hypoglycemia (glucose-level &lt; 60 mg/dl)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the prevalence of post-transplant diabetes, as diagnosed by an abnormal oral&#xD;
           glucose tolerance on days 90, 180 and 360 after transplantation, in the group of&#xD;
           patients which has been treated with long-acting insulin, in comparison to patients who&#xD;
           received conventional treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the morbidity (hospitalization, infections, subsequent episodes of surgery,&#xD;
           requirement of non-immunosuppressive, non- blood glucose lowering medication) in the&#xD;
           group of patients with long-acting insulin for hyperglycemia, in comparison to patients&#xD;
           randomized into the group receiving conventional treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the renal outcome (creatinine levels, rejections) in the group of patients&#xD;
           which is foreseen to be treated with long-acting insulin for hyperglycemia, in&#xD;
           comparison to patients randomized into the group receiving conventional treatment&#xD;

      DESIGN / PHASE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, single-center, randomized, parallel group, controlled, phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PLANNED DURATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First patient First visit 1Q 2009 Last patient First visit 4Q 2009 Last patient Last visit 4Q&#xD;
      2010&#xD;
&#xD;
      CENTERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Medical University&#xD;
      of Vienna, Austria, Department of Surgery, Division of Transplantation, Medical University of&#xD;
      Vienna, Austria&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS / GROUPS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 patients in 2 groups 25 patients per group Randomization ratio 1:1, no stratification&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capillary blood glucose will be measured four times daily: before breakfast (7:30 am), before&#xD;
      lunch (12 pm), before supper (5:30 pm) and after supper (9 pm) in both groups by the nursing&#xD;
      personnel/academic investigators. In group No.1 (study arm A), patients will be treated with&#xD;
      long-acting insulin (Insulatard) as soon as the glucose-level before supper surpasses 140&#xD;
      mg/dl. The normoglycemic goal in this group will be from 110 to 120 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group No.2 (study arm B), the glucose levels will be recorded, but the treatment will be&#xD;
      left up to the ward, which is relying on conventional morning glucose measurements. For&#xD;
      safety, any glucose levels &gt;180 mg/dl will be reported, and all measures taken by the ward&#xD;
      will be recorded. As there are no available guidelines however concerning the so called&#xD;
      &quot;conventional&quot; blood glucose-lowering therapy in renal transplant patients, especially during&#xD;
      this very early post-transplant phase, the following suggestions will be brought to the&#xD;
      attention of the ward in order to standardize the treatment of the patients in study arm B:&#xD;
      1. Treatment in this group should be initiated if the fasting glucose level surpasses the&#xD;
      renal glucose threshold, i.e. 180 mg/dl. 2. As the proposed life-style modifications for the&#xD;
      treatment of NODAT1 are not feasible during this very early post-transplant phase, the basis&#xD;
      of the conventional therapy will be proposed to be sulfonyl urea drugs (i.e. Gliclazide -&#xD;
      Diamicron®, 30 mg, not more than three times daily). 3. Short-acting insulin will be strongly&#xD;
      recommended to be used for corrections of capillary blood glucose levels above 250 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EFFICACY ENDPOINTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - HbA1c levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  capillary blood glucose profile in patients treated with long-acting insulin and in the&#xD;
           control group, as evaluated by the daily measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of patients and overall number of days with hyperglycemia &gt; 140 mg/dl (in each&#xD;
           group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of patients and overall number of days with hyperglycemia &gt; 200 mg/dl (in each&#xD;
           group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of patients and overall number of days with hypoglycemia &lt; 60 mg/dl in each group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of patients with abnormal glucose tolerance on days 90, 180 and 360 after&#xD;
           transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      TOLERABILITY / SAFETY ENDPOINTS:&#xD;

&#xD;
      H0 Treatment of hyperglycemia &gt; 140 mg/dl before supper with long-acting insulin in renal&#xD;

      conventional treatment in reducing the HbA1c (measured on day 90 after transplantation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Treatment of hyperglycemia &gt; 140 mg/dl before supper with long-acting insulin in renal&#xD;
