  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is associated with significant cognitive and functional deficits. As patients&#xD;
      with schizophrenia grow older, the impact of these deficits at a personal and public health&#xD;
      level is likely to increase. Cognitive Behavioral and Social Skills Training (CBSST) is a&#xD;
      recently developed group therapy that increased the frequency of social activities among&#xD;
      middle-aged patients with schizophrenia. It also increased cognitive insight, a measure of&#xD;
      the ability to reduce confidence in aberrant beliefs. To date, CBSST has not been studied in&#xD;
      late-life schizophrenia. In addition, its impact on medications management, an instrumental&#xD;
      function that is particularly salient in late life, and its interactions with cognition are&#xD;
      largely unknown. Thus, we propose to study the efficacy of CBSST in improving social skills&#xD;
      and medications management in patients with late-life schizophrenia, and to study the&#xD;
      interactions between the patients' cognitive characteristics and their response to CBSST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies show that cognitive deficits are strong predictors of response to CBSST.&#xD;
      Cognitive Remediation Treatments (CRTs) have been shown to improve cognition in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia especially when combined with psychosocial interventions that focus on function&#xD;
      such as CBSST. Thus, we also propose to assess the tolerability and impact of CRT on patients&#xD;
      with late-life schizophrenia.&#xD;

      Eighty subjects will be randomized into 2 arms, CBSST Group and Treatment as Usual Group.&#xD;
      Both Arms will run for a total of 52 weeks. The CBSST Group will attend 2-hour weekly&#xD;
      sessions for 9 months and attend follow up assessments every 4 months. The Treatment as Usual&#xD;
      Group will continue with their normal psychiatric treatment as usual and also attend follow&#xD;
      up assessments every 4 months. After subjects in the Treatment as Usual Arm finish, they will&#xD;
      continue on to the CBSST Group arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of the CBSST Group Arm, 24 subjects who are willing to consent to CRT&#xD;
      will continue with an additional 2-hour weekly session of Cognitive Remediation Treatment for&#xD;
      8 weeks.&#xD;
