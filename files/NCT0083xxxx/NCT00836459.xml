  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults that increase their physical activity can improve their health, and reduce future&#xD;
      risks to health, but long-term changes are difficult to sustain. This study assesses whether&#xD;
      it is worth providing further support, 3 months after giving initial advice, to those who&#xD;
      have managed to do more physical activity. All participants will initially be given an&#xD;
      interactive DVD. A researcher from Sheffield Hallam University will provide two telephone&#xD;
      follow ups at one month intervals to assess physical activity levels. Only those that have&#xD;
      increased their physical activity at this point will remain in the study. These participants&#xD;
      will receive a &quot;mini booster&quot;, a &quot;full booster&quot; or no booster. The &quot;mini booster&quot; consists of&#xD;
      a two telephone calls one month apart to discuss physical activity and usage of the DVD. A&#xD;
      &quot;full booster&quot; consists of a face-to-face meeting with the facilitator at the same intervals.&#xD;
      The purpose of these booster sessions is to help the individual to maintain their increase in&#xD;
      physical activity. The investigators will measure the differences in physical activity,&#xD;
      quality of life and costs, associated with the booster interventions, 3 months and 9 months&#xD;
      from randomisation. The research will be carried out in 20 of the most deprived&#xD;
      neighbourhoods in Sheffield. These locations have large, ethnically diverse populations, high&#xD;
      levels of economic deprivation, low levels of physical activity, poorer health and shorter&#xD;
      life expectancy. Participants will be recruited through general practices and community&#xD;
      groups, as well as by postal invitation to ensure the participation of minority ethnic groups&#xD;
      and those with lower levels of literacy. Sheffield City Council and Primary Care Trust fund a&#xD;
      range of facilities and activities to promote physical activity and variations in access to&#xD;
      these between neighbourhoods will make it possible to examine whether the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the intervention is modified by access to community facilities.&#xD;
