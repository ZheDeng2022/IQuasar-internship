      1.1 To detect reproducible variations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels throughout the&#xD;
      course of one year in relationship to objectively measured levels of ultraviolet exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 To determine specific times within the year that would yield the most significant data&#xD;
      that could be focused on in future, larger studies examining whether there are protective&#xD;
      effects of serum vitamin D on the development of cutaneous melanoma&#xD;

      We will conduct a pilot study to investigate the ability to generate a dose-response curve of&#xD;
      serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D to incidental ultraviolet light exposure measured objectively with&#xD;
      a computerized personal ultraviolet light radiation dosimeter among 10 healthy volunteers in&#xD;
      New Mexico where the population is highly exposed to solar UV radiation. During the follow-up&#xD;
      period we will collect solar exposure data through a self-reported sun exposure diary, in&#xD;
      tandem with objective UV dosimeter data, and will collect blood samples for serum&#xD;
      measurements. We will carry out clinical measurements of serum vitamin D, parathyroid&#xD;
      hormone, and calcium and phosphorus ions. We will analyze the correlation between the vitamin&#xD;
      D and the recorded UV exposure in order to evaluate physiological changes due to solar&#xD;
      exposure. This pilot study is important for melanoma prevention as there is currently&#xD;
      confusion among the public as to how much sun is needed for vitamin D production and when too&#xD;
      much sun exposure will increase risk for developing melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits of this study to the participants include obtaining an objective measure of&#xD;
      daily ultraviolet exposure and vitamin D status and the possible need for supplementation.&#xD;
      Expected benefits to society include determining a dose-response of vitamin D to ultraviolet&#xD;
      light that will enhance our understanding of the balance between necessary and harmful&#xD;
      ultraviolet exposure. The results generated in this pilot study could provide a scientific&#xD;
      basis for designing a larger study to develop effective primary prevention against cutaneous&#xD;
      malignant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will investigate the ability to generate a dose-response curve of serum&#xD;
      25-hydroxyvitamin D to incidental ultraviolet light exposure measured objectively with a&#xD;
      computerized personal UVR dosimeter. The knowledge obtained will provide important pilot data&#xD;
      a larger NIH grant to estimate the risk-benefit of solar exposure and serum vitamin D in the&#xD;
      development and prevention of cutaneous melanoma.&#xD;

        2 participants with Hispanic ethnicity are represented as well. Darker-skinned individuals,&#xD;
        such as African Americans, produce considerably less vitamin D. Inclusion of African&#xD;
        Americans will be critical. Asians and African Americans do develop melanoma, but at a rate&#xD;
        ten times less than Caucasians and it does not appear to be related to sun exposure; thus,&#xD;
        to include them at this time would not allow us to focus on the medically-related issue.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Light-skinned volunteers (Caucasians including Hispanics with slightly darker&#xD;
             complexion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. 18 years of age (5 men and 5 women)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Resident in the State of New Mexico&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Indoor workers with no significant history of prolonged, excessive sun exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willing to have a monthly blood draw&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing to fill out the sun diary every day on different indoor/outdoor activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. During the project time period potential pregnancy of women volunteers would change&#xD;
             the risk category of the participants, and that is a reportable event to UNM HSC HRRC&#xD;
             and the Clinical Trial Office.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Further explanation of the inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        This pilot study is intended to evaluate the dose-response associations between measured UV&#xD;
        exposure and individual serum 25 (OH)-vitamin D levels. To date, there is little data and a&#xD;
        great deal of mis-information about vitamin D. Caucasians have a variety of skin types and&#xD;
        melanin production. This pilot study is unfunded and we know that there is extreme&#xD;
        heterogeneity among Caucasians in their absorption of UVB and subsequent synthesis of&#xD;
        vitamin D. Among our volunteers 2 participants with Hispanic ethnicity are represented as&#xD;
        well. Darker-skinned individuals, such as African Americans, produce considerably less&#xD;
        vitamin D, based on the bone health literature. Inclusion of African Americans will be&#xD;
        critical in the future as we develop our understanding of the relationship between vitamin&#xD;
        D and UV exposure. Our collaborator, Elizabeth Jacobs at the University of Arizona, is&#xD;
        currently conducting a pilot study to evaluate UV and serum vitamin D among individuals&#xD;
        with darker pigmentation. The motivation for our pilot study has to do with the balance&#xD;
        between vitamin D and sun exposure as a risk-benefit assessment for the development of&#xD;
        melanoma. Asians and African Americans do develop melanoma, but at a rate ten times less&#xD;
        than Caucasians and it does not appear to be related to sun exposure; thus, to include them&#xD;
        at this time would not allow us to focus on the medically-related issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diet high in oily fish (e.g. eating cod liver or sardines oil conserved products more&#xD;
             than 2-3 times/week)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Oral vitamin D supplementation (over 1,000 IU/day amount)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Tanning bed use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Existing pregnancy&#xD;
