    <textblock>
      This is a 17 week, randomized, single center, open-label, parallel-group study to compare&#xD;
      glucose excursions and other efficacy and safety parameters of repaglinide thrice daily or&#xD;
      metformin thrice daily in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes subjects in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility for participation will be determined by medical history, physical examination,&#xD;
      and laboratory results obtained during a screening visit (see trail population). About 60&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed (within 6 months) type 2 diabetes and both insulin and oral&#xD;
      antidiabetic drugs (OAD) naïve will be include in this study. All subjects will be given&#xD;
      informed consent before starting any examination and test. Then the 24h blood glucose of each&#xD;
      patient will be recorded by utilizing continue glucose monitor system (CGMS). Besides that,&#xD;
      the following data of all subject will be collected: HbA1c, Fasting blood glucose, 2h&#xD;
      postprandial blood glucose, fasting lipid profile, 2h postprandial lipid profile, fasting&#xD;
      uric acid, 2h postprandial uric acid, fasting insulin and proinsulin, 2h postprandial insulin&#xD;
      and proinsulin, fasting C peptide, 2h postprandial C peptide, fasting glucagon, 2h&#xD;
      postprandial glucagon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline data are collected, eligible subjects will be randomized into each group at a&#xD;
      2:1 ratio (40 for repaglinide and 20 for metformin). IVGTT and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic&#xD;
      clamp will be done to 20 patients in repaglinide group and 10 patients in metformin group&#xD;
      (less than 20% drop-off rate is acceptable for this study). Follow that, all patients will&#xD;
      start to receive either repaglinide thrice daily (immediately before breakfast lunch, and&#xD;
      dinner) or metformin thrice daily (after breakfast, lunch and dinner). The initial&#xD;
      repaglinide doses will be based on HbA1c levels on the day of randomization (0.5 mg tid for&#xD;
      HbA1c &lt; 8% and 1 mg tid for HbA1c ≥ 8%); the initial dosage for metformin will be 0.5 g tid&#xD;
      and this dosage will be kept until the end of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment diaries will be asked for every subject to record glucose levels (7 times per day&#xD;
      and 2 days per week for the first three weeks, then 7 times per day and 1 day per week until&#xD;
      the end of this study), diet and exercise, stress situation, hypoglycemic symptoms and so on.&#xD;
      All patients will be followed by visiting clinic every week for the first three weeks, but&#xD;
      only patients in repaglinide group will be titrated their doses. Dose adjustment should be&#xD;
      aimed at achieving the following glycemic targets: fasting blood glucose: 4.4 - 6.0 mmol/L,&#xD;
      2h post prandial glucose 4.4 - 8.0 mmol/L. If above glycaemic target has not been achieved,&#xD;
      repaglinide dose should be adjusted for every week (see Schematic diagram of trial design).&#xD;
      The adjustment of repaglinide doses is based on the mean of blood glucose recorded in subject&#xD;
      diaries. The doses of repaglinide before each meal may be different, depending on the&#xD;
      recorded blood glucose concentrations. After three weeks titration for repaglinide (maximal&#xD;
      dosage for repaglinide is 2 mg tid), the patients in this group will keep the optimal dosage&#xD;
      for the next 12 weeks. Clinic visit will be conducted every four weeks after the period of&#xD;
      dosages titration to collect information, such as hypoglycemia, adverse events and fasting&#xD;
      blood glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complicated examinations will be repeated again after above 12 weeks treatments for both&#xD;
      groups, including physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), CGMS, fasting and 2h post&#xD;
      prandial glucose, concentration of insulin, proinsulin, C peptide, glucagon, uric acid and so&#xD;
      on. IVGTT and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp will be repeated only for subjects who did&#xD;
      that at the beginning of study. Data will be collected and analyzed.&#xD;
