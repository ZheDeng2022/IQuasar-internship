  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VTI had established other clinical protocols to study the effects of ELAD® plus standard&#xD;
      therapy compared with standard therapy alone in patients with acute on chronic (AOCH)&#xD;
      (VTI-201, VTI-206) and fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) (VTI-202) and acute alcoholic&#xD;
      hepatitis (AAH). However, liver failure (LF) patients who do not qualify for other protocols&#xD;
      may benefit from ELAD use. In order to accommodate physician requests for the use of ELAD in&#xD;
      LF patients who do not qualify for open Protocols, without the need to resort to individual&#xD;
      Emergency Use INDs for each case, VTI has developed a Treatment Protocol with Cost Recovery&#xD;
      to provide for expanded access to ELAD for those with LF. This uncontrolled Treatment&#xD;
      Protocol has been designed to provide expanded access to ELAD in subjects with LF while&#xD;
      assuring that sufficient data are collected to adequately monitor ELAD safety when used in&#xD;
      this setting at multiple centers in the United States.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      ELAD® therapy is designed to provide continuous liver support to a subject with compromised&#xD;
      liver function, allowing time for the subject's native liver to regenerate to a healthy&#xD;
      state, or to stabilize the subject until a suitable donor organ can be found for&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
