      High-dose dobutamine/atropine stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (DS-MRI) has been&#xD;
      incorporated in daily clinical practice for the detection of ischemic heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, wall motion abnormalities (WMA) during stress, precede the development of ST-segment&#xD;
      depression on ECG and of anginal symptoms and aid in the detection of anatomically&#xD;
      significant coronary artery disease (CAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DS-MRI offers the possibility to integrate myocardial perfusion and wall motion analysis in a&#xD;
      single examination. In this regard, recent data suggest that the assessment of myocardial&#xD;
      wall motion and perfusion during a single session may enhance the sensitivity of the&#xD;
      technique for the diagnosis of CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, to date limited data is available on the prognostic value of high-dose DS-MRI in&#xD;
      large patient cohorts, treated according to current guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of long-term outcome of DS-MRI is important because this test may identify both&#xD;
      high-risk patients, who would benefit from invasive diagnostic and therapy, and lower-risk&#xD;
      patients in whom additional procedures and intensive medical follow-up are not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study we aim to determine the value of wall motion and perfusion assessment&#xD;
      during high-dose dobutamine/atropine MRI in predicting cardiac events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the incremental value of the MR-stress testing results was assessed (inducible&#xD;
      wall motion, perfusion abnormalities and the combination of both) after the consideration of&#xD;
      traditional clinical risk factors and baseline ejection fraction.&#xD;

      Background: High-dose dobutamine stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (DS-MRI) is&#xD;
      incorporated in daily clinical practice for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD).&#xD;
      Purpose: To determine the value of wall motion and perfusion assessment during DS-MRI for the&#xD;
      prediction of cardiac events in a large patient cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular MR-Examination. Patients are examined in a clinical 1.5-T whole-body&#xD;
      MR-scanner Achieva system (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) using a 5-element&#xD;
      cardiac phased-array receiver coil. Cardiovascular MR-images were acquired at rest and during&#xD;
      a standardized high-dose dobutamine/atropine protocol involving short breath holds, and using&#xD;
      a vector electrocardiogram for R-wave triggering11. Electrocardiographic rhythm and symptoms&#xD;
      were monitored continuously, and blood pressure was measured every 3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Data. Personnel unaware of the stress testing results contacts each subject or an&#xD;
      immediate family member and the date of this contact was used for calculating the follow-up&#xD;
      time duration. Outcome data iscollected from a standardized questionnaire and determined from&#xD;
      patient interviews at the outpatient clinic or by telephone interviews. Reported clinical&#xD;
      events are confirmed by review of the corresponding medical records in our electronic&#xD;
      Hospital Information System (HIS), contact with the general practitioner, referring&#xD;
      cardiologist or the treating hospital. Cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction are&#xD;
      registered as major cardiac events. Cardiac death is defined as death from any cardiac cause&#xD;
      (lethal arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure) or sudden unexpected&#xD;
      death occurring without another explanation. Myocardial infarction is defined by angina of&#xD;
      &gt;30 minutes duration and either ST segment elevation of ≥2mm in 2 consecutive ECG leads or a&#xD;
      rise in troponin T of ≥0.03µg/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other events include clinically indicated coronary arterial revascularization by percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary angioplasty (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of 2 simultaneous cardiac events, the worst event was selected (cardiac&#xD;
      death&gt;non-fatal myocardial infarction&gt;revascularization).&#xD;
