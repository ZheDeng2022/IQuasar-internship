    <textblock>
      Seizures are a frequent cause of morbidity in the pediatric age group. Uncontrolled seizures&#xD;
      pose a variety of risks to children, including higher rates of mortality, developmental delay&#xD;
      and/or regression, and cognitive impairment. The ketogenic diet is a well known treatment&#xD;
      option for refractory epilepsy. However it is very restrictive and requires strict weighing&#xD;
      of foods. The modified Atkins diet is a dietary therapy for intractable childhood epilepsy&#xD;
      that was designed to be a less restrictive alternative to the traditional ketogenic diet.&#xD;
      Early studies have demonstrated efficacy and safety.There are no randomized trials evaluating&#xD;
      the efficacy of the modified Atkins diet in children with refractory epilepsy. Hence this&#xD;
      study has been planned to investigate whether there are clear benefits in terms of seizure&#xD;
      control in children with refractory epilepsy who are treated with the modified Atkins diet,&#xD;
      versus controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several severe catastrophic epilepsies present in childhood, including severe infantile&#xD;
      myoclonic epilepsy, Lennox Gastaut syndrome and myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (Doose syndrome).&#xD;
      Seizures in these disorders are difficult to control; sometimes only at the expense of&#xD;
      multiple and toxic levels of antiepileptic medications.Epilepsy surgery is feasible only in a&#xD;
      very small number, also the costs are prohibitively high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uncontrolled seizures pose a variety of risks to children, including higher rates of&#xD;
      mortality, developmental delay and/or regression, and cognitive impairment. Thus effective&#xD;
      treatment to control seizures is fundamental to improving overall outcome in childhood&#xD;
      epilepsy. The shortcomings of antiepileptic drug therapy and epilepsy surgery have made the&#xD;
      need for alternative treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ketogenic diet is one of the oldest available treatments for epilepsy. It is a medically&#xD;
      supervised high fat, low carbohydrate, and restricted protein diet that maintains a chronic&#xD;
      state of ketosis while providing proteins and calories for adequate growth. The ketogenic&#xD;
      diet compares favourably with the newer antiepileptic drugs (AED's) which have been developed&#xD;
      for the treatment epilepsy in children Studies on the newer antiepileptic drugs such as&#xD;
      vigabatrin, lamotrigine, tiagabine and gabapentin indicate that only 3% to 10% of all&#xD;
      intractable patients achieve complete relief of seizures with the introduction of these newer&#xD;
      drugs. Whereas with the ketogenic diet, 33% of patients with intractable epilepsy have more&#xD;
      than 50% reduction in seizures and 15-20% become seizure free.Also, many of the children who&#xD;
      are maintained on the diet are able to have their antiepileptic drugs decreased or withdrawn.&#xD;
      This leads to improvement in alertness, behaviour and cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional ketogenic diet, with 4:1 ratio of fat: carbohydrate + protein has its&#xD;
      drawbacks. It restricts calories and fluids, and requires weighing of foods. Protein is&#xD;
      generally restricted to 1 g/kg/day, with the majority of remaining calories in the form of&#xD;
      fat. This may lead to hypoproteinemia and growth problems. Hospitalization is generally&#xD;
      advocated for diet initiation, both for fasting and non-fasting initiation. Side effects of&#xD;
      the diet include kidney stones, constipation, acidosis, diminished growth, weight loss, and&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modified Atkins diet is a nonpharmacologic therapy for intractable childhood epilepsy&#xD;
      that was designed to be a less restrictive alternative to the traditional ketogenic diet.&#xD;
      This diet is started on an outpatient basis without a fast, allows unlimited protein and fat,&#xD;
      and does not restrict calories or fluids. Early studies have demonstrated efficacy and&#xD;
      safety.13-20 However these studies have been uncontrolled, and have enrolled small numbers of&#xD;
      patients. There are no randomized control trials evaluating the efficacy of the modified&#xD;
      Atkins diet in children and adults with refractory epilepsy. Hence this study has been was&#xD;
      planned to investigate whether there are clear benefits in terms of seizure control in&#xD;
      children with refractory epilepsy who are treated with the modified Atkins diet, versus&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible children will be randomized using computer generated random number tables in two&#xD;
      groups: the intervention and the control arm. Both groups will undergo a baseline 4-week&#xD;
      observation period, during which parents will be asked to maintain a daily seizure activity&#xD;
      log; recording seizure type, duration and frequency. In the intervention arm, the children&#xD;
      will start the modified Atkins diet after this 4-week baseline period. The control group will&#xD;
      receive their normal diet with no dietetic input, and remain on the same on-going&#xD;
      antiepileptic medication for the 3 months. Anti-epileptic medications will remain unchanged&#xD;
      during the 3 month trial period in both groups, unless the change in AED regimen is medically&#xD;
      indicated; e.g. drug side effects or status epilepticus; in which case standard therapy will&#xD;
      be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be reviewed as outpatients at 1, 2 and 3 months. Urinary ketones will be&#xD;
      checked at each hospital visit. A 3-day dietary intake chart will be reviewed at each visit&#xD;
      to compute calorie and carbohydrate intake, and reinforce compliance. Weight will be checked&#xD;
      at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seizure frequencies will be recorded daily for the 4-week baseline period and the 3 month&#xD;
      study period. At the end of the 3 month study period, the number of seizures in the preceding&#xD;
      28 days will be used to calculate the mean seizure number, which will be expressed as a&#xD;
      percentage of the mean baseline number of daily seizures (ie, the number of seizures during&#xD;
      the 4 weeks before the child started either the diet or the control phase of the study).No&#xD;
      changes will be made to the child's antiepileptic medication during the 4-week baseline or&#xD;
      the 3-month study periods, unless medically indicated; e.g. drug side effects, or status&#xD;
      epilepticus; in which case standard therapy will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability of the diet and its side effects will be evaluated by means of parental&#xD;
      interview at each visit: vomiting, lethargy, poor appetite, refusal to feed and constipation.&#xD;
      Any other parental concerns or parental reports of side effects will also be noted.&#xD;
