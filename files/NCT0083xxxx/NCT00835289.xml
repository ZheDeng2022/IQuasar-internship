      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently the fourth leading cause of death&#xD;
      in the United States. Unlike the other leading causes of death, no medical therapies&#xD;
      currently available improve the course of disease or affect survival in COPD. Recent&#xD;
      investigations suggest that endothelial dysfunction and chronic inflammation is fundamental&#xD;
      to COPD. Fish oil intake improves endothelial dysfunction and lowers levels of inflammatory&#xD;
      intermediaries which may be important in the development of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Fish Oil (COD-Fish) Pilot Trial will enroll 40-45&#xD;
      participants with COPD. These participants will be randomized to receive omega-3&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation (PUFA) or placebo (containing corn oil). All&#xD;
      participants will perform a number of noninvasive tests (including flow-mediated dilation&#xD;
      (FMD) and pulmonary function testing) at study entry as well as every two months for a total&#xD;
      of six months. Thirty participants who agree to it will undergo a separate procedure to&#xD;
      collect cells from inside a forearm vein for analysis to be compared to 30 controls. The main&#xD;
      purpose of this trial is to examine the effect of PUFA on endothelial function as measured by&#xD;
      change in FMD in patients with COPD. We hypothesize that in subjects with COPD, treatment&#xD;
      with PUFA will increase FMD.&#xD;

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is abbreviated as COPD and includes both emphysema and&#xD;
      chronic bronchitis. COPD is currently the fourth leading cause of death in the United States.&#xD;
      Unlike most major medical diseases, the morbidity and mortality from COPD continue to rise in&#xD;
      the US. In 2000, over 10 million Americans carried a physician diagnosis of COPD and 120,000&#xD;
      Americans died from this disease. Additionally, from the year 1980 to the year 2000, the&#xD;
      number of cases of COPD among women nearly doubled and the prevalence among African Americans&#xD;
      increased by 61%. Unlike the other leading causes of death, no medical therapies currently&#xD;
      available improve the course of disease or affect survival in COPD. Current therapies for&#xD;
      COPD that improve survival in COPD are limited to smoking cessation, oxygen therapy, and&#xD;
      possibly surgery. Medical therapies such as inhalers and pills improve symptoms and reduce&#xD;
      COPD exacerbations (&quot;attacks&quot;), but have not been shown to slow down the progression of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent investigations suggest that endothelial dysfunction and chronic inflammation is&#xD;
      fundamental to COPD. Fish oil intake improves endothelial dysfunction and lowers levels of&#xD;
      inflammatory intermediaries. These inflammatory intermediaries can be measured in the blood&#xD;
      and are potentially important in the development of COPD. Large observational studies&#xD;
      demonstrate that participants who eat high amounts of fish oil develop less COPD and have&#xD;
      lower levels of these inflammatory intermediaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Fish Oil (COD-Fish) Pilot Trial will enroll 40-45&#xD;
      participants with COPD. These participants will be randomized to receive Omax3[TM] or placebo&#xD;
      (containing corn oil). Omax3[TM] (Cenestra Health) is a 1 gram softgel capsule containing&#xD;
      94.5% omega-3 fatty acids. Each participant will be taking 3 capsules of either Omax3[TM] or&#xD;
      matching placebo. The investigators and the subjects will be blinded, meaning that neither&#xD;
      the investigators nor the subjects will know if they are taking Omax3[TM] or placebo. All&#xD;
      participants will perform a number of noninvasive tests at study entry as well as every two&#xD;
      months for a total of six months. They will also undergo pulmonary function testing,&#xD;
      flow-mediated dilation (FMD), peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT), six minute-walk tests&#xD;
      (6MWT), blood drawing and answer questionnaire data. Thirty participants who agree to it will&#xD;
      undergo a separate procedure to collect cells from inside a forearm vein for analysis to be&#xD;
      compared to 30 controls. The main purpose of this trial is to examine the effect of Omax3[TM]&#xD;
      on endothelial function as measured by change in FMD in patients with COPD. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that in subjects with COPD, treatment with Omax3[TM] will increase FMD.&#xD;
