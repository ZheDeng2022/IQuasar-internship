      Purpose: This is a non-masked study with a primary endpoint of in vitro basophil activation&#xD;
      by the allergen D. farinae, comparing basophil activation before and after seven days of&#xD;
      supplementation. Secondary endpoints will include circulating antioxidant levels (tocopherols&#xD;
      and metabolites), in vitro basophil activation to IgG anti-IgE and to&#xD;
      N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (f-met-leu-phe), and monocyte and basophil&#xD;
      responsiveness to in vitro endotoxin challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Twenty allergic asthmatic volunteers Procedures (methods): Volunteers will be&#xD;
      given 1200 mg of a gamma tocopherol enriched supplement, a commercially available supplement&#xD;
      form of vitamin E. Study participants will undergo assessment of general health, lung&#xD;
      function assessment, symptom scoring, and epicutaneous skin test to allergens at baseline and&#xD;
      after supplementation. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and after 7 days of&#xD;
      gamma-T treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Oxidant stress plays an important role in mucosal inflammation such as seen with asthma.&#xD;
      Previous studies have also shown that asthmatic individuals tend to have lower endogenous&#xD;
      levels of antioxidant such as vitamins E and C, and that supplementing antioxidants can&#xD;
      decrease exacerbations associated with ozone exposure in children. We are interested in&#xD;
      future studies to examine the benefits of gamma-tocopherol supplementation for people with&#xD;
      allergic asthma. This current study will determine if gamma tocopherol supplementation&#xD;
      reduces allergic responses in vitro, providing us information that will allow us to design&#xD;
      future masked placebo-controlled studies of this potentially important antioxidant on in vivo&#xD;
      allergic responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to address the question if in vivo gamma-tocopherol&#xD;
      supplementation at 1200 mg daily blunts allergen-specific inflammatory responses in vitro.&#xD;
      Members of our group have previously shown that administration of 100 mg/kg of gamma&#xD;
      tocopherol daily for four days prior to Ova challenge in sensitized allergic brown Norway&#xD;
      rats prevented eosinophil infiltration into the airways1. In addition, this dose of gamma&#xD;
      tocopherol blunted production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IFN-gamma in the nasal airway; and PGE2,&#xD;
      LTB4 and cysteinyl leukotrienes by the pulmonary airway. Mucous cell metaplasia was decreased&#xD;
      as well in the gamma Tocopherol treatment group 1. In an in vivo study of gamma tocopherol&#xD;
      performed at our center (IRB# 05-CEMALB-1407), we found that daily administration of 2&#xD;
      capsules of a gamma tocopherol rich preparation (each capsule containing 623 mg of gamma&#xD;
      tocopherol, 61.1 mg of d-alpha-tocopherol, and 11.1 mg of d-beta tocopherol), was able to&#xD;
      increase serum levels of gamma tocopherol to 18.6 + 2.6 uM after 8 days of daily&#xD;
      administration; serum levels of alpha tocopherol were 25.2 + 2.4 uM, and delta-tocopherol&#xD;
      were 5.1 + 1.1 uM2 . Using the data from the in vivo study, we performed basophil activation&#xD;
      tests on dust mite allergic subjects, pretreating blood obtained from venipuncture with&#xD;
      pharmacologic doses attained in the vivo study with gT, aT, gCEHC, and aCEHC. We found that&#xD;
      gT, gCEHC, and aCEHC blunted basophil activation induced by the allergen D. farinae, as&#xD;
      measured by upregulation of CD63 on the cell surface of basophils. As secondary aims, we will&#xD;
      also examine the effect of gamma tocopherol supplementation on non-allergic stimuli that have&#xD;
      been shown to activate basophils, such as IgG anti-IgE and&#xD;
      N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (f-met-leu-phe), as well as in vivo allergen-specific&#xD;
      responsiveness through epicutaneous skin testing before and after supplementation.&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses will include assessing the effect of gamma tocopherol supplementation on&#xD;
      monocyte and basophil responsiveness to in vitro endotoxin and lipoteichoic acid challenge.&#xD;
