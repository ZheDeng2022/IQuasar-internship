      The purpose of this study is to test a new monitoring technology that uses the sound of a&#xD;
      depressed person's speech to assess the severity of depression symptoms. The Vocal Social&#xD;
      Signals Platform (VSSP) is software that analyzes the non-verbal characteristics of a&#xD;
      person's speech. This study will test this software to see if it could be a useful&#xD;
      measurement tool for assessing depression symptoms. Participation in this study requires&#xD;
      coming to the research headquarters twice over a three-month period. The first visit is to&#xD;
      determine eligibility. Throughout the study, participants will be connected to a telephone&#xD;
      system five times, on which they will answer questions about their depression symptoms. After&#xD;
      answering questions, their voice will be recorded using a structured speech sample that the&#xD;
      participant will read out loud. The participant will also give an unstructured speech sample,&#xD;
      which will involve describing a typical day or the last movie s/he saw. The voice samples&#xD;
      will be analyzed and compared to the results of the depression symptom questionnaires.&#xD;

      We will conduct a 24-month study that will include the test-retest reliability, criterion&#xD;
      validity and sensitivity to change measurements of a novel monitoring technology that might&#xD;
      provide an objective measure to monitor depression symptoms. There will be no randomization&#xD;
      to control and experimental groups as this is a reliability/validity study of a measurement&#xD;
      tool. In order to evaluate this technological measure for its psychometric properties, we&#xD;
      will recruit 60 subjects recently diagnosed with depression. We will recruit only recently&#xD;
      diagnosed patients to maximize the likelihood of the person improving their depressive&#xD;
      severity during our study. Even though subjects will be referred by their clinicians as&#xD;
      depressed patients we will use CES-D or Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale&#xD;
      to to confirm depressive symptoms in these patients. CES-D and not PHQ-9 will be the&#xD;
      screener. We will also recruit 20 non-depressed subjects (who will also be screened by the&#xD;
      CES-D). This is done to validate the ability of the VSSP to discriminate between&#xD;
      non-depressed individuals and individuals presenting with depressive symptomatology. The&#xD;
      subjects with depression will be recruited from the Boston Medical Center's (BMC) Psychiatry&#xD;
      Clinic as well as BMC's two primary care practices. The non-depressed individuals will be&#xD;
      recruited by posting ads in Boston Metropolitan area daily newspapers. We will administer the&#xD;
      combined TLC-VSSP to these subjects 5 times over a three month period. This means that&#xD;
      subjects will receive TLC-PHQ-9 during the 5-time encounters with the study. The time&#xD;
      interval between the five evaluation sessions will be 1, 3, 4, and 4 weeks respectively. The&#xD;
      first two data collection points will include test-retest reliability of TLC-PHQ9 and VSSP.&#xD;
      The third, fourth and fifth data collection points will include follow-up assessments to&#xD;
      detect change. In addition, the first and last data collections will include an evaluation of&#xD;
      the criterion validity of VSS through an administration of the Inventory of Depressive&#xD;
      Symptomatology (IDS) by a human professional (Validity). The first and last data collections&#xD;
      will also be used to assess the ability of VSSP, TLC-PHQ9 and their combination to detect&#xD;
      change in the severity of depression (as measured by the IDS). The first and last evaluations&#xD;
      will be conducted in the research headquarters while the intermediate evaluations will occur&#xD;
      over the telephone. The IDS interviews will be tape-recorded and conducted by a researcher.&#xD;
      Another researcher will listen to a sample of the tapes throughout the study to assess the&#xD;
      interviewer¿s fidelity to the IDS clinician administration protocol for each of the 30 items&#xD;
      and score the questionnaire independently of the interviewer. In addition, subjects will&#xD;
      provide both ¿structured¿ and ¿unstructured¿ voice samples in random order at each assessment&#xD;
      point. Baseline Visit 2 Visit 3 Visit 4 Visit 5 (telephone) (telephone) (telephone) Week 0&#xD;
      Week 1 Week 4 Week 8 Week 12 We designed the study with 5 data collection points in order to&#xD;
      observe change in symptom severity levels at intermediate points before the final assessment&#xD;
      at visit 5. We expect the majority of patients to be in some type of treatment, either&#xD;
      receiving an antidepressant medication regimen or some form of therapy or both (we will not&#xD;
      be concerned with the specific type of treatment). It is reported that approximately 60% of&#xD;
      patients on antidepressant medications respond to treatment. Thus, we anticipate certain&#xD;
      improvement in depressive symptoms among a substantial proportion of subjects who are taking&#xD;
      antidepressants. We are also aware that some of the subjects who are being treated by&#xD;
      antidepressants may experience side-effects. We estimate that approximately 15% of patients&#xD;
      on antidepressants might discontinue treatment due to significant side-effects and lack of&#xD;
      efficacy. In addition, some subjects may not be completely adherent to their medication&#xD;
      and/or therapy regimens for a variety of reasons. These factors will make it possible to&#xD;
      explore changes in symptom severity in two different directions of improvement and&#xD;
      deterioration. We will collect information on these events (being on treatment, stopping&#xD;
      treatment, non-adherence or under adherence to mediation taking, missing therapy sessions,&#xD;
      etc.) by providing the subjects with a diary and asking them to write all treatment related&#xD;
      events in that diary. The diary will include specific questions about possible events in&#xD;
      treatment regimens.&#xD;
