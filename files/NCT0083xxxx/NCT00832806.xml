  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to provide you with an effective treatment for reducing the&#xD;
      physical and emotional stress that can occur during the early phase of being without&#xD;
      cigarettes. It is our hope that this treatment will help you to stay smoke-free. You will&#xD;
      receive counseling and a supply of Champix, a medication to help suppress the symptoms of&#xD;
      nicotine withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To assess the effect of extended Integrated Voice Response (IVR) on smoking&#xD;
      cessation after varenicline (Champix) and IVR treatment Hypothesis: There will be significant&#xD;
      increase in participants who do not smoke at 1 year if extended IVR is used after 12 weeks of&#xD;
      varenicline (Champix) and IVR treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The automated IVR uses algorithms and sophisticated speech recognition (computerized) to&#xD;
      engage smokers on the telephone; gather information, provide reinforcing messages and triage&#xD;
      them to a study nurse for call-back within 2 working days if either the smoker or nurse&#xD;
      identify help is required. The technology recognizes the smoker's verbal responses, documents&#xD;
      them and thereby assists in guiding further follow-up. IVR is a low-cost, high-yield way of&#xD;
      contacting smokers when they would not ordinarily be contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When prospective subjects call to register, a voice message will ask them to leave their&#xD;
      name, telephone number, and register their choice of session date they would like to attend&#xD;
      (the telephone message will list the 3 choices of session dates - as outlined on the poster).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session is a combined Information, Screening, and Recruitment session, which will be&#xD;
      held once a week at St. Paul's Hospital (for a period of 3 weeks). The sessions will begin&#xD;
      with a presentation by the participating physician, and will be group-based. The sessions&#xD;
      will include information about smoking, smoking cessation, varenicline (Champix), eligibility&#xD;
      for the study, and the relevance of the questionnaire about demographics, motivation, stress,&#xD;
      and smoking, and the consent form (see questionnaire attachment). (The consent forms will be&#xD;
      distributed to the group so they may view them while their relevance is discussed). Potential&#xD;
      subjects will be given an information package including the Canadian Cancer Society booklets&#xD;
      &quot;For Smokers Who Don't Want to Quit&quot; and &quot;For Smokers Who Want To Quit&quot; (see booklet&#xD;
      attachments in 9.8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will then be asked to read the consent form. If they think they meet the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria and are interested in proceeding they will meet with the&#xD;
      physician in private (in a conference room across the hall) after the session. The physician&#xD;
      will determine their eligibility (as per inclusion and exclusion criteria). A Healthy Heart&#xD;
      volunteer will then witness their signing of the consent form. They will be asked to sign a&#xD;
      second consent form that will be marked &quot;copy&quot; and given to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no time limit to sign the consent form. If potential subjects would like to make an&#xD;
      appointment with the study nurse to come in to sign the consent at a future date, they may do&#xD;
      so. In this situation, the following study procedures would be completed at this later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures If subjects meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study, they will be asked to complete the questionnaire (20 minutes): the&#xD;
      Stage of Change algorithm will determine stage or readiness for change, pros' and con's of&#xD;
      change will be assessed using the Decisional Balance Scale, smoking self-efficiency will be&#xD;
      measured using the Self-Efficacy and Temptation Scale, and psychological distress will be&#xD;
      measured using the Stop-D Scale (see questionnaire attachment in 9.1). The answers to the&#xD;
      questionnaire provide information about the phenotype - who responds to varenicline (Champix)&#xD;
      and IVR treatment and who does not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' weight and waist circumference will be measured and recorded. They will choose a&#xD;
      target quit date at this time. It will be between 8 and 14 days after starting varenicline&#xD;
      (Champix). Subjects will give their quit date, preferred calling time, and telephone number&#xD;
      for the IVR technology (see vital signs and IVR attachment in 9.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then receive a 12-week supply of varenicline (Champix). The study nurse will&#xD;
      hand it to them. They will be instructed to take 0.5 mg on days 1-3, 0.5 mg twice a day (once&#xD;
      in the morning and once in the evening, at about the same time each day) on days 4-7, and 1&#xD;
      mg twice a day until the end of their supply (the end of week 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will also be given a 12-month diary calendar and asked to record the number of&#xD;
      cigarettes smoked on the corresponding dates (see diary attachment in 9.1). They will be&#xD;
      asked to bring this diary calendar in to the final visit at week 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Integrated Voice Response (IVR) will make a call on the quit date, day 3, 8, and 11, and&#xD;
      then every 2 weeks. The IVR is a sophisticated, computerized, voice response technology that&#xD;
      tracks subjects' progress using a detailed series of questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any response suggests the subject is having trouble remaining smoke-free or if they have&#xD;
      started smoking again, a study nurse will call to help get the subject back on track and not&#xD;
      smoking. This smoking cessation counseling will include assessment of whether the subject is&#xD;
      taking varenicline (Champix) in the prescribed dosage, whether they are experiencing any&#xD;
      adverse effects, the number of cigarettes and time of day they are smoking, triggers for&#xD;
      smoking, and assistance to develop coping mechanisms to reduce these triggers. If the subject&#xD;
      is not experiencing any adverse effects they will be advised to continue taking varenicline&#xD;
      (Champix). If they are still smoking, they will be advised to try not to increase the number&#xD;
      of cigarettes smoked per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 12th week of treatment, all subjects who have quit smoking will come in for a brief&#xD;
      (15 minutes) appointment. An exhaled carbon monoxide level will be measured and recorded by&#xD;
      the study nurse to assess smoking status. Lung / breath carbon monoxide measurements (CO)&#xD;
      will be made using a Roxon Micro Smokerlyzer; CO should be 0 - 10 ppm. in a non-smoker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have quit smoking (usually about 44% of those who receive Champix and 15% of&#xD;
      those who receive IVR) will be equally randomized into 2 groups matched by level of&#xD;
      motivation (a score of 7 or higher - question #30, pg. 5 of questionnaire) and level of&#xD;
      addiction (a score of 7 or higher - question #17 - #24, pg. 3 - 4 of questionnaire).&#xD;
      Randomization will be done by manual calculation of these two scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will continue to receive IVR support every 2 weeks for 9 months (weeks&#xD;
      13 - 52) and the control group will no longer receive IVR support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are still smoking, identified by the IVR system, and not eligible for&#xD;
      randomization, do not need to attend the visit after week 12. They will continue in the study&#xD;
      and return for the final visit at week 52 with their diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 52, all subjects will come in for a final appointment (approximately 35 minutes) and&#xD;
      complete the same questionnaire administered at the initial baseline visit. Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to bring their diary. Weight and waist circumference will be measured and recorded by&#xD;
      the study nurse. For those Subjects who have stopped smoking, a final exhaled carbon monoxide&#xD;
      level will be measured and recorded by the study nurse to assess smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a total of 3 clinical visits for participants (initial baseline visit, 12 week&#xD;
      visit, and 52 week visit) who have stopped smoking by week 12. There will be a total of 2&#xD;
      clinical visits for those who have not stopped smoking by week 12 (initial baseline visit and&#xD;
      52 week visit). There will be approximately 27 telephone contacts for the intervention group&#xD;
      and 9 telephone contacts for the control group. Each telephone call is approximately 3 - 5&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group (extended IVR) will be asked to dedicate 7 hours and the control group&#xD;
      (not receiving extended IVR) will be asked to dedicate 3 hours to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be reimbursed $10.00 for parking expenses at the final visit, week 52. Other&#xD;
      expenses such as time away from work, etc. will not be reimbursed.&#xD;
