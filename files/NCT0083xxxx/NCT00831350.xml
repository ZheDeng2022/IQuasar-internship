  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of subjects with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) specifically looking at the&#xD;
      difference in outcomes between patients with posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and those&#xD;
      without PVD. Posterior vitreous detachment is a condition where the gel-like substance that&#xD;
      occupies the space between the retina and the lens of the eye liquefies and separates from&#xD;
      the retina. 20 subjects from Barnes Retina Institute will be enrolled in this study. Based on&#xD;
      a pre-treatment ultrasound (a test utilizing high-frequency sound waves to look at the inside&#xD;
      of the eye), high resolution OCT (a noninvasive procedure called optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      to check the thickness of your retina) and clinical exam, subjects will be assigned to one of&#xD;
      2 groups at baseline: Group 1 will be those with PVD and Group 2 will be those without PVD.&#xD;
      Then subjects will receive monthly intravitreal (inside the eye) injections of Ranibizumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several retinovascular diseases have been shown to be VEGF dependent including retinal vein&#xD;
      occlusion, wet age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. The role of the&#xD;
      vitreous or composition of the vitreous cavity has been examined in diabetic retinopathy on&#xD;
      many occasions in the past and clinically it has been felt that a posterior vitreous&#xD;
      separation leads a quieting and involution of diabetic retinopathy, both proliferative as&#xD;
      well as pre-proliferative retinopathy. This clinical observation has never had any basic&#xD;
      science data to support it. However, it has recently been shown that in cat eyes with&#xD;
      posterior vitreous separation the vitreous cavity has a much lower VEGF concentration than in&#xD;
      cat eyes with an attached posterior vitreous. This may be due to the fact that flow of oxygen&#xD;
      from the retinal vasculature is increased by PVD. Vitreous oxygen levels are inversely&#xD;
      associated with vitreous VEGF levels. As oxygen tension increases, VEGF levels will decline.&#xD;
      This suggests if higher amounts of VEGF are present in the eye without PVD perhaps a powerful&#xD;
      anti-VEGF drug, such as ranibizumab, may be of greater benefit to treat VEGF dependent&#xD;
      retinovascular disease. To try and answer this question clinically, we have suggested that an&#xD;
      analysis of the vitreous status in treatment naive eyes with retinal vein occlusion beginning&#xD;
      ranibizumab therapy be undertaken to see if eyes without a posterior vitreous separation&#xD;
      would achieve greater improvement in vision and a return to more normal retinal physiology&#xD;
      compared to eyes with a posterior vitreous separation. No study has assessed PVDs in RVO&#xD;
      patients receiving potential treatment.&#xD;
