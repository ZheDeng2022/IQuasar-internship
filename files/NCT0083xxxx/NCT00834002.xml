      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a patient's white blood cells (dendritic cells) and a specific&#xD;
      leukemia antigen (Wilms tumor antigen-1) may induce an effective immune response to kill&#xD;
      residual leukemic cells and/or prevent leukemia relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the feasibility, safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      intradermal mRNA-transfected dendritic cell vaccination therapy in patients with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autologous dendritic cell (DC) vaccination is a promising strategy for adjuvant cancer&#xD;
      therapy in the setting of minimal residual disease (MRD). We performed a phase I/II trial in&#xD;
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) where patients received intradermal injections of&#xD;
      autologous DC loaded with mRNA coding for the Wilms' tumor protein (WT1). WT1 is highly&#xD;
      overexpressed in leukemia and the level of WT1 RNA in peripheral blood is a useful biomarker&#xD;
      for molecular diagnosis en follow-up in the MRD setting. We want to prospectively monitor WT1&#xD;
      RNA expression in the peripheral blood of vaccinated and non-vaccinated AML patients in order&#xD;
      to evaluate its predictive value as a biomarker for relapse and to assess the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of DC vaccination in acute myeloid leukemia patients. We believe, on the basis of&#xD;
      already available evidence, that the use of WT1 both as a target for immunotherapy as well as&#xD;
      a biomarker not holds promise to assess the efficacy of new experimental therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions such as DC vaccination.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Tumor type: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) according to the WHO criteria (ea at least&#xD;
             20% blasts in the marrow). All FAB subtypes except M3. Patients with Myelodysplastic&#xD;
             Syndrome, category of Refractory Anemia with Excess Blasts (RAEB): RAEB I (WHO:&#xD;
             medullary blast count ≤ 10% and a peripheral blast count ≤ 5%) and RAEB II (WHO:&#xD;
             medullary blast count &gt; 10% and/or &gt; 5% peripheral blasts) can be included in the&#xD;
             study in absence of other non-experimental treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Extent of disease: remission (partial or complete) or smouldering course. Complete&#xD;
             remission (CR) is defined as no blasts in the peripheral blood and no more than 5%&#xD;
             blasts in the bone marrow. This definition is related to the hematological remission&#xD;
             if it is not specified. Partial remission (PR) is defined as a decrease of at least&#xD;
             50% in the percentage of blasts to 5 to 25% in the bone marrow aspirate. Smouldering&#xD;
             course is defined as a relatively low marrow blast count and slowly progressive&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Overexpression of WT1 RNA (&gt;50 copies of WT1 per 1000 copies ABL in bone marrow or &gt;2&#xD;
             copy/1000 copies ABL in peripheral blood) as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR at the&#xD;
             time of presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior treatments : Patients must have received at least one prior antileukemic&#xD;
             chemotherapeutic regimen and must be more than 1 month past the last treatment and/or&#xD;
             6 months past allogeneic/autologous stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age: ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. High risk of relapse because of (and/or)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age &gt; 60 years (if &lt;60 y, no sibling allotransplant donor available)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Poor risk cytogenetic or molecular markers at presentation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hyperleukocytosis at presentation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Second complete remission after relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Performance status: WHO PS grade 0-1 (Appendix B)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Objectively assessable parameters of life expectancy: more than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Prior and concomitant associated diseases allowed with the exception of underlying&#xD;
             autoimmune disease and positive serology for HIV/HBV/HCV&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. No concomitant use of immunosuppressive drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Adequate renal and liver function, i.e. creatinin and bilirubin = 1.2 times the upper&#xD;
             limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition&#xD;
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those&#xD;
             conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Women of child-bearing potential should use adequate contraception prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with concurrent additional malignancy (with exception of Non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancers and carcinoma in situ of the cervix)&#xD;
