  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      intravenous MN-221 compared to placebo when administered as an adjunct to standard therapy in&#xD;
      subjects experiencing an acute exacerbation of asthma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center ED&#xD;
      study. Each subject will receive MN-221 or placebo administered through a continuous&#xD;
      intravenous infusion in addition to the standardized treatment for an acute exacerbation of&#xD;
      asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon presentation to the ED for assessment and treatment for an acute exacerbation of asthma&#xD;
      the patient should receive standard of care consistent with the international guidelines&#xD;
      (e.g., Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA] or the National Asthma Education and Prevention&#xD;
      Program [NAEPP]) and required, in part, by this protocol prior to screening procedures being&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to any study specific treatment or evaluation being performed a subject must have&#xD;
      signed an IRB/EC/REB approved consent form. Once the subject has received the initial&#xD;
      treatment regimen the subject will be assessed for response to the treatment including&#xD;
      spirometry.If the subject meets all entry criteria the subject will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      MN-221 or placebo. Throughout the screening process the subject will continue to receive&#xD;
      standardized treatment consistent with the appropriate guidelines for the treatment of acute&#xD;
      exacerbations of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in the study will receive an intravenous 1-hour infusion of MN-221 study&#xD;
      drug or placebo. Subjects receiving MN-221 will be administered a total dose of 1200 μg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study treatment period, the subject may continue to receive standardized treatment&#xD;
      and be assessed. The study treatment period will be approximately 3 hours in length. Safety&#xD;
      and efficacy will be monitored throughout the treatment period. PK parameters (if applicable)&#xD;
      will be obtained from subjects at selected study sites. A blood sample for genomic evaluation&#xD;
      will be collected during the treatment period (at participating sites) if the subject&#xD;
      consents to the evaluation. An initial 24-hour post-randomization follow-up visit will be&#xD;
      completed to evaluate the subject's health status as well as for safety and PK parameters (if&#xD;
      applicable). A second follow-up contact will be completed by telephone seven days&#xD;
      post-randomization for safety purposes and to evaluate the subject's health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A periodic risk/benefit evaluation will be performed by the study's Data Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Board.&#xD;

             Investigator's clinical judgment, a single positive result is explained by exposure to&#xD;
