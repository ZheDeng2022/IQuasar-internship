  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common chronic illnesses in children,&#xD;
      with recent data suggesting that 1 to 4 in 1000 Canadian children and youth cope with the&#xD;
      condition. Many JIA children will enter adulthood with permanent joint damage5. In parallel,&#xD;
      a significant number are affected by deficits of muscle function. In addition to the impact&#xD;
      on physical function, muscles play an important role in maintaining joint health. The overall&#xD;
      aim of this proposal is to evaluate a novel therapeutic intervention - whole body vibration&#xD;
      (WBV) - for its ability to improve muscle function and the biomechanics of lower extremity&#xD;
      joints in JIA in order to prevent joint degeneration.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project aims to evaluate the effect of a therapy called whole body vibration (WBV) on&#xD;
      muscle function and joint biomechanics in children and adolescents suffering from juvenile&#xD;
      idiopathic arthritis (JIA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      JIA is the most common chronic form of arthritis in children and affects at least 1 in 1000&#xD;
      Canadian children and youth. Current data suggests that a large number of children suffering&#xD;
      from JIA will encounter permanent joint damage, to which direct effects of inflammation are&#xD;
      an important contributor. Nevertheless, recent research has also shown that impaired muscle&#xD;
      function and a subsequent alteration of joint loading might by itself induce joint damage.&#xD;
      Fifty percent of JIA patients have significant impairments of muscle function and this is&#xD;
      often present in patients who do not have active arthritis anymore. In addition to optimum&#xD;
      medical treatment of the disease, it is therefore important to improve muscle function in&#xD;
      order to protect the joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WBV therapy might be an interesting technique to achieve this in JIA patients. It is able to&#xD;
      improve muscle function very efficiently with relatively short training times and at the same&#xD;
      time confers loads to the lower limbs which are only 30% of body weight. The WBV device&#xD;
      consists of a plate going up and down along a fulcrum at a high frequency. The patient stands&#xD;
      on the WBV device and the vibration will induce muscle stretch reflexes producing muscle&#xD;
      contractions. These muscle contractions are similar to muscle activity during exercise and&#xD;
      are not perceived as painful or unpleasant. The technique has been used in children with&#xD;
      several conditions impairing muscle function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary question to be investigated in the proposed study is whether WBV therapy will&#xD;
      significantly improve muscle function in JIA patients. In addition, the effect of an&#xD;
      improvement in muscle function on gait and the loading of individual joints at the lower&#xD;
      extremity will be examined. Finally the effect of WBV therapy on quality of life will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose conducting a controlled trial investigation. This implies, that one group of study&#xD;
      participants, called the intervention group, will do the WBV therapy, whereas a second group,&#xD;
      called the control group, will just follow their daily habitual activities. All participants&#xD;
      will have an initial assessment of muscle function, electrical muscle activity and joint&#xD;
      biomechanics by completely painless measurement techniques at the Children's Hospital of&#xD;
      Eastern Ontario (CHEO) and a nearby Human Motion Biomechanics lab at the University of&#xD;
      Ottawa. In addition, an MRI of the lower legs without contrast media will be done to confirm&#xD;
      the absence of joint effusions as well as bone or muscle edema. Quality of life will be&#xD;
      assessed by a standard questionnaire that has been validated in JIA. Subsequently, study&#xD;
      participants in the intervention group as well as their parents will be introduced to the&#xD;
      therapy during two separate sessions at the CHEO. They will then take a WBV device home and&#xD;
      perform 6 minutes of training on 5 days a week for 3 months. Each month, they will return to&#xD;
      CHEO for assessment of muscle function and demonstration of training technique. At the end of&#xD;
      the 3 month period, both intervention and control group patients will repeat the initial set&#xD;
      of assessments including MRI. After another 3 month period, all participants will return for&#xD;
      a final assessment of muscle function and joint biomechanics but not MRI to document&#xD;
      persistence of any change observed.&#xD;
