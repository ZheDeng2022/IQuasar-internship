  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory arthritis (IA) is a major cause of long-term disability. Due to specialist&#xD;
      shortages, failure of primary care providers and individuals to recognize the disease, and&#xD;
      lack of awareness of the importance of early intervention, delays to rheumatologic care are&#xD;
      common. Peer support models have been used for various health issues and may be one method to&#xD;
      assist individuals with early IA to manage their disease and cope with stress. Qualitative&#xD;
      research methods (focus groups) will seek out feedback on a peer support approach and explore&#xD;
      the learning needs (informational needs, educational preferences) and opinions about&#xD;
      emotional and appraisal support of individuals living with IA, from the perspectives of&#xD;
      patients. The data will be analyzed and expressed themes (articulated needs and&#xD;
      understandings of interviewee context) will guide the future development of a peer support&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

      RESEARCH PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      ____________________________________________________________________&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploring the Learning Needs of Individuals with Inflammatory Arthritis from the Perspectives&#xD;
      of Patients, Family Members and Friends, and Health Care Providers: Patient Perspectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      _____________________________________________________________________&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rheumatic diseases are a chronic, lifelong illness that results in significant pain,&#xD;
      disability, and morbidity in the Canadian population (Perruccio, Power &amp; Badley, 2006).&#xD;
      Focusing on one aspect of rheumatic diseases, inflammatory arthritis has been associated not&#xD;
      only with the aforementioned concerns, but also with an increased burden of care that affects&#xD;
      not only patients, but extends its impact to include their family members, friends, and&#xD;
      caregivers. Inflammatory arthritis is also associated with significant increases to&#xD;
      healthcare budgets (Hunsche, Chancellor &amp; Bruce, 2001). Care and management of these diseases&#xD;
      are expected to be in high demand as the burden of illness is estimated to be on the rise&#xD;
      (Perruccio, Power &amp; Badley, 2006). The number of primary care providers and specialists is&#xD;
      not sufficient to meet this anticipated increase, (Beaulieu et al., 2004; Glazier et al.,&#xD;
      2003) and patients dealing with chronic diseases are increasingly required to self-manage&#xD;
      their disease. This can be a stressful and daunting process for a newly diagnosed patient and&#xD;
      may result in delayed decision-making and ultimately, delays in their disease treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While physician care is undeniably important in the management of inflammatory arthritis,&#xD;
      educating patients with the knowledge and skills to self-manage their disease can be helpful&#xD;
      with decision-making processes and reducing healthcare burden. For example, Lorig et al&#xD;
      (2001) demonstrated that individuals who were better able to self-manage their illness&#xD;
      experienced a significant improvement in health behaviours, self-efficacy, and health status,&#xD;
      and had fewer visits to emergency departments. By equipping patients with strategies to cope&#xD;
      and enhance personal health, they take on a more active role in the management of their&#xD;
      disease and are able to take on health promoting activities with little supervision from&#xD;
      healthcare professionals (Keysor et al., 2003). In fact, patient education in self-management&#xD;
      has been identified as an arthritis best-practice and a key clinical practice guideline and&#xD;
      (Combe et al., 2007; Holbrook, 2000; Jordan et al., 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient education can take many forms, but peer support interventions have been particularly&#xD;
      effective in helping patients manage chronic diseases, including HIV, alcoholism and&#xD;
      diabetes. Likewise, we hope to examine the benefits, challenges, and impact peer support can&#xD;
      have on individuals living with inflammatory arthritis. A peer is someone who shares a common&#xD;
      characteristic, such as age, gender, social economic status, education, religion, or in this&#xD;
      case, status of disease (Doull et al., 2005). Peers have experiential knowledge of rheumatic&#xD;
      disease, its management and care, and the social implications it has had in their lives.&#xD;
      Within a healthcare context, they can provide assistance to individuals living with arthritis&#xD;
      by providing support to their emotional, appraisal, and informational needs. Peers have the&#xD;
      potential to influence health outcomes of other patients by addressing feelings of isolation&#xD;
      and loneliness, promoting positive outlook and motivation, and providing information about&#xD;
      behaviors that encourage health and well-being (Dennis, 2003). They can augment the services&#xD;
      provided by healthcare professionals and can help individuals with inflammatory arthritis&#xD;
      better cope and manage their illness. While peer support groups have been used to address&#xD;
      many chronic diseases, their implementation amongst individuals with inflammatory arthritis&#xD;
      has been limited. The effectiveness of such a program is dependent on the educational&#xD;
      preferences and learning needs of its participants and this is a topic that requires&#xD;
      examination and further assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project addresses one subcomponent of a larger study in which the overall purpose is to&#xD;
      explore the learning needs (informational needs, emotional needs, and appraisal needs) and&#xD;
      the educational preferences of individuals with inflammatory arthritis. The impact of formal&#xD;
      or informal peer support on individuals with rheumatic disease and the improvement of their&#xD;
      health and well-being will also be examined with an emphasis on peer support from the&#xD;
      perspective of patients living with the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will focus on soliciting perspectives of patients with inflammatory arthritis.&#xD;
      To better understand the learning needs and potential impact of peer support strategies,&#xD;
      including the context, circumstances, and processes involved in making peer support an&#xD;
      effective intervention. This project, in particular, will examine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the perspective of individuals with inflammatory arthritis regarding disease management&#xD;
           and educational needs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  what they feel are their emotional, informational, appraisal needs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  what specific feedback they are seeking related to peer support&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whether and how these needs change over the progression and duration of the disease&#xD;
           course&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative examination of the aforementioned objectives will be carried out using focus&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible study participants will be divided into three focus groups of 6-8 participants each&#xD;
      based on their disease duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0-6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Over 6 months - 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 - 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each focus group will be comprised of individuals with inflammatory disease of mixed age and&#xD;
      gender. Focus group sessions will be held over several weeks and at a time convenient to the&#xD;
      participants. This will be done in order to avoid conflicts with work and shift schedules.&#xD;
      Informed, written consent will also be obtained from potential participants (Appendix 1 -&#xD;
      Information Sheet and Appendix 2 - Consent Form).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two second-year medical student co-investigators and/or the study coordinator from the&#xD;
      University of Toronto will be present at each focus group session. A semi-structured&#xD;
      interview guide will be used (Appendix 3 - Interview Guide) with probes to prompt further&#xD;
      discussion when appropriate. One medical student will conduct the focus group while the&#xD;
      second student or study coordinator will keep a speaker log and take notes throughout the&#xD;
      session. Each participant will be assigned a number and a record will be kept of the first&#xD;
      phrase of each speaker. The speaker log will be used to aid in the analysis (i.e. to clarify&#xD;
      if the view was expressed by a number of people or one person many times). During focus group&#xD;
      discussions, only the first name of each participant will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus group sessions will run approximately 1 ½ - 2 hours in duration. After every session,&#xD;
      each medical student/study coordinator will create field notes in which they will&#xD;
      independently record their thoughts and impressions of the interview, non-verbal&#xD;
      communication, and other conversations not recorded before or after the meeting. Each focus&#xD;
      group session will also be recorded using a digital audio recorder and will be transcribed in&#xD;
      whole or in part. Transcribed names will be removed, instead being replaced by their assigned&#xD;
      speaker numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential focus group participants will have to meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis from a physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be able to participate in a 1 ½- 2 hour focus group session&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be aged 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be English-speaking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be able to get to the focus group session&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Consent Potential research participants will be identified through the&#xD;
      Rheumatology clinics at the Sunnybrook Health Science Centre (SHSC). They will be approached&#xD;
      by Dr. Mary Bell (Principal Investigator), staff Rheumatologist, who will introduce the study&#xD;
      to eligible individuals and obtain their verbal consent to be contacted by the medical&#xD;
      student co-investigator assigned to the project. The name of the individual will then be&#xD;
      forwarded to the Office Manager who will schedule an interview at the Rheumatology clinic. At&#xD;
      the interview, medical students will go over an information letter on the study and a consent&#xD;
      form with each eligible patient to ensure that the potential research participant understands&#xD;
      the study and what he/she is being asked to do. Once written consent is obtained, a copy will&#xD;
      be provided to the participant. A confirmation letter (Appendix 4 - Confirmation Letter to&#xD;
      Research Participants) with time and location of the interview/focus group will be mailed to&#xD;
      the participant. The day before the interview is scheduled to take place the medical student&#xD;
      will telephone the individual to remind them of the time and location of the interview using&#xD;
      a Telephone Script (Appendix 5 - Telephone Script to Confirm Interview). At the beginning of&#xD;
      the interview, prior to asking any questions, the medical student will obtain written consent&#xD;
      and answer any further questions the participants may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcripts will be analyzed using content analysis in order to systematically make&#xD;
      inferences from text. Interview data will be imported into a NVIV0 8 qualitative software&#xD;
      package and analyzed using a constant comparative method by the two research team members who&#xD;
      were present at the focus group discussions. Medical students will be trained in qualitative&#xD;
      content analysis. Interview data will be categorized into themes by each team member&#xD;
      independently using an iterative coding scheme developed by the team. To ensure consistency&#xD;
      in coding, the research team members who completed the focus group will frequently meet with&#xD;
      the Principle Investigator and study coordinator to ensure consistency in coding and to&#xD;
      verify the credibility of the codes. New codes will be added as themes arise from the data&#xD;
      analysis. The individuals who conducted the focus group will independently code transcripts&#xD;
      and subsequently meet compare results of the coding and agree upon their understanding of&#xD;
      themes that emerged. By doing this cross-referencing, the rigor of the study will be&#xD;
      increased. Modifications will be made to the interview guide with subsequent interviews to&#xD;
      include new questions or probes that came up with prior focus group discussions. Field notes&#xD;
      will also be used to inform the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS AND BENEFITS&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no known risks that may be associated with this study. Participants may become&#xD;
      upset or emotional during the focus group session because the nature of the discussions will&#xD;
      require open, honest sharing. The research team will make available a list of support groups&#xD;
      and help-lines and reinforce that care of participants will not be affected in any way should&#xD;
      an individual decide to withdraw from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These group discussions will benefit participants as they share and discover other&#xD;
      individuals who can relate to their disease experiences. Individuals with arthritis in&#xD;
      Ontario may indirectly benefit in the event that this research helps develop a peer support&#xD;
      intervention for individuals with inflammatory arthritis that may be implemented as part of&#xD;
      the patient care process. The results of this study may help validate the importance of&#xD;
      support based on experiential knowledge in decision-making, health promotion, and education&#xD;
      and may encourage the implementation of peer support groups among individuals living with&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only the Principal Investigator, Office Manager and the medical students/study coordinator&#xD;
      who conduct the focus group sessions will be aware of the identity of participants. All data&#xD;
      collection forms will have identifying information removed and replaced with a unique&#xD;
      identifying number. A list of participant names, addresses, and phone numbers will be kept on&#xD;
      a password protected computer on a secure server in a locked research room at the&#xD;
      rheumatology clinic at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre to be accessed only by the Principle&#xD;
      Investigator and research team involved in this study. Names or other identifying information&#xD;
      will not be used in any publications, reports, or presentations and will not be passed on to&#xD;
      anyone else outside of the research team for this study. All information collected during the&#xD;
      focus group sessions will be kept confidential. Hard copies of data and will be locked in a&#xD;
      research room at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre for storage for 25 years before being&#xD;
      destroyed. All electronic data files (i.e., audiofiles, transcripts) will be stored on a&#xD;
      password protected computer on a secure server in a locked office at the Sunnybrook Health&#xD;
      Sciences Centre rheumatology clinic. A confidentiality agreement will be signed by the study&#xD;
      coordinator and all second year medical students involved with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMMUNICATION OF RESULTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of reporting study results, a written report will be created and sent to any&#xD;
      participants involved in the study upon their request. A copy will also be submitted to the&#xD;
      University of Toronto DOCH-2 Course Coordinator and the results of this study may also be&#xD;
      shared with scientific publications, conferences, and presentations.&#xD;
