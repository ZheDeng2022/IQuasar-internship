      The central question in this research proposal is: can a popular technique that specifically&#xD;
      targets active mastery and improved affect regulation, yoga, which is utilized by&#xD;
      approximately 4% of the US population each year (1), improve the constellation of PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms, multiple somatic complaints, social and occupational impairment and high health&#xD;
      care utilization that has been documented in hundreds of thousands of women in the US?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Aims of this study include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the short-term and long-term effectiveness of 10 weeks of yoga for treating&#xD;
           treatment-resistant PTSD and compare it with attention controls receiving Women's Health&#xD;
           Education (WHE).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the short-term and long-term effects of yoga on a) co-morbid conditions, b)&#xD;
           quality of life, c) body awareness, d) health care utilization and e) heart rate&#xD;
           variability (HRV), in comparison to an attention control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has demonstrated a close association between trauma exposure and 1) PTSD, anxiety &amp;&#xD;
      depression, 2) loss of affect regulation, 3) poor quality of life, and 4) high health care&#xD;
      utilization (2, 3). This study will explore how a popular body-mind technique, yoga, compares&#xD;
      with a attentional control group condition, Women's Health Education (WHE), in the treatment&#xD;
      of [heretofore treatment- unresponsive adults with] PTSD, and measure whether yoga can affect&#xD;
      &quot;the attitudes and beliefs&quot; that &quot;can reduce psychological stress and contribute to positive&#xD;
      health outcomes.&quot; [The study of yoga for chronic PTSD is in line with the empirical research&#xD;
      that supports the notion that autonomic dysregulation plays a significant role in the&#xD;
      persistence of PTSD (4), and with the hypothesis that an increased capacity for&#xD;
      self-regulation is associated with a decrease in the severity of this symptom constellation].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the short-term and long-term effectiveness of 10 weeks of yoga for treating&#xD;
           treatment-resistant PTSD and compare it with attention controls receiving Women's Health&#xD;
           Education (WHE).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the short-term and long-term effects of yoga on a) co-morbid conditions, b)&#xD;
           quality of life, c) body awareness, d) health care utilization and e) heart rate&#xD;
           variability (HRV), in comparison to an attention control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants in the yoga condition will demonstrate a clinically significant reduction&#xD;
           in PTSD symptoms at post-treatment, defined as a mean reduction of total CAPS score of&#xD;
           at least 30% compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Yoga will be more effective than attention control at improving PTSD symptoms as&#xD;
           evidenced by a significantly greater drop in total CAPS score from pre-treatment to&#xD;
           post-treatment for the yoga group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Yoga will be more effective at improving comorbid conditions and quality of life and&#xD;
           reducing health care utilization than attention control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Yoga will be more effective than attention control at improving HRV and body awareness.]&#xD;
