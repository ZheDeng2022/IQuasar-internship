  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether sclerotherapy using a 25% dextrose and 1%&#xD;
      lidocaine solution is an efficacious treatment for patients with chronic Achilles&#xD;
      tendinopathy who have failed a home based, heavy load eccentric training program.&#xD;

      The purpose of this research project is to optimize the clinical outcome of patients with&#xD;
      Achilles tendinopathy. Patients who fail a standardized physical therapy regiment (eccentric&#xD;
      training protocol) will be randomly allocated into two groups with one group receiving an&#xD;
      injection of hypertonic glucose and Lidocaine (sclerosing solution) and the other receiving&#xD;
      an injection of Lidocaine (control). Neovascularisation (growth of new blood vessels and&#xD;
      nerves into a damaged area of the tendon) appears to be associated with pain and subsequently&#xD;
      a decrease in function and use of the affected tendon. Results of an observational study in&#xD;
      Sweden revealed that in all patients for which eccentric training was unsuccessful&#xD;
      neovascularisation was present. Sclerosis of neovessels appears to be successful in removing&#xD;
      the pain associated with Achilles tendinopathy in both mid-portion and enthesitis patients.&#xD;
      However, there are no studies that have administered this technique to a homogenous patient&#xD;
      population in a prospective, controlled and randomized manner. In addition, there are no&#xD;
      studies that have compared the effects of eccentric training in healthy individuals versus&#xD;
      patients with painful Achilles tendinopathy in a controlled longitudinal study. It is&#xD;
      expected that patients for whom eccentric training is unsuccessful and who subsequently&#xD;
      receive sclerosing therapy will show a statistically significant improvement in pain and&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adults 18 years of age and older with a minimum of 3 months of clinically determinant&#xD;
             history and symptoms (pain) consistent with unilateral Achilles tendinopathy&#xD;
             (enthesitis or mid-portion) as diagnosed by a sport medicine physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants are not required to have tried other treatments, however, those who have&#xD;
             tried other treatments (except injection treatments) including, but not restricted to,&#xD;
             oral NSAIDs, topical NSAIDs, shoe modifications, and physical/athletic therapy will&#xD;
             not be restricted from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provide informed consent for the controlled longitudinal study and RCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with physical ailments precluding them from performing the eccentric&#xD;
             training program&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Worker's Compensation Board (WCB) and elite athletes (varsity, national and&#xD;
             professional level).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals younger than 18 years of age will be excluded from this trial due to the&#xD;
             complicating factors of musculoskeletal immaturity and the lack of relevant research&#xD;
             of Achilles tendinopathy and neovascular bundles in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous Achilles tendon rupture of the tendon in question&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals that have received any type of injection in or around the Achilles tendon&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to dextrose based sclerosing agent or other contraindications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to Lidocaine&#xD;
