    <textblock>
      This is a study in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). We will use muscle&#xD;
      ultrasound as a tool to try and see if there are changes in muscle size that can find out how&#xD;
      fast ALS is progressing. This might give us a better way to carry out further studies on new&#xD;
      drugs to see if they might help slow the progression of ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study will have muscle ultrasound performed on a few muscles in the arms&#xD;
      and legs at the first visit, and again 3 months later, and one last time 3 months after that.&#xD;
      This takes about 10 minutes, is painless, and involves scanning the muscle with a handheld&#xD;
      device, with some gel applied to the skin. At each visit, there will also be a questionnaire&#xD;
      about symptoms and strength testing.&#xD;

      Protocol for the Study - Muscle Ultrasound: A New Tool for Measuring Progression in ALS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Specific Aims The authors propose to study the change in muscle mass over time in patients&#xD;
      with ALS. Muscle atrophy is a very common feature of the disease, and in clinical experience&#xD;
      correlates with progressing weakness. As such, it is a qualitative marker of disease&#xD;
      progress, although this lacks a quantitative marker. Muscle ultrasound is a safe,&#xD;
      noninvasive, and rapid method of measuring muscle volume or thickness (1). Recently Arts, et&#xD;
      al published an assessment of muscle ultrasound, specifically including reduced muscle depth&#xD;
      and increased ultrasound echogenicity (2). We believe determining quantitatively the rate of&#xD;
      progression of muscle mass in a group of patients with ALS will lead to a clinically useful&#xD;
      tool to serve as a marker of disease progression, which may be useful in clinical trials for&#xD;
      new therapies for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Background and Significance ALS is a quickly progressive disease that results in skeletal&#xD;
      muscle weakness, including ventilatory weakness, which is the ultimate cause of death for the&#xD;
      vast majority of patients with ALS. Median survival from diagnosis is less than 3 years.&#xD;
      There is only one drug approved to treat ALS, riluzole, and its effects to limit the&#xD;
      progression of the illness are slight (6). Current study designs often use a primary endpoint&#xD;
      of either death from ALS or initiation of long-term mechanical ventilation (LTMV). There are&#xD;
      other tools to assess progression, which can include a questionnaire called the ALS&#xD;
      functional rating scale (ALS-FRS), a direct measurement of strength, or an electromyography&#xD;
      technique called motor unit number estimate (MUNE). Each has potential drawbacks, which&#xD;
      include potential lack of objectivity in questionnaire and variable effort when assessing&#xD;
      direct strength measurements. There has also been work to correlate magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy findings to progression in ALS, with some positive results (3). However, this&#xD;
      technology is expensive, time consuming, and not widely available. Muscle ultrasound may be&#xD;
      sensitive enough to quantitatively detect changes in muscle thickness (4), which may serve as&#xD;
      an objective tool to measure disease progression, for the purpose of clinical trials. Muscle&#xD;
      echointensity (EI) is also abnormal in ALS (2, 4), although this assessment is less reliable&#xD;
      among different observers and ultrasound settings, resulting in less diagnostic precision.&#xD;
      Normal values for muscle thickness and echointensity are available, with norms varying by age&#xD;
      and weight (5). Muscle ultrasound is readily available, noninvasive, inexpensive, and could&#xD;
      be used in the context of a clinical examination. Muscle ultrasound is painless and can be&#xD;
      completed in a few minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report As this is a pilot study, there is no preliminary data&#xD;
      using muscle ultrasound longitudinally in patients with ALS. The study by Arts et al used&#xD;
      muscle ultrasound to assist in the ALS diagnosis, but to our knowledge, muscle ultrasound has&#xD;
      not been used to detect longitudinal changes in the illness. This study will help in the&#xD;
      development of future studies testing pharmacologic agents in ALS, by providing muscle&#xD;
      ultrasound as a validated endpoint in the progression of ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Research Design and Methods Ten patients will be recruited to participate, and will have&#xD;
      serial muscle ultrasound examinations every three months, at regularly scheduled clinic&#xD;
      appointments in the Vanderbilt ALS clinic. Muscles examined will include forearm flexors,&#xD;
      biceps, and tibialis anterior. The thickness of each muscle will be measured at standard&#xD;
      sites for these muscles, in addition to the echogenicity as measured by a grayscale histogram&#xD;
      representation. The rate of loss of ultrasound-measured muscle thickness will be assessed&#xD;
      over time. Our hypothesis is that there will be significant loss of muscle thickness over&#xD;
      time, which will correlate with disease severity. As different patients have different rates&#xD;
      of deterioration, there will likely be significant differences in the rate of muscle volume&#xD;
      loss from patient to patient. A secondary endpoint will be an increase over time in muscle&#xD;
      echogenicity. Patients will complete the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), a 12 item&#xD;
      subjective scale that assesses several motor functions, including function of speech,&#xD;
      swallowing, respiration, and activities of daily living. Grip strength will be measured by&#xD;
      hand grip dynamometry, using the best result from 3 attempts in each limb. Secondary analyses&#xD;
      will also be conducted to correlate the decrease in ultrasound-measure muscle depth with the&#xD;
      ALS Functional-Rating Scale, and with measures from hand grip dynamometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted over a period of 8 months. All patient data will be kept in a&#xD;
      password-secured online database called REDcap. Any adverse events will be reported to the&#xD;
      IRB, as none are expected with this safe diagnostic modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients must meet the El Escorial criterion for definite or probable ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients forced vital capacity (FVC) must exceed 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) and other forms of motor neuron disorders&#xD;
           will not participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with severe weakness from ALS who require continuous mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
           who have a forced vital capacity less than 50%, or who have no clinically measurable&#xD;
           strength in the arms and legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients without cognitive capacity to give informed consent. This is not a clinical&#xD;
           feature of ALS, and therefore such patients would have an alternate diagnosis that would&#xD;
           prevent such capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. Privacy/Confidentiality This is minimized by using study numbers, and labeling all patient&#xD;
      data with study numbers and no other identifying information. The medical record numbers that&#xD;
      correspond to each study number will be stored only in REDcap, a secure, password-protected&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. Human Subjects Research/Risks Careful consideration will be given to the protection of&#xD;
      subjects from research risks and to the appropriate inclusion of women and minorities in the&#xD;
      subjects who will be studied. Research risks are substantially limited by the noninvasive&#xD;
      nature of muscle ultrasound, and the absence of any pharmacologic intervention in the study.&#xD;
      There is a theoretical risk of breach of confidentiality, which is minimized as noted in the&#xD;
      section above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Reporting of Adverse Events/Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to Participants or&#xD;
      Others The PI will report to the IRB in the event of an adverse event involving any&#xD;
      participant, study personnel, or others, either from procedures involved in the study, or in&#xD;
      the event of breach of participant confidentiality. These risks are minimized as noted above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      J. Statistical Considerations As this is a pilot study, this is not powered to likely find a&#xD;
      statistically significant difference. Nonetheless, a mixed effect model statistical&#xD;
      evaluation of the changes in muscle ultrasound values will be carried out for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      K. Follow-up and Record Retention At the conclusion of the study, the study data will be&#xD;
      maintained electronically only, in secure, encrypted format by the PI on REDcap for 6 years.&#xD;
      After that time, any data not submitted to the patient's StarPanel electronic record will be&#xD;
      destroyed.&#xD;
