  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To describe the response of etanercept after adalimumab has failed to produce a satisfactory&#xD;
      response in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. A total of 10 patients with moderate to&#xD;
      severe psoriasis who are currently using adalimumab for at least 12 weeks but have a PGA of&#xD;
      mild or worse will be transitioned to etanercept 50 mg twice weekly (BIW) for 12 wks followed&#xD;
      by a dose reduction to 50mg once weekly (OW) for an additional 12 weeks.&#xD;
