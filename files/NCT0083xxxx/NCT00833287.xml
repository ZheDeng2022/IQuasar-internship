      Patient who have major traumatic injury are at risk to develop postoperative inflammatory&#xD;
      complications such as pneumonia and lung trouble called adult respiratory distress syndrome&#xD;
      (ARDS). This study will draw blood from trauma patients are several time points after their&#xD;
      injury to see if we can predict who is at greatest risk for developing pneumonia or ARDS&#xD;
      based upon the results of these immune lab tests. We are particularly interested to see if&#xD;
      this will be useful in obese patients who have a greater risk of these post trauma&#xD;
      complications&#xD;

      The role of inflammation in disease is increasingly appreciated in clinical medicine. Too&#xD;
      much or too long a course of inflammation can lead to serious and sometime fatal&#xD;
      complications for patients who experience significant physical trauma, particularly those&#xD;
      whose injuries are serious enough to warrant intensive care follow up. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      sheer stress of the traumatic injury can leave patients deficient in their ability to mount a&#xD;
      protective immune/inflammatory response leaving them susceptible to concomitant infection.&#xD;
      Another component to the conundrum is that after the trauma (first hit), the surgeons are&#xD;
      faced with the dilemma of complete surgical repair of the injury - the second hit (i.e. full&#xD;
      orthopedic repairs) vs stabilization of the injury until the patient recovers from the shock&#xD;
      of the first hit. The difficulty for the medical team is predicting who can safely tolerate a&#xD;
      full second hit (total surgical restoration) vs who needs to be further stabilized before&#xD;
      further intervention. In the obese individual, this conundrum is compounded by the known&#xD;
      immune/inflammatory alterations characteristic of the obese state. How these patients in&#xD;
      particular can be safely triaged for immediate vs delayed definitive therapy based upon&#xD;
      specific immune/inflammatory parameters is the object of this initial pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese individuals who experience severe traumatic injury will develop immunoregulatory&#xD;
      dysfunction shortly after injury that is greater than nonobese individuals experiencing&#xD;
      similar traumatic injury. Depending upon severity and duration of this immunoregulatory&#xD;
      dysfunction, the post injury inflammatory responses will also be altered resulting in&#xD;
      increased risk for pneumonia and/or adult respiratory distress syndrome, major morbidities&#xD;
      associated with trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine immunoregulatory and inflammatory blood cytokine and endocrine stress hormone&#xD;
           profiles in adult patients with significant traumatic injury correlated with subsequent&#xD;
           development of pneumonia and/or adult respiratory distress syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the role of obesity in the initial immunoregulatory dysfunction and subsequent&#xD;
           short term clinical course of trauma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate whether demographic differences (age, gender, race) impact the risk for&#xD;
           immunoregulatory and/or inflammatory dysfunction as well as risk for pneumonia and/or&#xD;
           adult respiratory distress syndrome in obese s non obese trauma patients.&#xD;
