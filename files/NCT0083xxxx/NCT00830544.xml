      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pathological CR rate in breast and lymph nodes&#xD;
      of a novel neoadjuvant regimen for invasive breast carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been used for years to treat patients with breast cancer whose&#xD;
      primary tumors are too large to allow for breast conservation surgery [1]. Reduction in size&#xD;
      of the primary tumor with neoadjuvant chemotherapy has made possible the use of lumpectomies&#xD;
      instead of mastectomies in a large fraction of these cases. In the past this was the major&#xD;
      objective of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, but more recently the focus has&#xD;
      changed and the goals have expanded [2]to include: 1- determination of the chemosensitivity&#xD;
      of the tumor so that subsequent chemotherapy can be modified accordingly. 2- to prolong&#xD;
      disease free survival . 3- to prolong survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far there has been no consistent improvement in survival using this approach, although two&#xD;
      recent studies suggest that a survival benefit might actually occur[3, 4]. However, there is&#xD;
      consensus that patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and who achieve a &quot;pathological&#xD;
      CR&quot;, meaning that no tumor is found at time of definitive tumor resection, have experienced&#xD;
      longer survival[5-8]. Perhaps with a more active neoadjuvant combination a significantly&#xD;
      higher pathological CR rate can be obtained, and thus longer survival achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most neoadjuvant regimens that have been used in the past have only included induction with&#xD;
      3-4 courses of an anthracycline based regimen without a Taxane, followed by surgery and&#xD;
      further chemotherapy subsequently. However, the incorporation of docetaxel after an&#xD;
      anthracycline-based regimen (Aberdeen and NSABP-B27 protocols) [4, 9]led to better clinical&#xD;
      response, subsequently to better breast conservation and more important, an increase in the&#xD;
      pathological complete response rate. In the NSABP-B-27 study, 2,411 patients with operable&#xD;
      primary breast cancer were randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms: a) four cycles&#xD;
      of preoperative AC followed by surgery. b) four cycles of preoperative AC followed by four&#xD;
      cycles of preoperative docetaxel (100 mg/m2 IV every 3 weeks), or c) four cycles of AC&#xD;
      followed by surgery and subsequently four cycles of postoperative docetaxel. Compared to&#xD;
      preoperative AC alone, preoperative AC followed by preoperative docetaxel increased the&#xD;
      clinical complete response rate (40.1% v 63.6%; P &lt; .001), the overall clinical response rate&#xD;
      (85.5% v 90.7%; P &lt; .001), the pathologic complete response rate (13.7% v 26.1%; P &lt; .001),&#xD;
      and the proportion of patients with negative nodes (50.8% v 58.2%; P &lt; .001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement of relapse free survival has also been observed in the NSABP-B-27 and Aberdeen&#xD;
      trials. In the latter trial, improvement in overall survival has also been reported.. A&#xD;
      statistically significant improvement in overall survival has not been observed yet in the&#xD;
      NSABP-B-27 trial but a longer follow-up of this study is required to better evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of including Taxotere (Docetaxel) as part of the neoadjuvant strategy on overall&#xD;
      survival of breast cancer. One subgroup of patients in the NSABP-B-27 trial was found in a&#xD;
      retrospective analysis to benefit the most. This was the group who achieved a clinical&#xD;
      partial response after the first four courses of AC and who received four additional courses&#xD;
      of Docetaxel. They benefited from a longer disease free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another neoadjuvant trial performed at MD Anderson Cancer Center, patients with a&#xD;
      pathologic response but with residual tumors &gt;1 cm were randomized to receive postoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy based on their response to preoperative chemotherapy. Those patients who had a&#xD;
      change in their chemotherapy experienced a longer survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review of neoadjuvant trials shows that those with the higher number of preop chemotherapy&#xD;
      courses have the best results. We feel that the next step should be the development of a&#xD;
      preoperative combination chemotherapeutic regimen which provides the highest pathological&#xD;
      complete response rate and the highest lymph node negative status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study we propose to: 1- incorporate Docetaxel as part of the induction neoadjuvant&#xD;
      regimen in all patients. 2- tailor the neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen according to the&#xD;
      preoperative response as judged by MRI so that patients whose maximum response after the&#xD;
      first four courses of an anthracycline-docetaxel based combination, is a partial remission or&#xD;
      less, will receive four courses of a non-cross resistant regimen. 3- prolong the duration of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant preoperative chemotherapy to a total of eight courses. 4- complete the&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery so that the chances for a pathological CR are&#xD;
      increased. 5- include Trastuzumab (Herceptin) as part of the neoadjuvant treatment in&#xD;
      patients who are Her-2 positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A combination derived from the established TAC (Taxotere, Adriamycin, Cyclophosphamide)&#xD;
      regimen but which uses Epirubicin, a less cardiotoxic analogue of Doxorubicin (Adriamycin),&#xD;
      will be tested. Those Her-2 negative patients whose response to the first 4 courses of&#xD;
      induction TEC is less than a complete remission, will have their treatment changed to a&#xD;
      second line regimen, Navelbine-Avastin-Xeloda (&quot;NAX&quot;), with the intention of capturing a&#xD;
      better response prior to surgery. Those who are Her-2 positive will initially also receive&#xD;
      TEC but subsequent therapy will include Trastuzumab (Herceptin) whether they respond well or&#xD;
      not to TEC.&#xD;
