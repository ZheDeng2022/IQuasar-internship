  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory arthritis (IA) is a major cause of long-term disability. Due to specialist&#xD;
      shortages, failure of primary care providers and individuals to recognize the disease, and&#xD;
      lack of awareness of the importance of early intervention, delays to rheumatologic care are&#xD;
      common. Peer support models have been used for various health issues and may be one method to&#xD;
      assist individuals with early IA to manage their disease and cope with stress. Qualitative&#xD;
      research methods (one-on-one interviews) will seek out feedback on a peer support approach&#xD;
      and explore the learning needs (informational needs, educational preferences) and opinions&#xD;
      about emotional and appraisal support of individuals living with IA, from the perspectives of&#xD;
      health care providers. The data will be analyzed and expressed themes (articulated needs and&#xD;
      understandings of interviewee context) will guide the future development of a peer support&#xD;
      intervention&#xD;

      Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of medical treatment in patients recently diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis are&#xD;
      well documented, but delays in the commencement of these treatment regimens often leads to&#xD;
      poor and irreversible healthcare outcomes. This study aims to explore the informational needs&#xD;
      and educational preferences of persons with early inflammatory arthritis through the&#xD;
      perspective of their health care providers in efforts to expedite the time to treatment. This&#xD;
      project is part of a larger multidisciplinary study that also investigates these learning&#xD;
      needs from the perspectives of the patients, their families, and their culture. Specifically&#xD;
      for this part of the project, healthcare providers who are engaged in work related to&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis care will be invited to participate as key informants. Using a&#xD;
      semi-structured interview guide, these participants will provide personal insight from their&#xD;
      experiences in working with patients diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis regarding the&#xD;
      informational and educational barriers they believe lead to delays in arthritis treatment in&#xD;
      Ontario patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale Disorders of the musculoskeletal system remain a prevalent cause of long-term&#xD;
      disability in Canada and their burden on society and the health care system is projected to&#xD;
      continue increasing1-5. There are currently over 4 million Canadians inflicted with&#xD;
      arthritis, a figure projected to continue increasing to 6 million by 2026. Although there is&#xD;
      currently no cure for this disease, medical intervention has been demonstrated to prevent&#xD;
      disability, help maintain function, and reduce arthritis associated pain6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the benefits of commencing early treatment in patients recently diagnosed with&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis are well documented6, delays due to the shortage in the number of&#xD;
      qualified healthcare providers trained to meet the demands of this growing disease7-11 often&#xD;
      leads to poor and irreversible health outcomes in these patients12-14. This disparity has&#xD;
      created gaps in the care of these patients including access to arthritis-related services,&#xD;
      specialist and rehabilitation services7,8. To compound this, the stress acquired following a&#xD;
      diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis has been shown to greatly impede patients' cognitive&#xD;
      function and decision-making abilities. Unlike the disparity in healthcare providers, these&#xD;
      patient-related variables, although likely to play a major role in disease progression, are&#xD;
      currently not well understood. In light of this, one cost-effective option to shortening the&#xD;
      time between disease onset and treatment is to better understand the hurdles patients face&#xD;
      following their diagnosis and develop more efficient mechanisms to deliver the information to&#xD;
      this group more effectively. By exploring the informational needs and educational preferences&#xD;
      of persons with early inflammatory arthritis, the development of such novel strategies will&#xD;
      likely be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Promoting patient education in self management encourages self-autonomy and is considered one&#xD;
      of the key elements to optimal clinical practice. It increases confidence and self-esteem and&#xD;
      empowers patients to be come more independent at coping and managing their arthritis15,16.&#xD;
      Furthermore, self-management strategies increase the efficacy of prescribed medication and&#xD;
      allow patients play a more active role in the management of their disease with relatively&#xD;
      little supervision from healthcare providers17. These ideals are often not met in the&#xD;
      clinical setting as a large proportion of patients fail to engage or continue with this&#xD;
      independent approach. Such failures may be accounted for by the variable learning stages and&#xD;
      individual needs of patients and thus require refinement in order to improve long-term&#xD;
      adherence to self-management strategies18,19. Understanding the needs of patients in these&#xD;
      different stages of learning will be vital to implement new patient-directed therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, the wide array of different educational needs have yet to be systemically explored&#xD;
      in a scientific manner, it is postulated one common problem in this patient population is a&#xD;
      deterioration of sufficient self-confidence to make independent decisions. Onset of&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis leads to systemic profound fatigue, prolonged morning stiffness and&#xD;
      severe joint pain compromising affected individuals' mood and ability to work and participate&#xD;
      at home and in the community20. This alienation significantly decreases patients'&#xD;
      independence and likely leads to subsequent increase in everyday stresses. Factors like these&#xD;
      that greatly affect patient's learning and cognitive function need to be properly understood.&#xD;
      One solution to this problem could involve the promotion of peer support in patients' lives&#xD;
      and healthcare decisions20. Peer supporters are lay health advisers that offer encouragement&#xD;
      and are seen as equal by the patients. The support often presents as one-on-one or focus&#xD;
      groups between newly diagnosed patients and people who through personal or closely related&#xD;
      encounters have previously been placed in similar decision making scenarios. They thus&#xD;
      represent trusting figures that can easily sympathize with the difficult adjustments and&#xD;
      decisions these patients need to make. Because of this connection, they often provide some&#xD;
      degree of informational, appraisal and emotional support that other members of a healthcare&#xD;
      team cannot. Such interventions that are designed to improve the social environment of&#xD;
      individuals have been shown effectively improve psychological adjustment, recovery times and&#xD;
      even extend the life expectancy of patients with chronic diseases20. Peer support is thus an&#xD;
      important tool that when integrated into healthcare transforms the focus from disease&#xD;
      treatment to overall health promotion21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the education needs of the patients and their perceptions of peer support will&#xD;
      likely lead to the development of better strategies that are more centered around patients.&#xD;
      It is hoped that such novel strategies will play a key role in decreasing the diagnosis to&#xD;
      treatment lag time currently affecting positive outcomes in the management of inflammatory&#xD;
      arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to solicit the knowledge and experience of experts in the field&#xD;
      (healthcare providers) working with inflammatory arthritis patients to develop a&#xD;
      comprehensive understanding of strategies, including peer support that can be used to promote&#xD;
      independence in the learning and decision making among patents with arthritis regarding their&#xD;
      disease. Through dialog with these healthcare providers we hope to identify and better&#xD;
      understand the barriers and facilitators in this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and Objectives The specific objectives of this phase of study are to explore the&#xD;
      daily observations and personal experiences of different healthcare providers to identify the&#xD;
      informational needs and educational preferences of persons with early inflammatory arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By conducting these interviews we hope to identify common hurdles and catalysts observed by&#xD;
      healthcare providers preventing or promoting newly diagnosed inflammatory arthritis patients&#xD;
      to make prompt decisions regarding the management of their disease. The aim is to identify&#xD;
      processes important for the implementation and evaluation of the proposed model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Through the perspectives of the healthcare providers, the informational needs and&#xD;
      educational preferences for persons with early inflammatory arthritis will be explored using&#xD;
      a qualitative approach. A sample size of approximately 10-15 health care providers (i.e.&#xD;
      physicians, nurses, therapists) who are engaged in the management of inflammatory arthritis&#xD;
      patients in Ontario will be asked to act as key informants. More specifically, this will be&#xD;
      done through the use of both one-on-one in-person or telephone semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The semi-structured interviews will serve an as efficient investigation technique for&#xD;
      assembling large amounts of data in a relatively short time frame that offers insight into a&#xD;
      broad range of issues on a particular topic. A semi-structured interview guide (Appendix A)&#xD;
      outlining the information that will be inquired about during the interview was developed for&#xD;
      the purpose of this study. Semi-structured interviews entail asking each interviewee a&#xD;
      specific set of predetermined questions in the same and consistent manner. However, they also&#xD;
      allow flexibility for the interviewer to alter the order of the questions and probe the&#xD;
      participants further to gain more information. These probes (or prompts) are questions not&#xD;
      found in the interview guide that will be used to encourage elaboration of responses and&#xD;
      further discussion to particular questions. These will be posed to the interviewees in a&#xD;
      neutral and unbiased manner. Furthermore, additional questions may be added to subsequent&#xD;
      interviews if deemed to be useful at extracting previously unanticipated and potentially&#xD;
      useful information. Due to the qualitative nature of the study, the total number of&#xD;
      participants is estimated to be between 10 and 15, and will depend on when saturation is&#xD;
      achieved. Saturation occurs when no new information or emerging themes are uncovered with&#xD;
      subsequent interviews. The interviews will be conducted by a medical student who is a&#xD;
      co-investigator for the project and has undergone interview training from experienced&#xD;
      researchers and are anticipated to last approximately one hour. During the interview, key&#xD;
      points arising will be manually documented by the medical student. The completed interview&#xD;
      will also be digitally audiotaped and transcribed verbatim, and the digital files, interview&#xD;
      transcripts and field notes will be uploaded to a qualitative software package, NVivo 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential study participants will be identified based on the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Healthcare providers for patients diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physicians, nurses, occupational therapist, physiotherapists, social workers and other&#xD;
           healthcare providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Able to participate in a 1 hour interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Ontario residents&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Fluent in English&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Consent Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential participants for this study will be identified as healthcare providers holding&#xD;
      positions that offer experienced insight into the informational needs and educational&#xD;
      preferences for patients recently diagnosed with early inflammatory arthritis. This may&#xD;
      include physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and social workers.&#xD;
      These individuals will be selected based on inclusion criteria in through existing and&#xD;
      emerging contacts with Dr. Mary Bell, a rheumatology physician at the Toronto General&#xD;
      Hospital and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. This initial contact will be made by Dr. Bell&#xD;
      through e-mail, telephone, or personal contact. Recruitment will also take place through The&#xD;
      Arthritis Society and using a snowball technique in which participants are asked to recommend&#xD;
      others who could be contacted. An attempt will be made to select healthcare providers from&#xD;
      different geographic locations (e.g. rural vs. urban) across Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be approached by the Principal Investigator (Dr. Mary Bell) and&#xD;
      asked for their willingness to participate in this study. The individual will verbally agree&#xD;
      to be contacted by the medical student who is a co-investigator with the project. Contact&#xD;
      information of these potentially interested volunteers will be collected by the office&#xD;
      manager at the clinic and then given to an experienced medical student responsible for&#xD;
      obtaining consent and conducting the interviews. This medical student will obtain written&#xD;
      consent and provide a copy to the participant. The medical student will then contact&#xD;
      potential participants by telephone using a standardized telephone scripted (Appendix B) to&#xD;
      further describe the study and re-confirm the willingness of the potential participants to&#xD;
      take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A confirmation letter (on Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre letterhead, signed by Dr. Bell)&#xD;
      with time and location of the interview/focus group will also be mailed to the participant&#xD;
      (Appendix C). The day before the interview is scheduled to take place the medical student&#xD;
      will telephone the individual to remind them of the time and location of the interview&#xD;
      (Appendix D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be conducted by telephone or in person. The location and timing of the&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted at a time and place that is convenient for each participant. If&#xD;
      the participant lives or work in a remote rural area, if preferred, the interview will be&#xD;
      conducted over the phone. Before each interview, participants will receive an information&#xD;
      sheet describing the study (Appendix E) and a consent form (Appendix F) via e-mail, personal&#xD;
      delivery or by mail. The information sheet will describe the purpose of the study, expected&#xD;
      commitment for participation, the known benefits and risks of the study, and their right to&#xD;
      refuse or withdraw at any time. The interview process will begin only after the participant&#xD;
      has a chance to read over the forms and has an opportunity to ask questions about the study&#xD;
      and consent process. Consent forms will be completed and signed by the participant prior to&#xD;
      commencing the interview session. A photocopy of the form will be prepared for each&#xD;
      participant for their records. If the interview is to be conducted over the phone, consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from the participant in advance of the interview by fax or mail. With the&#xD;
      interviewee's consent, the interview will be audio-recorded, and interviews will be&#xD;
      transcribed in part or in whole for a more thorough analysis. Notes from the interview will&#xD;
      be taken before, during and after the interview on an Interview Notes Form (Appendix G). In&#xD;
      addition to notes on the interviewee's responses to the questions, comments will be made&#xD;
      regarding the interviewer's personal thoughts on the interview itself, observations of any&#xD;
      nonverbal communication, as well as conversations occurring before and after the interview&#xD;
      itself (field notes). Audio files, interview transcripts and field notes will be uploaded to&#xD;
      a qualitative software package, NVivo 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis The data collected from the interviews will be analyzed using the constant&#xD;
      comparative method and organized into themes. This process involves simplifying and&#xD;
      categorizing the unique thoughts and descriptions given by the various interviewees' into&#xD;
      common themes. This process will allow us to reduce and refer to the complexity of the&#xD;
      information into more manageable and readily identifiable classes. These clusters aim to&#xD;
      summarize what the significant and meaningful aspects of the data collected and allow for the&#xD;
      proper interpretation and presentation of the data. The specific categories that will be used&#xD;
      will be developed as an iterative process during the analysis of each interview and a coding&#xD;
      scheme will be created. Categories will be added to the coding scheme until no further&#xD;
      emerging themes can be identified. This analysis will be carried out by the medical student&#xD;
      who conducted the interviews of the healthcare providers. To reduce any potential bias in the&#xD;
      interpretation of the interviewees' responses, the interview transcripts will be&#xD;
      independently coded by another person on the research team. Discussion between the two&#xD;
      following the coding process will be used to reach a consensus on the emerging themes arising&#xD;
      from each interview. The modifications made to the interview guide during the evolution of&#xD;
      the study will be noted to ensure any discrepancies between information gathered from the&#xD;
      initial participants and those near the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Benefits There are no known risks associated with this study. In addition to&#xD;
      possibly promoting awareness in healthcare providers participating in the study regarding&#xD;
      their patient population, there may be indirect benefits to patients and providers due to the&#xD;
      future care of individuals with inflammatory arthritis in Ontario. We will make the&#xD;
      information freely available to allow other programs to also integrate the implications of&#xD;
      our findings into their own practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Privacy and Confidentiality Only the principal investigator and research staff conducting the&#xD;
      interviews will know the identity of the participants. No identifying information will be&#xD;
      included on data collection forms. Upon agreement to partake in the study each participant&#xD;
      will be assigned a unique study identification number. This ID number will be used to&#xD;
      identify the occupation and responses of each participant. The list of names, addresses and&#xD;
      phone number of each participant will be maintained in a password protected file at the&#xD;
      department of rheumatology offices at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Only the principal&#xD;
      investigator and research staff involved in the study will their associates will have access&#xD;
      to this file. All information collected during the study will be strictly confidential. No&#xD;
      names or identifying information will be used in subsequent publications or presentations. No&#xD;
      identifying information will be shared with personnel not associated with the study or leave&#xD;
      the confines of the hospitals involved in the study. Until their eventual destruction, all&#xD;
      digital audio files and tangible copies of data will be stored in a locked research room at&#xD;
      the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. The data for this study will be retained for 25 years.&#xD;
      A confidentiality agreement will be signed by the study coordinator and all second year&#xD;
      medical students involved with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation Participants are recruited on a volunteer basis and there will be no monetary&#xD;
      remuneration. The budget for this is outlined in Appendix H.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Communication of Results Dissemination of these results to study participants upon request&#xD;
      (including interviewed healthcare providers) will be done through a working report. The&#xD;
      findings in this report will also be communicated by the medical students to their peers and&#xD;
      professors as a partial requirement for the completion of their &quot;Determinants of Community&#xD;
      Health&quot; course. Upon completion, these results will also be shared to the public academic&#xD;
      audience through publications and presentations of the findings.&#xD;
