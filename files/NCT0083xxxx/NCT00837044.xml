  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine headache occurs frequently in women more than men and is associated with symptoms&#xD;
      not only of significant pain but also of symptoms typically including of photophobia,&#xD;
      phonophobia, nausea and vomiting. Many migraine patients report difficulty in cognition from&#xD;
      lack of concentration, difficulty in word finding or inability to remember. Many of these&#xD;
      cognitive symptoms seem to be independent of the pain intensity and may occur completely&#xD;
      separately from the headache pain but can be disabling. It is likely that the frequency and&#xD;
      importance of cognitive symptoms associated with migraine are underreported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mental Efficacy Workload Test (MEWT) is a computerized battery that is designed to be an&#xD;
      efficient and accurate measure of cognition during migraine headache. Treximet is a new&#xD;
      migraine treatment recently FDA approved for the treatment for the relief of acute migraine&#xD;
      that may be effective for the cognitive symptoms for migraine patients who have a history of&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction during a migraine headache. The primary efficacy parameter is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with Treximet versus placebo in patients with acute&#xD;
      migraine headache measuring neuropsychological function using the MEWT during the migraine&#xD;
      and comparing that score with a prior MEWT score when the patient had no migraine symptoms. A&#xD;
      double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was chosen so that each patient may be her&#xD;
      or his own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the intent of this study to determine the type and intensity of cognitive dysfunction&#xD;
      associated with migraine headache and to what extent that Treximet may relieve the cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction in a safe and effective manner.&#xD;

      Overall Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to be a double blind crossover comparison study in patients during a migraine&#xD;
      headache attack, with assessments at one and two hours after treatment. Patients with an IHS&#xD;
      diagnosis of migraine with or without aura may be included. The patients will complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding the nature of their migraine attacks, including their impression of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment if any. Historically associated symptoms will be listed. Menstrual&#xD;
      associated migraine history will be assessed. 30 patients will be randomized to Treximet or&#xD;
      placebo in a 1:1 manner for the first treatment and in reverse order for treatment on the&#xD;
      second migraine attack. In this manner, each patient will be his or her own control. 60&#xD;
      migraine headaches will be treated in this study. Also, it has been previously discussed that&#xD;
      after 3 practice sessions with the MEWT, further administration of the MEWT does not produce&#xD;
      bias by a practice effect as the ANAM has been shown not to produce bias by a practice&#xD;
      effect.10 Therefore, patients will have 3 practice sessions in the clinic before taking the&#xD;
      baseline MEWT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the baseline period, while the patient is without any migraine symptoms and feeling&#xD;
      well (interictal period), three practice trials on the MEWT will be performed and a fourth&#xD;
      MEWT trial will be taken with the score recorded for a neuropsychological baseline. When the&#xD;
      patient experiences a migraine headache, the patient will rate headache severity and&#xD;
      associated symptoms and then take Treximet or matching placebo. The patient will repeat&#xD;
      headache and associated symptom checklist and the MEWT at 1 and 2 hours after treatment.&#xD;
      Rescue medication will be allowed at 2 hours for those patients who require it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 Clinical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Selection of Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Visit 1 (Screen visit): After informed consent reviewed and signed, inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria reviewed and the patient approved for the study, patients will have&#xD;
      assessments and practice MEWT sessions as listed below. The patients will then be scheduled&#xD;
      for visit 2 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      These assessments will be completed in the following order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . Type(s) of migraine including menstrual migraine&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . Medical and surgical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. . Migraine history: age of onset, age of onset of cognitive dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. . Family history of migraine&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. . Prior treatment for migraine, both rescue and preventative&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. . Age, sex, educational background&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Concomitant medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. General physical and neurological examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Reviewing with patient headache severity and symptom assessment forms&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Two practice sessions on the MEWT&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 Visit 2 Patient is to return to clinic within 2 weeks to review headache severity&#xD;
           and symptom forms to be filled out at home or work while experiencing a migraine. Two&#xD;
           MEWT sessions will be taken, one last session for practice and the other for a baseline&#xD;
           test to be compared to MEWT assessment while experiencing a migraine. Subject is&#xD;
           randomized to treximet or placebo and given medication package and instructions .*&#xD;
           Subject is also given MEWT device to take home along with assessments and diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4 Visit 3 (Post-treatment visit #1): The patient is to return to the clinic within one&#xD;
           week of treating a migraine to review headache severity and symptom assessment forms,&#xD;
           MEWT scoring and adverse event (AE) dairy. Patient given second medication package for&#xD;
           second migraine treatment.* Subject given MEWT device and assessment forms to take home&#xD;
           and complete when experiencing headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5 Visit 4 (Post-treatment visit #2): The patient is to return to the clinic within one&#xD;
           week of treating the second migraine to review headache severity and symptom assessment&#xD;
           forms, MEWT scoring and AD dairy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           * Patients may take rescue medication of choice after 2 hours of taking Treximet or&#xD;
           placebo if they wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.0 Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
           An adverse event definition for this protocol is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any unexpected, untoward medical occurrence that is considered clinically significant by&#xD;
           the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All adverse events fitting this description will be captured and recorded on the case&#xD;
           report forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the event that a subject is withdrawn from the study because of an adverse event, it&#xD;
           must be recorded on the CRF as such. The subject should be followed and treated by the&#xD;
           investigator until the abnormal parameter or symptom has resolved or stabilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All adverse events will be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF)&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.0 Serious Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
           A serious AE means any adverse event fitting the description above but also containing&#xD;
           one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Life threatening experience which places the subject at immediate risk of death&#xD;
                from the event as it occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Full Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Persistent or significant disability/incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Congenital anomaly or birth defect&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any reports of these events during the conduct of the study will immediately be reported&#xD;
           to the sponsor, to the IRB and to Medwatch.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.0 Statistical analysis plan, sample size justification and power analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cognitive function and efficacy analysis (pain relief) will be calculated on the&#xD;
           intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Statistics will be presented for headache response&#xD;
           (0-3 scale), pain-free response, safety and demographics. Five subsets of MEWT will be&#xD;
           used (CPT, MTS, MP, PRT and SRT -see Table 1). Four of the subset tests of the MEWT&#xD;
           (CPT, MTS, MP, and PRT) will be scored for 'throughput,' which is the number of correct&#xD;
           responses per minute. This is a measure of efficacy that combines both speed and&#xD;
           accuracy in a single score. SRT will be calculated for reaction time in msec. Group&#xD;
           means will be calculated from each patient's mean for each MEWT subtest and compared to&#xD;
           each stage of the migraine: migraine-free, migraine pre-treatment (time zero) and&#xD;
           migraine post-treatment (time 1 and 2 hours). Each MEWT subtest will be calculated using&#xD;
           a repeated measure 1 x 3 (each stage of migraine: migraine free, pre and post-treatment)&#xD;
           by analysis of variance (ANOVA) for statistical significance of at least p = 0.05 or&#xD;
           better.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.0 Duration of study&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nine months (30 patients with baseline practice sessions, treatment of 2 separate&#xD;
           migraine headaches)&#xD;
&#xD;
           9.0 Specific drug supply requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treximet and matching placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
           10.0 Publication/presentation plan&#xD;
&#xD;
           Submission to a national and/or international headache meeting as soon as the data have&#xD;
           been analyzed. Submission to a peer review journal within 6 months of study analysis&#xD;
           completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           11.0 Source Documentation and Case Report Form Completion&#xD;
&#xD;
           Source documents are defined as original documents, data and records. These may include&#xD;
           hospital records, clinical and office charts, lab results, cognitive data and&#xD;
           information, etc. The Case Report Form documents will serve as the source records for&#xD;
           this trial. All forms will be completed within 5 business days of the study visit. A CRF&#xD;
           will be provided for each enrolled study subject. All CRFs will be completed using black&#xD;
           ink. All corrections will be made by striking through with a single line and writing&#xD;
           correct data above, beside, or below the erroneous data, so as not to obscure the&#xD;
           original entry. Each correction will be initialed and dated by the person making the&#xD;
           correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           12.0 Retention and Availability of Records&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigator will maintain adequate records for the protocol including signed&#xD;
           Informed consents, patient information sheets, completed source documents, CRF's, Lab&#xD;
           reports, Medical records, AE reports and information regarding all subjects who&#xD;
           discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
           13.0 Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
           Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol&#xD;
           amendments, the Investigators Brochure if applicable, informed consent/assent, and all&#xD;
           other forms of subject information related to the study (including advertisements) be&#xD;
           reviewed by the IEC/IRB. IRB approval is mandatory before initiating of any study&#xD;
           related activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be conducted per the protocol, in accordance with ICH guidelines,&#xD;
           applicable regulations, and guidelines governing clinical study conduct and the ethical&#xD;
           principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
           14.0 Use of Information/Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
           All information obtained during the conduct of this clinical trial is considered&#xD;
           confidential. This information may be disclosed as deemed necessary by Neurological&#xD;
           Research Center Inc or GlaxoSmithKline, Inc. to other clinical investigators, the&#xD;
           IEC/IRB, the FDA and other governmental agencies. Patient identifiers will include&#xD;
           patient assigned number, age, and sex. Patient Initials will not be released to the&#xD;
           company as this is irrelevant information. The investigator will maintain a confidential&#xD;
           subject identification code list of all subjects enrolled in the study by name and&#xD;
           subject number. This list will be maintained at the investigative site.&#xD;
