    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this proposal is to provide a pre-treatment evaluation that can assist&#xD;
      in the rational selection of patients to undergo appropriate and definitive therapy for&#xD;
      prostate cancer. In so doing, it may be possible to further improve the numbers and&#xD;
      percentage of cancer patients who receive effective therapy that will cure the disease and&#xD;
      maximize their quality of life following therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1: To evaluate the accuracy of T2W MRI, DCE-MRI and their combined data for staging&#xD;
           prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2: To evaluate the accuracy of MRI in determining tumor volume in the prostate&#xD;
           gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3: To evaluate the accuracy of MRI in grading prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our laboratory we have combined the use of new 3T clinical magnetic resonance (MR)&#xD;
      technology, dynamic-contrast enhancement (DCE), and a unique endorectal-coil (ERC) probe in&#xD;
      order to non-invasively obtain images of the prostate gland with higher signal-to-noise&#xD;
      resolution and better spectral dispersion than has been previously achieved. This imaging&#xD;
      strategy acquires higher-resolution images with smaller voxel sizes than has been possible&#xD;
      with prior MR technology and more comprehensive tissue sampling compared to other&#xD;
      pre-surgical assessments. This methodology should make it feasible to assess prostate-tissue&#xD;
      morphology and additional features of prostate cancer such as tissue metabolism, tissue&#xD;
      kinetics, and the vascular microenvironment, and thus provide a non-invasive tool to: 1)&#xD;
      detect extra-capsular spread, 2) detect specific areas within the prostate that harbor&#xD;
      cancer, 3) determine the aggressiveness of the cancer and 4) direct biopsy and treatment&#xD;
      specifically to diseased areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to prospectively validate these goals we will recruit successive patients who have&#xD;
      been scheduled for prostate removal to participate to our protocol. Each patient will be&#xD;
      studied with an ERC MRI at 3T using T2-weighted (T2W) imaging, DCE 3D T1-weighted imaging and&#xD;
      MR spectroscopy (MRS). A pathologist using whole mount preparations will independently&#xD;
      analyze each patient's prostate specimen. The whole mount data will be used as the standard&#xD;
      against which we will compare the observations and data obtained from the 3T MRI findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate the accuracy of T2W MRI, DCE-MRI and their combined data for staging&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplementing T2W imaging with the high-resolution capability of 3TMR, we will apply standard&#xD;
      morphologic criteria used at 1.5T to determine the presence or absence of extracapsular&#xD;
      extension (ECE) of disease. The possible incremental value of high spatial resolution,&#xD;
      dynamic contrast-enhanced data will be investigated. MRI results will be compared to ECE&#xD;
      determination at whole-mount pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate the accuracy of MRI in determining tumor volume in the prostate gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using dynamic-contrast enhanced MRI with parametric analyses and T2-weighted images, both at&#xD;
      smaller voxel sizes than have been used previously, will be our approach. Tumor volumes&#xD;
      determined with MRI will be compared to those determined at pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To evaluate the accuracy of MRI in grading prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enhanced resolution available at 3T offers new opportunities to compare Gleason grades&#xD;
      with independent and combined assessments of tissue kinetics and metabolism. Pixel by pixel&#xD;
      parametric analyses will be obtained. Furthermore, choline to citrate and choline plus&#xD;
      creatine to citrate ratios determined using MRS techniques will be obtained. Single voxel&#xD;
      techniques will first be employed, followed by 3D chemical shift imaging, when the latter&#xD;
      becomes available at 3T. DCE and MRS data will be compared both separately and in combination&#xD;
      to the histologic Gleason scores of the comparable tumor identified at whole mount pathology.&#xD;
