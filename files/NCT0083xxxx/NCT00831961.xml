    <textblock>
      Repeated exposure to topical antibiotics may alter the normal bacteria on the eye and in the&#xD;
      nose and increase rates of resistance. This study will determine whether repeated short-term&#xD;
      exposure to topical antibiotic drops which are commonly prescribed after eye injections to&#xD;
      reduce the chance of infection increase rates of resistant bacteria which are normally found&#xD;
      on the eye and in the nose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesis that certain commercially available antibiotics may increase rates of bacteria&#xD;
      resistance more so than others.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with anti-vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth therapy (ranibizumab and bevacizumab, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA)&#xD;
      requires repetitive and often long-term intraocular injections and has raised concern about&#xD;
      increasing rates of endophthalmitis. Endophthalmitis remains one of the most feared&#xD;
      complications in ophthalmology and despite early detection and intervention can result in&#xD;
      substantial morbidity. Recent multicenter clinical trials of anti-vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      therapy have reported endophthalmitis rates of 1.0% to 1.9% per patient treated (during a 6&#xD;
      month to 2 year period of follow-up). Consequently, topical antibiotics are routinely&#xD;
      prescribed after intraocular injections, although no published study to date has proven their&#xD;
      efficacy in preventing post-injection endophthalmitis. 1,2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of increasing concern, however, are reports of growing resistance of normal ocular flora to&#xD;
      commonly employed antibiotic classes including macrolides, aminoglycosides, and 3rd&#xD;
      generation fluoroquinolones.3-5 The recent availability of 4th generation fluoroquinolones:&#xD;
      gatifloxacin 0.3% (Zymar, Allergan Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, Calif) and moxifloxacin 0.5%&#xD;
      (Vigamox, Alcon Fort Worth, TX) has notably enhanced our armamentarium and are widely used&#xD;
      due to their greater potency. Not surprisingly however, recent reports have begun to surface&#xD;
      documenting emerging resistance to these 4th generation fluoroquinolones as well.6,7&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practice of short-term and repeated exposure of ocular flora to antibiotics, as is the&#xD;
      case after intraocular injections for AMD, may facilitate antibiotic resistance. However, no&#xD;
      study to date has evaluated resistance patterns of ocular or nasopharyngeal flora in response&#xD;
      to repeated applications of topical antibiotics over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study will attempt to monitor long-term resistance patterns of conjunctival&#xD;
      and nasopharyngeal flora in patients with AMD who are repeatedly exposed to different&#xD;
      commercially available antibiotics after intraocular injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the Research Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine changes in ocular and nasopharyngeal flora after repeated exposure to topical&#xD;
      antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rpeated use of topical antibiotics may alter normal ocular and nasopharyngeal flora and may&#xD;
      increase resistance to commonly employed antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective, randomized, observational cohort study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Goals of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish baseline susceptibility and resistance patterns of normal conjunctival and&#xD;
           nasopharyngeal flora of patients with choroidal neovascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Monitor changes in normal conjunctival and nasopharyngeal flora after repeated exposure&#xD;
           to topical antibiotics over a 2 year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine patterns of antibiotic resistance of conjunctival and nasopharyngeal flora&#xD;
           after repeated exposure to topical antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous Studies: none&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board will approve this study and the study&#xD;
      will comply with all aspects of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult patients with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to AMD or other causes in 1&#xD;
      eye and planned treatment with intraocular injections of either ranibizumab or bevacizumab,&#xD;
      will be eligible. Patients will be excluded if they are younger than 18, are taking&#xD;
      concurrent topical or systemic antibiotics, have active ocular infection, or have a history&#xD;
      of use of topical antibiotics for any indication within the previous 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients identified with CNV after complete ophthalmic examination and who agree to&#xD;
      participate will be asked to return ≥ 24 hours later for their planned injection in order to&#xD;
      minimize contamination from topical anesthetic and mydriatic drops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned to 1 of 4 commercially available antibiotics at the initial study&#xD;
      visit: ofloxacin 0.3% (Ocuflox, Akorn Inc., Somerset, NJ), azithromycin 1% (AzaSite, Inspire&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Durham, NC), gatifloxacin 0.3%, or moxifloxacin 0.5% and will use only&#xD;
      their assigned antibiotic during and after all injections for the entire duration of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conjunctival cultures (from the lower fornix) of both eyes and nasopharyngeal cultures from&#xD;
      the same side as the eye to be treated will be taken with sterile cotton tip applicators and&#xD;
      calcium alginate swabs, respectively before the application of any topical medications. The&#xD;
      cultures will be obtained in standardized fashion with every effort made to minimize&#xD;
      contamination from the lids, lashes, or skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All intravitreal injections will be performed in accordance with the standard protocol of&#xD;
      each individual treating retina specialist using sterile technique. Patients will start using&#xD;
      their assigned antibiotic beginning on the day of their injection and continue for the next 4&#xD;
      consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conjunctival culture swabs will be transported to the microbiology laboratory using the BBLTM&#xD;
      CultureSwabTM (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD 21152) transport system and then&#xD;
      inoculated onto blood agar plates and incubated at 37°C for 3 days. All blood agar plates&#xD;
      will be incubated in a microaerophilic environment. Blood agar cultures will be deemed&#xD;
      positive if 1 or more colony forming units are observed. Nasopharyngeal swabs will be&#xD;
      directly inoculated on blood agar plates and transported to the microbiology laboratory and&#xD;
      processed as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test resistance, the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion technique will be conducted in accordance&#xD;
      with the guidelines of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following antibiotics will be tested for resistance on all positive cultures: penicillin,&#xD;
      cefazolin, ceftazidime, imipenem, gentamicin, tobramycin, erythromycin, azithromycin,&#xD;
      ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, doxycycline, and&#xD;
      vancomycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will return in 4 weeks and cultures will be retaken in the exact same fashion as&#xD;
      above. If further injections are planned, the above protocol will be repeated until the end&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exact sample size calculations are difficult given the absence of reference data. We plan to&#xD;
      follow patients for 2 years and anticipate requiring 10 patients for each antibiotic arm. We&#xD;
      anticipate having 6 culture results per patient during the first year of follow-up and assume&#xD;
      a 20% loss of follow-up. Thus, we plan to recruit a total of 48 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics including mean and standard deviation will be calculated for case&#xD;
      characteristics. Group comparisons will be performed with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and&#xD;
      chi-square test. A P value &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Withdrawal: patients will be reminded at every visit that they can discontinue the&#xD;
      study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information: all patient data will be recorded and retained using non-identifiers.&#xD;
