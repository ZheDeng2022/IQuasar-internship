    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder (BD) is also named as a bipolar affective disorder, belonging to a kind of&#xD;
      severe mental disorder involving both mania or hypomania and depression episode, with&#xD;
      lifetime prevalence between 1.2 - 1.6%. The hygienic burden of bipolar disorder is high, and&#xD;
      its disease burden lies in top 10 position among the population of 15 - 44 years of old&#xD;
      patients and concomitant with relative high suicide rate (10 - 15%) and mutilation rate, as&#xD;
      reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) 2001 Annual Report. Drug treatment is one of&#xD;
      the main treatment methods for this kind of disease, and the dose selected will interfere the&#xD;
      efficacy and prognosis of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel) is a dibenzothiazepine derivative, which is widely used in the&#xD;
      world. It has the indications in schizophrenia, bipolar mania and depression approved by FDA.&#xD;
      Quetiapine fumarate has been used in China for almost 10 years, which is in the treatment of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. The indication of bipolar mania has been approved by SFDA recently.&#xD;
      Exploration of the relationship between the dose and efficacy has been a hot spot in the&#xD;
      clinical practice as the drug has a broad action spectrum and wide dose range&#xD;
      (200mg/d-800mg/d).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      bipolar disorder. Some clinical studies indicate the blood BDNF level decreased during the&#xD;
      depression phase in the bipolar disorder, and the blood BDNF level is negative proportional&#xD;
      to the severity of the depression; and the same phenomenon was found, i.e. the blood BDNF&#xD;
      level decreased during the manic phase in the bipolar disorder, and the blood BDNF level is&#xD;
      negative proportional to the severity of the mania. Quetiapine fumarate was found to reduce&#xD;
      the decreasing of the expression of BDNF in the rat hippocampus and brain mantle in some&#xD;
      animal experiments, indicating quetiapine fumarate has the possibility on potential&#xD;
      interfering BDNF in the treatment. However, few study on comparison of the blood BDNF level&#xD;
      between pre and post treatment in the bipolar disorder was conducted.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, open label, 4-week study. Study subjects are defined in Chinese Han&#xD;
      nationality patients with acute mania of bipolar disorder (inpatients or outpatients). The&#xD;
      screening phase is up to 7 days. The eligible patients in the screening phase can be enrolled&#xD;
      into the treatment phase, the target dose is 400-800mg/day, and treatment period will last&#xD;
      for 4 weeks. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy of quetiapine fumarate switching from&#xD;
      other drugs used as monotherapy in the treatment of acute mania with bipolar disorder, and&#xD;
      the relationship between the serum BDNF and quetiapine fumarate.&#xD;
