      The purpose of this study is to collect information in order to identify people who have&#xD;
      asthma and who may be good candidates to participate in one of the future asthma studies to&#xD;
      be conducted at The Ohio State University Asthma Clinical Research Center.&#xD;

      Patients from The Ohio State University Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine will&#xD;
      be sent a letter explaining the registry and asking about their interest in participating in&#xD;
      this registry. The registry and all procedures related to their inclusion will be explained,&#xD;
      opportunity to ask questions will be given and a consent document signed prior to any&#xD;
      registry activity. Information about the registry will be shared with the community by&#xD;
      newspaper ads, Internet postings, word of mouth, flyers, and other pulmonologists in central&#xD;
      Ohio. Those potential registrants may choose to make an appointment to complete lung function&#xD;
      tests at the Asthma Clinical Research Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry and all procedures related to their inclusion will be explained, opportunity to&#xD;
      ask questions will be given and a consent document signed prior to any registry activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be asked to provide appropriate (general medical history, asthma&#xD;
      history, current medications, past asthma medications, demographic information, weight&#xD;
      height, smoking history, allergies, and prior surgeries. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete an Asthma Control Questionnaire, which will be scored to determine how well their&#xD;
      asthma is controlled. All consented registrants will be given the opportunity to visit The&#xD;
      Ohio State University Asthma Clinical Research Center where an extensive lung function test&#xD;
      (spirometry) will be provided. At the Asthma Clinical Research Center each registrant will&#xD;
      perform at least three lung function efforts, then given two puffs of albuterol (a fast&#xD;
      acting medication that opens airways). After a standard waiting period that meets the&#xD;
      standards of the American Thoracic Society, a second set of lung function test will be done.&#xD;
      The results of the second set of tests will reflect any reversibility in lung function&#xD;
      levels, and will serve as an indicator that treatment may improve lung function. All&#xD;
      participants will be given copies of all lung function tests, and the results of the test&#xD;
      will be explained to them. All study procedures are provided without cost to the registrant.&#xD;
