      The purpose of the study is to determine if a program of regular exercise can help reduce&#xD;
      asthma symptoms and also reduce the inflammation caused by asthma. If successful, this would&#xD;
      allow regular exercise to be recommended as a therapy for people with asthma, which could&#xD;
      possibly reduce the amount of medicine that people with asthma need to control their asthma&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, controlled, parallel-design study of the effectiveness of exercise&#xD;
      therapy as add-on therapy in the treatment of mild to moderately severe asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      105 men and women between the ages of 18-50 years with asthma will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of two treatment groups: exercise therapy or control. The exercise therapy protocol is&#xD;
      detailed below. The control group will receive usual asthma care. The control group will be&#xD;
      instructed to maintain their current sedentary activity level, i.e. not to begin a formal or&#xD;
      informal exercise program. In order to standardize contact with study personnel between the&#xD;
      two groups the control group will be seen three times a week for clinic visits (exercise&#xD;
      group will have sessions three times a week). The primary outcome measures are asthma control&#xD;
      (asthma symptom score) and asthma-related inflammation. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      exacerbation rate, asthma-related quality of life, generic quality of life, lung function,&#xD;
      airways hyper-reactivity, and cardiovascular fitness. The effect of exercise therapy on&#xD;
      inflammatory markers in blood, and sputum will be assessed by comparing results obtained at&#xD;
      study completion versus those obtained at baseline.&#xD;
