    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, single sequence, crossover study to be conducted in healthy&#xD;
      adult subjects. There will be a screening visit, three treatment periods, and a follow-up&#xD;
      visit. In Period 1, subjects will receive a single dose of eltrombopag on Day 1, and PK&#xD;
      sampling will occur for 72 hours. In Period 2, subjects will receive LPV/RTV for 14 days with&#xD;
      PK sampling for 12 hours. In Period 3, subjects will receive a single dose of eltrombopag&#xD;
      with LPV/RTV on Day 1 only with PK sampling for 72 hours. Subjects will return for a&#xD;
      follow-up visit within 10 to 14 days of the last dose of study drugs.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy subjects with no clinically significant abnormality identified by physician by&#xD;
             evaluation of medical history, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests or&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female subjects between the ages of 18 to 64 years of age inclusive, at the&#xD;

             and restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving written informed consent which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Signed informed consent must&#xD;
             be on file prior to screening procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight ≥ 50kg (110 lbs) for men and ≥ 45 kg (99 lbs) for women and body mass&#xD;
             index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects, who are not surgically sterile, must agree on abstinence or to use a&#xD;
             double barrier method, such as, a condom plus spermicidal agent&#xD;
             (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository). This criterion must be followed from the time of&#xD;
             the first dose of study medication until 14 days after the last dose of medication.-&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is neither pregnant nor lactating,&#xD;
             and falls into one of the following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  non-childbearing potential including pre-menopausal females with documented&#xD;
                  (medical report verification) hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or&#xD;
                  postmenopausal females defined as being amenorrheic for greater than 1 year and&#xD;
                  having serum estradiol and follicle stimulating hormone levels consistent with&#xD;
                  menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  child-bearing potential with negative β human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) test&#xD;
                  and agrees to comply with recognized non-hormonal contraceptive methods from&#xD;
                  screening or at least two weeks prior to first dose (whichever is earlier) until&#xD;
                  the follow-up visit. Recognized non-hormonal contraceptive methods include:&#xD;
                  complete abstinence from intercourse, two forms of barrier contraception (e.g.&#xD;
                  condom with spermicide, or diaphragm with spermicide), or intrauterine device&#xD;
                  (IUD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of Gilbert's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any previous history of deep vein thrombosis or any other thromboembolic event. 3.&#xD;
             History of thrombocytopenia or bleeding due to abnormal platelet number or function.&#xD;
             4. Clotting factor abnormalities associated with hypercoagulability, specifically&#xD;
             Factor V Leiden, Protein C or Protein S deficiency or antithrombin III deficiency. 5.&#xD;
             Elevated blood pressure (BP) at screening (systolic &gt;140 mm Hg, diastolic &gt;85 mm Hg).&#xD;
             If the subject's BP is elevated on the first measurement, complete two additional BP&#xD;
             measurements 2 minutes apart and average the three assessments to evaluate this&#xD;
             criteria. If averaged BP exceeds the safety criteria, the subject should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. History of atrial fibrillation, mitral valve prolapse, significant heart murmur or&#xD;
             vascular bruit. 7. Prolonged QTc interval (Bazett's) at screening (for females &gt; 450&#xD;
             msec and for males &gt; 430 msec). If the QTc interval is prolonged on the initial ECG,&#xD;
             then complete two additional ECGs 5 minutes apart and take the average QTc&#xD;
             measurements of all three ECGs to evaluate this criteria. If averaged QTc exceeds the&#xD;
             safety criteria, the subject should be excluded. 8. Female subjects currently&#xD;
             receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT). 9. Positive for HIV, hepatitis B virus or&#xD;
             hepatitis C virus assays at screening.&#xD;

             12. History of alcohol consumption in the past six months exceeding 7 units/week for&#xD;
             women and 14 units/week for men (where 1 unit = 5 ounces of wine or 12 ounces of beer&#xD;
             or 1.5 ounces of hard liquor). 13. Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking at&#xD;
             screening or pre-dose (Day -1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of regular use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to&#xD;
        screening. 14. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives&#xD;
        (whichever is longer) preceding the first dose of study medication. 15. Exposure to more&#xD;
        than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. 16. Use of&#xD;
        prescription or non-prescription drugs (including aspirin and non-steroidal&#xD;
        anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements within 7 days&#xD;
        (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer, such as St. John's Wort) or 5&#xD;
        half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the&#xD;
        opinion of the investigator and sponsor the medication will not interfere with the study&#xD;
        procedures or compromise subject safety. 17. Subjects who have donated plasma within 7 days&#xD;
        prior to the screening visit or where participation in this study would result in donation&#xD;
        of blood in excess of 500 mL within a 56-day period. 18. History of sensitivity to any of&#xD;
        the study medications, or components thereof.&#xD;
