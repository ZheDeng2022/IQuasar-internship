    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to discover the feasibility of conducting clinical research in&#xD;
      individuals with chronic sequelae following brain injury who are given hyperbaric oxygen.&#xD;
      This study will also look at the outcome of individuals with a chronic stable brain injury&#xD;
      due to trauma, anoxia (lack of oxygen to the brain), or stroke, who are given hyperbaric&#xD;
      oxygen. Outcome measures testing cognitive (memory, etc.) and functional (balance, strength,&#xD;
      etc.) measures will be performed before the hyperbaric sessions, immediately following them,&#xD;
      and 6 months later. The subject will receive 60 hyperbaric sessions, 60 minutes in the&#xD;
      chamber, to a pressure of 1.5 ATA, once daily, Monday through Friday.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperbaric oxygen is presently being used in an attempt to improve functional outcome&#xD;
      following a multitude of brain injuries such as stroke, anoxic brain injury, traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury, and others. Family members of brain-injured individuals correspond via the Internet&#xD;
      into coalitions demanding that their loved ones receive hyperbaric oxygen therapy. There are&#xD;
      anecdotal reports of benefit with hyperbaric oxygen following brain injury but there is&#xD;
      little credible scientific evidence for efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen in brain injury.&#xD;
      Clearly, what is needed to answer if hyperbaric oxygen improves brain injury are results from&#xD;
      carefully designed multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trials. However,&#xD;
      the implementation of such a Phase III clinical trial is challenging without information from&#xD;
      Phase II trials. We propose to conduct a feasibility trial that may potentially guide a&#xD;
      future Phase III clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms by which hyperbaric oxygen improves sequelae following brain injury are&#xD;
      speculative. Hyperbaric oxygen upregulates growth factor receptor sites on human endothelium&#xD;
      and can stimulate healing in hypoxic wounds. It is conceivable that hyperbaric oxygen exerts&#xD;
      similar effects within damaged neuronal tissue but this information is lacking. Stem cells&#xD;
      are present in the adult brain and there is speculation that hyperbaric oxygen may stimulate&#xD;
      these stem cells to generate new neurons, but once again, this information is speculative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this Phase II feasibility prospective clinical trial, we propose to recruit and enroll 70&#xD;
      brain-injured subjects and expose them daily to hyperbaric oxygen at 1.5 atmospheres absolute&#xD;
      for 60 minutes per session, for 60 sessions per subject. This research protocol is the one&#xD;
      most commonly used by practitioners who claim benefit with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Before&#xD;
      and after the 60 hyperbaric oxygen sessions, and at 6 months following completion of&#xD;
      hyperbaric oxygen, outcome measures consisting of neuropsychological testing, functional&#xD;
      measures, health-related quality of life measures, and a neurological examination will be&#xD;
      conducted and analyzed with the subjects serving as their own controls. Important information&#xD;
      regarding a subsequent Phase III clinical trial, including subject recruitment, tolerance and&#xD;
      risk of therapy, dropout rate, and potential benefit or lack of benefit with hyperbaric&#xD;
      oxygen will be reported.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has had a brain injury at least 12 months prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is at least 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Etiology of brain injury: Stroke, anoxia, and trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be able to equalize ears, or have tympanostomy tubes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to complete outcome measures and complies with the research protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Commitment to pay the hospital for hyperbaric oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Glasgow Coma Scores less than 13 at the time of hyperbaric oxygen evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poorly controlled seizures(ie:&gt;1 generalized seizure in past 3 months despite&#xD;
             appropriate anticonvulsant therapy). Pharmacologically-controlled seizures or focal&#xD;
             seizures are not an exclusion to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to participate in outcome assessments (eg: blindness, quadraplegia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Claustrophobia (unwillingness or inability to enter the hyperbaric chamber).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to equalize ears. The patient could elect to have bilateral tympanostomy&#xD;
             tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to protect airway, and or requiring frequent suctioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring tracheostomy will be ineligible due to limitations in autoinflation&#xD;
             of the middle ear space and difficulty to perform airway suctioning in the&#xD;
             single-person chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (beta HCG will be assayed in women who could be pregnant prior to&#xD;
             enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bi-polar disease. We appreciate&#xD;
             that psychiatric problems such as depression and anxiety may follow brain injuries so&#xD;
             we would not exclude patients based on brain-injury induced psychiatric disorders, but&#xD;
             will exclude patients with severe pre-injury psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking lithium (due to the possibility of concomitant toxic side effects with&#xD;
             hyperbaric oxygen therapy, specifically hyperexcitability).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Degenerative Mental Disease (eg: Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, senile dementia,&#xD;
             severe psychiatric disorder (schizophrenia, bi-polar disease, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of chronic debilitating disease (end-stage renal disease, end-stage liver&#xD;
             disease, diabetes with sequelae).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heart failure patients with ejection fractions less than 50% or inability to lay&#xD;
             supine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active malignancy, or prior treatment with cisplatin or bleomycin (there&#xD;
             is some evidence that prior cisplatin and bleomycin therapy may place the patient at&#xD;
             increased risk for serious oxidated stress with inhalation of high concentrations of&#xD;
             oxygen).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of current recreational drug use, either by history, or by comprehensive&#xD;
             urine drug testing (due to confounds on outcome measure interpretation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consumption of more than the equivalent of 12 beers/week habitually.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with hyperbaric oxygen for chronic brain injury within the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential&#xD;
