      This study will test the effectiveness of a new behavioral treatment, called the Child Life&#xD;
      and Attention Skills Program, for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,&#xD;
      inattentive type.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood disorder in which&#xD;
      problems with focusing disrupt a normal life. There are two subtypes of ADHD: combined type&#xD;
      (ADHD-C), which includes symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity or impulsivity, and&#xD;
      inattentive type (ADHD-I), in which symptoms are limited to inattention. The profile of&#xD;
      ADHD-I, including attention deficits, comorbid disorders, social impairments, and&#xD;
      neurocognitive functioning, is sufficiently different from the profile of ADHD-C that&#xD;
      treatments effective for ADHD-C may not also be effective in treating ADHD-I. Most studies of&#xD;
      ADHD treatment evaluate ADHD-C, and there is very little research into treatments aimed&#xD;
      specifically at ADHD-I. The Child Life and Attention Skills (CLAS) Program is a behavioral&#xD;
      program designed specifically for ADHD-I and combines life skills training for the child,&#xD;
      teacher consultation, and parent training techniques adapted from ADHD-C treatments. This&#xD;
      study will compare the effectiveness of the CLAS Program, standard parent training, and&#xD;
      community referrals in treating children with ADHD-I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 11 to 12 weeks, followed by a 5- to 7-month follow-up&#xD;
      period. On the basis of parent and teacher evaluations of each child's behavior, invitations&#xD;
      to participate in screening procedures for the study will be extended to children and their&#xD;
      parents. There will be two screening visits, during which the child will undergo reviews of&#xD;
      medical and developmental history, diagnostic interviews, intelligence testing, academic&#xD;
      achievement testing, and neuropsychological testing. The child and parent will be videotaped&#xD;
      in a series of interactions, and both will complete questionnaires about child functioning,&#xD;
      parent functioning, family functioning, and family relations. The child's teacher and school&#xD;
      principal will also be contacted to ensure that they are willing to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will then be randomly assigned to receive the CLAS Program,&#xD;
      parent-focused training (PFT), or community referrals. The CLAS Program will involve a&#xD;
      half-hour orientation and up to five half-hour weekly meetings with the child's teacher,&#xD;
      therapist, and parent over 11 to 12 weeks. The program will also involve ten 1.5-hour group&#xD;
      sessions for parents, with separate group sessions for children at the same time, and up to&#xD;
      five individual family sessions led by a therapist. Teachers will participate in a&#xD;
      school-home note system for maintaining and rewarding child behavior; parents will be taught&#xD;
      strategies for giving commands, using rewards and consequences, and establishing routines and&#xD;
      organizational schemes; and children will be taught social interaction skills, homework&#xD;
      skills, and organizational skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the PFT group will attend the ten 1.5-hour parent group sessions and up to&#xD;
      five individual family sessions. Participants in the community referrals group will only&#xD;
      receive referrals to community mental health practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo assessments that are similar to those in the screening visit&#xD;
      after completing treatment and again at a follow-up visit 5 to 7 months later. Participants&#xD;
      in the CLAS and PFT groups will continue monthly individual family sessions with a therapist&#xD;
      until undergoing the follow-up assessment.&#xD;
