      In this study, the investigators employed Visante-OCT (Carl Zeiss, USA), an anterior chamber&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography, to monitor the change of anterior chamber dimensions. These&#xD;
      data were correlated to anterior and posterior curvature changes collected with the Oculus&#xD;
      Pentacam (Oculus Inc., Germany), a corneal topographer based on rotating Scheimpflug&#xD;
      principle. To minimize the effect of convergence and excyclotorsion during examination,&#xD;
      topical cycloplegic medication was used. The investigators hypothesized that if there is a&#xD;
      link between ciliary muscle contraction and cornea curvature, installation of cycloplegic&#xD;
      should result in widening of anterior chamber angle to angle distance and flattening of the&#xD;
      cornea curvature data.&#xD;

      Accommodation is an action that enables projections of both distant and near objects to be&#xD;
      brought into clear focus on the retina through changing of diopteric power of crystalline&#xD;
      lens. Although the exact mechanism of accommodation remains inconclusive, most authors agree&#xD;
      that contraction of ciliary muscle plays a pivotal role.1, 2 Recently, accumulating evidence&#xD;
      shows that the effect of ciliary muscle contraction goes beyond merely changing the curvature&#xD;
      of the crystalline lens.3 Ciliary muscle contraction might be responsible for a transient&#xD;
      elongation in axial length during the accommodation response.3 Contraction of ciliary smooth&#xD;
      muscle applied an inward pulling force on the choroid and sclera adjacent to the ciliary body&#xD;
      and cause protrusion at posterior sclera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If ciliary muscle contraction can elicit protrusion at posterior sclera, it is conceivable&#xD;
      that some changes in corneal shape would also occur as the cornea is adjacent to ciliary&#xD;
      muscle. The influence of accommodation on the cornea has therefore been the subject of&#xD;
      several studies with conflicting results. Some authors reported no change4, 5, while others&#xD;
      described significant change in corneal curvature during accommodation6-9. Yasuda and&#xD;
      Yamaguchi9 found central corneal steepening of approximately 0.10 D, using pharmacologically&#xD;
      induced ciliary muscle contraction and corneal topography analysis. Saitoh et al10 reported&#xD;
      that instillation of a sympathomimetic agent to stimulate mydriasis induces significant&#xD;
      flattening of both anterior and posterior cornea curvatures as detected by Orbscan . On the&#xD;
      contrary, Buehren5 and Read4 argue that changes in corneal topography is a result of&#xD;
      excyclotorsional eye movement during accommodation. When this excyclotorsional eye movement&#xD;
      was accounted for in their data analysis, no significant change in corneal topography was&#xD;
      found with accommodation. The effect of ciliary relaxation on the cornea curvature, however,&#xD;
      was less well delineated.&#xD;
