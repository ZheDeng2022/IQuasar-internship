  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchoscopy is performed on a daily basis for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. This&#xD;
      procedure may cause anxiety and discomfort requiring the use of sedative drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators titrate the administration of sedatives using bispectral&#xD;
      analysis of the EEG. The investigators compared 2 drugs, propofol versus midazolam regarding&#xD;
      patient subjective tolerance, recovery of brain function, safety and operator's satisfaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sedation using anxiolytic, hypnotic and /or analgesic drugs is currently used during flexible&#xD;
      bronchoscopy (FB) to facilitate the diagnostic process and improve patient comfort.[The&#xD;
      technique of sedation varies widely and depends primarily on the experience of the chest&#xD;
      physician. FB can also be done without sedation. However, according to a recent survey, 80%&#xD;
      of patients prefer to be sedated during FB and it is also well known that the operator has a&#xD;
      tendency to overstate the tolerance of patients during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of benzodiazepines for sedation undoubtedly enhances the perception and tolerance&#xD;
      during FB and they are by far the most widely used drugs because of their ease of&#xD;
      administration, their speed of action and the possibility to administer an antidote. The&#xD;
      drawback of these sedative agents is related to a high variable individual sensitivity, which&#xD;
      can lead to drug overdose and to severe respiratory depression requiring ventilatory&#xD;
      assistance. In addition, their sedative and amnesic effects might persist several hours after&#xD;
      the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last decade, major advances in technology and pharmacology have resulted in better&#xD;
      cerebral monitoring of anaesthesia with tools like electroencephalographic bispectral index&#xD;
      and synthesis of sedative agents of short duration of action as propofol (P).&#xD;
&#xD;
      P is a lipidic emulsion used intravenously for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. Its&#xD;
      effect begins rapidly and ends faster than midazolam (M). The main advantage of P is&#xD;
      therefore a faster recovery of mnesic, cognitive and motor functions, whereas M induces&#xD;
      anterograde amnesia (1-2 h after bolus) and slower motor reaction . This gives to P a keen&#xD;
      interest in ambulatory practice. While P is commonly and safely used in several&#xD;
      gastroenterological endoscopic procedures, its use by pneumologist is currently hampered by a&#xD;
      lack of expertise and could benefit from collaboration with the anaesthesia team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised trial comparing recovery of brain function and patient subjective&#xD;
      tolerance following FB after administration either of P or M for sedation. Patients and&#xD;
      operators are blinded to the sedative drug, which is administered and titrated by another&#xD;
      chest physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each procedure, the staff consists of a chest physician trained in FB (operator), a&#xD;
      physician in charge of sedation and two nurses for technical assistance and proper data&#xD;
      recording. Before the procedure, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (SaO2) and weight are recorded. The patient is placed in supine position, fitted with a nasal&#xD;
      oxygen cannula and a peripheral intravenous access (18-20 G) for the infusion of&#xD;
      crystalloids. Oxygen is administered only if SaO2 was &lt; 92%. Local anaesthesia is done using&#xD;
      lidocaïne 10 % and 1% in the pharynx and central airways respectively. The sedative drugs&#xD;
      syringes and lines are hidden from the operator by a sheet. Sedation is then started with P&#xD;
      or M according to randomization for any FB as follows: We inject in both groups a 5 ml bolus&#xD;
      of lidocaine 1% (50 mg) (prevention of pain associated with P injection), followed by either&#xD;
      a 40 mg (4 ml) bolus of P or 2 mg of M. The re-injection of 20 mg (2ml) of P or 2 mg of M was&#xD;
      allowed every 2 minutes to achieve and maintain BIS values between 70 and 85 and OAA/S of&#xD;
      3-4. Blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, BIS and OAA/S are monitored continuously&#xD;
      and recorded every 3 minutes during the procedure and at 5, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after&#xD;
      its end. We record the time necessary to achieve the targeted BIS value after the injection&#xD;
      of the sedative drug, the duration of FB, the electroencephalographic recovery time, defined&#xD;
      as the time to reach a BIS value &gt; 90 after the end of FB and total doses of M and P.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty minutes and 24 hours after FB, operator and patient, both blinded to the allocation,&#xD;
      evaluate the tolerance to the FB with visual analogic scales (VAS) (1 mm: excellent&#xD;
      tolerance, 100 mm very low tolerance) to assess 1) the global tolerance of the procedure and&#xD;
      2) the intensity of 4 key symptoms during FB (pain, nausea, breathlessness and cough).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the procedure and 15 and 60 minutes after the procedure, patients are asked to&#xD;
      complete CPT trials to evaluate cognitive recovery.&#xD;
