  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is part of a larger grant funded by the NCI to create an international research&#xD;
      center to study traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). All of the patients enrolled in this&#xD;
      study will be treated at the Cancer Hospital, Fudan University, our sister institution in&#xD;
      Shanghai, China. No patients will be seen at MDACC. This protocol will be overseen by the&#xD;
      Fudan University Institutional Review Board (IRB00002408) which has Federal Wide Assurance&#xD;
      through the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services (Approved: April 25, 2002). The&#xD;
      research nurses have received training at MDACC and will receive regular oversight by MDACC&#xD;
      personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary End Point:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Determine the efficacy of huachansu as measured by progression free survival at 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary End Points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the feasibility and safety of treatment using huachansu in combination with&#xD;
           gemcitabine in patients with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine clinical efficacy by other measures including tumor response, 6-month&#xD;
           survival, and changes in quality of life (QOL) in patients with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Monitor patient blood levels of the three main cardiac glycosides that are in huachansu&#xD;
           (bufalin, cinobufagin, and resibufogenin). This information will provide evidence to&#xD;
           delineate the role of these cardiac glycosides in antitumor activity.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HuaChanSu is a substance used in China to treat different types of cancer. One of the major&#xD;
      elements of the substance is bufalin, which is an ingredient that has been shown to block the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine is designed to disrupt the growth of cancer cells, which may cause cancer cells&#xD;
      to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can receive study treatment, you will have &quot;screening tests.&quot; These tests will&#xD;
      help the study doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. The following&#xD;
      tests will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked questions about your medical history and any symptoms you may have&#xD;
           now.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a complete physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs (temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure), height,&#xD;
           and weight will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily living&#xD;
           (a performance status evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG-a test that measures the electrical activity of&#xD;
           the heart).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To check the status of the cancer, you will have computed tomography (CT) scan(s) and/or&#xD;
           magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of your abdomen, pelvis, and any other areas&#xD;
           where there is disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a short questionnaire that will ask questions about your quality of&#xD;
           life. This will take about 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis will also be done. This will include diagnosis&#xD;
           by a study doctor. The doctor will take your pulse (heart rate), look at your tongue,&#xD;
           and ask you a few questions about your health. The doctor will also use a heart-rate&#xD;
           machine and take a photograph of your tongue. This will allow a more scientific check of&#xD;
           your heart rate and tongue condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have blood (about 3 teaspoons) collected for routine safety tests. This routine&#xD;
           blood draw will include a pregnancy test for women who are able to have children. To be&#xD;
           eligible to take part in this study, the pregnancy test must be negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have 1 biopsy of your tumor tissue to check your cancer type. To collect a&#xD;
           tumor tissue biopsy, an area where cancer is located is numbed with anesthetic, and a&#xD;
           small amount of tumor tissue is withdrawn through a large needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible and decide to take part in this study, you may begin&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 3 participants enrolled on this study will be given HuaChanSu and gemcitabine, to&#xD;
      find out if this dose combination can be tolerated. After the first 3 participants are&#xD;
      enrolled, all other participants will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to&#xD;
      receive HuaChanSu and gemcitabine or gemcitabine and the placebo. The first 20 participants&#xD;
      have an equal chance of receiving HuaChanSu or placebo, but after that point, participants&#xD;
      will have a better chance of being assigned to the group that is responding better to their&#xD;
      study combination. All participants will receive the same dose level of gemcitabine, but you&#xD;
      will not know if you are given HuaChanSu or placebo. However, this information can be found&#xD;
      out if medically necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study drug infusions begin, you will be fitted with a peripherally-inserted&#xD;
      central catheter (PICC) by a specially trained nurse. A PICC is a tube that is inserted into&#xD;
      a vein, either in your arm or under the collarbone, to make it easier to give you gemcitabine&#xD;
      with or without HuaChanSu. This is an outpatient procedure. You will be given a separate&#xD;
      consent form for the insertion of the PICC. It will explain the risks of the procedure and&#xD;
      how to take care of the PICC. Your doses of gemcitabine and either HuaChanSu or a placebo (a&#xD;
      saline [salt water] solution that looks like HuaChanSu but has no effects) will be given&#xD;
      through the PICC while you are on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HuaChanSu (or placebo) will be given as a 2-hour continuous (nonstop) infusion through&#xD;
           the PICC. You will receive the 2-hour dose 5 days a week (5 days in a row each time) for&#xD;
           3 weeks. This will be followed by 1 week of not receiving the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gemcitabine will be given through a needle in a vein over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and&#xD;
           15, followed by 1 week where no study drug is given. Each 4-week treatment period is&#xD;
           called a study &quot;cycle.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Cycle 1 only, you will have extra blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) collected at&#xD;
      various time points for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK testing measures the amount of study&#xD;
      drug in the body at different time points. PK blood samples will be drawn 4 times over a&#xD;
      24-hour period on Day 1 and then once each on Days 7, 14, and 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each new cycle, you will be asked questions about your current health, and you will&#xD;
      have a complete physical exam. Your vital signs and weight will be measured. You will have a&#xD;
      performance status evaluation. You will complete a questionnaire about your quality of life.&#xD;
      The questionnaire will take about 5 minutes to complete. You will also have blood (about 3&#xD;
      teaspoons) drawn for routine safety tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 8 and 15 of each cycle, you will also have blood (about 3 teaspoons) drawn for&#xD;
      routine safety tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 8 weeks (starting in Cycle 3), to check the status of the cancer, you will have CT&#xD;
      and/or MRI scan(s) of your abdomen, pelvis, and any other areas where there is disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue to receive more cycles of treatment, as long as the cancer does not get&#xD;
      worse and intolerable side effects do not occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be taken off this study if the cancer gets worse, intolerable side effects occur,&#xD;
      new information shows that the treatment is not right for you, you are not able to follow the&#xD;
      study rules, the study is stopped, or you decide to leave the study for any reason. If you&#xD;
      are thinking about leaving the study, please tell your study doctor, so that you may be told&#xD;
      how to end treatment safely as well as what other treatment options are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to have a final study visit 4 weeks after your last dose of study drugs.&#xD;
      During this visit, you will have the following tests and procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have blood (about 3 teaspoons) drawn for routine safety tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked questions about your medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a complete physical exam, and your vital signs and weight will be&#xD;
           measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a questionnaire about your quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To check the status of the cancer, you will have computed tomography (CT) scan(s) and/or&#xD;
           magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of your abdomen, pelvis, and any other areas&#xD;
           where there is disease (if these were not performed close to the time that you stopped&#xD;
           study treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. HuaChanSu is a commercially available medication that is&#xD;
      approved by the Chinese FDA for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine is approved&#xD;
      by the Chinese FDA for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In this study, the combination of&#xD;
      these drugs is being used for research only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 80 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at Fudan University&#xD;
      Cancer Hospital.&#xD;
