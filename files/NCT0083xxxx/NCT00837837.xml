      The purpose of this study is to examine the pharmacokinetic parameters of chlorpheniramine in&#xD;
      children and adolescents.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-group, single-center, open-label, one period, bioavailability study. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of chlorpheniramine in a population of&#xD;
      children aged 2 to &lt;12 yrs and adolescents aged 12 to &lt;18 yrs. Twelve blood samples (3.0 mL)&#xD;
      for chlorpheniramine analysis will be drawn at time 0 (pre-dose), and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6,&#xD;
      8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after dosing. Plasma levels of chlorpheniramine will be&#xD;
      determined. The following primary, single-dose PK parameters for chlorpheniramine will be&#xD;
      determined using noncompartmental methods: AUCL, AUCI, and Cmax. The following PK parameters&#xD;
      will also be determined to provide a complete profile of the drug, as appropriate: oral&#xD;
      clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vd) and adjusted for body weight (per kg); time to&#xD;
      reach Cmax (tmax), and apparent elimination constant (Kel) and half-life (t1/2). The PK&#xD;
      parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics.&#xD;

             within the 5th and 95th percentiles in physical growth characteristics (i.e., height&#xD;
             and weight) and BMI based on age and gender,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Symptomatic or asymptomatic children/adolescents as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        i.A prior diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and either symptomatic or asymptomatic at the time&#xD;
        of entry in the study; or ii.Symptoms of an acute Upper Respiratory Infection (URI); or&#xD;
        iii.No symptoms of an acute URI, but at risk for developing an acute URI as evidenced by&#xD;
        the following frequency, crowding, and exposure criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Frequency: a history of frequent URIs defined as &gt;6 infections/yr for children aged 2&#xD;
             to &lt;6 yrs and as &gt;4 infections per year for adolescents aged 6 to &lt;18 yrs;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Crowding: living in a home with ≥4 persons, or sleeping in the same bedroom with ≥3&#xD;
             persons;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure: the presence of another family member in the household who is ill with a&#xD;
             URI, or a child in the family that is attending preschool, or attending school with ≥6&#xD;
             children in the class; c.Except for allergic rhinitis or a URI, children/adolescents&#xD;
             are in normal physical health (i.e., no clinically significant systemic disease) as&#xD;
             judged by the Investigator upon physical examination of the subject; d.Subjects do not&#xD;
             require concomitant medication except for low-dose inhaled glucocorticoids for&#xD;
             allergic rhinitis or mild concomitant asthma, if dose is stabilized before entry in&#xD;
             the study (i.e., dose is not changed for one month prior to or during the study), and&#xD;
             inhaled short-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonists for concomitant asthma, as needed;&#xD;
