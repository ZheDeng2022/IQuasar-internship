      A prospective, multicenter, open-label, safety and preliminary efficacy study of the surgical&#xD;
      implantation of OPKO's glaucoma drainage device (AquashuntTM) in patients with refractory&#xD;
      chronic forms of open angle glaucoma (OAG). The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the surgical implantation, safety and preliminary efficacy of the AquashuntTM after&#xD;
      implantation in patients with refractory chronic forms of OAG&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients of either sex will be eligible for the study if all of the following criteria are&#xD;
        met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must be aged 18 years or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have a diagnosis of chronic forms of open angle glaucoma in the study&#xD;
             eye, which is uncontrolled on maximum tolerated medical treatment with ocular&#xD;
             hypotensive medications and has failed glaucoma surgery or is not considered a&#xD;
             reasonable candidate for traditional surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient's documented IOP must be considered by the treating physician to be too&#xD;
             high for their glaucoma status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have BCVA of between 20/400 and Light Perception, or no light perception&#xD;
             with pain, in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have a BCVA in the fellow eye, which is better than that of the study&#xD;
             eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must be mentally competent and willing to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must be willing to return for all study visits and assessments for at least 3&#xD;
             years after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will not be eligible for the study if any of the following criteria are present:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with a diagnosis of glaucoma other than open angle glaucoma including active&#xD;
             uveitic, active neovascular or recent traumatic glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with clinically significant corneal disease including corneal dystrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any previous ocular surgery other than trabeculectomy, trabeculoplasty or cataract&#xD;
             surgery and any surgery (including laser) within previous 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with an Anterior Chamber configuration that puts the patient at high risk for&#xD;
             the development of angle closure glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with any recent (within previous 30 days), or current, ocular/periocular&#xD;
             inflammation or infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with a history of extensive keloid formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients who will need ancillary procedures in the study eye at the time of&#xD;
             implantation or during the initial one year study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients who have any known intolerance or hypersensitivity to topical anesthetics,&#xD;
             mydriatics or components of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients who are unable to interrupt their anti-coagulant, anti-platelet or NSAID&#xD;
             (including aspirin) therapy for at least 3 weeks prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients who have within the previous 3 months, are currently, or intend to&#xD;
             participate in a study with any investigational agent (drug or device).&#xD;
