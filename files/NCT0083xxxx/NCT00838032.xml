      Quetiapine fumarate is indicated for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia in China.&#xD;
      Lots of clinical experience and evidence has demonstrated its efficacy and tolerability for&#xD;
      the patient population. Some evidence showed that quetiapine fumarate could control&#xD;
      aggression and agitation within 1 week, which is appropriate for the acute treatment of&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia. PANSS and MOAS are the common measurements for the efficacy of&#xD;
      psychotic symptoms controlling in the clinical trials. Generally, 2 weeks are the appropriate&#xD;
      timeframe for the evaluation of clinical effect of agitation and aggression symptoms&#xD;
      controlling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In adult patients with schizophrenia, quetiapine fumarate is licensed to maximal dose of&#xD;
      750mg/day. The target dose of quetiapine fumarate recommended in the manufacturer's&#xD;
      prescribing information is 300-450 mg/day in China, though similar efficacy for quetiapine&#xD;
      fumarate (600 mg/day), olanzapine (15 mg/day) and Risperidone (5 mg/day) was reported in a&#xD;
      small, randomised, rater-blinded trial. Because of the low incidence of EPS, the limitation&#xD;
      potential for weight gain and prolactin elevation, quetiapine fumarate should be well&#xD;
      tolerated in this sensitive patient population with higher dose (600mg/day-750mg/day)&#xD;
      (Peuskens 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of quetiapine fumarate&#xD;
      with daily dose 600-750mg/day in improving agitation and aggression for the treatment of&#xD;
      Chinese acute schizophrenic patients hospitalised for acute phase over a treatment period of&#xD;
      2 weeks&#xD;

      Agitation and aggression are the common symptoms in the acute schizophrenic patients. Under&#xD;
      these symptoms, schizophrenic patients could be harmful to themselves as well as the&#xD;
      environment and people surrounding. Patients' agitation and aggression are also part of the&#xD;
      reason for their hospitalisation. Therefore, rapid controlling of agitation and aggression&#xD;
      for the patients is critical to ensure their treatment adherence, so that patients could stay&#xD;
      with their treatment for a long time. Some studies have already provided the methods for&#xD;
      rapid control, of which haloperidol is a common medication. However, use of haloperidol will&#xD;
      bring patients prominent adverse reaction, such as extropyromidal symptoms etc., which will&#xD;
      lead to the poor adherence of patients and caregivers and finally increase the treatment risk&#xD;
      rather than benefit, such as relapse, re-hospitalization, and poor social functioning etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quetiapine fumarate, a dibenzothiazepine derivative, is an atypical antipsychotic drug&#xD;
      approved for treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania, and bipolar depression by FDA in many&#xD;
      countries worldwide. In China, it has been used for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia for approximately 10 years. Quetiapine has the advantage of broad symptoms&#xD;
      controlling, individualized dose range, and most important, good efficacy and tolerability in&#xD;
      the acute treatment for schizophrenic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;

      2 weeks This is a 2-week, single-blinded, randomised, parallel-group haloperidol-controlled&#xD;
      pilot study. After given of informed consent and undergoing screening procedures, the&#xD;
      patients will be allocated to study treatment on Day 1. Patients should have a diagnosis of&#xD;
      schizophrenia by CCMD-3 criteria with MOAS total score at least 10. Eligible patients will be&#xD;
      randomised into quetiapine group or haloperidol group with 1-week dose titration (at least&#xD;
      600 mg/day for quetiapine and 8 mg/day for haloperidol after Day 7). After that, the patients&#xD;
      should be treated by the defined dose range for another week.&#xD;
