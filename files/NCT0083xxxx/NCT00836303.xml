  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effectiveness of a culturally-responsive intervention to increase&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among Latino immigrants in a primary care clinic setting of&#xD;
      a large municipal Hospital in New York City. propose a randomized, control trial to determine&#xD;
      if a video-based intervention, that educates and activates the patient and the provider via&#xD;
      the patient, will increase rates of CRC screening referrals compared to a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer remains one of the most prevalent cancers among the general population, as&#xD;
      well as in the Latino population, in the United States. There are serious disparities in CRC&#xD;
      screening rates between different races and socio-demographic populations (American Cancer&#xD;
      Society: Colorectal Cancer Facts and Figures - Special Edition 2005). Latino immigrants are&#xD;
      one of the populations most affected by the lack of screening, reducing their relative&#xD;
      benefit from preventive CRC services. This study will use a modified version of an&#xD;
      intervention developed and studied by Pignone (11), with changes made to be tailored&#xD;
      specifically to the Latino immigrant population. The outcomes measured will include referral&#xD;
      for CRC screening and adherence with providers' referrals. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      will measure screening rates for other cancer screening tests to assess if the CRC&#xD;
      intervention displaces or facilitates other cancer screening. A sample of Latino immigrants&#xD;
      seeking care at the primary care clinic of Bellevue Hospital will be accrued through a&#xD;
      process of consecutive sampling until reaching the proposed sample size of 101 patients in&#xD;
      each group (alpha 0.05 and power of 80%). To analyze the effectiveness of the intervention&#xD;
      the investigators will use the z-test and will report the difference in proportion between&#xD;
      the intervention and the control group with a 95% CI, adjusting for intra-class correlations&#xD;
      and covariates. A repeated measurement analysis with logistic regression will be used to&#xD;
      examine the effects of covariates.&#xD;

    <description>Research assistants showed intervention patients a colorectal cancer educational video in Spanish on a portable personal digital video display device while the patients were waiting for their visit. The 11-minute video was developed by the National Alliance for Hispanic Health and was accompanied by a brochure with key information from the video {http://www.hispanichealth.org/publication/}. Intervention patients were also given a one-page reminder to hand to their physicians notifying them 1) of their patients' eligibility for colorectal cancer screening, and 2) of their patients' receipt of CRC educational material.</description>
