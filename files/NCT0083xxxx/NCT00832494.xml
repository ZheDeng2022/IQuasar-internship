  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to test the addition of DMXAA (now known as ASA404) to carboplatin&#xD;
      and paclitaxel in patients with NSCLC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of DMXAA in&#xD;
      combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with locally advanced and metastatic&#xD;
      (Stage IIIb and IV) non-small cell lung cancer. The phase Ib part of the study evaluated dose&#xD;
      levels of DMXAA at 600 mg/m2, 1200 mg/m2 and 1800 mg/m2. In the phase II part of the study,&#xD;
      patients were randomized to receive carboplatin and paclitaxel alone or in combination with&#xD;
      ASA404 1200 mg/m2. An additional single-arm study was undertaken to evaluate further patients&#xD;
      at the 1800 mg/m2 dose level.&#xD;
