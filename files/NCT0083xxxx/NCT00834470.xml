  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Ketamine seems an obvious choice in the setting of an emergency department&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ketamine leads to increased production of salivary and tracheal secretions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antisialagogues(atropine)therefore have been recommended as a routine adjunct&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We compare atropine with placebo as an adjunct to ketamine sedation in children&#xD;
           undergoing primary closure of lacerated wound&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The degree of secretion was significantly less in the atropine group compared with the&#xD;
      control group at the end of the procedure (VAS score: 16.5 ± 9.9 vs. 27.0 ± 15.9, atropine&#xD;
      vs. control, p = 0.00). The change in the degree of secretion between the start and end of&#xD;
      the procedure was significantly greater in the atropine group than in the control group (p =&#xD;
      0.00) (Fig. 2). However, the frequency of hypersalivation as predefined (VAS score ≥50) did&#xD;
      not differ between the groups (p = 0.06).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only complication that differed significantly between the two groups was tachycardia (p &gt;&#xD;
      0.05). Complications such as aspiration, laryngospasm, and apnea were not documented in the&#xD;
      hospital. There were fewer interventions for hypersalivation in the atropine group, but the&#xD;
      difference was not significant (p &gt; 0.05). As interventions, O2 administration and&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation were not needed. After discharge, the control patients tended to have&#xD;
      more complaints of nausea, vomiting, and ataxia, although the difference was not significant&#xD;
      (p &gt; 0.05) Heart rate was increased significantly in the atropine group (p = 0.00). The&#xD;
      frequency of tachycardia according to patient age was also significantly higher in the&#xD;
      atropine group than in the control group (p = 0.00)&#xD;
