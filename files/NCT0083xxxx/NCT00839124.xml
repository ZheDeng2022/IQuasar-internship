      This will be a single center, open label study comparing baseline characteristics of&#xD;
      recovered sputum cells (collected on screening day) to those of cells recovered 6 hours after&#xD;
      inhalational challenge with 20,000 EU Clinical Center Reference Endotoxin (CCRE, a component&#xD;
      of air pollution)) within each group as well as cross group comparisons between individuals&#xD;
      with allergic asthma (AA's)and normal volunteers (NV's). The primary objective of this study&#xD;
      is to test the hypothesis that persons with allergic asthma will have an increased neutrophil&#xD;
      response to challenge with 20,000 EU CCRE compared to normal volunteers. Secondary objectives&#xD;
      include post CCRE comparison between AA's and NV's with regard to changes in airway cells and&#xD;
      blood as well as changes in mucociliary clearance (MCC) in response to inhalation of 20,000&#xD;
      EU CCRE.&#xD;
