      The purpose of the study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  recruit subjects with untreated sleep apnea; assess overnight changes in their blood and&#xD;
           urine chemicals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  review the overnight changes in blood and urine chemicals after they have been treated&#xD;
           for sleep apnea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess the overnight changes in blood and urine chemicals in healthy individuals with no&#xD;
           sleep problems&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  compare the amount of fat in the belly using a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner&#xD;
           on all subjects&#xD;

      The overall goal of this project is to address the postulate that the optimal molecular&#xD;
      signature for the common disorder obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is change in relevant&#xD;
      biomarkers during the sleep period. In sleep apnea, events lead to sleep fragmentation and&#xD;
      cyclical deoxygenation/reoxygenation. It is proposed that these changes will lead to&#xD;
      molecular consequences can be detected by assessing biomarkers in blood. To determine which&#xD;
      changes are due to OSA and which to circadian/sleep mechanisms, studies will be done in&#xD;
      patients with OSA before and after effective treatment with Continuous Positive Airway&#xD;
      Pressure (CPAP) and also in controls of similar visceral adiposity without OSA. Multiple&#xD;
      assessments of biomarkers will be made before, during and after sleep. Since it is proposed&#xD;
      that the magnitude of these dynamic changes across the sleep period will be affected by&#xD;
      degree of visceral obesity and be greater in OSA subjects with cardiovascular comorbidities,&#xD;
      studies will be done in 4 groups of subjects: lean and obese with and without such&#xD;
      morbidities. In assessing biomarkers the primary outcome variables will be: urinary&#xD;
      isoprostanes (oxidative stress); plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) (inflammation);&#xD;
      plasma norepinephrine (sympathetic activation); and free fatty acids. Secondary biomarkers&#xD;
      will be: Interleukin 6 (IL-6), urinary norepinephrine; urinary normetanephrine; glucose,&#xD;
      Intercellular Adhesion Molecule (ICAM), leptin. To complement assessment of circulating&#xD;
      biomarkers, an approach utilizing a cellular window will be used. Monocytes will be separated&#xD;
      from each blood sample (before, during and after sleep) and RNA extracted. Expression of key&#xD;
      genes will be assessed by RT-PCR and microarray studies will be performed in a subset of&#xD;
      subjects to assess changes in expression of all genes as a result of OSA. A particular focus&#xD;
      will be investigating differences between individuals with OSA with and without&#xD;
      cardiovascular comorbidities. Three aspects will be evaluated: a)whether individuals with&#xD;
      comorbidities have more oxidative stress and inflammatory change for equivalent degrees of&#xD;
      OSA than individuals without such comorbidities; b) whether individuals with comorbidities&#xD;
      have lower levels of protective mechanisms-melatonin (an anti-oxidant secreted during sleep),&#xD;
      IL-10 (antiinflammatory); c) different gene variants based on a genetic association study&#xD;
      using a recently developed CV SNP array. Finally, data will be used to determine whether&#xD;
      there is a diagnostic urine and/or blood test for OSA.&#xD;
