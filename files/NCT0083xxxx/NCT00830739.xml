      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic nicotine exposure through cigarette smoking affects the level of the brain&#xD;
           chemical dopamine. Smokers who attempt to quit experience lower levels of dopamine,&#xD;
           which increases anxiety and triggers nicotine cravings that make quitting more&#xD;
           difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Varenicline (Chantix) is a smoking cessation medication that is designed to reduce&#xD;
           nicotine craving and withdrawal by slightly increasing levels of dopamine in the brain.&#xD;
           Research has shown that varenicline is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective treatment&#xD;
           for nicotine dependence, but researchers are interested in learning more about how it&#xD;
           affects the brain and its function. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and&#xD;
           electroencephalography (EEG) will help researchers study the brain s response to&#xD;
           nicotine and varenicline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To explore how varenicline affects brain function and behavioral performance in current&#xD;
      smokers and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 55 years of age who are either current smokers (10 or more&#xD;
      cigarettes per day) or healthy nonsmoking volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will involve nine testing and research visits over 5 to 6 weeks. The first&#xD;
           visit will provide an initial assessment and training on the tasks that will be&#xD;
           completed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Six testing visits will involve fMRI and EEG measurements of brain activity. Each visit&#xD;
           will contain two 2-hour scanning sessions, and each session will involve thinking tests.&#xD;
           During these visits, participants will receive varenicline and placebo tablets, and wear&#xD;
           nicotine patches and placebo patches that do not contain nicotine. Participants will not&#xD;
           be told which tablet or patch they are given. This is a crossover study so all&#xD;
           participants eventually get nicotine and placebo, as well as varenicline and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two other visits involve different thinking tasks. These visits will not require fMRI or&#xD;
           EEG scans.&#xD;

      Objective. Chronic nicotine exposure is thought to lead to alterations in the dopamine (DA)&#xD;
      system that leaves smokers in a hypo-dopaminergic state during periods of abstinence.&#xD;
      Varenicline (Chantix), a new efficacious smoking cessation medication, is thought to lead to&#xD;
      a modest but sustained increase of DA release thereby reducing nicotine craving and&#xD;
      withdrawal. While numerous studies have shown that varenicline is a safe, well-tolerated, and&#xD;
      effective pharmacological treatment for nicotine dependence, studies exploring the&#xD;
      neurophysiological impact of this drug in the human brain have not been conducted. This&#xD;
      protocol will utilize an array of reward processing and cognitive control tasks to explore&#xD;
      the effects of subtle DA manipulations (induced by smoking cessation, transdermal nicotine,&#xD;
      and varenicline) on brain function and behavioral performance. Brain function will be&#xD;
      assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population. There will be two study populations: 1) healthy nicotine-dependent adults&#xD;
      who smoke 10 or more cigarettes per day; and 2) healthy non-smoking, non-drug dependent&#xD;
      controls. Participants must be generally healthy, right-handed, male or&#xD;
      non-pregnant/non-lactating females between the ages of 18-55.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. After being medically cleared and giving informed consent, each participant will&#xD;
      complete several imaging visits (6 visits, on separate days) before and after taking&#xD;
      varenicline. Two of these visits will take place before varenicline administration&#xD;
      (baseline), two visits after a two-week varenicline dosing period (post-varenicline), and&#xD;
      another two after a two-week placebo-pill period (post-placebo-pill). Each set of two scans&#xD;
      will involve the randomized, double blind administration of a nicotine transdermal or placebo&#xD;
      patch. fMRI and EEG data will be collected after patch application and will involve several&#xD;
      tasks designed to probe brain regions in a corticolimbic circuit that may mediate aspects of&#xD;
      reward-processing, learning, attention, goal-directed behaviors, and drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures. This study involves assessing neurophysiological and behavior differences&#xD;
      between cohorts (smokers vs. non-smokers) and conditions (nicotine vs. placebo-patch;&#xD;
      baseline vs. varenicline vs. placebo-pill). The primary outcome measures used to ascertain&#xD;
      these differences will be: 1) percentage change in fMRI BOLD signal during performance of&#xD;
      cognitive control and reward processing tasks; 2) change in ERP component (e.g.,&#xD;
      error-related negativity) amplitudes; 3) behavioral measures during task performance&#xD;
      including reaction times and error rates; 4) scores on mood, personality, and smoking&#xD;
      questionnaires; and 5) variations in genes related to nicotinic receptors and DA functioning.&#xD;
