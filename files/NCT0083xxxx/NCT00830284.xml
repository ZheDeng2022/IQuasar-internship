      Lung units which participate in gas exchange are known as 'recruited' lung. Patients with&#xD;
      lung injury suffer from a proportion of units which do not participate in gas exchange (i.e.&#xD;
      the derecruited state), which results in impaired gas exchange and induces an inflammatory&#xD;
      cascade. Currently, there is no clinical practice guideline in our intensive care unit&#xD;
      regarding lung recruitment strategies for children with lung injury. While many studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated efficacy (ability to open the lung) and safety of recruitment maneuvers in&#xD;
      adults, no such studies have been performed in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is therefore to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a&#xD;
      recruitment protocol designed to maximally recruit collapsed lung in children with acute lung&#xD;
      injury. Each study patient will follow a recruitment protocol (see Appendix 2). Two&#xD;
      'controls' will be utilized in this study: baseline ventilation (no recruitment maneuver) and&#xD;
      the open lung approach (a sustained inflation followed by increased PEEP). Efficacy will be&#xD;
      defined as an improvement in lung volume (as measured by nitrogen washout and electrical&#xD;
      impedance tomography), and by an improvement in measured arterial partial pressure of oxygen.&#xD;
      Safety will be defined as the incidence of barotrauma and hemodynamic consequences which&#xD;
      occur during the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary purpose of this study will be to further validate electrical impedance tomography&#xD;
      (EIT) as a non-invasive tool describing the lung parenchyma by comparing it to an accepted&#xD;
      standard method of measuring lung volumes, the multiple breath nitrogen washout technique.&#xD;
      Validation of EIT would allow clinicians to have a non-invasive image of a patient's lungs&#xD;
      without the risks imposed by radiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information we learn will be instrumental in defining an optimal strategy for lung&#xD;
      recruitment in children with lung injury.&#xD;

      I. Introduction A. Background Lung units which participate in gas exchange are known as&#xD;
      'recruited' lung. Patients with lung injury suffer from a proportion of units which do not&#xD;
      participate in gas exchange (i.e. the derecruited state), at times resulting in impaired gas&#xD;
      exchange. Derecruitment of alveoli may also cause intrapulmonary shunting and worsen lung&#xD;
      injury through atelectotrauma7. Outcomes in acute respiratory distress syndrome have improved&#xD;
      significantly Is this really true? since clinicians have begun to employ lung protective&#xD;
      strategies, including low-tidal volume ventilation and permissive hypercapnea8, 9. However,&#xD;
      low-tidal volume ventilation has been recognized to decrease recruited lung volume, a&#xD;
      phenomenon which persists despite the aggressive positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)&#xD;
      strategy employed in ARDSNet studies4. Atelectasis associated with low-tidal volume&#xD;
      ventilation is relieved through the use of so-called sign breaths, or recruitment breaths10.&#xD;
      Further, the proportion of lung remaining in the derecruited state may contribute to the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)11. In&#xD;
      adults, several strategies have been utilized to recruit the lung: sustained inflation (SI)&#xD;
      and the maximal recruitment strategy. The so-called open lung approach (OLA) includes an SI&#xD;
      followed by the setting of PEEP to the measured lower inflection point of the PV curve. An&#xD;
      alternative approach to setting PEEP is a decremental PEEP titration, which includes the&#xD;
      sequential lowering of PEEP until a predetermined decrement in PaO2 or SaO2 occurs. Studies&#xD;
      which have not included a strategy for maintaining lung recruitment following a recruitment&#xD;
      maneuver have all been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of lung recruitment in the long-term course of ARDS is not yet clear. It is clear&#xD;
      that lung recruitment is most effective earlier in the course of ALI/ARDS. Grasso et al&#xD;
      demonstrated that patients who received a recruitment maneuver on day 1±0.3 of ARDS could be&#xD;
      recruited, versus patients recruited on day 7±1. Similarly, Gattinoni et al11 and Crotti et&#xD;
      al5 found limited recruitment in patients who were well along in the course of ARDS. Borges&#xD;
      et al,6 Tugrul et al,12 and Girgis et al all recruited patients early in the course of ARDS,&#xD;
      and each found marked lung recruitment, on average, in all the patients studied. Each of&#xD;
      these studied demonstrated an ability to improve oxygen saturations and (sometimes studied)&#xD;
      end-expiratory lung volume. While no study has examined the effect of this change on&#xD;
      morbidity or mortality, in children hypoxemia is known to be a common cause of morbidity.&#xD;
      Importantly in children, treatment of hypoxia often drives escalating ventilator settings,&#xD;
      the use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) or the use of extra-corporeal&#xD;
      membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Early recruitment in children with ALI/ARDS may prevent the need&#xD;
      for escalation of care towards these more invasive, and risk-imposing therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no clinical practice guidelines or standard of care regarding lung&#xD;
      recruitment strategies for children with lung injury. To date, no studies have been performed&#xD;
      in children documenting the efficacy or safety of any of the strategies utilized in intensive&#xD;
      care. The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of sustained&#xD;
      inflation and maximal recruitment maneuvers in children with lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Lung Recruitment Maneuvers&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sustained Inflations (SI) Sustained inflations (SI) are commonly utilized in the&#xD;
           intensive care unit as a recruitment maneuver. In SI, the patient is given a prolonged&#xD;
           positive pressure breath (usually between 30 and 45 cm H2O) lasting between 15 and 40&#xD;
           seconds. Clinically, this maneuver is applied following a derecruitment, such as&#xD;
           suctioning, or when the patient exhibits hypoxemia. This strategy is currently employed&#xD;
           in the Children's Hospital Boston Medical-Surgical Intensive Care Unit in some patients&#xD;
           with lung injury, though there is no published evidence of its safety or efficacy in&#xD;
           children. Could we put the 3 SI studies in premature infants that use 20-40 cmH20&#xD;
           followed by CPAP? 1 was a rabbit study. The studies described below regard sustained&#xD;
           inflation recruitment maneuvers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Tugrul, et al12 studied the effect of SI in 24 adults with ARDS. SI included 45 cm&#xD;
                H2O for 30 seconds, followed by a decremental PEEP titration from 20 cm H2O down,&#xD;
                titrating to saturations. P/F ratio increased &gt;200 in 11/24 patients, which&#xD;
                persisted at 6 hours post-maneuver in 9/24 patients. Barotrauma was not observed in&#xD;
                any patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Richard, et al studied4 the effect of SI (45 cm H2O for 15 seconds) in 10 adults&#xD;
                with ARDS ventilated with a low-tidal volume strategy. The maneuver induced a&#xD;
                significant increase in recruited lung volumes (175±108 ml pre-maneuver versus&#xD;
                254±137 ml post-maneuver). This improvement was associated with an increase in&#xD;
                arterial oxygen saturations. There was no report of sustainability of recruitment,&#xD;
                nor of adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Lapinski, et al13 studied the safety and efficacy of the SI maneuver in 14 adults&#xD;
                with ARDS. The pressure utilized in the maneuver was the lesser of 45 cm H2O or the&#xD;
                plateau pressure utilized in 12 mL/kg tidal volume breaths; the maneuver was held&#xD;
                for 20 seconds. Oxygen saturations increased from 86.9 ± 5.5 to 94.3 ± 2.3% by 10&#xD;
                minutes, which was maintained at 4 hours in 10/14 patients. The four in whom&#xD;
                saturations fell had PEEP levels below 10 cm H2O. The systolic blood pressure&#xD;
                decreased during the 20 second inflation in some patients, mean change of 6.9 mm&#xD;
                Hg, which reversed rapidly following release of the maneuver in all patients. No&#xD;
                barotrauma was noted in any patient at 24 hour followup.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Pelosi, et al10 studied the effect of three consecutive 'sigh' breaths (one with&#xD;
                plateau pressure of 45 cm H2O but of normal duration) in 10 adults with ARDS. After&#xD;
                1 hour of 3 sigh breaths per minute, end-expiratory lung volume (measured by He&#xD;
                dilution) increased from 1.49±0.58 to 1.91±0.67 L, and an increase in PaO2 from&#xD;
                92.8±18.6 to 137.6±23.9 mm Hg, compared with the same ventilator settings without&#xD;
                sigh breaths. Lung elastance and ventilation also increased. No adverse effects&#xD;
                were noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Toth, et al studied the cardiac and respiratory changes which occur in SI (40 cm&#xD;
                H2O for 40 seconds) in 18 adults with ARDS. The PaO2 increased from pre-recruiting&#xD;
                maneuver to following the 60 minute followup period (203±108 vs. 322±101 mm Hg, p &lt;&#xD;
                .001). Cardiac index (CI) and the intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV) decreased&#xD;
                following the recruiting maneuver (CI, 3.90±1.04 vs. 3.62±0.91 L/min/m2, p &lt; .05;&#xD;
                ITBVI, 832±205 vs. 795±188 mL/m2, p &lt; .05). There was no correlation with CI and&#xD;
                mean arterial pressure, and no significant changes occurred in mean arterial blood&#xD;
                pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. In perhaps the largest study of sustained inflations in the protective ventilation&#xD;
                era, Meade, et al14 studied 983 adults with ARDS utilizing lung protective&#xD;
                strategies (tidal volumes 6 mL/kg) in both groups. The experimental group utilized&#xD;
                SI recruitment maneuvers (40 cm H2O for 40 seconds), higher levels of PEEP&#xD;
                (14.6±3.4 in the so-called 'lung open ventilation' group versus 9.8±2.7 in the&#xD;
                control group), and higher plateau pressures (30.2±6.3 versus 24.9±5.1 cm H2O) than&#xD;
                the control group, which did not utilize recruitment maneuvers. While there was no&#xD;
                difference in all-cause mortality, the experimental group had lower rates of&#xD;
                refractory hypoxemia (4.6% vs 10.2%; RR, 0.54), death with refractory hypoxemia&#xD;
                (4.2% vs 8.9%; RR, 0.56), and less frequent use of escalated therapies (defined as&#xD;
                high frequency ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide, jet ventilation, or&#xD;
                extra-corporeal support) (5.1% vs 9.3%; RR, 0.6). This lends credence to the notion&#xD;
                that effective recruitment of children early in acute lung injury may avert&#xD;
                escalation of therapy and decrease the mortality due to severe hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pressure control ventilation (PCV) recruitment maneuver In contrast to a SI, ventilating&#xD;
           patients with increased plateau pressures and increased PEEP levels has also been used&#xD;
           as a recruiting maneuver. In this case, the patient is temporarily placed on higher&#xD;
           ventilator pressures than would be used to ventilate a patient otherwise. A combination&#xD;
           of PEEP and plateau pressures helps to recruit atelectatic alveoli. Pressure control&#xD;
           ventilation is the mode of choice in such patients because in it the plateau pressure is&#xD;
           set, and therefore kept constant (in contrast to volume controlled ventilation). Thus, a&#xD;
           known plateau pressure (which participates in lung recruitment) is delivered. Following&#xD;
           are the salient studies utilizing a PCV recruitment maneuver. ? Athanasios &quot;TLC&#xD;
           maneuver&quot; in anesthetized children? Small study treating intraoperative atelectisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Borges, Amato, et al6 have performed the most convincing and complete study of the&#xD;
                maximal recruitment maneuver to date. In it, they studied 26 adults early in the&#xD;
                course of ARDS comparing the open lung approach (including SI of 40 cm H2O for 40&#xD;
                seconds, followed by PEEP set at Pflex + 2 cm H2O, described below) with the&#xD;
                maximal recruitment strategy, performed in sequence. Maximal recruitment was&#xD;
                defined as a PaO2 plus PaCO2 exceeding 400 mm Hg, indicative of minimal&#xD;
                intrapulmonary shunting. The strategy included pressure controlled ventilation of&#xD;
                15 cm H2O, with PEEP increased in 5 cm H2O increments every 5 minutes (maximum PEEP&#xD;
                45 cm H2O) until maximal recruitment was achieved. Maximal recruitment was achieved&#xD;
                in 24/26 patients, two thirds of which were achieved by a PEEP of 30 cm H2O.&#xD;
                Utilizing a PEEP titration to maintain lung recruitment (see below), PaO2 remained&#xD;
                above 400 (lungs fully recruited) in all patients at 6 hours. The procedure was&#xD;
                tolerated hemodynamically in all patients and the long-term incidence of barotrauma&#xD;
                in study patients (7.7%) was lower than the recognized incidence in ARDSNet studies&#xD;
                (10-11%)8.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Crotti, et al5 studied five adults with ALI/ARDS with varying plauteau pressures&#xD;
                (10, 15, 20, 30, 35, 40, 45 cm H2O) and PEEP levels (5, 10, 15, 20 cm H2O).&#xD;
                End-inspiratory and end-expiratory thoracic CT imaging was obtained with each&#xD;
                combination of plateau pressure and PEEP. Percentage of lung recruited (as&#xD;
                determined radiographically) increased in a nearly linear fashion with increasing&#xD;
                plateau pressures (Figure 1). The maximal opening frequency occurred at 20 cm H2O,&#xD;
                suggesting that plateau pressures exceeding 20 cm H2O would be most beneficial in&#xD;
                lung recruitment. No measures of gas exchange or adverse events were studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Foti, et al15 compared changes in oxygenation and end-expiratory lung volumes at&#xD;
                increasing PEEP levels with superimposed volume controlled ventilation versus a&#xD;
                sustained inflation maneuver in 15 adults with ARDS. Although recruitment was&#xD;
                variable (due to the use of VCV, hence variable plateau pressures), he found that&#xD;
                maximal increase in oxygenation occurred at high sustained levels of PEEP (mean 16&#xD;
                cm H2O for 30 minutes) when compared with 30 second recruitment maneuvers and low&#xD;
                PEEP (mean of 9 cm H2O). The PEEP/plateau protocol was not associated with any&#xD;
                hemodynamic alterations, as with the sustained inflation maneuver.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Villagra, et al, studied a recruiting maneuver utilizing 2 minutes of ventilation&#xD;
                using pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) in 18 adults with early ARDS. For the&#xD;
                RM, PEEP was set 3 cm H2O above the upper inflection point of the PV curve, and&#xD;
                peak pressures set to 50. Importantly, RM peak pressures did not differ&#xD;
                significantly from baseline ventilation (43.6±7.6 pre-RM, 47±4.5 during RM, and&#xD;
                42.8±7.1 cm H2O post-RM), although PEEP did (14±1.3 pre-RM vs 30±4.9 cm H2O). The&#xD;
                investigators did not find a significant difference in PaO2 following the&#xD;
                recruiting maneuver (127±63 pre-RM, 162±108 during, and 149±85 cm H2O post-RM).&#xD;
                This finding implies several important findings regarding lung recruitment. First,&#xD;
                the peak pressure represents a significant determinant in lung recruitment. By&#xD;
                contrast, Borges, et al were able to fully recruit all 18 ARDS patients by using&#xD;
                driving pressures differed significantly from pre-RM in the maximal recruitment&#xD;
                phase (50-60 cm H2O during recruitment vs 30 cm H2O at baseline). Further, the&#xD;
                recruiting maneuver utilized here was only 2 minutes, versus the incremental&#xD;
                titration utilized by Borges which lasted 4 minutes in each phase. While not&#xD;
                systematically studied, the lack of significant improvement in PaO2 post-RM found&#xD;
                in this study suggests that recruitment utilizing PCV may be a function of time and&#xD;
                peak pressures utilized in the RM.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Medoff,3 et al presented a single patient with refractory hypoxemia. Management&#xD;
                included repeated sustained inflations with PEEP set just above Pflex based on the&#xD;
                PV curve. A recruiting maneuver including 20 cm H2O of PEEP and 40 cm H2O&#xD;
                distending pressure for 2 minutes was performed. The patient exhibited marked&#xD;
                improvement in oxygenation and near-complete recruitment of the lung by CT scan&#xD;
                (see Figure 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. While all of the aforementioned studies achieved successful recruitment, Gattinoni,&#xD;
                et al11 studied 68 adults with late ARDS (5±6 days ventilation at enrollment) who&#xD;
                failed to successfully recruit. Recruitment maneuvers included pressure-controlled&#xD;
                ventilation with peak pressure of 45 cm H2O, PEEP of 5 cm H2O, and respiratory rate&#xD;
                of 10. PEEP levels were subsequently applied in random order, between 5 and 15 cm&#xD;
                H2O. He found that study patients had only 13±11% recruitable lung by CT scan.&#xD;
                Amongst all patients, he found that 24% of lung tissue was non-recruitable, even at&#xD;
                airway pressures of 45 cm H2O. No markers of gas exchange were measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to note three aspects of this study which are likely responsible for the&#xD;
      excessively high percentage of non-recruitable lung, in contrast with the highly successful&#xD;
      recruitment strategy outlined by Borges, et al. First, Borges studied patients early in the&#xD;
      ARDS course (median, 2 days) while Gattinoni studied late ARDS. Second, Borges utilized peak&#xD;
      pressures as high as 60 cm H2O, while Gattinoni utilized pressures up to 45 cm H2O. Finally,&#xD;
      Gattinoni did not practice a PEEP titration, but lowered PEEP to 5 cm H2O following&#xD;
      recruitment maneuvers. Thus, Gattinoni's study highlights the importance of high peak&#xD;
      pressures in lung recruitment, of recruiting early in ARDS, and of a decremental PEEP&#xD;
      titration to maintain lung recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Strategies of Maintaining Recruitment The application of positive end-expiratory pressure&#xD;
      is known to prevent repetitive derecruitment-recruitment stresses on lung tissue. In an&#xD;
      animal model of acute lung injury, Farias showed histologic and biochemical evidence of&#xD;
      atelectotrauma is averted when PEEP is applied following lung recruitment7. The two principal&#xD;
      strategies to prevent derecruitment following a recruitment maneuver include the open lung&#xD;
      approach and decremental PEEP titration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Open Lung Approach In the open lung approach, PEEP is set just above the lower&#xD;
           inflection point (also known as Pflex) of the patient's pressure-volume curve. This&#xD;
           theoretically prevents the PEEP from decreasing below the zone of underdistension.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. In a second part of the study mentioned above, Richard, et al4 also studied the&#xD;
                effect of increasing PEEP relative to the measured LIP (LIP + 4 cm H2O, no SI)&#xD;
                compared to PEEP set at the lower inflection point following SI. In 10 adults&#xD;
                ventilated with low-tidal volume ventilation, measured lung volumes were 175±108 at&#xD;
                PEEPLIP versus 332±91 ml at PEEPLIP+4. This increase was even more notable in&#xD;
                patients ventilated with high tidal volumes (10 mL/kg), demonstrating the role of&#xD;
                plateau pressures (in addition to PEEP) in alveolar recruitment (see Figure 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Amato, et al16 studied the effects of a 'protective ventilation strategy' in 53&#xD;
                patients with ARDS. The protective ventilation group received recruitment maneuvers&#xD;
                via sustained inflation (35-40 cm H2O for 40 seconds) followed by PEEP set at LIP +&#xD;
                2 cm H2O. The control group received a PEEP titrated to saturations, no recruiting&#xD;
                maneuvers. The protective ventilation group had a dramatic decrease in 28 day&#xD;
                all-cause mortality (38% vs 71%, p&lt;0.001). However, the control group also received&#xD;
                high tidal volume ventilation (12 mL/kg), later proven to be a significant&#xD;
                determinant in ARDS mortality.8 Therefore, the contribution of RM and open lung&#xD;
                approach to the improved mortality of this study, if any, is difficult to conclude.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Decremental PEEP Titration In a decremental PEEP titration, following a recruiting&#xD;
           maneuver, the PEEP is set at a high level, often between 20 and 26 cm H2O. PEEP is&#xD;
           decreased incrementally, and markers of lung inflation (e.g. gas exchange or measured&#xD;
           lung volume) are followed. When evidence of atelectasis occurs, PEEP is held at or just&#xD;
           above this level, often termed 'optimal PEEP.'&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Borges, Amato, et al6 describe a PEEP titration following a maximal recruitment&#xD;
                protocol and compare it to the open lung approach (PEEP set at Pflex + 2 cm H2O).&#xD;
                Following a maximal recruitment strategy (described above), PEEP was set at 25 cm&#xD;
                H2O and decreased by 2 cm H2O every 4 minutes until PaO2 + PaCO2 &lt; 380 mm Hg, then&#xD;
                increased by 2 cm H2O (optimal PEEP, mean 20±5 cm H2O). Using this strategy, PaO2&#xD;
                was sustained at levels above 400 mm Hg at 30 minute followup in all 24 patients&#xD;
                (see Figure 4, top), and above 450 in the 16 patients followed for 6 hours. This&#xD;
                correlated with a percent mass of collapsed tissue as measured by CT scan of &lt;5% at&#xD;
                end of PEEP titration and at 30 minute followup (see Figure 4, bottom).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Toth, et al17 described a decremental PEEP titration following a SI recruiting&#xD;
                maneuver. Following SI at 40 cm H2O for 40 seconds, PEEP was set at 26 cm H2O, then&#xD;
                decreased by 2 cm H2O every 4 minutes until the PaO2 decreased by &gt;10% of its peak&#xD;
                value. The PEEP 2 cm H2O above this was defined as optimal PEEP. Optimal PEEP was&#xD;
                found to actually be lower than the patients' baseline PEEP (prior to protocol&#xD;
                initiation, 17±3 vs 15±4 cm H2O). The PaO2 following the recruiting maneuver&#xD;
                (203±108 at baseline PEEP vs 328±132 cm H2O) sustained at the 30 minute followup&#xD;
                period (266±121 cm H2O, p&lt;0.05 compared to baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Estimating Lung Volumes Currently, the ability to determine whether a patient is at, below&#xD;
      or above their ideal functional residual capacity is deduced from surrogate measurements,&#xD;
      including lung appearance of the chest radiograph, vital sign trends (particularly&#xD;
      oxygenation), and pressure-volume (P-V) curves generated by modern ventilators. In this&#xD;
      study, we will utilize an established method of determining lung volume (MBNW) to study lung&#xD;
      volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pressure-Volume Curves The pressure-volume curve represents the continual relationship&#xD;
           between changes in pressure and changes in volume of the lung. The slope of the line&#xD;
           represents the compliance of the lung. In Figure 5, note the three lines which comprise&#xD;
           the inspiratory limb (lower curve). The leftmost line represents noncompliant,&#xD;
           atelectatic lung. The point at which the slope changes is known as the lower infection&#xD;
           point, also known as Pflex. In the open lung approach (discussed later), PEEP is set to&#xD;
           a pressure just above the lower inflection point. Physiologically, it is hypothesized&#xD;
           that this is the point at which all atelectatic segments of lung are recruited, and that&#xD;
           disallowing ventilator pressures from dropping below this at any point (by setting PEEP&#xD;
           above this level) minimizes atelectasis. The point which distinguishes the second change&#xD;
           in slope of the line (becoming flat again) is known as the upper inflection point (UIP).&#xD;
           Pressures above this point represent overdistended, noncompliant alveoli, and thus this&#xD;
           point represents the pressure at which the compliance of the lung decreases&#xD;
           dramatically. In this protocol, the PV curve will be measured for each patient and the&#xD;
           UIP utilized as the ceiling pressure at any point in the protocol. In this way, we will&#xD;
           recruit compliant areas of the lung without the risks of overdistension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nitrogen Multiple Breath Washout Technique (MBNW)&#xD;
&#xD;
           MBNW has been utilized in a number of clinical studies, and is considered to be a gold&#xD;
           standard in the measurement of lung volume18-21. Currently, the most accurate way to&#xD;
           measure the volume of the lung is through dilution of a known amount of a gas with low&#xD;
           solubility be rebreathing in a closed system. The changes in concentration with&#xD;
           sequential breaths allow a calculation of the volume of distribution of the gas. One gas&#xD;
           which has been utilized for this purpose is nitrogen22, appealing due to its ubiquitous&#xD;
           presence in the environment. Measurement of nitrogen gas concentrations, however, is&#xD;
           available only using gas chromatography or mass spectrometry, neither of which is&#xD;
           clinically practical. Recently, a technique has been validated by which the partial&#xD;
           pressure of nitrogen is calculated as the residual of partial pressures of oxygen gas,&#xD;
           carbon dioxide gas and nitrogen gas, which together comprise the only three important&#xD;
           gases in a ventilator circuit. The former two gases are readily measured in a ventilator&#xD;
           circuit in real time, but of course vary widely with the metabolic state of the patient.&#xD;
           Stenqvist has developed the NMBW technique to calculate FRC using the changes in exhaled&#xD;
           O2 and CO2, manipulating inspired oxygen concentration to alter fraction of inspired&#xD;
           nitrogen23. FRC is calculated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           FiN2 = 1-FiO2 (set by ventilator) FeO2 = 1-FeO2 (measured)-FeCO2 (measured)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inspired and expired alveolar tidal volumes are calculated using O2 consumption (VO2)&#xD;
           and CO2 production (VCO2) as calculated by indirect calorimetry24:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Volumes of inspired and expired nitrogen gas associated with a single breath are&#xD;
           calculated from end-tidal nitrogen content (EtN2, inferred from measured expired CO2 and&#xD;
           oxygen content), inspired nitrogen fraction (FiN2) and inspiratory and expiratory&#xD;
           alveolar tidal volume as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before making the incremental 10% change in FiN2 via manipulating FiO2, baseline values&#xD;
           for VO2, VCO2 and ETN2 are made. VO2 and VCO2 are assumed to be constant throughout the&#xD;
           measurement. The FiN2 is then manipulated, and FRC estimated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measurement of FRC using this methodology in a lung model of known oxygen consumption&#xD;
           and lung volumes23 revealed excellent precision (mean FRC 103 5%) even when utilizing&#xD;
           incremental changes in FiO2 from 0.9 to 1.0. Precision in adult patients with&#xD;
           respiratory insufficiency revealed excellent precision amongst measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) Electrical impedance tomography capitalizes on&#xD;
           changes in impendence in air-filled versus tissue-filled spaces to characterize and&#xD;
           quantify regional distribution of lung volume at the bedside. Significant work has been&#xD;
           done in the past decade to validate the technology in animals25 and in humans26, 27. The&#xD;
           technology utilizes a series of 16 electrodes placed across the patient's chest (Figure&#xD;
           6). As small currents are passed between the electrodes, impedance is measured between&#xD;
           and amongst the series. Through a complex interrogation and manipulation of these&#xD;
           impedance values, a two-dimensional image is formed (Figure 7), and has been shown to&#xD;
           correlate with clinical and radiographic changes in patients27. In ten mechanically&#xD;
           ventilated adults with ARDS, end-expiratory lung volume as determined by nitrogen&#xD;
           washout correlated well with end-expiratory lung impedance with an r2 of 0.95.26 The&#xD;
           ability to estimate lung volume non-invasively and in real time may significantly&#xD;
           improve outcomes in patients with lung injury. Specifically, the ability to determine a&#xD;
           patient's ideal functional residual capacity and ventilate them towards that goal may&#xD;
           improve oxygen delivery by maximizing pulmonary compliance and minimizing pulmonary&#xD;
           vascular resistance. This study seeks to utilize varying levels of PEEP to alter&#xD;
           end-expiratory volume, using EIT and other surrogate measures to confirm efficacy,&#xD;
           measuring oxygenation and shunt fraction as the clinical end points. Should this study&#xD;
           demonstrate the ability to effectively recruit lung and minimize shunt fractions using&#xD;
           an aggressive PEEP strategy, further studies of clinical benefit from this will be&#xD;
           warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Exhaled Breath Condensate (as measure of lung health) There is a growing body of&#xD;
           evidence regarding changes in airway lining fluid (ALF) pH in acute and chronic&#xD;
           respiratory diseases that are characterized, at least in part, by inflammation. It has&#xD;
           been demonstrated that the pH of ALF is low (acidic) in multiple pulmonary inflammatory&#xD;
           diseases including asthma28, cystic fibrosis29, pneumonia, and ARDS30-32, and that this&#xD;
           pH can be detected continuously, safely and non-invasively in exhaled breath condensate&#xD;
           (EBC)33. The pH of EBC may be a safe, non-invasive screening tool for progression of&#xD;
           ARDS, and of lung recruitment. It has anecdotally been shown to predict respiratory&#xD;
           failure and impending respiratory infection (unpublished data). As seen in Figure 4&#xD;
           (left), the EBC pH is a marker exhibiting rapid turnover and thus may be valuable for&#xD;
           real-time monitoring of lung pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous exhaled breath condensate pH collection and assay system (ALFA monitor,&#xD;
      Respiratory Research, Inc., Austin, Texas) consists of a condenser attached to the expiratory&#xD;
      limb of the ventilator. Exhaled breath condensate is collected continuously from the&#xD;
      expiratory port, condensed in a cooling chamber, CO2 removed, and collected in an inferior&#xD;
      chamber where pH is continuously read. This yields a continuous, responsive measure from&#xD;
      ventilated patients, which (1) takes samples from an exhaust port on the outside of the&#xD;
      ventilator circuit, and (2) adds no measurable resistance to the ventilator circuit. The&#xD;
      measurement of EBC in patients with lung injury may serve as an early marker of&#xD;
      derecruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Study Objectives Specific Aim 1: To demonstrate the efficacy of the a maximal recruitment&#xD;
      strategy to increase lung volumes and improve oxygenation in children with acute lung injury,&#xD;
      utilizing multiple breath nitrogen washout (MBNW) and electrical impedance tomography (EIT)&#xD;
      as measures of lung volume. (Hypothesis: Lung volumes and oxygenation will increase following&#xD;
      the maximal recruitment protocol as compared to those during 'baseline ventilation' or the&#xD;
      'open lung approach.') Specific Aim 2: To compare lung volumes as measured by MBNW and EIT at&#xD;
      varying end-expiratory lung volumes. (Hypothesis: Lung volumes as measured by MBNW will&#xD;
      correlate with those obtained by EIT.)&#xD;
