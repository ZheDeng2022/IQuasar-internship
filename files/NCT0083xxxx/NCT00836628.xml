    <textblock>
      This protocol is aimed at establishing a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for submyeloablative&#xD;
      doses of Busulfex ® with the hope that a tolerable, submyeloablative dose can be established&#xD;
      to test efficacy as alternative therapy for refractory pediatric brain tumors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pediatric brain tumors remain among the most common malignancies in childhood, second only to&#xD;
      leukemia, representing 20% of all childhood cancers in the United States (1). Although&#xD;
      significant strides have been made in therapies for other pediatric malignancies, mortality&#xD;
      for patients with brain tumors remains high. The mainstay of therapy for CNS tumors has been&#xD;
      a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. High dose chemotherapy with stem cell&#xD;
      transplant has been proposed as an alternative to radiation, in very young children and for&#xD;
      relapsed patients. Stem cell transplantation however is not without significant side effects&#xD;
      as well as transplant related mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Busulfan is an alkylating agent and is able to exert its cytotoxic effects through hydrolysis&#xD;
      and subsequent production of carbonium ions, directly alkylating DNA, interfering with its&#xD;
      replication, and ultimately leading to cell death (2). Busulfan readily crosses the blood&#xD;
      barrier, allowing for CNS levels nearly equal to those of plasma levels (5,6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Busulfex ® in children with recurrent,&#xD;
      progressive, or refractory primary brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain preliminary data regarding progression free survival (PFS) and event free survival&#xD;
      (EFS) when Busulfex ® is used at submyeloablative doses in children with recurrent,&#xD;
      progressive, or refractory primary brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the plasma pharmacokinetics of Busulfex ® in children with recurrent,&#xD;
      progressive, or refractory primary brain tumors, using a continuous infusion.&#xD;
