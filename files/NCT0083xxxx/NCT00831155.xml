      The purpose of this study is to test two quit smoking therapies and to study brain function&#xD;
      while each therapy is being used. You will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to one&#xD;
      of the two groups. The first therapy is Extinction-Based therapy (EBT). If you are in this&#xD;
      group, you will switch to smoking denicotinized cigarettes while wearing a 21 mg/d nicotine&#xD;
      patch for one month prior to your quit date. The second therapy is a standard Nicotine&#xD;
      Replacement therapy (NRT). If you are in this group, you will smoke your usual brand of&#xD;
      cigarettes up to the quit date. Following the quit date, both groups will undergo standard&#xD;
      nicotine replacement therapy (21 mg/d for 6 weeks; 14 mg/d for 2 weeks, 7 mg/d for 2 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above, we will recruit a sample of former smokers who are now regular&#xD;
      users of e-cigarettes. This group [ECIG] will undergo the same screening and baseline&#xD;
      assessments as the EBT and NRT groups up to the completion of fMRI1.&#xD;

      If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to sign the consent form prior to any&#xD;
      tests or procedures. You will be asked to come to the laboratory for a screening session. The&#xD;
      screening session will take approximately 1.5 hours to complete, including all&#xD;
      questionnaires, physical and sample collection. Pregnant or nursing mothers will not be&#xD;
      allowed to participate in this study. If you test positive for illegal drug use, you will not&#xD;
      be allowed to participate in this study. Depending on the results of the screening procedures&#xD;
      you may not be eligible for the study. If you do not have any medical conditions that would&#xD;
      make your participation risky, and you feel comfortable participating in the study, you will&#xD;
      be given instructions regarding the rest of the study sessions and be asked to return.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoker participants who complete the screening visit (described above) and meet all study&#xD;
      requirements will then complete 8 lab visits, 1 fMRI training session, 3 fMRI sessions, and 2&#xD;
      follow-up visits. ECIG participants who complete the screening visit and meet all study&#xD;
      requirements will complete 1 fMRI training session and 1 fMRI session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First you will be randomly assigned (like drawing out of a hat) to a study group, either the&#xD;
      EBT or NRT group. In the extinction-based therapy (EBT) group, participants will switch to&#xD;
      smoking denicotinized cigarettes while wearing a 21 mg/d nicotine patch for one month prior&#xD;
      to their quit date; meanwhile, smokers assigned to the nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)&#xD;
      group will smoke their usual brand of cigarettes up to the quit date. Following the quit&#xD;
      date, both groups will undergo standard nicotine replacement therapy (21 mg/d for 6 weeks; 14&#xD;
      mg/d for 2 weeks, 7 mg/d for 2 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight lab visits (V1 - V8) will be conducted during the 16 weeks following enrollment in the&#xD;
      study. These visits will be largely identical, except that instructions and reminders to you&#xD;
      about upcoming events will vary from session to session. At each lab visit the following will&#xD;
      be collected: vitals (heart rate, blood pressure and weight); breath CO (Carbon Monoxide) and&#xD;
      saliva samples for testing smoking and nicotine levels; and measures of smoking withdrawal&#xD;
      and mood. You will be given daily diaries to record your smoking behavior and study&#xD;
      medication. You will be given instructions on how and when to use all study materials. Advice&#xD;
      on quitting and minimal support will be provided as requested at these visits. Each lab visit&#xD;
      will require 20-30 minutes of your time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Directly following V1 you will undergo a training session, during which you will be&#xD;
      familiarized with all aspects of the fMRI sessions including tasks and equipment. You will be&#xD;
      situated in a scanner simulator, which simulates the sounds and equipment used in the fMRI&#xD;
      scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One task will require you to view pictures of people smoking and people doing everyday&#xD;
      activities. After the task, you will be quizzed on the pictures you saw. During another task,&#xD;
      you will be presented with a stream of gray, yellow, or blue colored circles and instructed&#xD;
      to press a button every time you see a &quot;Go&quot; trial while inhibiting a response (not pressing&#xD;
      the button) when you are presented with a &quot;No-Go&quot; trial. The training session will require 1&#xD;
      hour of participant time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI Sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to complete three fMRI scanning sessions: a baseline scan (fMRI-1); a scan&#xD;
      4 weeks after you start treatment (fMRI-2); and a final scan 24 hours after your quit date&#xD;
      (fMRI-3). The first 20 minutes of each scanning session will follow the same protocol as a&#xD;
      lab visit. Following this, for fMRI-1 and fMRI-2 you will be asked to smoke a cigarette&#xD;
      (usual brand or denicotinized depending on session and group). No cigarette will be smoked&#xD;
      prior to fMRI-3. After smoking your cigarette you will sit in a quiet room and read magazines&#xD;
      for 30 minutes. Following the 30 min rest period, you will be escorted to the fMRI suite at&#xD;
      Duke University Medical Center. Once inside, you will complete questionnaires regarding your&#xD;
      current mood and withdrawal symptoms. We will take a CO and saliva sample at the beginning of&#xD;
      each scan. If you are wearing a nicotine replacement patch, you will remove it before&#xD;
      entering the scanner. Then you will be given specific instructions regarding data collection&#xD;
      procedures and be placed in the scanner. During the scanning you will perform each of the&#xD;
      tasks, and lie still while we take pictures of your brain. After being removed from the&#xD;
      scanner, you will complete post-session withdrawal and mood questionnaires and replace the&#xD;
      removed patch. End-of-session instructions will then be provided:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of fMRI-1, ECIG participants will be released from the study. Smoker&#xD;
           participants will be randomly assigned to either the EBT or NRT group, and given&#xD;
           supplies and information regarding upcoming sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of fMRI-2, you will be reminded of the quit date which you agreed upon&#xD;
           previously, and you will be given supplies and information regarding quitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of fMRI-3, you will be given reminders about upcoming sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be instructed not to consume any alcohol on the night before each scanning session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will ask for a breath and saliva sample before each session to make sure you have followed&#xD;
      all directions about wearing the patch and smoking your usual brand or the denicotinized&#xD;
      cigarettes as instructed. If the test indicates that you have not followed directions, you&#xD;
      will be sent home (this will be considered a missed visit) and the visit will be&#xD;
      re-scheduled. If this occurs on 2 consecutive visits, your further participation in the study&#xD;
      will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing all study visits, you will be asked to return for two follow-up sessions,&#xD;
      one at 6 months and one at 12 months from visit 1. At these follow-up sessions we will ask&#xD;
      for breath and saliva samples, and have you fill out paperwork regarding your mood and&#xD;
      current smoking status.&#xD;
