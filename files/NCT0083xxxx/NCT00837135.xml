    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if it is safe to add multiple immunotherapies to&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy and radiation for treating pancreatic cancer tumors that cannot be&#xD;
      completely removed by surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. GI-4000 Vaccination:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The first involves a &quot;vaccine,&quot; which is an injection (shot) that teaches your immune&#xD;
           system to attack foreign invaders. The vaccine we will use is called &quot;GI-4000&quot; - a&#xD;
           vaccine composed of yeast that is made to carry the same proteins (called &quot;mutated Ras&#xD;
           proteins&quot;) found in some pancreatic cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adoptive T-cell Transfer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second type of immunotherapy in this study is called &quot;adoptive T-cell transfer.&quot; This&#xD;
      involves collecting a specific type of white blood cells from you (called &quot;T-cells&quot;)and&#xD;
      growing T-cells grown in a lab which may help the research participants' immune systems&#xD;
      recover more quickly after chemotherapy, and possibly improved response to other&#xD;
      immunotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope that studying these agents together will teach us how to help the immune system fight&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I/Pilot study will assess the safety and feasibility of the GI-4000 series vaccine&#xD;
      with or without adoptive T cell transfer in subjects with locally advanced pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical resection. Subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      either ARM A (GI-4000vaccine) or ARM B (GI-4000 vaccine and activated T cell transfer). All&#xD;
      subjects will undergo apheresis of mononuclear cells immediately before receiving four cycles&#xD;
      of gemcitabine/oxaliplatin (GemOx) chemotherapy (&quot;immune preservation phase&quot;). After the&#xD;
      completion of chemotherapy, the apheresis product will be reinfused, and the subjects will&#xD;
      enter the &quot;priming phase,&quot; in which two biweekly doses (dose #1 and #2) of the appropriate&#xD;
      GI-4000 vaccine (the one that best matches the mutations found in the patient's tumor) and a&#xD;
      single dose of the Prevnar pneumococcal conjugate vaccine will be administered. At this time,&#xD;
      those subjects who have not developed distant metastatic disease by CT/MRI will undergo&#xD;
      chemoradiation, with ARM B subjects receiving a second apheresis immediately prior to the&#xD;
      initiation of the chemoradiation. The pheresed product will be activated and expanded ex vivo&#xD;
      and reinfused after chemoradiation is completed. All subjects will receive two more biweekly&#xD;
      boosts of the GI-4000 vaccine (doses #3 and #4) while undergoing restaging with CT/MRI&#xD;
      (&quot;boosting phase&quot;). Those who have not developed metastatic disease will undergo surgical&#xD;
      evaluation for tumor resection. Patients who undergo R0 or R1 resection will receive up to&#xD;
      three more weekly doses of GI-4000 prior to the initiation of adjuvant gemcitabine, monthly&#xD;
      doses of GI-4000 during the four cycles of gemcitabine chemotherapy, and monthly GI-4000&#xD;
      doses thereafter. At the end of gemcitabine chemotherapy, apheresis will be performed for&#xD;
      endpoint correlative studies. Those who are not candidates for surgery or whose tumors are&#xD;
      not completely resected will continue to receive GI-4000 monthly booster vaccination.&#xD;
