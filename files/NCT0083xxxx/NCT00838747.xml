  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The folate receptor (FR) is a cell marker that is over expressed on the cell surface of&#xD;
      certain cancers, this occurs most frequently in ovarian cancers. Some normal tissues also&#xD;
      express the FR, however in these normal tissues the FR is usually located on the tissue&#xD;
      surface that is inaccessible to circulating drugs. As such, drugs which target the FR may&#xD;
      potentially be used to achieve anti-tumour efficacy whilst reducing toxicity to normal&#xD;
      tissues. Therefore the ability to measure FR levels from different cancer types may help to&#xD;
      select patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment with FR targeted therapies. One&#xD;
      such drug BGC 945 is currently being tested in preclinical study at The Institute of Cancer&#xD;
      Research&#xD;

      A method has been developed in the laboratory which has been able to measure FR obtained from&#xD;
      cancer cells in culture that has been added into blood. We would like to study if this method&#xD;
      can measure FR in plasma and serum obtained from patients with ovarian cancer. We would also&#xD;
      like to analyse plasma and serum samples obtained from healthy volunteers to determine if&#xD;
      they have any appreciable levels of FR, which can then be compared to the measurements&#xD;
      obtained from cancer patients.&#xD;
