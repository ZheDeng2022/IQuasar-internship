  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory arthritis (IA) is a major cause of long-term disability. Due to specialist&#xD;
      shortages, failure of primary care providers and individuals to recognize the disease, and&#xD;
      lack of awareness of the importance of early intervention, delays to rheumatologic care are&#xD;
      common. Peer support models have been used for various health issues and may be one method to&#xD;
      assist individuals with early IA to manage their disease and cope with stress. Qualitative&#xD;
      research methods (one-on-one interviews) will seek out feedback on a peer support approach&#xD;
      and explore the learning needs (informational needs, educational preferences) and opinions&#xD;
      about emotional and appraisal support of individuals living with IA, from the perspectives of&#xD;
      patients. The data will be analyzed and expressed themes (articulated needs and&#xD;
      understandings of interviewee context) will guide the future development of a peer support&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

      Research Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploring the Learning Needs of Individuals with Inflammatory Arthritis from the Perspectives&#xD;
      of Patients, Family Members and Friends, and Health Care Providers Patient Perspectives&#xD;
      (One-on-One Interviews) Abstract The purpose of this study is to determine the learning needs&#xD;
      of individuals living with inflammatory arthritis from the perspective of newly diagnosed&#xD;
      patients. Specifically, we will be looking at how culture influences the learning needs of&#xD;
      arthritis patients. This is part of a larger study which will examine the perspectives of&#xD;
      patients, their family members and friends, and health care providers in an effort to develop&#xD;
      peer support methods that will improve care for individuals with inflammatory arthritis. A&#xD;
      qualitative methodology will be utilized including semi-structured interviews. Adults with&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis, from different cultural groups, will be recruited to participate in&#xD;
      the study as key informants. They will provide insight into culturally specific learning&#xD;
      needs of different groups, which will be used to design peer support programs to better meet&#xD;
      the needs of our increasingly diverse population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Rationale Arthritis and related diseases are a group of disorders that affect joints,&#xD;
      ligaments, bones, tendons and other parts of the musculoskeletal system (1). In Ontario,&#xD;
      arthritis is a leading cause of pain, physical disability and use of health care services (2,&#xD;
      3). Although the disease is not usually life threatening, symptoms of pain, swelling and&#xD;
      stiffness can significantly reduce quality of life and contribute to long-term disability&#xD;
      (4). Since arthritis is a chronic disease, it must be managed throughout a patient's&#xD;
      lifetime, with appropriate treatments for each stage of the disease. Management is usually&#xD;
      focused on symptom control, prevention of pain and disability and improving quality of life&#xD;
      (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive care of patients with arthritis and their families includes primary care&#xD;
      (consisting of medications, specialist and hospital care), community support services, and&#xD;
      health education and prevention. Patient education interventions to help individuals&#xD;
      self-manage their disease have been shown to be 20-30% as effective as pharmaceutical&#xD;
      therapies at pain reduction and 40% as effective in reducing disability from arthritis (5).&#xD;
      This results in decreased number of physician consultations, thereby reducing the cost of&#xD;
      treatment for arthritis (6). Peer support is one form of patient education that may have&#xD;
      application for arthritis patients. Components of peer support include emotional support,&#xD;
      appraisal support and information support from a peer who shares common characteristics with&#xD;
      the individual or group of interest (7). It is hoped that this support will help individuals&#xD;
      with arthritis improve self-management of their disease, by helping them cope with their&#xD;
      arthritis and become more active in managing their disease (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these programs to be effective, the peer population needs to be as similar as possible to&#xD;
      the patient population (7).Therefore, it is important to assess the needs of individuals of&#xD;
      various cultural backgrounds in order to design programs that best address culture-specific&#xD;
      needs and issues in the treatment of chronic disease such as arthritis. Existing recruitment&#xD;
      strategies are often biased towards those from white, middle-class backgrounds, but more&#xD;
      marginalized groups, including immigrants, may have the most to gain from peer support&#xD;
      programs (8). Additionally, it has been shown that the incidence, severity and processes of&#xD;
      care, as well as outcomes, differ among racial or ethnic groups although the reasons for this&#xD;
      are largely unknown (9). With the diversity of the Canadian population and aging of&#xD;
      immigrants, these are aspects that are increasingly relevant. Therefore, the design of&#xD;
      tailored programs for different communities is important to be able to successfully implement&#xD;
      peer support programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, immigrants make up a significant proportion of Ontario's population. Assessing&#xD;
      their needs after diagnosis is an essential step in the design of peer support programs that&#xD;
      address culturally specific needs. Through one on one interviews, we hope to better&#xD;
      understand information needs and educational preferences of individuals with inflammatory&#xD;
      arthritis and use this information to design peer support programs that are accessible to&#xD;
      this growing segment of our population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Purpose and Objectives The specific objective of this study are to examine the learning&#xD;
      preferences of individuals who have inflammatory arthritis, including thoughts about peer&#xD;
      support, to identify informational needs and educational preferences related to managing&#xD;
      arthritis and to explore how learning needs change over time or duration of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Methodology To explore these objectives, the perspectives of individuals with arthritis&#xD;
      will be examined using a qualitative approach. One on one semi-structured interviews will be&#xD;
      utilized for this component of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured Interviews Study Design Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with&#xD;
      individuals with inflammatory arthritis acting as key informants. An interview guide&#xD;
      (Appendix A) was developed for the purpose of this study based on a literature review of&#xD;
      cultural needs in patient education for arthritis, previous studies of peer support needs in&#xD;
      arthritis patients and discussion with colleagues. The interviewer will ask the same specific&#xD;
      questions for each interview. The order of the questions may be altered and probes&#xD;
      incorporated to obtain more information. Probes, or prompts, are questions that are not&#xD;
      included in the interview guide, but will allow participants to elaborate on their responses&#xD;
      and provide further discussion. Probes will be posed in a neutral manner. Depending on the&#xD;
      data that emerges, additional questions can be added to the interview guide to obtain further&#xD;
      information in subsequent interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will continue until interviews are conducted with all key informants. There&#xD;
      will be approximately 10-15 interviews. The interviews are anticipated to last approximately&#xD;
      one hour each, and will be conducted by a second year medical student who is a&#xD;
      co-investigator on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be identified for participation in this study based on the following&#xD;
      inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must have a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis from a physician;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be aged 18 years or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be able to participate in a 1 hour interview;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants are English-speaking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants are immigrants to Canada&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Consent Process The individuals will be identified through a cohort of&#xD;
      patients with inflammatory arthritis at a rheumatology clinic at Sunnybrook Health Sciences&#xD;
      Centre The Principal Investigator will identify and screen potential research participants&#xD;
      from her inflammatory arthritis patient population according to the eligibility criteria for&#xD;
      the study and will initiate the informed consent process. The Principal Investigator will&#xD;
      introduce the project and review the information letter for the study with each eligible&#xD;
      patient to ensure that the potential participant understands the study and what he/she is&#xD;
      being asked to do and to answer any questions that the potential participant may have about&#xD;
      the study (Appendix B). The PI will obtain verbal consent for the medical student&#xD;
      co-investigator to contact the potential research participant. When an individual has agreed&#xD;
      to meet with the medical student co-investigator, his/her name will be forwarded to the&#xD;
      Office Manager at the clinic. The Office Manager will contact the individual and schedule an&#xD;
      interview at the PI's rheumatology clinic office with the medical student co-investigator&#xD;
      assigned to the project. A confirmation letter (Appendix C) with time and location of the&#xD;
      interview will be mailed to the participant by the Office Manager. The day before the&#xD;
      interview is scheduled to take place the medical student will telephone the individual to&#xD;
      remind him/her of the time and location of the interview (Appendix D). At the beginning of&#xD;
      the interview, prior to asking any questions, the medical student will review the consent&#xD;
      form (Appendix E) with each potential research participant to ensure that he/she understands&#xD;
      the study and what he/she is being asked to do and answer any further questions the person&#xD;
      may have. Once written consent is obtained, a copy will be provided to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be conducted face-to-face. These interviews will take place at a time that is&#xD;
      convenient for each participant in a private room at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.&#xD;
      Interviews will be tape recorded using a digital tape recorder. Transcription of each&#xD;
      interview may occur in whole or in part. The medical student will take written notes before,&#xD;
      during and after the interviews. These will include the student's thoughts on the interview&#xD;
      itself, a description of any nonverbal communication by the participants, and any&#xD;
      conversations that may not be audio-taped before or after the interviews. Personal or&#xD;
      professional relationships between the interviewer and the participants are not anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Data Analysis Interview data will be analysed using a constant comparative method of&#xD;
      analysis. Interview data will be categorized into themes and analysed by the medical student&#xD;
      who conducted the interviews. The transcripts will also be coded by the study coordinator&#xD;
      and/or a second medical student, who will assist with this analysis. A preliminary coding&#xD;
      scheme will be developed by this team, and they will first code the interview separately&#xD;
      using this coding scheme and then meet to compare and contrast the codes. The initial&#xD;
      interview guide may be modified with each subsequent interview to include new themes or&#xD;
      probes that emerge in the interviews. Codes will be added to the coding scheme as new&#xD;
      concepts are identified as the interviews progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Risks and Benefits There is a potential risk of emotional distress in patients who are&#xD;
      asked about there illness. Should this occur, the study team will work to provide resources&#xD;
      for support. Participants may withdraw from the study at any time without any negative&#xD;
      consequences. Indirect benefits may be experienced due to improvement in peer support&#xD;
      networks for arthritis patients and gained knowledge in how culture influences peer support&#xD;
      needs of patients with arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Privacy and Confidentiality Only the medical student, the research staff and the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator involved in the study will know the identity of the key informants. No&#xD;
      identifying information will be used on any data collections forms. For all other forms,&#xD;
      participants will be assigned a unique identifying number. The list of names, addresses and&#xD;
      phone numbers will be kept in a password protected computer file on a secure server in a&#xD;
      locked research room and will only be accessed by the Principal Investigator, research staff&#xD;
      and medical student working on the study. All information obtained during the study will be&#xD;
      held in strict confidence. No names or identifying information will be used in any&#xD;
      publications or presentations. No information identifying participants will be transferred&#xD;
      outside the researchers in this study or this hospital. All of the digital files of recorded&#xD;
      interviews will be stored as a password protected computer file on a secure server in a&#xD;
      locked research room and deleted 25 years following completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Compensation No monetary remuneration will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Communication of Results Results from this study will be communicated to an academic and&#xD;
      health professional audience at the University of Toronto through a Determinants of Community&#xD;
      Health (DOCH) II written report and presentation.&#xD;
