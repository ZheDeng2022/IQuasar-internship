  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this pilot safety study are to identify a dose of inhaled Clinical Center&#xD;
      Reference Endotoxin (CCRE) that is well tolerated by allergic subjects that induces&#xD;
      measurable increases in neutrophil content of induced sputum that can be employed to screen&#xD;
      large populations for susceptibility to the inflammatory effect of inhaled endotoxin.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Twenty-four or forty-eight hours (study day 1) prior to the inhalation challenge, subjects&#xD;
      will undergo a physical examination of the ears, nose, throat and chest and will have an&#xD;
      assessment of vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure), oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, symptom score assessment and undergo spirometry to rule out acute illness prior&#xD;
      to challenge. All female volunteers will undergo a urine pregnancy test. A similar&#xD;
      examination will take place immediately prior to inhalation challenge with 10,000 EU of CCRE,&#xD;
      as well as 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 minutes and 24 hours after challenge (with the&#xD;
      exception of a pregnancy test which will only be administered prior to sputum induction on&#xD;
      study day 1). Induced sputum will be 24 to 48 hours prior to challenge, and again six hours&#xD;
      after challenge on Study day 2. Sputum will be analyzed for PMN content, CD14 expression on&#xD;
      airway macrophages and monocytes, soluble CD14 levels, cytokine levels in sputum and products&#xD;
      of inflammatory cells (eosinophil, cationic protein, myeloperoxidase). Blood will be&#xD;
      collected for a CBC and differential when the pre- challenge induced sputum is obtained and&#xD;
      again 6 hours after challenge. Subjects will then be escorted to the GCRC for overnight&#xD;
      admission. While on the GCRC, vital signs will be obtained every 2 hours till bedtime, then&#xD;
      once a shift. Spirometry will not be obtained while the subject is in the GCRC, however the&#xD;
      subject will be given symptom scoring cards. The next morning (study day 3) subjects will be&#xD;
      discharged and escorted to the CEMALB for a final set of vital signs, spirometry, symptom&#xD;
      scoring, and an examination by a study physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each volunteer will be given a symptom scoring sheet for each day up to 96 hours (4 days)&#xD;
      after challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each sheet will include the name and phone number of the study coordinator and study MD.&#xD;
      Sample home symptom scoring sheets and instructions are included with this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 48 and 96 hours after challenge, each volunteer will be called to determine their&#xD;
      status, inquiring about symptoms, symptom scoring, and need for medication and/or physician&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 7 and 10 days of the challenge dose, each subject will be asked to return for a study&#xD;
      discontinuation visit. At that time temperature, pulse, systolic and diastolic BP,&#xD;
      respiratory rate, FVC and FEV1 and SpO2 (oxygen saturation), and symptoms scores will be&#xD;
      assessed and, if abnormal, medical evaluation as directed by the study physician will be&#xD;
      undertaken.&#xD;
