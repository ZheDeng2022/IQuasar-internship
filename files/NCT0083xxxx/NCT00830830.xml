        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients having given their written informed consent, prior to participating in the&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of either sex &gt;= 40 years of age and of sufficient good health that they will&#xD;
             be able to complete the 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of at least one knee:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diagnosed according to ACR criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Based upon a knee X-ray performed within 6 months prior to Screening, the&#xD;
                  radiograms must be classified as a Grade II or III for osteoarthritis of the knee&#xD;
                  according to the Kellgren &amp; Lawrence grading system based upon a radiologist's&#xD;
                  written report or individual certified for reading knee radiograms. (Sharpening&#xD;
                  of the tibial spine is not considered to be an osteophyte).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptoms consistent with osteoarthritis of the knee for at least 6&#xD;
             months prior to Screening. These symptoms must include knee joint pain, and may&#xD;
             include crepitus, swelling and/or effusion of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At Screening, patients on any analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication should have a&#xD;
             visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score after walking on a 50 ft flat surface of &gt; 30&#xD;
             mm but &lt; 90 mm using a 100 mm scale. If patients are not taking any&#xD;
             analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication or have not taken any pain medication&#xD;
             (prescription [Rx] or over-the-counter [OTC]) in the previous 3 days from Screening&#xD;
             then they should have a VAS pain score after walking on a 50 ft flat surface of &gt; 40&#xD;
             mm but &lt; 90 mm. If bilateral knee pain is present, the investigator will select the&#xD;
             more painful knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At Screening and Baseline, if there is bilateral OA of the knee involvement, patients&#xD;
             must have a VAS pain score for walking on a 50 ft flat surface of &lt; 30 mm in the less&#xD;
             painful contralateral knee at the Baseline assessment. A patient scoring an acceptable&#xD;
             VAS pain score at Screening but failing to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
             at Baseline can not be randomized and enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At Baseline, after all analgesic/anti-inflammatory medications have been discontinued&#xD;
             for 2 weeks (withdrawal from acetaminophen rescue medication for at least 24 hours&#xD;
             prior to Baseline assessment), patients should have a VAS pain score of &gt; 40 mm but &lt;&#xD;
             90 mm immediately after the 50-foot walk on a flat surface. Again, if bilateral knee&#xD;
             pain is present, the investigator will select the more painful knee and the&#xD;
             contralateral knee must have a VAS pain score of &lt; 30 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had knee pain in the signal knee on at least 50% of the days in the&#xD;
             month preceding Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are able to complete efficacy measurement questionnaires and can&#xD;
             understand and read English or Spanish (Spanish forms will be provided).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who can perform the 50-foot walk test without the support of crutches or&#xD;
             other assistive devices, except for canes. If patient uses a cane routinely in daily&#xD;
             activities, then they can use it for their assessments. However, this use must remain&#xD;
             stable for all assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minimum flexion of 90 degrees in both knees.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are willing to discontinue all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
             (NSAIDs) or other analgesic medication taken for any condition, including their knee&#xD;
             pain with the exception of acetaminophen, up to 1000 mg (2 tablets) four times a day&#xD;
             (q.i.d.), as needed (p.r.n.) (maximum 8 tablets or 4 grams per day). These patients&#xD;
             must be willing to use only acetaminophen as a rescue pain medication for the knee&#xD;
             pain during the study period and refrain from even acetaminophen use 24 hours prior to&#xD;
             any office visit. All other analgesic medications for any chronic condition must be&#xD;
             stopped (see exceptions for acute treatment of transient flares of pain). Patients&#xD;
             must also be willing to abstain from any intra-articular (i.a.) or peri-articular&#xD;
             injections to the knee or surgery during the course of the trial, except for the&#xD;
             assigned study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who, if they are currently taking low dose aspirin (325 mg/day or less), are&#xD;
             willing to remain on a stable dose throughout the study and are willing to refrain&#xD;
             from any aspirin dose 24 hours prior to any office visit.&#xD;

                  procedures are complete. (Methods of contraception considered effective are an&#xD;
                  oral, injectable or implanted contraceptive agent, or an intra-uterine device&#xD;
                  with a failure rate of 1% per year, and abstinence).&#xD;
