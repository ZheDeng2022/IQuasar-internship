  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will examine how often hypersensitivity, or allergic reactions, occur in&#xD;
      patients receiving the chemotherapy medication oxaliplatin. Hypersensitivity reactions can&#xD;
      vary from a transient skin rash and fever to more severe symptoms such as shortness of&#xD;
      breath, chest tightness, and a more severe allergic reaction that can affect blood pressure&#xD;
      called anaphylaxis. We will be examining how often hypersensitivity reactions occur and how&#xD;
      severe the reactions are when they occur. We will also examine whether there are factors that&#xD;
      place people at risk for developing hypersensitivity reactions to oxaliplatin. In an optional&#xD;
      portion to this study, we will examine whether allergy skin testing can predict whether&#xD;
      someone will develop a hypersensitivity reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who develop a moderate to severe allergic reaction to oxaliplatin will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in an additional portion of the study examining a desensitization&#xD;
      process. This part of the study will examine whether a desensitization process can prevent&#xD;
      future hypersensitivity reactions to oxaliplatin in patients who previously developed&#xD;
      moderate to severe hypersensitivity reactions and allow therapy with oxaliplatin to continue.&#xD;

      -  Participants will come in for chemotherapy treatment as scheduled by their oncologist.&#xD;
           The frequency of the visits will depend upon the chemotherapy regimen the participant is&#xD;
           receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With each visit, the participants will have a physical exam and will be asked questions&#xD;
           about their general health and specific questions about any problems that they might be&#xD;
           having and any medications they may be taking. At each of these visits, routine blood&#xD;
           work will be taken to monitor the participant's health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  While the participants are receiving oxaliplatin, the infusion nurse will monitor them&#xD;
           for any evidence of hypersensitivity reaction. Participants will also leave with a diary&#xD;
           to record any symptoms that may occur for 24 hours after they have completed the&#xD;
           infusion of oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the optional portion of the study, participants will undergo allergy skin testing in&#xD;
           the Allergy Service at Brigham and Women's Hospital The skin testing will be done at&#xD;
           three time points: before the first dose of oxaliplatin, before the 5th dose of&#xD;
           oxaliplatin, and before the 10th dose of oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Desensitization is a method used to help a person with an allergy tolerate exposure to a&#xD;
           specific allergic agent. Desensitization to a medication such as oxaliplatin involves&#xD;
           giving the medication in slowly increasing amounts, starting with tiny doses, and ending&#xD;
           with the full dose prescribed by the physician. Patients participating in this part of&#xD;
           the study will have the desensitization at Brigham and Women's Hospital in the Medical&#xD;
           Intensive Care Unit (ICU or MICU) to ensure close supervision. Desensitization to&#xD;
           oxaliplatin involves a multi-step procedure where the oxaliplatin dose is started at&#xD;
           very small doses and the rate of infusion is increased every 15 minutes until the&#xD;
           &quot;target rate&quot; is achieved. This rate is then maintained until the full dose of&#xD;
           medication has been infused. This usually takes approximately 6 hours if no adverse&#xD;
           reactions are experienced.&#xD;
