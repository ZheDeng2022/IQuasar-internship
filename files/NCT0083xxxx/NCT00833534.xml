      RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in&#xD;
      different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab,&#xD;
      can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to&#xD;
      them. It is not yet known whether lenalidomide is more effective with or without rituximab in&#xD;
      treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well lenalidomide works when given with or&#xD;
      without rituximab in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic&#xD;
      lymphoma who have undergone autologous or syngeneic stem cell transplant.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of consolidation therapy comprising lenalidomide with or&#xD;
           without rituximab followed by maintenance therapy comprising lenalidomide in patients&#xD;
           with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma who have undergone&#xD;
           autologous or syngeneic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consolidation phase: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group I: Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-14. Treatment&#xD;
                repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
                unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group II: Patients receive lenalidomide as in group I. Patients also receive&#xD;
                rituximab IV once on the day before the start of lenalidomide and then once between&#xD;
                days 25-30, 50-55, and 75-80 for a total of 4 doses in the absence of disease&#xD;
                progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance phase: Beginning 2 months after completion of consolidation therapy, all&#xD;
           patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28&#xD;
           days for 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28 days and then annually&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
