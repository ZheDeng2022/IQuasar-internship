      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy of P276-00 in subjects with advanced&#xD;
      malignant melanoma positive for cyclin D1 expression&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, melanoma is the fifth most common cancer diagnosed in men and the seventh most&#xD;
      common cancer diagnosed in women.Advanced melanoma has a very poor prognosis.For a vast&#xD;
      majority of subjects with malignant melanoma, there are no effective therapies.Therefore, the&#xD;
      development of effective therapies for this subject population remains a priority in&#xD;
      oncology.In a limited study in melanomas, increased cyclin D1 protein expression, as was&#xD;
      observed in 33% cases.P276-00 is a novel potent small molecule flavone derived Cyclin&#xD;
      dependent kinase (Cdk) Cdk 4-D1, Cdk1-B and Cdk9-T inhibitor.P276-00 demonstrated significant&#xD;
      and selective antiproliferative effect against melanoma cell lines.&#xD;
