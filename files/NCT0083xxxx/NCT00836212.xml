      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low concentrations of protease inhibitors (PIs) or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      inhibitors (NNRTIs) are associated with an increased risk of virological failure. Likewise,&#xD;
      excessive antiretroviral drug concentrations increase the risk of toxicity. Therapeutic drug&#xD;
      monitoring (TDM) may identify and correct excessively high or low PI and/or NNRTI&#xD;
      concentrations, and thus minimize toxicity and risk of treatment failure. Treatment&#xD;
      guidelines only recommend using TDM to help optimize ARV therapy in selected patients, and&#xD;
      there are no clear recommendations to guide the clinician who decides to adjust drug doses.&#xD;
      Prospective studies have demonstrated the relationship between EFV plasma concentration and&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric symptoms. Moreover, EFV is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 2B6 and its&#xD;
      concentration was reported to be associated with the CYP2B6 516GrT genetic polymorphism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For drugs such as EFV or LPV/r, lower doses than the ones validated for standard clinical use&#xD;
      have demonstrated efficacy in dose-ranging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use a standardised algorithm to reduce doses in patients with plasma&#xD;
      EFV or LPV/r concentration above percentile 75. This algorithm is based on a Bayesian&#xD;
      approach from the pharmacology unit in Lausanne. The investigators hypothesize that a dosage&#xD;
      individualisation is feasible and safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim at testing a simplified algorithm for dose reduction in patients with&#xD;
      documented virological efficacy, treated by a stable LPV/r or EFV based regimen with elevated&#xD;
      plasma concentration of these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective open label study in which all eligible patients screened with a plasma drug&#xD;
      concentration of either EFV or LPV/r above percentile 75 will be included. After confirmation&#xD;
      of the results at baseline, patients will be offered to decrease drug dosage by a third or a&#xD;
      half according to a standardised algorithm. All patients will undergo HIVRNA, biochemistry&#xD;
      and validated questionnaires after 3 and 6 months to assess the safety and the benefit of&#xD;
      this strategy.&#xD;
