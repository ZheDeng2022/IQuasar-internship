      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of Fluticasone/ salmeterol combination&#xD;
      and double the dose of fluticasone on airway hyper-responsiveness to methacholine in a&#xD;
      randomised, double blind, double dummy, cross-over trial.&#xD;

      The objective of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of asthma is restoration of pulmonary&#xD;
      function. This is accomplished by reducing airway inflammation, stimulating bronchodilation&#xD;
      or a combination of the two. The classes of drug that have proved effective in this regard&#xD;
      are anti-inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids and mast cell-stabilising agents, and&#xD;
      bronchodilators such as β2 adrenergic agonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are used as a first-line anti-inflammatory prophylactic therapy&#xD;
      for asthma. Current guidelines recommend initiating treatment with a medium to high dose,&#xD;
      then reducing to the lowest effective dose for long-term maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroids are preferably inhaled from aerosol inhalers (commonly pMDIs: pressurised&#xD;
      metered dose inhalers) using large-volume spacer devices for pMDI doses in excess of 800&#xD;
      µg/day of BDP (Beclometasone Dipropionate), or equivalent. CFCs ((Chlorofluorocarbon)) (&#xD;
      propellants in BDP pMDIs are being replaced with non-ozone-depleting propellants such as&#xD;
      hydrofluoroalkane-134a (HFA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of steroid therapies in patients with asthma is rather difficult using&#xD;
      conventional measures such as lung function parameters (FEV1/forced expiratory flow over one&#xD;
      sencond or PEF/Peak expiratory flow) when chosen as the primary outcome variable, as these&#xD;
      are relatively insensitive to ICS therapy, and are rather distant from the underlying&#xD;
      inflammatory process. Measurements of airway responsiveness are frequently used to evaluate&#xD;
      asthma treatments and methacholine or histamine challenge testing is recognized and&#xD;
      recommended by regulatory authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Airway responsiveness is defined as the relative ease with which airways can be made to&#xD;
      constrict when exposed to non-sensitising chemical or physical stimuli such as methacholine,&#xD;
      histamine, cold air, exercise or hyperventilation. Methacholine challenge looks at the&#xD;
      functional antagonism of long acting bronchodilators (LABA) against increased airway tone; as&#xD;
      such there is always more room for potential improvement, and therefore treatment response,&#xD;
      with protection against challenge than with spirometry alone. In addition the effect of ICS&#xD;
      is more sensitive when measured with methacholine challenge testing than with lung function&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, which looked at the effect of both ICS alone and ICS with LABA, methacholine&#xD;
      challenge was selected as it is more sensitive than lung function alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methacholine challenge test involves delivering doubling concentrations of methacholine&#xD;
      over a period of time (usually 2 minutes) until a given level of bronchoconstriction is&#xD;
      achieved (often a 20% fall in FEV1). The provocative concentration producing a 20% fall in&#xD;
      FEV1 is termed the PC20. Previous studies have shown that treatment with 50µg salmeterol&#xD;
      versus 100 µg Fluticasone plus 50 µg salbutamol showed a 1.15 doubling dose difference in&#xD;
      response to methacholine challenge, which would indicate that a treatment response to the&#xD;
      100µg fluticasone would be in the region of 1 doubling dose15. A similar study demonstrated a&#xD;
      similar (0.9 dd difference between treatments) when comparing FPSM/fluticasone/ salmeterol&#xD;
      (125/50µg) vs FP/Flutiocasone Propionate(250µg) alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One doubling dose can therefore be shown to indicate a clinically relevant difference between&#xD;
      the treatments (based upon either the ICS or the LABA component of the combination product)&#xD;
      as shown in previous studies. Therefore 1 dd shift in treatment response was defined as the&#xD;
      minimally important clinical difference for the purposes of the statistical calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the measures of efficacy, this study aimed to compare the effect of the two&#xD;
      treatments on basal HPA-axis suppression in vivo, as measured by the ratio of overnight&#xD;
      urinary cortisol to creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bioactivity of a corticosteroid is thought to be related to the relative degree of&#xD;
      HPA-axis suppression as measured by the decrease in the ratio of overnight urinary cortisol&#xD;
      to creatinine. This measure has been shown to be as sensitive as a 24-hour collection. An&#xD;
      alternative, though less sensitive, assessment is plasma cortisol and creatinine production&#xD;
      30 minutes after stimulation with ACTH19,20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two formulations were administered for 2 weeks, which was thought to be sufficient to&#xD;
      achieve steady state in terms of HPA-axis suppression. It had been shown previously that&#xD;
      steady state plasma levels can be achieved in 3 days when using fluticasone propionate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smokers have been shown to develop acquired steroid resistance, resulting in a diminished&#xD;
      response. It has therefore been the practice of most studies on asthma to exclude smokers as&#xD;
      a matter of course. Indeed current asthma guidelines are based on these studies. A recent&#xD;
      subgroup analysis of the 'Gaining Optimal Asthma controL (GOAL) study' reported by Pedersen&#xD;
      and colleagues has revealed some interesting results. They discovered that smokers gained&#xD;
      more benefit from FPSM vs FP alone, as compared to non smokers, in terms of reduction in&#xD;
      exacerbation rates over 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To put the results of this study into a clinical context, in the majority of patients who&#xD;
      were non smokers it would take 25 years to obtain an additional benefit to prevent an&#xD;
      exacerbation by taking fluticasone/salmeterol vs fluticasone alone. In smokers it would take&#xD;
      6.66 years to see the same benefit conferred by using combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reasons for the apparent increased benefits of treatment with FP/SM in smokers are&#xD;
      unclear. A potential explanation for this could be that, in the face of the relative steroid&#xD;
      resistance seen in smokers, the smooth muscle stabilisation conferred by the LABA becomes of&#xD;
      greater significance. Another possible explanation is that smoking induces greater&#xD;
      hyper-reactivity in the airway smooth muscle, which responds well to the smooth muscle&#xD;
      stabilisation offered by LABAs. A third possibility is that smoking might in some way&#xD;
      up-regulate beta2- adrenoreceptor function. It was therefore felt important to include a&#xD;
      cohort of smokers in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To enter Treatment Period 1, subjects must have had a provocative concentration of&#xD;
      methacholine causing a 20% decrease in FEV1 (PC20) of less than 4mg/mL at randomisation and&#xD;
      FEV1 at the end of the run-in period and wash-out must have remained within 15% of that&#xD;
      recorded at screening, and ≥ 60% predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For entry into the second treatment period the PC20 after 2 to 3 weeks of the placebo washout&#xD;
      must have been within ±1 doubling dilution of the initial placebo run in period.&#xD;
