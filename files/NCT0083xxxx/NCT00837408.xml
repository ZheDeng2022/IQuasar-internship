      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify susceptibility genetic&#xD;
           variants for diabetes among Han Chinese.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To conduct resequencing of positional candidate gene/loci to identify likely functional&#xD;
           variants in a subset of the cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To conduct replication studies of the top-100 scoring variants in three independent&#xD;
           African and European ancestry samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate whether diabetes-associated variants discovered in European populations&#xD;
           increase diabetes risk in Han Chinese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients 25 years of age with newly diagnosed T2D in Suizhou, China. Control subjects&#xD;
           are nondiabetics, age and ethnically matched to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study design for both patients and controls consists of the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discuss informed consent process and obtain signed informed consent form. Informed&#xD;
           consent will be administered by trained clinic staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assign study ID (barcode)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administer questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain spot urine sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain anthropometric measurements including body composition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform finger prick for blood glucose level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain venous blood samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform eye examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the following day, perform confirmatory blood glucose for the small subset of&#xD;
           participants requiring confirmation of previous test result&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DNA extraction of stored samples will be done at either the National Institutes of&#xD;
           Health or the laboratory in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GWAS will be conducted using publicly available software packages.&#xD;

      This research protocol is designed to study the genetic basis of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) in Han&#xD;
      Chinese. This project taking place at Suizhou Central Hospital complements several years of&#xD;
      similar research activities conducted by Dr. Rotimi s lab in populations of the African&#xD;
      Diaspora with study sites in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and the US. Suizhou Hospital was selected&#xD;
      because of the existence of an excellent team of research investigators, infrastructure and&#xD;
      more importantly, the availability of a large population from which to enroll and examine&#xD;
      persons with diabetes and normal controls. Previous funding from Dr. Rotimi s lab at Howard&#xD;
      University made it possible for Dr. Jiang and staff to enroll 1000 cases and controls.&#xD;
      Therefore, the goal of the current project is to enroll additional 1500 cases of T2D and 1500&#xD;
      ethnically matched Han controls from Suizhou to facilitate the conduct of genome-wide&#xD;
      association study (GWAS) and candidate gene/loci studies in Han, Chinese. The current project&#xD;
      will increase the number of subjects for future GWAS, linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping and&#xD;
      functional studies to over 4,000 ethnically balanced cases (greater than 2,000) and controls&#xD;
      (greater than 2,000). Identified candidate genes/loci will be investigated by re-sequencing&#xD;
      and functional studies will be conducted to identify susceptibility variants for diabetes and&#xD;
      associated complications including obesity, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy and&#xD;
      retinopathy. Given past activities, it is also anticipated that this resource will form the&#xD;
      basis of multiple collaborations between Dr. Rotimi s lab, several NIH intramural researchers&#xD;
      and non-NIH scientists.&#xD;

        Cases will be drawn from Type 2 Diabetics attending clinics at the Suizhou Central&#xD;
        Hospital. Controls will be ethnicity-matched individuals from the community served by this&#xD;
        hospital.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cases Men and women with confirmed type 2 diabetes mellitus that are either on treatment&#xD;
        for diabetes or newly diagnose with blood sugar reading on more than one occasion exceeding&#xD;
        or equal to 126 mg/dl. These persons must be above the age of 25 years. In this regard, all&#xD;
        newly diagnosed participants will be required to visit the clinic on the following day to&#xD;
        perform fasting blood glucose test to confirm previous results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Controls Men and women with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) less than 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l).&#xD;
        Controls must be above age 25 years and should be ethnically matched to the cases. Enrolled&#xD;
        cases and controls have to be unrelated. Therefore, only one person may be enrolled from&#xD;
        each family unless they are husband and wife.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Attempts will be made to enroll an equal number of men and women. To ensure that ethnic&#xD;
        distribution is maintained in the parent study, we are proposing to enroll only Han Chinese&#xD;
        participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        People who do not meet the above criteria (e.g., younger than 24, without the blood sugar&#xD;
        requirements, etc). No more than one non-spouse member of each family. No prisoners,&#xD;
        pregnant women or fetuses will be included in this study.&#xD;
