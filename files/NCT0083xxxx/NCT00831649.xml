  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of&#xD;
      natalizumab in subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receiving concomitant&#xD;
      methotrexate (MTX)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The biological effect seen with natalizumab was not sufficient to warrant further development&#xD;
    in RA.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be eligible to begin study participation if they meet all of the following&#xD;
        inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must give written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects ≥18 to ≤75 years of age (at randomization in Study&#xD;
             ELN100226-RA201)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have been randomized in Study ELN100226-RA201;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have completed the Month 6 visit of Study ELN100226-RA201 OR Subjects who&#xD;
             have an inadequate therapeutic response (defined as a &lt; 20% reduction from baseline&#xD;
             [Month 0 in Study ELN100226-RA201] for both painful/tender and swollen joint counts)&#xD;
             after receiving at least 4 infusions of study drug and has not been rescued with other&#xD;
             RA medications during the treatment phase of Study ELN100226-RA201;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be taking MTX at the same dose last used in Study ELN100226-RA201;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential agreed to use adequate, contraceptive&#xD;
             methods (either intrauterine device [IUD], oral or depot contraceptive, or barrier&#xD;
             plus spermicide). Female subjects of childbearing potential used adequate&#xD;
             contraception for at least 2 months prior to study entry and continued contraception&#xD;
             for at least 3 months after their last infusion of study drug;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing and able to complete all planned study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following exclusion&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;

          -  Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding or those planning to become pregnant in the&#xD;
             next 14 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have experienced anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, clinical syndrome&#xD;
             diagnostic of serum sickness, or biopsy-proven vasculitis to a previous infusion of&#xD;
             study drug;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who received rescue intervention in Study ELN100226-RA201, defined as an&#xD;
             increase in dose of an existing permitted concomitant treatment of RA or the&#xD;
             introduction of a new treatment of RA;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject who are expected to be unavailable for the duration of the trial, likely to be&#xD;
             noncompliant with the Protocol, or who are felt to be unsuitable by the Investigator&#xD;
             for any other reason;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of a malignancy (other than surgically excised basal or&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of clinically significant and/or persistent gastrointestinal,&#xD;
             pulmonary, chronic infection, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, neurological,&#xD;
             dermatological, immunological, major psychiatric (including drug or alcohol abusers)&#xD;
             or hematological illness, which in the opinion of the Investigator places the subject&#xD;
             at unacceptable risk for participation in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who intend to donate blood or blood products during the period of the study&#xD;
             or within one month following completion of the study.&#xD;
