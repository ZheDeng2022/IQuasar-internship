      The purpose of this research study is to determine how effective and how safe it is to give&#xD;
      an Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) immunotherapy product to participants with nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      carcinoma (NPC) associated with EBV that has come back or spread to other parts of the&#xD;
      participants body. The EBV immunotherapy product will be made with white blood cells from the&#xD;
      participants blood and takes about 16 weeks to create. This EBV immunotherapy product may&#xD;
      stop cancer cells from growing and cause the tumors to disappear.&#xD;

      Subjects will register and provide a blood sample which will be used to create the immune&#xD;
      therapy product. This will take about 16 weeks during which time they will receive&#xD;
      chemotherapy for their nasopharynx cancer. When the immune product is ready the chemotherapy&#xD;
      will be stopped and the immunotherapy product will be given to the participant by infusion.&#xD;
      On the first day of the research treatment, participants will receive infusion #1 of the EBV&#xD;
      immunotherapy product. Fourteen days later, the participant will receive infusion #2. Eight&#xD;
      weeks after infusion #2, the research doctor will do some tests to determine the effects that&#xD;
      the EBV immunotherapy product has had on the participants tumor. If the research doctor&#xD;
      thinks that they would benefit from a third infusion of the EBV immunotherapy product and&#xD;
      there is sufficient immunotherapy product remaining, the participant my be given infusion #3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before each infusion of the EBV immunotherapy product participants will have a physical&#xD;
           exam, blood work and fiberoptic exam of the nasopharynx if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within 28 days of receiving the EBV immunotherapy product for the first time, we will&#xD;
           evaluate the participants tumor by using CT scan and/or MRI.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically proven NPC of an WHO grade, associated with EBV&#xD;
             infection documented by the presence of EBER expression by in situ hybridization in&#xD;
             the tumor. Positive EBER staining from another institution must be confirmed by&#xD;
             pathology review at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Other confirmation of EBV-associated&#xD;
             disease is acceptable, such as EBV DNA in situ hybridization, if EBER analysis is not&#xD;
             adequate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Incurable NPC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recovery from toxicity from any prior NPC therapy to grade 1 or better&#xD;
