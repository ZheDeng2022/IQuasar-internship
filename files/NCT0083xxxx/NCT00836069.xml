  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-site, Phase 3, placebo&#xD;
      controlled fixed-dose study of PD 0332334 and paroxetine in 528 outpatients with generalized&#xD;
      anxiety disorder. Subjects will be randomized to the following treatments (132 subjects per&#xD;
      treatment group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD 0332334 225 mg twice a day (450 mg/day), PD 0332334 300 mg twice a day (600 mg/day),&#xD;
      placebo once a day in the morning or paroxetine 20 mg once a day in the morning (20 mg/day).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 3 phases: an initial screening phase which must be completed 7 to&#xD;
      14 days prior to randomization; an 8-week double-blind treatment phase; and a 2-week&#xD;
      double-blind dose-tapering follow-up phase. After obtaining written informed consent the&#xD;
      investigator will initiate washout of prior psychotropic medications. After the washout of&#xD;
      prior psychotropic medications has been completed the investigator must ensure that the&#xD;
      subject is no longer taking psychotropic medication for at least 14 days prior to the&#xD;
      randomization visit. In addition the investigator must ensure that screening visit procedures&#xD;
      (with the exception of obtaining informed consent) are completed within 14 days of the&#xD;
      randomization visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be approached during a regularly scheduled clinic visit, upon&#xD;
      referral from another physician, or in response to research advertisements. Those who call in&#xD;
      will participate in a short phone pre-screen. This allows us to determine if the person fits&#xD;
      the most limiting inclusion/exclusion criteria before requesting they dedicate a longer&#xD;
      period of time for an in-person screen. Additionally it gives interested individuals the&#xD;
      opportunity to learn more about the study and to review the consent form with family,&#xD;
      friends, and other physicians prior to coming in for the screen and making a final decision&#xD;
      regarding study enrollment. Once the subject has given informed consent, the screening&#xD;
      process for the study will commence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who fulfill entry criteria will be randomized to receive ONE of the following 4&#xD;
      treatments in a double-blind fashion: PD 0332334 225 mg twice a day, PD 0332334 300 mg twice&#xD;
      a day, placebo, and paroxetine 20 mg once in the morning. PD 0332334 will be titrated up in&#xD;
      the PD 0332334 225 mg twice a day and PD 0332334 300 mg twice daily treatment groups. The&#xD;
      titration of PD 0332334 will be from 125 mg in the beginning of the study. In addition the PD&#xD;
      0332334 225 mg twice a day and PD 0332334 300 mg twice a day treatment groups will be&#xD;
      titrated down at the end of the study. The 20 mg daily dose of paroxetine used in this study&#xD;
      is based on the approved label for the use of paroxetine in patients with generalized anxiety&#xD;
      disorder. Doses were selected for this Phase 3 study based on safety and efficacy information&#xD;
      known about PD 0332334 and pregabalin, an α2δ ligand approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      generalized anxiety disorder in Europe&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects enrolled will be men and women ages 18 to 65 who meet DSM-IV criteria for&#xD;
      generalized anxiety disorder with a preponderance of anxious symptoms over depressive&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      De-identified blood samples will be collected from study subjects at Screening (Visit 1)&#xD;
      according to the standard Molecular Profiling supplement to the protocol. Participation in&#xD;
      this component is optional for study subjects. Samples may be utilized in the future to&#xD;
      investigate generalized anxiety disorder genetics, expression metabonomics and protein&#xD;
      biomarker profiles, drug-response, or other genetic or biomarker questions. [Metabonomics:&#xD;
      The study of metabolic responses to drugs, environmental changes and diseases. Metabonomics&#xD;
      is an extension of genomics (concerned with DNA) and proteomics (concerned with proteins). ]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, partners of male participants who become pregnant during the course of the&#xD;
      study, will be requested to participate in order for the sponsor to collect safety&#xD;
      information and understand the effects, if any, that PD 0332334 may have on her pregnancy or&#xD;
      the fetus. Details of the this sub-study are described in the separate 'pregnant partner'&#xD;
      consent form. Pregnant partners will be be asked to sign a separate HIPAA and consent form in&#xD;
      order to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have recently received notification of an serious adverse event at another&#xD;
      site that has already begun recruitment for this study. The MediWatch report for that serious&#xD;
      adverse event is included as a Supporting document on WEBRIDGE. Additionally, a protocol&#xD;
      change clarifying the procedures to collect lab information to calculate the estimate&#xD;
      Creatinine Clearance has been submitted. This document has been added as a supporting&#xD;
      document on WEBRIDGE (IRB web-based management portal).&#xD;

             suicidality, but do not replace overall clinical judgment in determination of suicidal&#xD;
             risk).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Current use of psychotropic medications (ie, drugs normally prescribed for depression,&#xD;
             mania, anxiety, insomnia, or psychosis) that cannot be discontinued 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             randomization. Fluoxetine is prohibited within 5 weeks of randomization. In the event&#xD;
             of inadvertent administration of psychotropic medications during the 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             randomization, continued eligibility will be assessed on a case by case basis by the&#xD;

             weeks prior to randomization, continued eligibility will be assessed on a case by case&#xD;
             basis by the investigator and the medical monitor. In addition, following a discussion&#xD;
             of the individual case between the medical monitor and the investigator, the medical&#xD;
             monitor may allow minimal anxiolytic medication (for example a benzodiazepine) use for&#xD;
             subjects who experience significant intolerable anxiety during the final week of the&#xD;
             study (Days 64-71).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects who have been treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors in the 14 days prior&#xD;
             to the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Regular use of benzodiazepines during the 3 months prior to Screening (for at least 5&#xD;

             to continue formal psychotherapy during the study. This includes psychodynamic,&#xD;
             cognitive, and interpersonal therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Positive drug tests at Screening (Visit 1) or Randomization (Visit 2) visits for any&#xD;
             of the following substances or classes of compounds: amphetamines, barbiturates,&#xD;
             opiates, benzodiazepines, sedatives and hypnotics, cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP),&#xD;
             cannabinoids, or other illegal or illicit drugs. An exception to the exclusion for a&#xD;
             positive benzodiazepine, opiate, or sedative and hypnotic drug test at the Screening&#xD;
             (Visit 1) visit may be granted by the Pfizer medical monitor if written evidence of a&#xD;
             valid, current prescription is presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Subjects with a known hypersensitivity to paroxetine.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. History of allergy or intolerance to paroxetine.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Subjects with a prior history of insufficient response to paroxetine in the treatment&#xD;
             of generalized anxiety disorder (with an adequate trial of therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Pregnant or nursing females; females of childbearing potential who are unwilling or&#xD;
             unable to use an acceptable method of contraception for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             correction) &gt;450 msec, if confirmed with an unscheduled repeat 12-lead ECG's at the&#xD;
             screen visit. In the event of discrepant QTcF values (i.e., &gt;450 msec and &lt;450 msec)&#xD;
             after repeat unscheduled 12-lead ECG at screen, a decision with regards protocol&#xD;
             eligibility will be made on a case by case basis between the investigator and medical&#xD;
             monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. History of lack of efficacy for treatment of generalized anxiety disorder with, or&#xD;
             allergy or intolerance to, other α2δ drugs (pregabalin, gabapentin).&#xD;

             dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with trial participation or&#xD;
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             trial results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this trial.&#xD;
