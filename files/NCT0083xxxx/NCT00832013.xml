  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in health care require that more children are given sedation to allow doctors to&#xD;
      perform investigations or minor procedures. Sedation drugs have traditionally been given&#xD;
      orally (swallowed) by children. However, oral sedation drugs have unpredictable&#xD;
      characteristics, such as duration of sedation, which may result in difficulties performing&#xD;
      the planned procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic drugs are now invariably used for sedation in children. These are given through an&#xD;
      IV (skinny plastic tube inserted in to a vein). Propofol (white liquid) is the anesthetic&#xD;
      drug most commonly used for sedation at BC Children's Hospital for sedation. Propofol has&#xD;
      several advantages, including an accurately controllable depth of sedation (how deeply&#xD;
      asleep), minimal effect on the heart and circulation and control of reflexes (e,g coughing)&#xD;
      during the procedure. Propofol also promotes rapid recovery with less sickness and an earlier&#xD;
      return to normal functioning following the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While propofol has many advantages it can cause respiratory depression (reduced breathing&#xD;
      rate). This reduction in breathing is more common if propofol is given quickly. When your&#xD;
      child is given propofol for their proposed procedure this is performed by a pediatric&#xD;
      anesthesiologist who is skilled in supporting breathing should this be required. If your&#xD;
      child does not participate in this study they will still receive propofol administered by the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist as this is our usual practice. It would be routine to administer the&#xD;
      propofol rapidly and then support breathing for a few minutes. This is very safe in the hands&#xD;
      of an expert anesthesiologist but can be sometimes more risky in other settings where&#xD;
      extensive monitoring and anesthesiologists are not available. This is the setting that&#xD;
      propofol is used in many institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal is to determine how quickly propofol can be given without reducing breathing to the&#xD;
      point that help with breathing is required.&#xD;

      Purpose Advances in minimally invasive radiological and surgical techniques demand that&#xD;
      increasing numbers of children are given sedation or anesthesia to facilitate these&#xD;
      procedures, frequently performed on an out-patient or day-care basis. Most are performed&#xD;
      outside the operating room environment, with intensivists and emergency physicians&#xD;
      administering over 55 % of sedation episodes, and only 19% being performed by&#xD;
      anesthesiologists in North America. It is well documented that risks of complications during&#xD;
      sedation exceed those experienced during the much more controlled environment of general&#xD;
      anesthesia, with a twelve-fold increased risk of mortality when sedation is administered&#xD;
      outside the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedative agents have traditionally been administered orally to children. However,&#xD;
      characteristics of oral sedation drugs, such as unpredictable depth and duration of sedation&#xD;
      resulting from variable drug absorption and prolonged duration of drug effect, have resulted&#xD;
      in both high failure and complication rates. Recently, intravenous (IV) anesthetic drugs with&#xD;
      more accurately titratable and predictable characteristics have gained popularity for a&#xD;
      variety of sedation procedures. Propofol is the most commonly used intravenous agent for&#xD;
      these procedures in North America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The maximum safe infusion rate for an induction dose of propofol administered to&#xD;
      children for sedation can be reliably predicted. Safety will be optimized by preventing&#xD;
      apnoea whilst minimizing the time for induction of sedation and ensuring an adequate depth of&#xD;
      sedation is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification Propofol is an intravenous (IV) anesthetic agent used for induction and&#xD;
      maintenance of anesthesia in both adults and children. Propofol has several characteristics&#xD;
      favouring its use, including an accurately titratable depth of anesthesia, cardiovascular&#xD;
      stability, suppression of upper airway reflexes, rapid recovery with reduced post-operative&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting and overall earlier return to pre-anesthetic functional state. At lower&#xD;
      doses, propofol may also be used to maintain a level of sedation for radiological imaging or&#xD;
      endoscopic investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While propofol provides many advantages it does cause significant respiratory depression.&#xD;
      Adverse respiratory events have been reported to be similar in both adults and children.&#xD;
      Propofol induced respiratory depression may lead to hypoxemia requiring the provision of&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen by mask and/or manual positive pressure ventilation.8 Artificial&#xD;
      ventilation requires significant expertise and if poorly managed may result in gastric&#xD;
      insufflation, pulmonary aspiration or hypoxia, all of which can lead to devastating&#xD;
      complications such as permanent brain injury or death. The maximum dose or rate of&#xD;
      administration of propofol that causes respiratory depression in children has yet to be&#xD;
      accurately defined. Age specific effects have also not been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Develop a safe dosing schedule for propofol administration in children that will ensure&#xD;
      spontaneous ventilation is maintained in at least 95% of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Model the effects of propofol induction administered by intravenous infusion to facilitate&#xD;
      the prediction of dosing schedules for different doses, different end-points in different&#xD;
      clinical scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method Prospective randomized study. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a&#xD;
      predetermined infusion rate for propofol during induction of sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis A graphical representation of each data point with crossovers will be&#xD;
      produced. Data will be analysed on a per protocol basis using the pooled-adjacent-violators&#xD;
      algorithm to estimate the maximal infusion rate whilst preserving spontaneous ventilation. We&#xD;
      will apply the boot-strap methods implemented by Pace to compute 95 % confidence limits. The&#xD;
      effect of age, will be assessed by performing separate analyses in the age-strata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To model the ventilatory effects of propofol, we will develop a mathematical model of human&#xD;
      respiratory control. We will base this on the respiratory model proposed by Ursino (Ursino&#xD;
      Model)19-21 which is a three compartment model comprising the lung, brain and tissues for gas&#xD;
      exchange. We will enhance the model to include ventilatory regulation, along with&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models of propofol including a respiratory effect site.&#xD;
      The identification of suitable parameters for the model will include non-linear fitting of&#xD;
      the clinical data (age, weight, BSA, ventilatory volumes, CO2 excretion, respiratory rate,&#xD;
      and entropy).&#xD;

    <description>Propofol 1 % at a dose of 4mg/kg will be administered intravenously via a standard Medex Protégé® 3010 (Medex-A Furon. Healthcare Company, Duluth, GA, USA) infusion pump at a constant rate determined by the randomization schedule. Fresh gas flow will be maintained at 6 l/min throughout the induction procedure with the FiO2 increased to 0.5. Full cardiovascular, respiratory and EEG monitoring will continue during induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
Once the loading dose of propofol has been delivered the propofol infusion will be maintained at a rate of 200mcg/kg/min or as determined by the attending anesthesiologist whilst the end-point respiratory responses are observed.</description>
