  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dengue fever, which is caused by dengue viruses, is a major health problem in tropical and&#xD;
      subtropical regions of the world. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of and&#xD;
      immune response to a new dengue virus vaccine in healthy adults.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 2 billion people living in tropical and subtropical regions of the world are at&#xD;
      risk of dengue virus infection. Dengue viruses cause dengue fever, as well as the more severe&#xD;
      dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome, and dengue virus infection is the leading cause of&#xD;
      hospitalization and death in children in several tropical Asian countries. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live, attenuated dengue virus called&#xD;
      rDEN3delta30/31-7164.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of two groups, with Group 1 enrolling first. Group 1 participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to receive either 10^3 PFU of rDEN3delta30/31-7164 or placebo&#xD;
      subcutaneously in their deltoid. Participants will be monitored at the clinic for 30 minutes&#xD;
      after receiving the immunization to monitor for adverse effects. After that, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to return to the clinic approximately every other day for the next 16 days, and&#xD;
      then on Day 21, 28, 42, and 180. At each visit participants will have physical and clinical&#xD;
      exams, vital signs, measures, blood drawn, and will be asked about any adverse events they&#xD;
      may have experience. Female participants will be given a pregnancy test. In addition,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to measure their temperature 3 times a day and record it in a&#xD;
      temperature diary for the first 16 days after immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If less than 90% of the participants in Group 1 seroconvert to DEN3 then Group 2A will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Group 2A will follow the same procedures as Group 1, but will receive a 10^5 PFU&#xD;
      dose of rDEN3delta30/31-7164.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If more than 90% of the participants in Group 1 seroconvert to DEN3 then Group 2B will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Group 2A will follow the same procedures as Group 1, but will receive a 10^1 PFU&#xD;
      dose of rDEN3delta30/31-7164.&#xD;
