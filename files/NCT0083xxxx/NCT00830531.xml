  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of the study is to obtain pharmacokinetic and safety data of bumetanide in&#xD;
      newborns with refractory seizures. The overall hypothesis is that bumetanide, added to&#xD;
      conventional antiepileptic (antiseizure) medications, will be a safe and well tolerated&#xD;
      medication, compared with conventional antiepileptic drugs alone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seizures occur more often during the newborn period (2-3.5 per 1000 live births) than at any&#xD;
      later age. Neonatal seizures can lead to frequent and serious long-term consequences in&#xD;
      survivors, such as later epilepsy and significant cognitive and motor disabilities.&#xD;
      Unfortunately there are no completely effective drugs to treat neonatal seizures.&#xD;
      Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) currently used to treat neonatal seizures are generally&#xD;
      ineffective and have significant potential for side effects. Furthermore, many of these AEDs&#xD;
      have never been tested in a randomized study. Numerous experts have thus emphasized in the&#xD;
      last few years the urgent need for randomized trials of potential new treatments for neonatal&#xD;
      seizures. The investigators are conducting a pilot study of the drug bumetanide as one such&#xD;
      potential and novel treatment. Bumetanide is a commercially available drug that has been used&#xD;
      safely in newborns as a diuretic for many years with minimal side effects. Recent basic&#xD;
      science research in animals has shown bumetanide to be very effective in reducing seizures in&#xD;
      neonatal animals by blocking a specific chloride importer which is highly expressed in&#xD;
      neonates but not in children and adults (1). Moreover, these experimental studies have shown&#xD;
      bumetanide to be particularly effective against seizures when used in combination with&#xD;
      phenobarbital (PB), which is the standard first drug given to treat neonatal seizures (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blind, controlled, dose escalation study&#xD;
      of BTN as add-on therapy to treat refractory seizures caused by HIE, focal or multi-focal&#xD;
      stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, CNS infection, genetic syndrome, focal or diffuse brain&#xD;
      malformation, idiopathic or presumed genetic etiology of seizures, or metabolic disorder&#xD;
      other than electrolyte disturbances or those caused by renal failure not controlled by an&#xD;
      initial loading dose of PB. The trial will test the feasibility of early enrollment of&#xD;
      newborns with HIE, rapid application of a full montage EEG, and continuous review of EEG data&#xD;
      to detect refractory seizures as soon as they occur following an initial loading dose of PB.&#xD;
      When an EEG-proven seizure occurs at least 30 minutes following a loading dose of PB, the&#xD;
      newborn will be randomized to receive either BTN or placebo in conjunction with a loading&#xD;
      dose of PB. Clinical, laboratory and continuous EEG monitoring data obtained after BTN&#xD;
      administration will be analyzed to determine the pharmacokinetics (3) and safety of BTN by&#xD;
      comparing data from treatment and standard therapy groups. This study addresses important&#xD;
      challenges in trial design and sets the stage for trials to improve treatment of neonatal&#xD;
      seizures. Data from this pilot study will be used to guide design of a planned Phase III&#xD;
      multicenter trial to test the efficacy of BTN to control refractory neonatal seizures.&#xD;
