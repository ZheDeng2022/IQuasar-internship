  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of local infiltration to an&#xD;
      ultrasound guided nerve block placed by the anesthesiologist for children undergoing&#xD;
      umbilical hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-cohort, double blinded, randomized study comparing local infiltration to&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block in children 1 to 17 years of age undergoing epigastric&#xD;
      or umbilical hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will first compare pain scores to see if one method is more adequate then the other in&#xD;
      providing post-op analgesia. Our second aim is to compare morphine consumption between the&#xD;
      two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our third aim is to measure the levels of local anesthetic in the blood following local&#xD;
      anesthetic infiltration or USGRSB.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy children, aged 1 to 17 years of age, undergoing elective umbilical hernia repairs&#xD;
      will be considered for this study. After informed consent/assent has been obtained, the&#xD;
      subject will be randomized into one of two groups. Group A will receive local infiltration of&#xD;
      0.25% bupivacaine by the surgeon at the end of the subject's surgery. Group B will undergo an&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block using 0.25% bupivacaine prior to incision by an&#xD;
      anesthesiologist skilled in the performance of this block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive a standardized anesthetic for their surgery. Subjects assigned to&#xD;
      Group A (local infiltration) will receive 2mcg/kg of fentanyl prior to incision for&#xD;
      intra-operative pain management. Subjects assigned to Group B will have their Rectus Sheath&#xD;
      Block and no fentanyl will be given at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fentanyl is a short-acting opioid analgesic. It's duration of action in the dose we will be&#xD;
      using is approximately one hour which is close to the expected length of surgery. Therefore,&#xD;
      it is not expected to influence the pain management after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain scores will be assessed by a member of the research team. They will be blinded to which&#xD;
      technique the subject has been randomized to. This person will not be involved in the direct&#xD;
      care of the subject. These observations will be made using an age-appropriate scoring system&#xD;
      (FLACC or FACES scale). Scoring will be done every 5 minutes when the subject is in the&#xD;
      recovery room and every 30 minutes when they are in Phase II. This will be done until the&#xD;
      subject is discharged from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families will be followed by phone for 48 h post discharge, to collect data on medication&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
