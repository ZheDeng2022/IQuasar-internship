  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary studies have shown that people with diabetes who undergo heart surgery may have a&#xD;
      higher risk of developing cognitive functioning problems, including memory problems, than&#xD;
      people without diabetes who undergo heart surgery. Among people with diabetes, however, those&#xD;
      who control their blood sugar levels in a more intensive way during and after heart surgery&#xD;
      may have better neurological outcomes than those who use a standard method of controlling&#xD;
      their blood sugar levels. This study will compare the effectiveness of using a traditional&#xD;
      method of blood sugar control versus a more intensive method of blood sugar control during&#xD;
      and after heart surgery for improving neurological outcomes in people with diabetes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      People with diabetes who undergo heart surgery have a greater risk of experiencing a stroke&#xD;
      and developing cognitive functioning problems than people without diabetes who undergo heart&#xD;
      surgery. There may be a connection between disturbances in glucose metabolism, endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction, and poor neurological outcomes after heart surgery. People with diabetes who&#xD;
      receive more intensive blood glucose management during and after heart surgery may have&#xD;
      better neurological outcomes than people who control their blood glucose levels in a standard&#xD;
      way. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of using a traditional method&#xD;
      of controlling blood glucose levels versus a tailored, more intensive method of glucose&#xD;
      control on neurological outcomes in people with diabetes who are undergoing heart surgery.&#xD;
      Researchers will also examine genetic factors that may be associated with insulin resistance&#xD;
      and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll people undergoing heart surgery. On the day before surgery,&#xD;
      participants will undergo a blood collection and neuropsychological testing. They will then&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to either a traditional method of blood glucose control or an intensive,&#xD;
      tailored method of blood glucose control. Participants following the traditional method of&#xD;
      blood glucose control may receive insulin several times a day, based on the results of&#xD;
      glucose monitoring. Participants following the intensive, tailored method of blood glucose&#xD;
      control will undergo hourly measurements of their glucose levels and receive insulin&#xD;
      adjustments as needed to maintain a glucose level of 100-140 mg/dL. During surgery, all&#xD;
      participants will undergo an ultrasound of their neck to monitor blood vessel activity.&#xD;
      Additional blood samples will be collected during surgery, 6 hours after surgery, 24 hours&#xD;
      after surgery, and upon hospital discharge or 5 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after surgery or just before leaving the hospital, participants will undergo a&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure and neuropsychological testing. Before leaving the&#xD;
      hospital, participants will take part in a diabetes education session and nutrition&#xD;
      counseling. Three to 6 weeks and 6 months after surgery, participants will undergo repeat&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing. Once a month for 6 months, participants who received the&#xD;
      intensive, tailored method of blood glucose control will attend study visits at which time&#xD;
      study researchers will monitor their diabetes.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the intensive glucose management group will undergo strict management of their blood glucose levels with a target whole blood glucose level of 100-140 mg/dL preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively in the intensive care unit (ICU). Once meals are started, targets for glycemia management will be (a) fasting: 80-140 mg/dL, (b) postprandial: 140-180 mg/dL. Prior to hospital discharge, participants will receive an in-depth diabetes education session. After hospital discharge, participants will attend monthly study visits for 6 months so that study researchers can monitor their glycemia management.</description>
