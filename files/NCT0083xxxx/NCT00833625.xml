    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the results of a positron emission&#xD;
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan done 10-14 days after beginning chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiation (chemoradiation) can predict how a patient with cancer of the esophagus will&#xD;
      respond to chemoradiation. Researchers also want to learn if biomarkers (substances in the&#xD;
      body associated with cancer) found in tumor tissue can predict response to chemoradiation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      You have cancer of the esophagus and you and your doctor have agreed that you will have&#xD;
      treatment with chemoradiation to try to shrink the cancer. You will then have surgery to&#xD;
      remove any remaining tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How well cancer of the esophagus responds to chemoradiation varies from person to person.&#xD;
      Currently, doctors cannot tell before surgery in which patients the chemoradiation will kill&#xD;
      all of the cancer, some of the cancer, or not much of the cancer. Studying patients' PET/CT&#xD;
      scans and tumor tissue for biomarkers may help researchers predict how an individual patient&#xD;
      will respond to chemoradiation. This could spare future patients from having unnecessary&#xD;
      surgery or chemoradiation treatment that is not effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET and CT scans are both standard imaging tests that doctors use to find cancer in the body.&#xD;
      The PET scan detects the signal of actively growing cancer cells in the body and the CT scan&#xD;
      shows the location, size, and shape of the cancer. Combining these scans provides more&#xD;
      complete information on cancer location, growth, and changes in the cancer over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, routine testing for esophageal cancer at MD Anderson includes a PET/CT scan at the&#xD;
      time of diagnosis and 5 or 6 weeks after chemoradiation is completed. Researchers hope that&#xD;
      analyzing changes seen in an &quot;early&quot; PET/CT scan (performed between 10-14 days after starting&#xD;
      chemoradiation) compared to the PET/CT scan taken at the time of diagnosis may predict how&#xD;
      well the chemoradiation will work against the patient's cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET/CT Scan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, 10-14 days after you start your&#xD;
      chemoradiation treatment you will have a PET/CT scan performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will need to fast (not have anything to eat or drink except water) for 4-6 hours before&#xD;
      the PET/CT scan. Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check your blood sugar level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive a small amount of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) solution by vein. Cancer cells&#xD;
      use sugar at a higher rate than normal cells do. FDG is a radioactive form of glucose (sugar)&#xD;
      commonly used during a PET scan. The FDG helps show areas in the body where there is cancer&#xD;
      cell growth. After receiving the FDG solution, you will rest in a quiet, darkened room for&#xD;
      45-60 minutes before the PET/CT scan. The entire procedure should take about 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This PET/CT scan will be compared to your routine PET/CT scan. Your doctor will tell you of&#xD;
      the results of this PET/CT scan. However, the results will not change the planned treatment&#xD;
      you receive, unless the scan shows that the disease has gotten worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will collect samples of tumor tissue previously collected at MD Anderson. This&#xD;
      tissue will be used for biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be off active study once you complete the PET/CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Record Information Collection and Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study staff will collect information from your medical record on tests, evaluations, and&#xD;
      treatments you receive as part of your routine care. The study staff will continue to collect&#xD;
      this information from your medical record as long as you are a patient at MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you stop coming to MD Anderson, you will be called by the study staff every 3 months after&#xD;
      surgery for the first year and then every 6 months after that. During this call, you will be&#xD;
      asked about your health status. The call should take about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. PET/CT scans are routine tests for patients with cancer of&#xD;
      the esophagus. The early PET/CT scan for the purpose of this study is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 95 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
