    <description>The BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions during a 24 hour period prior to evaluation. It consists of 5 questions. Questions 1 to 4 measure the magnitude of pain at its worst, least, average, and 'right now'. Responses are provided by the participant on an 11 point numeric rating scale with anchors at 0 (No Pain) and 10 (Pain as bad as you can imagine). Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain. Negative Score indicates decrease in pain and Positive Score indicates increase in pain. This measure denotes the average pain score, minimum score = 0 and maximum score = 10 with lower scores indicative of less pain.</description>

    <description>The BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions during a 24 hour period prior to evaluation. It consists of 5 questions. Question 5 consists of seven item subsets, A to G, that measure the level of interference of pain on daily functions. Responses are given on an 11 point numeric rating scale with anchors at 0 (Does not interfere) and 10 (Completely interferes). Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain interference. The BPI-sf Pain Interference with Function Composite score is calculated as the average of the seven item subsets (questions 5A to G) in the BPI-sf questionnaire. If one of the seven items was missing then the average score of the remaining items was used to impute the missing (seventh) value. If more than one item was missing then the composite score was missing.</description>

        <description>The BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions during a 24 hour period prior to evaluation. It consists of 5 questions. Questions 1 to 4 measure the magnitude of pain at its worst, least, average, and 'right now'. Responses are provided by the participant on an 11 point numeric rating scale with anchors at 0 (No Pain) and 10 (Pain as bad as you can imagine). Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain. Negative Score indicates decrease in pain and Positive Score indicates increase in pain. This measure denotes the average pain score, minimum score = 0 and maximum score = 10 with lower scores indicative of less pain.</description>

        <title>Change From A4091029 Baseline in BPI-sf Average Pain Score at Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 40, 48, 56 and 64</title>
        <description>The BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions during a 24 hour period prior to evaluation. It consists of 5 questions. Questions 1 to 4 measure the magnitude of pain at its worst, least, average, and 'right now'. Responses are provided by the participant on an 11 point numeric rating scale with anchors at 0 (No Pain) and 10 (Pain as bad as you can imagine). Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain. Negative Score indicates decrease in pain and Positive Score indicates increase in pain. This measure denotes the average pain score, minimum score = 0 and maximum score = 10 with lower scores indicative of less pain.</description>

        <description>The BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions during a 24 hour period prior to evaluation. It consists of 5 questions. Questions 1 to 4 measure the magnitude of pain at its worst, least, average, and 'right now'. Responses are provided by the participant on an 11 point numeric rating scale with anchors at 0 (No Pain) and 10 (Pain as bad as you can imagine). Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain. Negative Score indicates decrease in pain and Positive Score indicates increase in pain. This measure denotes the least pain score (within the last 24 hours at the time of the questionnaire), minimum score = 0 and maximum score = 10 with lower scores indicative of less pain.</description>

        <title>Change From Study A4091029 Baseline in BPI-sf Least Pain Score at Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 40, 48, 56 and 64</title>
        <description>The BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions during a 24 hour period prior to evaluation. It consists of 5 questions. Questions 1 to 4 measure the magnitude of pain at its worst, least, average, and 'right now'. Responses are provided by the participant on an 11 point numeric rating scale with anchors at 0 (No Pain) and 10 (Pain as bad as you can imagine). Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain. Negative Score indicates decrease in pain and Positive Score indicates increase in pain. This measure denotes the least pain score (within the last 24 hours at the time of the questionnaire), minimum score = 0 and maximum score = 10 with lower scores indicative of less pain.</description>

        <title>Change From Study A4091029 Baseline in BPI-sf Score for Right Now Pain at Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 40, 48, 56 and 64</title>
        <description>The BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions during a 24 hour period prior to evaluation. It consists of 5 questions. Questions 1 to 4 measure the magnitude of pain at its worst, least, average, and 'right now'. Responses are provided by the participant on an 11 point numeric rating scale with anchors at 0 (No Pain) and 10 (Pain as bad as you can imagine). Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain. Negative Score indicates decrease in pain and Positive Score indicates increase in pain. This measure denotes the right now pain score (at the time of the questionnaire), minimum score = 0 and maximum score = 10 with lower scores indicative of less pain.</description>

        <description>The BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions during a 24 hour period prior to evaluation. It consists of 5 questions. Question 5 consists of seven item subsets, A to G, that measure the level of interference of pain on daily functions. Responses are given on an 11 point numeric rating scale with anchors at 0 (Does not interfere) and 10 (Completely interferes). Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain interference. The BPI-sf Pain Interference with Function Composite score is calculated as the average of the seven item subsets (questions 5A to G) in the BPI-sf questionnaire. If one of the seven items was missing then the average score of the remaining items was used to impute the missing (seventh) value. If more than one item was missing then the composite score was missing.</description>

          <description>The BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions during a 24 hour period prior to evaluation. It consists of 5 questions. Question 5 consists of seven item subsets, A to G, that measure the level of interference of pain on daily functions. Responses are given on an 11 point numeric rating scale with anchors at 0 (Does not interfere) and 10 (Completely interferes). Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain interference. The BPI-sf Pain Interference with Function Composite score is calculated as the average of the seven item subsets (questions 5A to G) in the BPI-sf questionnaire. If one of the seven items was missing then the average score of the remaining items was used to impute the missing (seventh) value. If more than one item was missing then the composite score was missing.</description>

        <description>The BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions during a 24 hour period prior to evaluation. It consists of 5 questions. Question 5 consists of seven item subsets, A to G, that measure the level of interference of pain on daily functions. Items are defined as interference with, general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep and enjoyment of life mood. Responses are given on an 11 point numeric rating scale with anchors at 0 (Does not interfere) and 10 (Completely interferes). Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain interference.</description>

        <title>Change From Study A4091029 Baseline in BPI-sf Item Scores for Pain Interference at Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 40, 48, 56 and 64</title>
        <description>The BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions during a 24 hour period prior to evaluation. It consists of 5 questions. Question 5 consists of seven item subsets, A to G, that measure the level of interference of pain on daily functions. Items are defined as interference with: general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep and enjoyment of life mood. Responses are given on an 11 point numeric rating scale with anchors at 0 (Does not interfere) and 10 (Completely interferes). Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain interference.</description>
