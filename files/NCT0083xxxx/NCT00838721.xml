  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laser Trabeculoplasty has been shown to be effective in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP)&#xD;
      in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Although initially demonstrated with the&#xD;
      Argon laser (ALT), several other laser systems have also been employed with comparable&#xD;
      efficacy. Recently, Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) has been shown to lower intraocular&#xD;
      pressure comparable to ALT. The advantage of SLT is that the target eye structure, the&#xD;
      trabecular meshwork, remains intact with minimal damage at the cellular level. In contrast,&#xD;
      ALT lowers IOP at the expense of scarring of the trabecular meshwork. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the efficacy of lowering IOP with Pascal Laser Trabeculoplasty (PLT)&#xD;
      employing reduced energy levels compared to ALT and a computer guided pattern of laser&#xD;
      treatment applications.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Otherwise healthy males and females, older than 18 years of age with two (2) sighted&#xD;
             eyes&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have OAG, PXG, or combined mechanism glaucoma - as long as their angles are open&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have uncontrolled IOP (&gt;24mmHg); or controlled with Medicine(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. If on medical treatment, have undergone a washout period of at least one month prior&#xD;
             to Pascal treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Able and willing to comply with the treatment/follow-up schedule and requirements;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Able to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant, intending to become pregnant during course of study, less than 3 months&#xD;
             postpartum or less than 6 weeks after completion of breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have an advanced visual field defect within 10Â° of fixation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have had previous glaucoma surgery, except for peripheral iridotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have corneal disease obviating the use of corneal applanation for a reliable IOP&#xD;
             measurement, or would cause difficulty in viewing the TM by means of gonioscopic lens&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Using systemic steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participation in a study of another device or drug within 3 month prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment or during this study, and as per the Investigator's careful discretion, as&#xD;
             long as not contradictory to any of the above criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any condition which, in the Investigator's opinion, would make it unsafe (for the&#xD;
             subject or for the study personnel) to treat the subject as part of this research&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. No concomitant use of IOP lowering medicine (Group 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. No co-existing ocular pathology with the exception of Cataract.&#xD;
