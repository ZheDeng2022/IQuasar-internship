      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and values that influence perceptions and&#xD;
           utilization of colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) among first-degree relatives of&#xD;
           Hispanic CRC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess factors influencing Hispanic CRC patients' communication of CRC risk and&#xD;
           screening information to their FDRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) To establish the feasibility of recruiting Hispanic CRC patients and their FDRs from the&#xD;
      institutional patient database and/or MDACC clinics.&#xD;

      CRC PATIENTS AND THEIR FDRS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to complete a questionnaire by telephone interview. The study researcher&#xD;
      who calls you will ask for your permission to audiotape the interview. The questionnaire asks&#xD;
      about your awareness of screening tests for colorectal cancer, your family's past use of&#xD;
      these screening tests, your attitudes toward colorectal cancer screening, and how you discuss&#xD;
      colorectal cancer risk and screening with your family and health care providers. Some&#xD;
      demographic information also will be collected (such as your age or marital status). The&#xD;
      questionnaire will take between 30 and 45 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your answers to the questions and your personal information will be kept strictly&#xD;
      confidential. Your questionnaire answers will be identified with a code number, rather than a&#xD;
      name, so that you cannot be identified. Audiotaped recordings will be destroyed after all the&#xD;
      data have been collected and studied (no longer than 5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 60 colorectal cancer patients and their close&#xD;
      relatives may be enrolled in the study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KEY INFORMANT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to complete a psychosocial interview either in person or by telephone. The&#xD;
      study staff member interviewing you will ask you for permission to audiotape the interview.&#xD;
      You will be asked to review the interview guides for colorectal cancer patients and their&#xD;
      first degree relatives (FDRs), and provide feedback about them. The interviewer will ask for&#xD;
      your opinions about Hispanics' awareness and understanding of colorectal cancer screening.&#xD;
      You will also be asked for your opinion about cultural beliefs and practices that may&#xD;
      influence participation in colorectal cancer screening. The interview will take between 30&#xD;
      and 45 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your answers to the questions and your personal information will be kept strictly&#xD;
      confidential. Your questionnaire answers will be identified with a code number, rather than a&#xD;
      name, so that you cannot be identified. Audiotaped recordings will be destroyed after all the&#xD;
      data have been collected and studied (no longer than 5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 15 key informants may be enrolled in this study. All&#xD;
      will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
