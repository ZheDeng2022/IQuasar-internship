      To assess the magnitude and frequency of changes in chemo/cytokine expression in women&#xD;
      receiving radiation treatment. To asses the impact of race/ethnicity on the magnitude and&#xD;
      frequency of changes in chemo/cytokine expression during radiation therapy for breast cancer.&#xD;
      And finally to assess the interaction between radiation-induced chemo/cytokine expression&#xD;
      changes, and race/ethnicity, with respect to normal tissue reactions to radiation and&#xD;
      tumor-associated outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It is well recognized that the diagnostic and therapeutic gains made in the management of&#xD;
      breast cancer over the last 2 decades are not fully realized by all groups. African American&#xD;
      women with breast cancer have greater risk of recurrence, shorter overall survival, shorter&#xD;
      survival after relapse, worse toxicity and worse cosmetic outcome than their Caucasian&#xD;
      counterparts. These differences in outcome persist even when controlling for age, and stage&#xD;
      at presentation. Being similarly treated with modern breast conserving therapy (lumpectomy&#xD;
      and adjuvant whole breast irradiation) at recognized centers of excellence does little to&#xD;
      alleviate the disparities in outcomes. Controlling for socioeconomic factors decreases the&#xD;
      severity of these disparities, but it does not completely explain them. Theories abound as to&#xD;
      the cause of outcome inequality. Many of these theories take either a psychosocial, or&#xD;
      biologic bent. One potential biologic cause may be chemokine and cytokine expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemokines and cytokines (chemo/cytokines) are proteins and peptides used for cell signaling.&#xD;
      Primarily secreted by T cells and macrophages, they influence cellular activation,&#xD;
      differentiation, and function and act as mediators for inflammatory and immune responses.&#xD;
      There has been substantial research linking some of these chemo/cytokines [Tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor alpha (TNFα), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), Transforming growth factor beta&#xD;
      (TGFβ), interleukin (IL)-6,and IL-8] to tumor promotion and progression. For example, TNFα&#xD;
      has been linked to greater cell survival despite genomic injury which in turn leads to&#xD;
      greater genetic alterations and malignant transformation. TNFα has been associated with&#xD;
      breast cancer progression and metastases. Blocking the receptor for PDGF appears to decrease&#xD;
      the metastatic potential of breast cancer cell lines. TGFβ inhibits T cell and B cell&#xD;
      lymphocytes and natural killer cell cytotoxicity. This immuno-suppression has been shown to&#xD;
      promote tumor progression in mammary cancer cells lines. The ability of TGFβ to promote tumor&#xD;
      progression is so well recognized that it has become a therapeutic target by some&#xD;
      researchers. Interferon gamma (IFNγ) has been shown to inhibit mammary cancer cell&#xD;
      proliferation and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, Lyon et al reported&#xD;
      significantly higher circulating levels of TNFα, IL-6, and IL-8 in women with breast cancer&#xD;
      compared to women with a negative breast biopsy. Additionally, researchers have directly&#xD;
      correlated increased levels of IL-6 with the development and progression of breast cancer,&#xD;
      and decreased overall survival (OAS). Conclusion: Expression of certain chemokines and&#xD;
      cytokines is associated with development and progression of breast cancer.&#xD;
