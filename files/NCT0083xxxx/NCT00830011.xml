      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy (CBT) for the management of painful diabetic neuropathy. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: CBT plus standard medical care or&#xD;
      standard medical care alone. CBT will be offered in ten, ninety-minute group sessions and&#xD;
      will be provided by a psychologist with experience in the management of both diabetes and&#xD;
      chronic pain. CBT will involve teaching and encouraging practice of adaptive pain coping&#xD;
      skills such as relaxation skills, activity pacing, and positive self-statements, among&#xD;
      others. This study will allow us to determine which treatment is superior in terms of&#xD;
      improvements in pain management, functioning and overall quality of life.&#xD;

      Research Design: A randomized mixed factorial controlled design will be employed in which CBT&#xD;
      plus standard pharmaceutical care (CBT/SC) is compared to a standard pharmaceutical care (SC)&#xD;
      treatment condition. Participants will be randomized in equal numbers to the two conditions.&#xD;
      Repeated assessments of key outcome domains will occur at pretreatment/baseline and at 12, 24&#xD;
      and 36 weeks following baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Study participants will be evaluated pre-treatment (baseline), 12 weeks&#xD;
      post-baseline (post-treatment) and at 24 and 36 weeks post-baseline (follow-up). Baseline&#xD;
      assessment will include a neurological examination with a nerve conduction study to confirm&#xD;
      the diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy. The primary outcome measure will be pain intensity.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will be pain quality, pain-related disability, physical and&#xD;
      emotional functioning. Measures of treatment feasibility will also be examined. Participants&#xD;
      receiving CBT will attend 10 weekly, group treatment sessions of 90 minutes. A target sample&#xD;
      size of approximately 120 participants will be recruited.&#xD;
