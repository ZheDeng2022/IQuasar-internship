    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open-label, dose escalation, phase 1 study of TAK 701 in adult&#xD;
      patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies. This study will be the first to&#xD;
      administer TAK 701 to humans. The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safety&#xD;
      profile, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics profile of TAK-701.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female patients aged 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of a nonhematologic malignancy for which standard curative or lifeprolonging&#xD;
             treatment does not exist or is no longer effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Radiographically or clinically evaluable tumor; however, measurable disease is not&#xD;
             required for participation in this study (eg, patients with pleural effusion or&#xD;
             ascites).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female patients who:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Are surgically sterile, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of&#xD;
                  contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent&#xD;
                  form through 3 months after the last dose of study drug, or agree to completely&#xD;
                  abstain from heterosexual intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), who:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study drug&#xD;
                  treatment period and through 3 months after the last dose of TAK-701, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study-related&#xD;
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may&#xD;
             be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female patients who are lactating or have a positive serum pregnancy test during the&#xD;
             screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Major surgery within 14 days before the first dose of TAK-701 or any&#xD;
             planned/anticipated surgery during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;

          6. Antineoplastic therapy (including unconjugated therapeutic antibodies and toxin&#xD;
             immunoconjugates) or any experimental therapy within 21 days before the first dose of&#xD;
             TAK-701.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Radiotherapy within 21 days before the first dose of TAK-701.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Nitrosoureas or mitomycin-C within 6 weeks before the first dose of TAK-701.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Autologous stem cell transplant within 3 months before the first dose of TAK-701, or&#xD;
             prior allogeneic stem cell transplant at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any prior exposure to anti-HGF therapy (eg, AMG-102, AV-299).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The patient has symptomatic brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,500/mm3; platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 50mL/minute&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Any of the following clinical laboratory results during screening (ie, within 28 days&#xD;
             before the first dose of TAK-701):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2.5 times&#xD;
                  the ULN. AST and ALT may be elevated up to 5 times the ULN if their elevation can&#xD;
                  be reasonably ascribed to the presence of metastatic disease to liver and/or to&#xD;
                  bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this&#xD;
             clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Uncontrolled cardiovascular condition, including ongoing cardiac arrhythmias,&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, angina, or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Patients having QTc &gt; 470 msec on a 12-lead ECG obtained within 28 days before first&#xD;
             study drug administration.&#xD;
