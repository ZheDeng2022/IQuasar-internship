    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of PI3K inhibitor BKM120 when given&#xD;
      together with carboplatin and pemetrexed disodium in treating patients with stage IV&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer. PI3K inhibitor BKM120 and pemetrexed disodium may stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving PI3K inhibitor BKM120,&#xD;
      carboplatin, and pemetrexed disodium together may kill more tumor cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BKM120 (PI3K inhibitor BKM120) that&#xD;
      can be administered in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed (pemetrexed disodium) in&#xD;
      patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and other toxicities associated with the use&#xD;
      of combination BKM120 and carboplatin and pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of BKM120, when used in combination with&#xD;
      carboplatin and pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To obtain preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity with this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate downstream inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PI3K inhibitor BKM120. Patients receive&#xD;
      pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes followed by carboplatin IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes on day 1, and PI3K inhibitor BKM120 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      may receive courses of PI3K inhibitor BKM120 alone or PI3K inhibitor BKM120 and pemetrexed&#xD;
      disodium after 4-6 courses with carboplatin in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.&#xD;

                  have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status&#xD;
                  of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she&#xD;
                  considered not of child bearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
                  becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during treatment for 5&#xD;
                  T1/2 (8 days) after stopping treatment and for additional 12 weeks (3 months in&#xD;
                  total after study drug discontinuation); the highly effective contraception is&#xD;
                  defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  True abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject; periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago; in case of oophorectomy&#xD;
                  alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by&#xD;
                  follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of&#xD;
                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); for female subjects on the study, the&#xD;
                  vasectomized male should be the sole partner for that patient&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of a combination of any two of the following (a + b):&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  a) Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  b) Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal&#xD;
                       suppository&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving&#xD;
                  offspring, must use a condom during treatment, for 5 T1/2 (8 days) after stopping&#xD;
                  treatment and for an additional 12 weeks (3 months in total after study drug&#xD;
                  discontinuation) and should not father a child in this period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of another malignancy within 3 years, except cured basal cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin or excised carcinoma in situ of the cervix&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with&#xD;
             the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has acute viral hepatitis or a history of chronic or active hepatitis B virus&#xD;
             (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, (typically defined by elevated AST/ALT&#xD;
             [persistent or intermittent], high HBV deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] level hepatitis B&#xD;
             virus surface protein antigen [HBsAg] positive, or high HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA]&#xD;
             level) (testing not mandatory)&#xD;
