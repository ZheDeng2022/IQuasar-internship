  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IMMU-114 will be studied at different dose schedules and dose levels in order to assess the&#xD;
      highest dose safely tolerated. IMMU-114 will be administered subcutaneously (under the skin).&#xD;
      IMMU-114 will be given 1-2 times weekly for 3 weeks followed by one week of rest. This is&#xD;
      considered one cycle. Treatment cycles will be repeated until toxicity or worsening of&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
