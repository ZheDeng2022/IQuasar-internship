&#xD;
          -  Are ≥17.5 months of age (or are ≥6 months of age with Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome&#xD;
             [AGS]). Participants younger than 17.5 months of age can be considered for enrollment&#xD;
             after discussion with the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have systemic signs and symptoms of inflammation as manifested by the presence of two&#xD;
             or more of the following symptoms: rash, fever, musculoskeletal pain, headache,&#xD;
             fatigue, weakness, respiratory/breathing symptoms, or ulcers/ischemic lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an average daily Diary Score of ≥0.5 (CANDLE Diary; used also for CANDLE-related&#xD;
             conditions, AGS Diary) or ≥1.0 (SAVI) or ≥1.0 exclusive of headache and fever symptoms&#xD;
             (JDM Diary) assessed over at least 2 weeks prior to entry, if available. Otherwise,&#xD;
             participants can complete the diary after study consent is signed during the screening&#xD;
             period and meet the inclusion criteria for enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are ≥8.5 kilogram (kg) in body weight. Participants weighing less than 8.5 kg can be&#xD;
             considered for enrollment after discussion with the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been previously treated with at least 1 biologic therapy and, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator, did not respond or are no longer responding to therapy. If the&#xD;
             participant has been diagnosed with CANDLE, Nakajo-Nishimura Syndrome (NNS), SAVI,&#xD;
             AGS, or an equivalent syndrome, the need for previous biologic therapy is not&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Require treatment with oral corticosteroids (≥0.15 milligrams per kilogram per day&#xD;
             [mg/kg/d] of prednisone or its equivalent) for control of systemic signs and symptoms&#xD;
             of their chronic inflammatory disease for at least 2 weeks prior to study entry, or in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator, have failed an adequate course of steroids. Treatment&#xD;
             with or failure of treatment with steroids is not required for participants with AGS&#xD;
             or a confirmed genetic diagnosis of CANDLE or SAVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had previous documented elevations in acute-phase reactants (for example, high&#xD;
             sensitivity C-reactive protein) considered to be the result of the inflammatory&#xD;
             disease (participants with CANDLE or CANDLE-related conditions only).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have the ability to provide informed consent or have legal representative who is&#xD;
             willing and able to provide written informed consent, provided that assent is obtained&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received an immunosuppressive biologic agent/monoclonal antibody within 4&#xD;
             half-lives prior to entry, for example, anakinra (4 half-lives=18 hours); etanercept&#xD;
             (4 half-lives=18 days); infliximab; adalimumab (4 half-lives=36 days); use of&#xD;
             intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are pregnant or nursing at the time of entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are females of childbearing potential (women &gt;12 or who have had at least 1 menstrual&#xD;
             period regardless of age) who are sexually active and who do not agree to use 2 forms&#xD;
             of highly effective methods of birth control or remain abstinent during the study and&#xD;
             for at least 28 days following the last dose of investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are sexually active males who do not agree to use 2 forms of highly effective birth&#xD;
             control with female partners of childbearing potential or remain abstinent during the&#xD;
             study and for at least 28 days following the last dose of investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had symptomatic herpes zoster infection within 12 weeks prior to entry or during&#xD;
             the screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;

             neuralgia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have evidence of active infection, at the time of entry or during the screening&#xD;
             period, that in the opinion of the investigator, would pose an unacceptable risk for&#xD;
             participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history of active hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), or human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;

             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Investigators should review the vaccination status of the participants and follow the&#xD;
        local guidelines for vaccination with nonlive vaccines intended to prevent infectious&#xD;
        disease prior to entering participants into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had household contact with a person with active tuberculosis (TB) and did not&#xD;
             receive appropriate and documented prophylaxis for TB.&#xD;
