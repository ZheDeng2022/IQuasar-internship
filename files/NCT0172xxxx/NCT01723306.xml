  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T cells can penetrate virtually every biologic space and have the power to dispose of normal&#xD;
      or malignant cells as seen in viral and autoimmune diseases and in the rare spontaneous&#xD;
      remis-sions of cancer. However, T cells are easily tolerized to self or tumor antigens and&#xD;
      &quot;immune surveillance&quot; has manifestly failed in every cancer that is clinically apparent. It&#xD;
      is the goal of these studies to supply the specificities and affinities to patient T cells&#xD;
      without regard for their &quot;endogenous&quot; T cell receptor repertoire, directed by&#xD;
      antibody-defined recognition to kill malignant cells based on their expression of antigen. We&#xD;
      will achieve this by preparing chimeric IgCD28TCR genes in mammalian expression vectors to&#xD;
      yield &quot;designer T cells&quot; from normal patient cells. This extends the approach of Anderson,&#xD;
      Rosenberg and co-workers to introduce or augment expression of genes in patients' T cells in&#xD;
      a therapeutic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies in model systems demonstrated that recombinant IgCD28TCR could direct modified&#xD;
      T cells to respond to antigen targets with IL2 secretion, cellular proliferation, and&#xD;
      cytotoxicity, the hallmarks of an effective, self-sustaining immune response. It therefore&#xD;
      becomes of paramount interest to extend these studies to a human system of widespread&#xD;
      clinical relevance to explore the clinical potential of this new technology. The target&#xD;
      antigen for these studies is carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) which is predominantly expressed&#xD;
      on tumors of the colon and rectum, breast, pancreas and other sites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      CEA is perhaps the most prominent tumor marker among malignancies of epithelial origin:&#xD;
      colorectal carcinoma, with 60-94% of tumors positive in patients with advanced disease;&#xD;
      breast carcinoma, with 30-60% of metastatic cases positive for CEA; and cancers of the lung,&#xD;
      liver, pancreas, head and neck, bladder, cervix and prostate with 30% or more with CEA+&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of these therapies in the four Phase II/Pilot clinical sub studies listed&#xD;
      below proceed after collecting patient lymphocytes by leukapheresis, which are then modified&#xD;
      by transfer of the chimeric gene for Ig-CD28-TCRzeta. Cells are selected in culture with&#xD;
      amplification and activation of the now-specific anti-tumor T cells. These are then re&#xD;
      infused into the patients, with IL2 supplementation, and toxicity and response are monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are four sub studies embedded within this Phase II Study of Second Generation Designer&#xD;
      T Cells in CEA-expressing Adenocarcinomas. The embedded studies are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Phase II Pilot Study of Second Generation Anti CEA Designer T Cells in Gastric Cancers&#xD;
           (CEA-G)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Phase II Pilot Study of Second Generation Anti CEA Designer T Cells in Colorectal&#xD;
           Cancers (CEA-C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Phase II Pilot Study of Second Generation Anti CEA Designer T Cells in Lung Cancers&#xD;
           (CEA-L)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Phase II Pilot Study of Second Generation Anti CEA Designer T Cells in Solid Tumors&#xD;
           (CEA-S)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 12 subjects per protocol or a total of 48 subjects will be enrolled combining the&#xD;
      enrollment of the 4 CEA-expressing protocols.&#xD;
