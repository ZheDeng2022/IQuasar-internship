  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the infection rate in patients receiving/not&#xD;
      receiving their own blood, collected during surgery, during and after orthopedic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that transfusion of autologous salvaged blood may reduce postoperative&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative infections (both systemic and wound infections) are complications that should&#xD;
      be avoided both due to the discomfort and the risk to the patients and for the corresponding&#xD;
      increment of hospital costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some studies indicating that transfusion of autologous salvaged blood may reduce&#xD;
      postoperative infections. This may be due to immunostimulating cytokines released in these&#xD;
      products. However, as these cytokines also may cause adverse events as febrile transfusion&#xD;
      reactions and activation of the complement and the coagulation cascades, the overall impact&#xD;
      may be different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two publications from an Austrian group indicating that allogeneic blood&#xD;
      transfusion in orthopedic patients cause increased postoperative infection rate&#xD;
      irrespectively of the leukocyte content of the red cell concentrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Austrian studies were not randomized. Therefore, it would be useful to perform a&#xD;
      randomized, prospective study where the patients receive transfusion of salvaged blood versus&#xD;
      allogeneic red cell concentrate as their primary replacement product, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the pilot study is to evaluate if transfusion of autologous salvaged blood&#xD;
      reduces the infection rate in orthopedic patients compared with patients receiving allogeneic&#xD;
      blood transfusion. The study is limited to one source of autologous blood; blood collected by&#xD;
      the Sangvia Blood Collection System, and the study is partially sponsored by the&#xD;
      manufacturer.&#xD;
