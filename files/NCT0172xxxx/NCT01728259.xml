  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pomalidomide and bortezomib when&#xD;
      given together with dexamethasone in treating patients with amyloid light-chain amyloidosis&#xD;
      or light chain deposition disease. Biological therapies, such as pomalidomide, may stimulate&#xD;
      the immune system in different ways and stop abnormal cells from growing. Bortezomib may stop&#xD;
      the growth of abnormal cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving&#xD;
      pomalidomide and bortezomib together with dexamethasone may be an effective treatment for&#xD;
      amyloid light-chain amyloidosis or light chain deposition disease&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of pomalidomide, bortezomib,&#xD;
      and dexamethasone (PVD) to take forward in a subsequent phase 2 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Obtain a preliminary assessment of efficacy of PVD regimen as initial treatment of amyloid&#xD;
      light-chain (AL) or light chain deposition disease (LCDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pomalidomide and bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21; bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days&#xD;
      1, 8, and 15; and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at least every 3 months.&#xD;
