    <textblock>
      This partially randomized phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ipilimumab&#xD;
      when given together with rituximab in treating patients with B-cell lymphoma that has&#xD;
      returned or has not responded to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and&#xD;
      rituximab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine a recommended phase II dose for ipilimumab in combination with rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain preliminary information on the effect of adding ipilimumab to rituximab in&#xD;
      regard to: immune response; clinical anti-tumor response/overall remission rate (ORR)&#xD;
      (complete remission + partial remission); progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ipilimumab followed by a randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes once every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for 12 weeks and rituximab IV over 2-6 hours once weekly for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes and rituximab IV over 2-6 hours&#xD;
      once every 12 weeks for up to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive rituximab IV over 2-6 hours once weekly in weeks 1-4 and ipilimumab&#xD;
      IV over 90 minutes once weekly in weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. Patients then receive ipilimumab IV&#xD;
      over 90 minutes and rituximab IV over 2-6 hours once every 12 weeks for up to 1 year in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive rituximab IV over 2-6 hours once weekly in weeks 1-4 and ipilimumab&#xD;
      IV over 90 minutes once weekly in weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12. Patients then receive ipilimumab IV&#xD;
      over 90 minutes and rituximab IV over 2-6 hours once every 12 weeks for up to 1 year in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.&#xD;
