      This phase II trial studies the side effects and best dose of umbilical cord blood-derived&#xD;
      natural killer cells when given together with elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and high dose&#xD;
      melphalan before autologous stem cell transplant and to see how well they work in treating&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma. Before transplant, stem cells are taken from patients and&#xD;
      stored. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as elotuzumab, may induce changes in&#xD;
      the body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide and melphalan, may work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy before a stem cell&#xD;
      transplant stops the growth of cancer cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them.&#xD;
      Giving natural killer cells from donor umbilical cord blood before transplant may also kill&#xD;
      myeloma cells that remain in the body after the last chemotherapy treatment. After treatment,&#xD;
      stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were&#xD;
      destroyed by the chemotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived natural&#xD;
      killer (NK) cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine efficacy by the percent of patients achieving very good partial remission&#xD;
      (VGPR) + complete remission (CR) at 3 months post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the minimal residual disease rate 100 days post-transplant in high-risk&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To quantify duration of infused allogeneic donor UCB-derived NK cells in the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of UCB-derived NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive elotuzumab intravenously (IV) over 2-5 hours on day -15 and -8, lenalidomide&#xD;
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -8 to -2, high-dose melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day&#xD;
      -7, and UCB-derived NK cells IV over 1 hour on day -5. Patients undergo autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplant on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60 and 100 days and 6&#xD;
      and 12 months.&#xD;
