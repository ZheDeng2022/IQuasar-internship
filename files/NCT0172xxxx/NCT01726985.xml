  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalizations and readmissions in the United States&#xD;
      and is a tremendous economic strain on our healthcare system. There is currently, based on&#xD;
      national averages, a 30% readmission rate and 10% mortality rate within 3 months of being&#xD;
      hospitalized for heart failure. Retrospective studies have shown benefit to using biomarkers&#xD;
      such as BNP to guide inpatient heart failure management. Our own CCF retrospective study&#xD;
      showed that decreasing NT-ProBNP by 23%, making patients fluid negative by more than 1.3L,&#xD;
      and discharging patients with serum sodium above 135 reduces readmission rates significantly.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively use the above mentioned goals in the treatment&#xD;
      of heart failure in order to reduce heart failure readmission and mortality rates.&#xD;

      All HF patients admitted to CCF will receive a short consent form. The study will enroll&#xD;
      patients for one year. Physicians will initiate / titrate medications and obtain consults as&#xD;
      usual but are highly encourage to keep patients in the hospital until at least 2 of the 3&#xD;
      (above mentioned) criteria are met. Physicians will receive a copy of consent forms,&#xD;
      educational bulletins, and discharge forms (as described in the Physician Education document&#xD;
      which is attached to this application). Log-rank test will be used to compare groups.&#xD;
      Chi-Square will be used to compare prospective patients with retrospective controls (obtained&#xD;
      in 2010).&#xD;
