  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the statistics released by the Department of Health,Executive Yuan in&#xD;
      2005,depression, cancer and AIDS will become the three main diseases of the 21st century.The&#xD;
      prevalence of depression is 5.8% for males and 9.5% for women in the worldwide total&#xD;
      population each year.Depression ranks second next to cardiovascular disease and impacts on&#xD;
      social and economic burdens.From the perspectives of prevalence,suicide rate,loss of&#xD;
      workforce,family burden,co-morbidities and health care expenses,the issues related to caring&#xD;
      for patients with depression should not be overlooked.Communication is often neglected while&#xD;
      exploring the issues of caring for depressed patients,which can consequently affect their&#xD;
      family,work performance,social interaction,and even leads to a risk of suicide.Therefore,in&#xD;
      order to enhance their psychological adjustment and health management,it is particularly&#xD;
      important to achieve effective communications.&#xD;
