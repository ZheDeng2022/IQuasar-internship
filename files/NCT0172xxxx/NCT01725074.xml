    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will examine a case management program for patients&#xD;
      suffering from coronary heart disease with multimorbidity in Mannheim, Germany. The trail&#xD;
      consists of 3 treatment arms: 1) intensified case management; 2) social interaction alone 3)&#xD;
      standard care. The main objectives are to evaluate how case management and social interaction&#xD;
      alone compared to standard medical care affect the primary and secondary outcomes: physical&#xD;
      health, quality of life, loneliness, depression, self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, social&#xD;
      support, health locus of control, lifestyle behavior, social network, vulnerability,&#xD;
      intention, severity, health worries and cognitive functions.&#xD;

      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will examine a case management program for 320 male&#xD;
      and female patients suffering from coronary heart disease with multimorbidity in Mannheim,&#xD;
      Germany. The main objectives are to evaluate how case management and social interaction alone&#xD;
      compared to standard medical care affect the primary and secondary outcomes: physical health,&#xD;
      quality of life, loneliness, depression, self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, social support,&#xD;
      health locus of control, lifestyle behavior, social network, vulnerability, intention,&#xD;
      severity, health worries and cognitive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the secondary outcomes are studied as factors that mediate the effects of case&#xD;
      management and social interaction alone compared to standard medical care on the primary&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trail consists of 3 treatment arms: 1) intensified case management; 2) social interaction&#xD;
      alone 3) usual care. The intervention consists of a biweekly contact by trained case managers&#xD;
      over the first 6-months and a monthly contact over the subsequent 6-months. Each contact&#xD;
      involves an assessment of well-being, daily life, problems and offering emotional support and&#xD;
      solutions or refer to the general practitioner if necessary (both intervention groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients assigned to the &quot;CM CHD&quot; the contacts include medical control (like blood&#xD;
      pressure or weight) and well-being as well as an additional core set of relevant outcome&#xD;
      measures (e.g. need for treatment of fatigue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to the control group received usual care (no CM or contact). An additional&#xD;
      fourth group is monitored. This group is consisting of patients who refused to take part in&#xD;
      the study but gave consent to collect their practice data (not randomized).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be followed for 12 months. Extensive assessments and self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaires take place at baseline, 6-month and 12-month for all patients in the three&#xD;
      randomized groups.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention consists of a biweekly telephone or personal contact by trained case managers over the first 6-months and monthly contact over the second 6-months to assess well-being, everyday life (positive, neutral and negative daily events), and to inquire after health and personal problems on which basis the case manager offers practical or emotional support or a referral to the general practitioner if deemed necessary. During the contacts also medical control measures like blood pressure or weight are taken, and other study outcome measures like need for medical treatment.</description>
