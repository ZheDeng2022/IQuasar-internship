      12% of patients suffering from an acute crornary syndrome will develop long lasting anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms. The object of this study is to lessen or prevent these symptoms by the use of&#xD;
      neurofeed back (EEG-NF).&#xD;

      The accepted definition for a mentally traumatic event is an event in which there is a chance&#xD;
      of death, severe injury or a severe threat to one's body (either as a victim or as an&#xD;
      observer) and that event stimulates an intense emotional response of fear, horror or&#xD;
      helplessness1. About forty percent of western population will undergo such an event during&#xD;
      their life time, out of which up to thirty percent will suffer from a short live anxiety&#xD;
      disorder and up to quarter will suffer from a chronic anxiety disorder (PTSD - Post Traumatic&#xD;
      Stress Disorder) or depression2,3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distinction between different anxiety disorders is based on their time of appearance and&#xD;
      how long they will last. The shortest disorder is the acute stress reaction (ASR) which&#xD;
      appears immediately after the traumatic event and will disappear after 48 - 72 hours. ASR&#xD;
      symptoms include dissociation, anxiety and affective instubility3. The medium range anxiety&#xD;
      disorder is the acute stress disorder (ASD), which appears in the first two weeks following&#xD;
      the event and will last up to a month. Its symptoms include dissociation, re-experiencing of&#xD;
      the traumatic event and avoidant behavior of places and actions that might resemble the&#xD;
      traumatic event. The long lasting disorder is the post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),&#xD;
      which lasts more than a month and includes symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidant behavior and&#xD;
      hyper arousal1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent meta analysis of studies on the prevalence of PTSD in patients suffering from an&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome (ACS) demonstrated that about 12% will develop PTSD (in some studies&#xD;
      the prevalence was up to 32%). In three of the studies that were included, the morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality stemming from the PTSD were examined and were twice as high compared to the&#xD;
      patients without PTSD4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The personal, social and financial toll of anxiety disorders is significant and still, to&#xD;
      date, there is no excepted treatment that aims to prevent the occurrence of these disorders.&#xD;
      A few studies on the subject have shown that early interventions (done in the days to weeks&#xD;
      after the traumatic event) have an advantage in the prevention of PTSD, as opposed to&#xD;
      immediate interventions (that show no benefit)5,6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the subjectivity of the experience of a traumatic event there is great difficulty in&#xD;
      the prediction of who will develop an anxiety disorder. A few risk factors for the&#xD;
      development of PTSD were suggested in different studies: female sex, minors, low&#xD;
      socioeconomic status, young age, history of trauma, mental illness, little social support,&#xD;
      the severity of the event and adrenergic hyperactivity following the event5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain areas that were reported as being involved in PTSD are the Amygdala and the&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex7. Still, these observations are not enough to construct a predictive model&#xD;
      that will allow diagnosis and / or treatment. A prospective study, done in our lab,&#xD;
      demonstrated hyperactivity in the Amygdala alongside changes in hypocampal plasticity and a&#xD;
      decrease in the activity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in comparison to baseline in&#xD;
      subjects suffering from PTSD, or that have shown high levels of anxiety without a formal&#xD;
      diagnosis of an anxiety disorder8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological interventions after trauma events have shown poor specificity and benefit. In&#xD;
      contrast, behavioral \ psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      that are trauma oriented have shown some benefit6. Alas, due to their nature of&#xD;
      re-experiencing and reliving of the traumatic events patients are reluctant to partake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new kind of intervention, that has been becoming popular in the past few years, is changing&#xD;
      of brain wave pattern by the use of Neurofeedback (EEG-NF). By using a closed circuit brain&#xD;
      computer interface (BCI), the patient receives feedback about his (or hers) brain activity&#xD;
      via an external marker that is linked to his mental status. The feedback allows the patient&#xD;
      modulation of brain activity in a designated area to which the practice is aimed. The&#xD;
      practice lasts a few sessions, after which the patient can apply the technique without&#xD;
      immediate feedback10,11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early studies of EEG-NF focused on alpha waves (8 - 12 Hz) due to their link to feelings for&#xD;
      calm12,13. Later, the method was broadened due to findings that showed that during a state of&#xD;
      sleepiness the main frequency in brain activity is low theta waves (4-7 Hz)14. The method of&#xD;
      A/T NF was since used in the research and in treatment of ADD/ADHD15 and was shown to be&#xD;
      useful in the alleviation of symptoms of PTSD in two studies16,17. In a recent study EEG-NF&#xD;
      was effective in reducing level of anxiety in patients after an acute coronary event18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First appointment - Subjects will be asked to join during their hospitalization in the&#xD;
      cardiac intensive care unit at the first 72 hours after their coronary event. In this meeting&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to sign an informed consent form and will be interviewed by one of the&#xD;
      study team members and will be asked to answer psychological questioners. Also, they will&#xD;
      perform a resting EEG, while trying to relax with no special guidance. The meeting will last&#xD;
      about an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the subjects will be asked to undergo an MRI brain scan during that hospitalization.&#xD;
      In the first part of the scan subjects will be asked to remain still for a few moments and&#xD;
      try to relax (with no special guidance). After that they will watch a series of pictures and&#xD;
      movie clips with emotional valence. During the final part of the scan subjects will be asked&#xD;
      again to remain still for a few moments. This meeting, when performed, will also last for&#xD;
      about an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First follow up meeting (will be done face to face or by phone): A month following the&#xD;
      coronary event a team member will contact the subjects and ask for a second appointment,&#xD;
      during which the questioners will be redone in order to asses anxiety and depression levels,&#xD;
      including the appearance of post traumatic symptoms. The purpose of this meeting is to&#xD;
      identify the subject at high risk for developing PTSD. The meeting will last about an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the second meeting sixty patients, who exhibited post traumatic symptoms, will be asked&#xD;
      to continue in the study. The rest will be excluded from it. Those who will continue will&#xD;
      undergo 12 additional meetings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial meeting before starting the EEG-NF training, during which patients will fill&#xD;
      questioners and will undergo resting EEG with no guidance. After which they will undergo an&#xD;
      MRI scan during rest and exposure to stimuli. This meeting will last an hour and a half to&#xD;
      two hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the subjects will be divided into two groups. The first will undergo ten EEG-NF&#xD;
      training meetings and the second will undergo ten shame EEG-NF meetings. The meetings will be&#xD;
      done in a time frame of two months and will be guided by the study's team members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EEG-NF training will be alpha/theta EEG, as specified earlier. Each subject will be&#xD;
      connected to an EEG device continuously registering his / hers' brainwave activity. The&#xD;
      alpha/theta ratio will be computed online and will be translated to the subject as a sound. A&#xD;
      decrease in the ration, implicating relaxation, will lead to a decrease in the sounds'&#xD;
      volume. The subject will be asked to continue and soften the sound by relaxing. Each meeting&#xD;
      will last twenty minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The shame group will be connected to the same EEG device, will hear the same sound and will&#xD;
      be asked to relax in order to soften the sound. The sounds' volume will not be depended on&#xD;
      their alpha/theta ratio and will change randomly. Each meeting will last twenty minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final meeting: two to four weeks following the completion of the ten EEG-NF meetings (true or&#xD;
      shame), subjects will be asked for a final meeting in which they will undergo clinical&#xD;
      evaluation and a second MRI brain scan. They will fill the same questioners as earlier. This&#xD;
      meeting will last an hour and a half to two hours.&#xD;
