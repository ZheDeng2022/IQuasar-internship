    <textblock>
      Background: Shamshuipo District has the highest proportion of low income families, and a&#xD;
      relatively large percentage of single parents, elderly, new immigrants among all districts in&#xD;
      Hong Kong (Census and Statistics Department, 2011). In addition to provide these families&#xD;
      substantial support, a campaign to enhance their family well-being is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: This project is conducted to enhance their family relationship as well as family&#xD;
      happiness, health and harmony (3Hs) among families in the Shamshuipo District, through a&#xD;
      community-based intervention programme combined with a planning tool (booklet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This project adopts a cluster-randomized controlled design, with the application of&#xD;
      positive psychology concepts as a theoretical framework. A community-based participatory&#xD;
      (CBP) approach, which is an effective way to engage public health researchers and community&#xD;
      members (NGOs, other major stakeholders, and participants), will be used. Both quantitative&#xD;
      and qualitative methods will be used in the evaluation of major outcomes (participants'&#xD;
      family relationship and 3Hs) at different time points throughout the project. Process&#xD;
      evaluation will be performed to evaluate the process of each component of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: This project will be conducted in three phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 includes planning, implementation, and evaluation of a training programme for social&#xD;
      workers from the 30 participating NGOs. The social workers will be equipped with the&#xD;
      knowledge and skills of the application of positive psychology as well as logic model. This&#xD;
      phase also includes the launching event to arouse public awareness of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 includes designing, delivering, and evaluating 30 community-based intervention&#xD;
      programmes. A planning tool (designed as a booklet) will be distributed to participants of&#xD;
      the intervention group in the form of 'homework assignment' immediate after the intervention&#xD;
      programme; whereas participants of the control group will receive the booklet upon the&#xD;
      completion of the three months follow-up questionnaire assessment. This phase also contains&#xD;
      focus group interviews among participants to collect their experiences, feelings and changes&#xD;
      in families after attending the intervention programme. Focus groups among social workers&#xD;
      will be conducted afterwards to explore their barriers and facilitators in programme&#xD;
      implementation; as well as their personal and/or collective growth in conducting the project.&#xD;
      In-depth interview among community stakeholders will be held to explore the social impact of&#xD;
      the CBPR project, and collect their suggestions for future implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 is a dissimilation phase that the &quot;Positive Family Education Booklet&quot; and &quot;Positive&#xD;
      Family Practice Manual&quot; will be released. A practice wisdom forum for social workers and&#xD;
      other major stakeholders will also be organized to share their experiences in conducting the&#xD;
      community-based programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis: Families participated in a community-based programme and received a&#xD;
      toolkit (intervention group) have higher scores in their family relationship and family 3Hs&#xD;
      than families who participated in a community-based programme only (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses: (1) Participants' attitudes towards and intention of practising the&#xD;
      suggested behaviours will be increased immediately after their participation in the&#xD;
      community-based intervention programme; (2) Participants' attitudes towards, their intention,&#xD;
      as well as frequency of practising the suggested behaviours will remain higher at 6 weeks and&#xD;
      3 months after the intervention compared to the corresponding figures of pre-intervention&#xD;
      (baseline); (3) Participants' scores of family relationship and 3Hs will be significantly&#xD;
      higher at 6 weeks and 3 months after their participation in the intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Shamshuipo District consists of 5.3% of the population in Hong Kong; and ranks the fourth&#xD;
      most densely populated district in 2010 (Social Welfare, 2011). The proportion of single&#xD;
      parents, elderly, newly immigrated mainland persons, ethnic minorities, comprehensive social&#xD;
      security assistance recipients in this district are relatively high; whereas the median of&#xD;
      monthly domestic household income is the lowest among all districts in Hong Kong (Census and&#xD;
      Statistics Department, 2011). It is essential to provide substantial support for families&#xD;
      with low income and under privileged condition. Apart from this, encouraging positive&#xD;
      thinking among family members may be an effective way to enhance family well-being in this&#xD;
      district (Linley et al., 2011). A considerable amount of evidence has demonstrated benefits&#xD;
      of applying positive psychology principles on family well-being. Previous studies including&#xD;
      the 'nun study' (Danner et al., 2001) and Harvard study (Peterson et al., 1988) suggested&#xD;
      that people who are happy tend to be healthier and live longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      'The Shamshuipo Well-being Movement' ('The Movement'), which adopted a positive psychology&#xD;
      approach (Seligman &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2000) to promote four character strengths&#xD;
      ('gratitude', 'hope', 'resilience', and 'open-mindedness') among their residents to enhance&#xD;
      family well-being had been initiated in the past two years, under the coordination of Social&#xD;
      Welfare Department (SWD) of Shamshuipo District. Building on the success of 'The Movement', a&#xD;
      community-based initiative named 'Enhancing Family Well-Being Project' is collaboratively&#xD;
      developed between SWD of Shamshuipo District and the School of Public Health, the University&#xD;
      of Hong Kong. This project will focus on training and mobilizing local community&#xD;
      stakeholders, and developing, delivering, and evaluating community-based programmes for&#xD;
      families in Shamshuipo District, to arouse public interests towards an enhanced family&#xD;
      relationship, as well as family health, happiness, and harmony (3Hs). The collaboration is&#xD;
      based on evidence that community-based participatory (CBP) approach provides an effective way&#xD;
      to engage public health researchers and community members (NGOs, other major stakeholders,&#xD;
      and participants) in an active partnership to take action, in order to promote social change&#xD;
      (White et al., 2004; Macaulay, 2007; Berge et al., 2009; Shalowitz et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project also adopts a cluster-randomized controlled design to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of a theory-based action planning toolkit . The toolkit will be distributed to the&#xD;
      participants for their use at home, like a 'homework assignment', for the purpose of&#xD;
      enhancing their intention and practices of the suggested behaviours. The development of the&#xD;
      booklet was guided by the theory of The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA), which suggests&#xD;
      that one's intention can be foster by knowing that the new behaviour has positive outcomes as&#xD;
      opposed to the negative outcomes that accompany the current behaviour; and planning (action&#xD;
      planning and coping planning) serves as an operative mediator between intentions and&#xD;
      behaviour (Schwarzer, 2008). Previous evidence has shown the applicability of the HAPA in&#xD;
      changing people's health behaviours, e.g., physical exercise, breast self-examination, seat&#xD;
      belt use, dietary behaviours, and dental flossing; and its generalizability has been&#xD;
      confirmed by Schwarzer (2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, this is a community-based participatory research (CBPR) project using a&#xD;
      cluster-randomized controlled design; and applying positive psychology concepts to develop&#xD;
      community-based interventions with a theory-based toolkit, in an attempt to enhance family&#xD;
      relationship and family 3 Hs in the Shamshuipo District.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a community-based intervention&#xD;
      programme (with the application of positive psychology) with a theory-based toolkit among&#xD;
      families in the Shamshuipo District, on enhancing their family relationship and family 3Hs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of the study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the effectiveness of the community-based intervention programmes in&#xD;
           improving family relationship and family 3Hs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of a theory-based toolkit in increasing participants'&#xD;
           intention and practices of the suggested behaviours; as well as enhancing their family&#xD;
           relationship;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the various components of the project in terms of its structure, process,&#xD;
           and outcomes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To engage and build capacity of the social workers through training programmes on the&#xD;
           application of positive psychology and logic model;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To explore the social impact of the CBPR in collaboration with various NGOs and&#xD;
           stakeholders in the Shamshuipo District.&#xD;
