      This long-term, open-label extension study will evaluate the safety of RoActemra/Actemra&#xD;
      (tocilizumab) in patients with polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who&#xD;

      response to RoActemra/Actemra in the core study will be eligible to receive RoActemra/Actemra&#xD;
      8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks. Anticipated time on study treatment is 104 weeks.&#xD;
