  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation/dose finding, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study of&#xD;
      GSK2126458 in subjects with IPF. The study is designed to explore a number of doses of&#xD;
      GSK2126458 for engagement of pharmacology after short term dosing. It is anticipated that&#xD;
      approximately 24 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Actual number of cohorts in this&#xD;
      study could vary up to a maximum of 6 cohorts (n=4/cohort; 3 on active and 1 on placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cohort will consist of four subjects who will be randomised to receive GSK2126458 (three&#xD;
      subjects) or placebo (one subject) for approximately 8 days (7 to 10 days). On Day 1 they&#xD;
      will receive their first dose of GSK2126458 (or placebo) and safety, tolerability and PK/PD&#xD;
      in the blood will be measured for up to 8 hours post-dose. Subjects will then be discharged&#xD;
      from the site with study drug until the last day of dosing. They will also receive hand held&#xD;
      spirometers and instructions on action to be taken in case of deterioration in pulmonary&#xD;
      function or any other adverse events (AEs). On the last day of dosing they will return to the&#xD;
      site for a repeat of the Day 1 procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and [18F]-fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG)- positron emission&#xD;
      tomography / computed tomography (PET/CT) scan will be conducted twice during the study;&#xD;
      once, at least 2 days before dosing commences and again during the course of the dosing&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the final subject in each cohort has completed dosing, a dose escalation meeting will&#xD;
      take place. Safety and tolerability and PK data will be reviewed during this meeting and&#xD;
      decisions made may include but are not limited to: escalate the dose, decrease the dose or&#xD;
      repeat the same dose in the next cohort; stop the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of IPF as determined by a responsible and experienced chest physician and&#xD;
             based on established criteria defined by the American Thoracic Society/European&#xD;
             Respiratory Society: American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society&#xD;
             International Multidisciplinary Consensus Classification of the Idiopathic&#xD;
             Interstitial Pneumonias.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FVC greater than (&gt;) 40% predicted and Diffusing capacity of the Lung for Carbon&#xD;
             Monoxide (DLCO) &gt;30% predicted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than (&lt;) 2x upper limit of normal (ULN); alkaline&#xD;
             phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1.5xULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTcB &lt;450 milliseconds (msec) and QTc interval &lt;=480 msec; or QTc &lt;480 msec in&#xD;
             subjects with Bundle Branch Block.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male over 45 years of age inclusive, or female over 50 years of age inclusive at the&#xD;
             time of signing the informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential&#xD;
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or&#xD;
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhoea. Females on hormone&#xD;
             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to&#xD;
             use one of the contraception, if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.&#xD;
             Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status&#xD;
             prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks should elapse&#xD;
             between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type&#xD;
             and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can&#xD;
             resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of&#xD;
             the contraception methods. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first&#xD;
             dose of study medication until the follow-up contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight &gt;=40 kilogram (kg) (female), &gt;=50 kg (male), and body mass index (BMI)&#xD;

             a recent echocardiogram (at screening or within 3 months prior to screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             complications from hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Clinically significant laboratory assessment outside the reference range unless the&#xD;
             Investigator considers that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk&#xD;
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
             result within 3 months of screening&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Previous exposure to ionising radiation &gt;5 millisievert (mSv) in the 3 years prior to&#xD;

             beer, 1 glass (125 mL) of wine or 1 (25 mL) measure of spirits&#xD;

             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current&#xD;
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first&#xD;
             dosing day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently taking Pirfenidone or have received Pirfenidone within the previous 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to refrain from the use of prohibited prescription or non-prescription drugs,&#xD;
             unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will&#xD;
             not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components there of or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK&#xD;
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products&#xD;
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period&#xD;
