      To identify a panel of circulating miRNA markers which could help identify those breast&#xD;
      cancer patients who are most likely to respond well to neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy,&#xD;
      and indeed serve as an overall prognostic factor and stratify patients into risk categories&#xD;
      which would further guide their management. Similarly, the investigators aim to identify a&#xD;
      panel of circulating miRNA markers which could monitor patient's response to chemotherapy and&#xD;
      hormonal therapies. Ideally a suitable panel of markers would show significant changes in&#xD;
      expression level in good-responders whilst little or no change would be observed in miRNA&#xD;
      expression in non-responders.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify a panel of miRNAs, detectable in the circulation, which are altered in&#xD;
           breast cancer patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify specific combinations of miRNAs ('signatures') which associate with breast&#xD;
           cancer intrinsic subtypes, and thereby could aid in prognostication and treatment&#xD;
           planning on an individual patient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if systemic miRNA analysis can be used as a biomarker for monitoring&#xD;
           response to chemotherapy, in the neoadjuvant setting and in patients who present with&#xD;
           breast cancer recurrence and are treated with upfront chemotherapy and/or hormonal&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a prospective cohort studies, involving three study cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cohort 1: All newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who are scheduled to undergo&#xD;
           neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cohort 2: All breast cancer patients who present with metastatic disease, disease&#xD;
           recurrence or progression, who are commencing up-front chemotherapy +/- hormonal&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cohort 3: All breast cancer patients who present with metastatic disease who are&#xD;
           commencing hormonal therapy only.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood Sample&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood Sampling - Cohort 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Blood sample 1: at presentation before commencing neoadjuvant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Blood sample 2: midway through their chemotherapy treatment (after 2nd cycle if they&#xD;
           are enrolled in a 4 cycle regimen, or after 4th cycle if they are prescribed an 8 week&#xD;
           regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Blood sample 3: post-chemotherapy (before surgery as applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Blood sample 4: 2 to 4 weeks after surgery, or 2 to 4 weeks post 3rd blood sampling if&#xD;
           patients do not undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Blood sample 5: once during follow-up of 12 to 18 months after surgery or 12 to 18&#xD;
           months post 3rd blood sampling if patients do not undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood Sampling - Cohort 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Pre-treatment blood sample: at presentation before commencing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - On study blood samples: taken at monthly (± 1 week) intervals for a period of 6 months&#xD;
           from date of pre-treatment blood sample, despite whether the patient is on treatment or&#xD;
           completed treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On study blood sample 1: 1 month (± 1 week) from date of pre-treatment blood sample&#xD;
&#xD;
           On study blood sample 2: 2 months (± 1 week) from date of pre- treatment blood sample&#xD;
&#xD;
           On study blood sample 3: 3 months (± 1 week) from date of pre-treatment blood sample&#xD;
&#xD;
           On study blood sample 4: 4 months (± 1 week) from date of pre-treatment blood sample&#xD;
&#xD;
           On study blood sample 5: 5 months (± 1 week) from date of pre-treatment blood sample&#xD;
&#xD;
           On study blood sample 6: 6 months (± 1 week) from date of pre-treatment blood sample&#xD;
&#xD;
           - End of study blood sample: once during follow-up of 12 to 18 months from date of&#xD;
           pre-treatment blood sample or at the time of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood Sampling - Cohort 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Pre-treatment blood sample: at presentation before commencing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - On study blood samples: taken at the following time points despite whether the patient&#xD;
           is on treatment or completed treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On study blood sample 1: 3 months (± 2 weeks) from date of pre-treatment blood sample On&#xD;
           study blood sample 2: 6 months (± 2 weeks) from date of pre-treatment blood sample On&#xD;
           study blood sample 3: 12 months (± 2 weeks) from date of pre-treatment blood sample&#xD;
&#xD;
           - End of study blood sample: 18 months (± 2 weeks) from date of pre-treatment blood&#xD;
           sample or at the time of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood samples will be processed for miRNA analysis, which involves:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Lysis using Trizol 2. RNA isolation 3. Assessing concentration and integrity of RNA using&#xD;
      Nanodrop spectrophotometry 4. cDNA synthesis (using miRNA specific stem loop primers) 5. PCR&#xD;
      amplification and relative quantification (using miRNA specific probes)&#xD;
