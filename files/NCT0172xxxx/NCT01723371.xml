  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety and feasibility of using a β-blocker (in this case&#xD;
      carvedilol) in the treatment of pediatric patients with Left Heart Failure (LHF) in children&#xD;
      with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). Carvedilol affects the nervous system, the same&#xD;
      system that is highly activated in response to stress in patients with PAH. Each patient is&#xD;
      administered a dosage of carvedilol, according to their weight. This dosage is increased&#xD;
      incrementally over the span of the study, if the patient responds well to the drug. The study&#xD;
      will determine whether the potential adverse side effects of carvedilol outweigh the possible&#xD;
      positive results in reducing LHF. The hypothesis of this study predicts that carvedilol will&#xD;
      have positive effects in treating LHF, similar to their use in treatment of Right Heart&#xD;
      Failure (RHF). This is a single-centered pilot study. Each patient will be studied for&#xD;
      approximately 31 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Carvedilol will be administered orally. The initial dose of carvedilol will be 0.05mg/kg/day divided into 2 doses. After two weeks, at subsequent weekly study visits, the dose of carvedilol will be increased incrementally to 0.1mg/kg in Week 2, 0.2mg/kg in Week 3, 0.4mg/kg in Week 4, 0.6mg/kg in Week 5, and 0.8mg/kg in Week 6, when the target dose of 0.8mg/kg/day (if weight is less than 62.5kg) or 50mg/day (if weight is greater than 62.5kg) is achieved. This dosage, assuming no adverse effects, will be maintained between Weeks 6 and 30 of the study. After the maintenance period from Week 6 to 30, patients will be weaned over 5 to 7 days or continued on a non-study drug supply.</description>
