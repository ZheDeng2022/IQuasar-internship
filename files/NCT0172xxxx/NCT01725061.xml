  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury (ALI) is an often deadly form of respiratory failure caused by&#xD;
      inflammation. The widespread injury to the lungs involves a build-up of fluid in the lungs&#xD;
      that results in damage to the lungs and a decreased ability of the lungs to function&#xD;
      properly. There is currently no specific treatment for ALI; and of the 200,000 cases reported&#xD;
      in the US yearly, about 40% will die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients may have other conditions that could change the risk of developing ALI. For&#xD;
      example, it has been reported that patients who have septic shock have a lower chance of&#xD;
      developing ALI if they also have diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Septic shock is a type of&#xD;
      infection that causes overwhelming inflammation to occur throughout the body; it increases&#xD;
      the chances that a person will develop ALI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason diabetics are less likely to develop ALI is unclear and deserves further&#xD;
      investigation. The investigators believe that it may be explained by differences in the way&#xD;
      certain cells that are involved in inflammation function in the lungs. The investigators plan&#xD;
      on looking at the relationship between the wide-spread inflammation that occurs within the&#xD;
      bodies of diabetic and non-diabetic patients with an increased chance of developing ALI&#xD;
      [sepsis].&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study this relationship, we will identify patients who fit the requirements of the study.&#xD;
      The investigators will obtain blood samples and lung washings from these patients. The lung&#xD;
      washings will be obtained by injecting clean salt water into the lungs through a tube and&#xD;
      then pulling the water back out. When the sterile water is removed, some cells from the lungs&#xD;
      also are removed and they can then be used for further lab studies. Determining how diabetes&#xD;
      may change a patient's chance of developing ALI may uncover useful information that may help&#xD;
      prevent or treat ALI in all patients at risk.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common and lethal form of respiratory failure, occurring in&#xD;
      200,000 people each year and in as many as 25% of mechanically ventilated patients. Despite&#xD;
      multiple clinical studies, there are presently no effective medical therapies for ALI, and&#xD;
      its mortality remains unacceptably high at about 40%. Common co-morbid conditions that can&#xD;
      alter the susceptibility to ALI are chronic alcohol abuse and diabetes mellitus (DM). The&#xD;
      incidence and severity of ALI is increased in critically ill patients with a history of&#xD;
      chronic alcohol abuse. With respect to DM, the group has previously reported that a history&#xD;
      of diabetes mellitus is associated with a decreased incidence of ALI in patients with septic&#xD;
      shock. As the biological mechanism for this association was unknown, a cross-sectional&#xD;
      epidemiological study was conducted by broadly examining the role of diabetes in the&#xD;
      development of respiratory failure associated with sepsis. Using national hospitalization&#xD;
      data, it was found that diabetics with sepsis were less likely to develop any form of acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure than non-diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALI occurs through a common pathway of oxidant stress and inflammation, injuring the lungs&#xD;
      and rendering them dysfunctional for gas exchange. The alveolar macrophage (AM) is an&#xD;
      important mediator of the inflammatory response, with roles such as phagocytosis and&#xD;
      secretion of inflammatory cytokines that are key components of lung injury and repair. While&#xD;
      more than one mechanism may explain the previous observations of a decreased incidence of ALI&#xD;
      in diabetics, the data in chronic alcoholics suggests that AM dysfunction may play a role in&#xD;
      the in the development of ALI leading us to hypothesize that DM may similarly alter the&#xD;
      pulmonary microenvironment, thereby decreasing the susceptibility to ALI. Furthermore, early&#xD;
      preliminary data suggests that the AM activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor&#xD;
      gamma (PPARγ), a transcription factor with anti-inflammatory properties, may be increased in&#xD;
      diabetics. In addition, evidence suggests that macrophage activation into a pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      versus an anti-inflammatory state may be tissue specific and altered by obesity and insulin&#xD;
      resistance (i.e. compartmentalized in the lung). However, the effect of DM on the pulmonary&#xD;
      inflammatory response and specifically AM function is as yet unknown. PPARγ is highly&#xD;
      expressed in AMs, and thus PPARγ ligands have direct affects on AMs to influence lung&#xD;
      inflammation by inhibiting oxidative burst and enhancing AM phagocytic function. PPARγ and&#xD;
      its ligands influence AM differentiation into M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2&#xD;
      (anti-inflammatory) phenotypes and a recent preclinical study demonstrated effective&#xD;
      prevention of ALI by pretreatment with a PPARγ ligand. However, the effect that DM and PPARγ&#xD;
      ligands have on AM phenotypic differentiation, PPARγ expression, oxidative stress and AM&#xD;
      phagocytic function has not been well investigated. To our knowledge, there is no data on AM&#xD;
      PPARγ activity in DM, and little is known about how this disease state may alter the&#xD;
      pulmonary inflammatory milieu. The investigators hypothesize that DM reduces the risk of ALI&#xD;
      by modulating AM differentiation and function via PPARγ expression, oxidative stress and AM&#xD;
      phagocytic function, which may be positively influenced by exposure to a PPARγ ligand.&#xD;
      Examining the impact of DM and PPARγ on AM phenotype and function may identify mechanisms&#xD;
      responsible for the decreased incidence of ALI in diabetics; improve our understanding of the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of a common and lethal disease, and lead to novel therapies for both diabetic&#xD;
      and non-diabetic critically ill patients&#xD;
