  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase II study to investigate the potential utility of PD 0332991 in the treatment of early&#xD;
      stage ER+ Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)- breast cancer, to investigate&#xD;
      whether the combination of PD 0332991 and anastrozole is able to: 1) improve the pathologic&#xD;
      complete response rate when compared to the historical control of single agent aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors, 2) result in fewer patients with on therapy Ki67&gt;10% compared to historical&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
