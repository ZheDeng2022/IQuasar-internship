      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if stimulating the nerve involved with airway&#xD;
      constriction, while undergoing procedures that are known to cause asthma exacerbations,&#xD;
      decreases the level of asthma attack experienced.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by shortness of&#xD;
      breath, wheezing, cough, and fatigue. Some people suffer from sudden worsening of asthma&#xD;
      symptoms despite being treated with medications. When people have asthma attacks the muscle&#xD;
      tissue in the airway contracts causing the airway to narrow and decreasing the ability for&#xD;
      the person to breathe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological pacemakers are FDA approved devices that stimulate nerves in the body and have&#xD;
      been used for the treatment of many disorders such as Parkinson's, epilepsy, chronic pain and&#xD;
      urinary incontinence. Recent animal studies have shown that stimulating (activating a nerve)&#xD;
      the carotid sheath area (located in the neck) can cause the rapid relaxation of the muscles&#xD;
      which contract during an asthma attack. This approach has also been successfully used in&#xD;
      patients at an emergency room when they came in with a severe asthma attack.&#xD;
