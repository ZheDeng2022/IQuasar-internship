      The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of mebendazole (MBZ) that can be safely&#xD;
      given to people with malignant brain tumors in combination with the current standard of care&#xD;
      (temozolomide) without causing severe side effects. We also want to find out if MBZ can slow&#xD;
      the growth of the brain tumor. The study doctors have found that MBZ is effective against&#xD;
      malignant brain tumors in the laboratory and animal models of brain tumors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive brain cancer, and despite significant&#xD;
      advances in treatment the majority of patients die within two years of diagnosis. During&#xD;
      routine animal studies we serendipitously observed that fenbendazole, a benzimidazole&#xD;
      antihelminthic used for pinworms, prevented tumor engraftment. Subsequent in vitro and in&#xD;
      vivo experiments with benzimidazoles identified mebendazole as the drug having the best&#xD;
      results in preclinical testing 1. In GBM cell lines, mebendazole displayed cytotoxicity with&#xD;
      IC50s ranging from 0.1-0.3 μM. Mebendazole disrupted microtubule formation in GBM cells and&#xD;
      it's in vitro activity was correlated with reduced tubulin polymerization. In two orthotopic&#xD;
      mouse glioma models, one syngeneic and one xenograft, mebendazole significantly extended&#xD;
      average survival up to 63% compared to untreated controls 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mebendazole is an FDA approved antiparasitic agent with a well-established side effect and&#xD;
      safety record and was effective in our animal models in dosing schedules that are documented&#xD;
      as safe in humans. Therefore, mebendazole is a possible anti-cancer therapeutic with&#xD;
      pre-clinical safety and efficacy and provides a promising opportunity for a clinical trial in&#xD;
      patients with malignant gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a recently published case report case report from the University of Michigan&#xD;
      documented successful long term control in metastatic adrenocortical adenocarcinoma using&#xD;
      mebendazole 2. Mebendazole was well tolerated at 200 mg/day and used as the sole treatment&#xD;
      after the patient failed other chemotherapies.&#xD;
