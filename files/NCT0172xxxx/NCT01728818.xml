  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-agent gemcitabine is currently still regarded as one international standard of care&#xD;
      for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (Burris 1997 [4]). The oral EGFR tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor erlotinib received EMEA-approval for the treatment of patients with metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer in January 2007.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pivotal phase III trial, the combination of gemcitabine plus erlotinib was associated&#xD;
      with a statistically significant prolongation of OS (compared to single-agent gemcitabine),&#xD;
      however, the absolute survival benefit was - for the overall study population - clinically&#xD;
      moderate (median OS: 6.24 vs 5.91 months, 1-year OS rate: 23% vs 17%; HR = 0.82, p=0.038)&#xD;
      (Moore 2007 [19]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recently presented FOLFIRINOX regimen shows enhanced activity in metastatic pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer patients. This regimen is, however, limited to patients with good performance status&#xD;
      (ECOG 0-1), no major comorbidity, age &lt;75 years, and bilirubin &lt;1.5 ULN (Conroy 2011 [6]).&#xD;
      The majority of pancreatic cancer patients will therefore not be treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, novel treatment concepts are urgently needed in pancreatic cancer and&#xD;
      pre-clinical data indicate an important role of the EGFR1/erbB2 receptor signalling in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Yeh 2007 [24]). A recent publication (Larbouret&#xD;
      2010 [16]) indicates that the combination of cetuximab and trastuzumab induced superior&#xD;
      antitumour activity in human pancreatic carcinoma xenografts compared to gemcitabine alone&#xD;
      (see also Larbouret 2007 [15]). Furthermore, synergistic antitumour activity was observed&#xD;
      when monoclonal antibodies directed against the EGFR1 and erbB2 were combined (Ben-Kasus 2009&#xD;
      [3]). Based on these data, there is a good rationale to further investigate the combined&#xD;
      inhibition of the erbB family in pancreatic cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afatinib (BIBW 2992) is a novel irreversible EGFR1- and HER2 and HER4 inhibitor that is&#xD;
      applied orally. The purpose of the present trial is to investigate the erbB family inhibition&#xD;
      by afatinib in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the planned trial, afatinib will be applied at the dose (40 mg/day) that was chosen for&#xD;
      the randomised phase III trial (LUX 5 study) that investigates afatinib plus weekly&#xD;
      paclitaxel (80mg/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently there is also a phase I study ongoing that investigates the combination of afatinib&#xD;
      with gemcitabine (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01251653 U10-2249-02 ). Possibly the data&#xD;
      will be available once the study is ready to start. Otherwise a modification of the regimen&#xD;
      will be planned once the respective data will be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, we integrate a translational project which may allow the identification of&#xD;
      patients that primarily benefit from this novel treatment approach. The availability of&#xD;
      tumour tissue- and blood samples from each patient is therefore an important inclusion&#xD;
      criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2:1 randomisation is chosen favouring the experimental arm since a large body of data is&#xD;
      available on gemcitabine alone and since sufficient efficacy and toxicity data shall be&#xD;
      gained in the experimental arm. In addition, the patients' motivation to take part in the&#xD;
      trial will be greatly enhanced by a greater chance to receive the experimental agent.&#xD;
