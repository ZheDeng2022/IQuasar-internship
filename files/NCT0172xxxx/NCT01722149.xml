    <textblock>
      MPM patients are not eligible for surgical procedures like decortication or&#xD;
      pleuro-pneumectomy and have a median survival of 12 months with palliative chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are of crucial need in this clinical situation. This is&#xD;
      a phase I trial for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma with pleural effusion&#xD;
      testing the safety of a fixed single dose of 1x10e6 adoptively transferred FAP-specific&#xD;
      re-directed T cells given directly in the pleural effusion. Lymphocytes will be taken 21 days&#xD;
      before transfer from peripheral blood. CD8 positive T cells will be isolated and&#xD;
      re-programmed by retroviral transfer of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) recognizing FAP&#xD;
      which serves as target structure in MPM.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. A fixed single dose&#xD;
      of adoptively transferred FAP-specific CD8 positive re-directed T cells will be given in the&#xD;
      pleural effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three patients who are at the time point of screening not operable will be treated with&#xD;
      re-directed T cells administered into the pleural effusion after completion of 3 cycles of&#xD;
      palliative chemotherapy. In the case of one AE grade III/IV or one SAE - and the occurrence&#xD;
      of DLT both judged to be treatment related by an independent safety monitoring board - the&#xD;
      patient number will be expanded to 6 patients. The study will be stopped if one additional&#xD;
      DLT occurs also judged to be treatment related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with 1x10e6 re-directed FAP-specific T cells injected in the pleural&#xD;
      effusion. The study ends 35 days after adoptive T cell transfer. Re-directed FAP-specific T&#xD;
      cells will be administered at day 0 (day 14 of the third cycle of palliative chemotherapy).&#xD;
      The study is designed to demonstrate safety of 1x10e6 re-directed FAP-specific T cells. The&#xD;
      next patient will be enrolled earliest, when the previous patient completed day +14 and the&#xD;
      safety monitoring board has not declared any DLTs. The palliative chemotherapy is not part of&#xD;
      the study protocol.&#xD;
