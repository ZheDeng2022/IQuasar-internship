      Evaluation of efficacy and tolerance to a QUadruple therapy with Asunaprevir , Daclatasvir,&#xD;
      Ribavirin and pegylated Interferon alpha-2a, in HIV-HCV genotype 1 or 4 coinfected patients&#xD;
      previously null responders to a standard Pegylated Interferon -Ribavirin regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of patients presenting cirrhosis (defined by a METAVIR F4 score on liver&#xD;
      biopsy and/or with hepatic impulse elastometry ≥ 15 kPa) will be limited to 50% of all of the&#xD;
      patients included&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial is multi-center, national, Phase 2, open-label, single-arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to estimate the Sustained Virological Response rate (SVR) 12 weeks after&#xD;
      24 weeks of treatment with quadruple therapy combining Asunaprevir, Daclatasvir, Ribavirin&#xD;
      and Pegylated Interferon alpha-2a in HIV-HCV genotype 1 or 4 coinfected patients previously&#xD;
      null responders to a Pegylated Interferon -Ribavirin standard regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated enrolment is 65 patients during the enrolment period (9 months). The first 12&#xD;
      patients included will be on Raltegravir, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir and will participate to&#xD;
      the pharmacological sub-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of inclusion criteria: 4 to 8 weeks Anti-HCV treatment: 28 weeks (or shorter&#xD;
      according to futility rules) Follow up: 24 weeks following the end of the treatment&#xD;
