    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial is designed to evaluate whether a behavioral intervention&#xD;
      that includes three components: 1) reminder letters and education materials delivered before&#xD;
      the clinic visit, 2) telephone recalls after the visit for those who originally decline the&#xD;
      vaccine, and 3) telephone reminders for those who miss the 2nd and/or 3rd doses, increases 1&#xD;
      and 3 dose coverage of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series among adolescent girls&#xD;
      attending four Parkland primary care clinics in Dallas county.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Investigators expect higher 1 dose HPV vaccine coverage among patients in the&#xD;
      Intervention group than those in the General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Investigators expect significantly higher 1 dose HPV vaccine coverage among&#xD;
      patients in the Intervention group who initially declined the vaccine than those in the&#xD;
      General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group who initially declined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Investigators expect significantly higher 3 dose HPV vaccine coverage among the&#xD;
      Intervention group than those in the General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary research goal is to implement and evaluate evidence-based intervention strategies&#xD;
      targeted to adolescent girls and their parents that stimulate patient demand for the human&#xD;
      papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and compliment provider-directed strategies already employed by&#xD;
      Parkland clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1. Determine if a mailed packet with an invitation letter and educational material&#xD;
           (HPV-specific or general brochure about all recommended adolescent vaccines) delivered&#xD;
           prior to clinic visit, increases 1 dose coverage of the HPV vaccine series.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2. Determine if a telephone recall delivered 2 weeks after the clinic visit,&#xD;
           increases 1 dose coverage among parent-patient dyads who decline the vaccine during the&#xD;
           clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3. Determine if telephone reminders to those overdue for Dose 2 or 3 of the HPV&#xD;
           vaccine series, increase 3 dose coverage of the series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - Cognitive interviews: To ensure the usability and cultural appropriateness of all&#xD;
      project materials, investigators will conduct 40 in-person, cognitive interviews with parents&#xD;
      of female patients ages 11-18 attending Parkland clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 - Randomized controlled trial. Investigators will select and invite 1200 families&#xD;
      whose daughter has an upcoming appointment at one of four Parkland clinic sites. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to either the Intervention group or the General Adolescent&#xD;
      Vaccine Brochure group. The Intervention group participants will be mailed a packet&#xD;
      containing an invitation letter to join the study and HPV vaccine-specific educational&#xD;
      materials; General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group participants will be mailed a packet&#xD;
      with educational materials on all four of the recommended adolescent vaccines (HPV,&#xD;
      meningococcal, TDAP, and influenza). A few days after the packet has been sent, a research&#xD;
      assistant will call participants to verify that the letter was received and assess interest&#xD;
      in completing a pre-clinic visit survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who agree to fill out the in-clinic survey will be asked to come to their clinic&#xD;
      appointment 40 minutes early to obtain verbal informed consent from the parent and verbal&#xD;
      assent from the adolescent female patient. Then, the parent will complete a 20-30 minute&#xD;
      survey about the HPV vaccine and interactions with their daughter's provider. The daughter&#xD;
      will complete a short survey that asks about use of social media and health concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group participants who complete the in-clinic survey are also eligible to&#xD;
      receive telephone recalls and reminders. If the Intervention group parent refused the vaccine&#xD;
      during the initial clinic visit, a telephone recall will be delivered after 2 weeks offering&#xD;
      to schedule an immunization-only appointment. If the Intervention group participant misses&#xD;
      the 2nd and/or 3rd doses, telephone reminders will be delivered. For participants who&#xD;
      complete the in-clinic survey and are randomized to the General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure&#xD;
      group, parents who refused will be contacted after 2 weeks to assess attitudes and intentions&#xD;
      toward the HPV vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both the Intervention and General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group will have&#xD;
      their medical record reviewed to assess HPV vaccine outcomes, receipt of the other three&#xD;
      recommended adolescent vaccines, and contact with the clinic during the 12 months following&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ancillary Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform stratified analyses and multivariate logistic regression&#xD;
      modeling to examine whether certain subgroups were more likely initiate and complete the&#xD;
      series (e.g, vaccine uptake might vary by characteristics such as preferred language,&#xD;
      race/ethnicity, patient age, or parent educational status). The Investigators will use&#xD;
      similar methods to also examine our data for confounding, for example, if initiation differs&#xD;
      by clinic site. If no interactions are found (e.g., outcome estimates are similar for&#xD;
      different subgroups), the investigators will report summary chi-square tests that only adjust&#xD;
      for potential confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also use the dates that patients received the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd HPV&#xD;
      doses to run a time-to-recurrent event analysis. The investigators will model the completion&#xD;
      of the 3-dose series as recurrent event data, 72; 73 with event times from intervention to&#xD;
      Dose 1, Dose 1 to 2, and Dose 2 to 3. A proportional means model will be constructed with the&#xD;
      outcome being the recurrent events, and the variables of interest including intervention&#xD;
      group assignment, sociodemographic, clinic site, knowledge, and attitudes. A significant&#xD;
      intervention indicator effect will conclude that the intervention generally shortens the time&#xD;
      between initiation and receipt of all doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct the following secondary analyses to evaluate whether parents&#xD;
      who receive the intervention have greater HPV vaccine knowledge, information seeking, and&#xD;
      PAPM stage progression compared to parents receiving usual care. Among those who consented&#xD;
      for additional contact and completed pre-clinic and follow-up surveys, the investigators will&#xD;
      explore associations among intervention assignment and intermediate factors including&#xD;
      parents' HPV vaccine knowledge, attitudes, perceived risk, information-seeking, and HPV&#xD;
      vaccine decisional stage. Descriptive statistics will be calculated and outliers identified.&#xD;
      A correlation matrix will be run to check for multicollinearity (strong correlations between&#xD;
      intermediate factors). The investigators will run univariate and multivariate logistic&#xD;
      regression models to determine whether intervention assignment is associated with greater&#xD;
      knowledge of the HPV vaccine, more positive attitudes toward and information seeking about&#xD;
      the HPV vaccine, and PAPM stage progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore generalizability to all safety-net patients in the clinics, the investigators will&#xD;
      compute t tests or chi-square tests and examine whether patients who 1) decline to&#xD;
      participate or 2) do not consent for reminder and recall intervention components differ from&#xD;
      those randomized with respect to variables available in the EMR (patient demographics, health&#xD;
      care utilization patterns, clinic visit characteristics).&#xD;
