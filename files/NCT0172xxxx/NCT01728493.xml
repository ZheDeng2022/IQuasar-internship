  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most frequent form of secondary hypertension. It is caused&#xD;
      by autonomous secretion of aldosterone, encompassing a group of disorders which is for 99%&#xD;
      predominated by unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and bilateral adrenal&#xD;
      hyperplasia (BAH). Diagnosis of PA is relevant for two reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. independent of the level of blood pressure, hypertension due to autonomous aldosterone&#xD;
           secretion causes more cardiovascular damage than essential hypertension;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PA requires specific treatment: adrenalectomy in case of APA and mineralocorticoid&#xD;
           receptor antagonists (MRA) in case of BAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although previously presumed a rare condition (prevalence &lt;1%), PA is now estimated to affect&#xD;
      6 to 20% of the hypertensive population. Given this high prevalence of PA, as well as the&#xD;
      amount of cardiovascular damage and the available specific treatment, the question is raised&#xD;
      whether screening of PA should be introduced in Dutch general practice. To answer this&#xD;
      important question, several issues with regard to PA need to be elucidated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. International studies report a prevalence of PA in general practice of 6-13%. Prevalence&#xD;
           in the Dutch population is still unknown;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Because of underdiagnosis of PA and long delay in diagnosis of PA after recognition of&#xD;
           hypertension (mean eight years), data on characteristics of early diagnosed PA are&#xD;
           lacking. Proof of early cardiovascular damage would strengthen the case of screening for&#xD;
           PA and needs to be studied;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Consequently, the diagnostic delay has lead to lack of data on optimal treatment in&#xD;
           early PA. In the current guideline (NHG-guideline 'Cardiovascular risk management') a&#xD;
           regimen of antihypertensive drugs is advised, and only if hypertension is refractory for&#xD;
           &gt;6 months patients are referred. It is unknown if hypertension is resistant to therapy&#xD;
           in the initial phase of PA. If not, this would also argue for early biochemical&#xD;
           screening for PA, because even if blood pressure is controlled, the detrimental effect&#xD;
           of aldosterone itself will go on unopposed. It is therefore required to study the&#xD;
           response to antihypertensive drugs (not MRA) in these patients.&#xD;

      Rationale: Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most frequent form of secondary hypertension. It&#xD;
      is caused by autonomous secretion of aldosterone, encompassing a group of disorders which is&#xD;
      for more than 99% predominated by unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and&#xD;
      bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH). Diagnosis of PA is relevant for two reasons: 1)&#xD;
      independent of the level of blood pressure, hypertension due to autonomous aldosterone&#xD;
      secretion causes more cardiovascular damage than essential hypertension; 2) PA requires&#xD;
      specific treatment: adrenalectomy in case of APA and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists&#xD;
      (MRA) in case of BAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although previously presumed a rare condition (prevalence &lt;1%), PA is now estimated to affect&#xD;
      6 to 20% of the hypertensive population. Given this high prevalence of PA, as well as the&#xD;
      amount of cardiovascular damage and the available specific treatment, the question has been&#xD;
      raised whether screening of PA should be introduced in Dutch general practice. To answer this&#xD;
      important question, several issues with regard to PA need to be elucidated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. International studies report a prevalence of PA in general practice of 6-13%. Prevalence&#xD;
           in the Dutch population is still unknown;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Up to now, the laboratory test for screening for PA, the aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR),&#xD;
           is primarily used in secondary care. The relation between the ARR and outcomes in&#xD;
           primary care is unknown;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Because of underdiagnosis of PA and long delay in diagnosis of PA after recognition of&#xD;
           hypertension (mean eight years), data on characteristics of early diagnosed PA are&#xD;
           lacking. Indications of early cardiovascular damage would strengthen the case of&#xD;
           screening for PA and needs to be studied.&#xD;
