    <textblock>
      Constraint-induced movement therapy (CI therapy) is a highly efficacious treatment for&#xD;
      residual motor disability in chronic stroke. Its effectiveness is believed to be due, at&#xD;
      least in part, to the therapy's ability to aid the brain in &quot;rewiring itself.&quot; For example,&#xD;
      CI therapy produces increases in the amount of grey matter (the parts of the brain where&#xD;
      neuron cell bodies are most closely clustered) in certain areas of the human brain (Gauthier&#xD;
      et al., 2008). The cellular and molecular mechanisms that are responsible for this increase&#xD;
      in grey matter volume are not known, however. Thus, it is unclear how the therapy helps&#xD;
      brains &quot;rewire&quot; themselves. This study aims to better understand the timecourse and&#xD;
      cellular/molecular nature of brain changes during CI therapy. Because there is currently no&#xD;
      way to directly measure cellular/molecular changes in the brain noninvasively, this study&#xD;
      will infer what is happening on a microstructural level using new MRI techniques (three&#xD;
      dimensional pictures of the brain). For example, by charting the timecourse of grey matter&#xD;
      changes during CI therapy, and cross-comparing this to what is known about the timecourses of&#xD;
      different cellular/molecular processes, the investigators can gain a greater understanding of&#xD;
      what cellular processes may be responsible for increases in grey matter. The investigators&#xD;
      will gain additional information about which cellular processes are important for&#xD;
      rehabilitation-induced improvement by measuring larger-scale changes (e.g., amount of blood&#xD;
      flow through different brain areas) that accompany cellular changes. The investigators are&#xD;
      hopeful that by better understanding how CI therapy can change the brain, the effectiveness&#xD;
      of rehabilitation can be improved upon. For example, insight into the mechanisms of&#xD;
      rehabilitation-induced brain change may suggest particular drug targets to increase brain&#xD;
      plasticity. This study will help us better understand how the brain repairs itself after&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
