      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of recombinant interleukin-15 in&#xD;
      treating patients with melanoma, kidney cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, or head and neck&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled&#xD;
      with treatment. Recombinant interleukin-(IL)15 is a biological product, a protein, made&#xD;
      naturally in the body and when made in the laboratory may help stimulate the immune system in&#xD;
      different ways and stop tumor cells from growing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of recombinant human IL15 (rhIL15)&#xD;
      administered subcutaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of the dose schedules of rhIL15 on the number and phenotype of&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells including: total white blood cell count; absolute&#xD;
      lymphocyte count (ALC); and total number of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, as well as&#xD;
      activated T cells, T cell subsets and NK cell subsets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the effects of the dose schedules of rhIL15 on the function of peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells including: T cell subset response to recall viral antigens including&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) and influenza A virus; T cell responses to non-physiologic stimuli&#xD;
      including: phytohemagglutinin (PHA); and NK cell cytokine (interferon gamma [IFN-y])&#xD;
      secretion and degranulation by cluster of differentiation 107a (CD107a) expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess tumor response rate by objective response rate (ORR). IV. To assess the&#xD;
      immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute (NCI) rhIL15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive recombinant interleukin-15 subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 1-5 of weeks 1&#xD;
      and 2. Treatment repeats every 28 days (4 weeks) for up to 6 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 24 weeks.&#xD;
