  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies report that dietary fiber intake is inversely correlated with body weight gain.&#xD;
      Previously, we have shown alginate fiber supplementation increases weight loss, which we&#xD;
      ascribe to its satiating effct.Alginate is a major plant dietary fiber in brown seaweed. One&#xD;
      property of importance to appetite is the ability of alginate to gel in the acidic&#xD;
      environment of the stomach. We hypothesize that the alginate will decrease the feeling of&#xD;
      hunger and lower food consumption compared to control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here we test three different beverages in a double-blinded crossover design, in which 24&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to the sequence of the test days separated by at least&#xD;
      5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each test day appetite sensation as well as blood glucose and insulin will be measured&#xD;
      over 4h after intake of the test product. Hereafter, an ad libitum meal consisting of Pasta&#xD;
      Bolognese will be served, and energy intake calculated. The participants will also rate&#xD;
      gastrointestinal confort.&#xD;

      Three different iso-caloric beverages will be tested in a double-blinded crossover design, in&#xD;
      which 24 participants will be randomly assigned to the sequence of the test days separated by&#xD;
      at least 5 days. Prior to the test days, the participants will follow a standardized fasting&#xD;
      procedure: abstention from alcohol hard physical activity for 24 h; furthermore, consumption&#xD;
      of the same evening meal no later than 8 pm on the night before all meal tests, after which&#xD;
      time point they should be fasting. They are allowed 500 mL of water between 8 pm and the&#xD;
      morning of the test days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each test day, the participants will meet at the department in a fasting state. After&#xD;
      voiding they will be weighed, and a venflon catheter will be inserted in the antecubital&#xD;
      vein, allowing repeated blood sampling throughout the test day. Baseline measurements of&#xD;
      blood pressure, blood samples, and visual analogue scales (VAS) scores will be conducted at&#xD;
      time point of -15 min. A second baseline blood sample will be drawn at time point 0,&#xD;
      immediately after which the participants will consume the preload beverage (time point 0)&#xD;
      with a 10 min time limit for consumption. After consumption of the preload beverage, blood&#xD;
      samples will be taken and VAS scores completed at time points 15 and 30 min, and hereafter&#xD;
      the he standardized breakfast will be served for which 15 minutes is allowed (time point 30&#xD;
      min). After the participants have finished the breakfast, blood samples will be drawn and VAS&#xD;
      scores completed at time points 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 210 and 240 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hereafter, an ad libitum meal consisting of Pasta Bolognese will be served, and energy intake&#xD;
      calculated, and the final VAS score will be completed at time point 270 min after the&#xD;
      participants have finished their lunch. Before leaving, the participants will fill in a&#xD;
      questionnaire related to gastrointestinal adverse events (AE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a pilot study, the first 6 participants to finish the study will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in a fourth test day, on which capsules containing alginate fibers will be administered&#xD;
      together with the placebo beverage. This fourth test day is not included in the randomization&#xD;
      and will not be blinded for the participants.&#xD;
