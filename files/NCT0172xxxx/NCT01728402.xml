  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cause of blood and bone marrow cancers is poorly understood; however, most research&#xD;
      focuses on how cancer cells grow and develop. Because the causes of these cancers are&#xD;
      unknown, current treatments may be unnecessarily harsh and often do not provide a cure.&#xD;
      Identifying the causes of blood cancers would allow for the development of treatments that&#xD;
      are more likely to provide a cure. To find the causes of blood and bone marrow cancers, we&#xD;
      will look for specific cancer cell abnormalities that are responsible for cancer cell growth.&#xD;
      We will then look to see if drugs that can reverse these abnormalities can kill cancer cells.&#xD;

        Patients of any age with a diagnosis or suspected diagnosis of a blood or bone marrow&#xD;
        cancer may be a part of this study. The provider who will perform the blood draw, bone&#xD;
        marrow aspirate, or biopsy as part of the patient's routine care will identify possible&#xD;
        participants from their clinic schedule or patient list, give them information about what&#xD;
        would be involved in participating in the study including possible risks, and ask if they&#xD;
        are interested in participating.&#xD;
