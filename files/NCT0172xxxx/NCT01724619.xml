  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer represents a significant health problem in the United States. This year&#xD;
      179,000 men in the United States will be diagnosed with prostate carcinoma and approximately&#xD;
      25% of them will die of the disease. In addition, the incidence and mortality of prostate&#xD;
      carcinoma has been increasing steadily in the United States. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)&#xD;
      levels are commonly used as a biomarker for the detection of prostate cancer. Nonetheless,&#xD;
      there is a significant false negative and false positive diagnosis since PSA levels elevate&#xD;
      in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis and decrease in patients taking medications&#xD;
      and herbal remedies. Twenty percent of biopsy-proven prostate carcinoma have PSA levels&#xD;
      within the normal range, thus confounding the diagnosis based on the PSA screening test.&#xD;
      Current diagnostic methods that include transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and TRUS guided&#xD;
      prostate biopsy are logistically difficult and insensitive. These are further complicated by&#xD;
      equivocal prostatic biopsy findings such as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) or&#xD;
      normal PSA with high clinical suspicion. A tracer with high specificity to prostate cancer&#xD;
      related structures at a cellular level would enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology&#xD;
      of prostate cancer and would contribute to the detection, localization and quantification of&#xD;
      the disease and its metastases. This information will be invaluable in selecting the&#xD;
      appropriate treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the utility of [F-18]FMDHT to image prostate cancer and will evaluate if&#xD;
      this radiotracer can differentiate primary prostate cancer in the prostate gland from normal&#xD;
      prostate gland itself. More specifically, we will study the distribution kinetics of&#xD;
      [F-18]FMDHT in normal healthy humans and in patients with prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per exploratory IND requirements, we performed toxicity assessment of FMDHT through an&#xD;
      outside laboratory (ILS, Inc.) and the results of that study are attached as Appendix A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our and others data, we hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. [F-18]FMDHT PET/CT will distribute initially in various normal tissues following blood&#xD;
           flow pattern and will clear rapidly from tissues with no AR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. [F-18]FMDHT PET/CT will detect metastatic disease that expresses AR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. [F-18]FMDHT PET/CT uptake will be elevated in AR-expressing prostate cancer lesions&#xD;
           compared to surrounding normal prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to progress [F-18]FMDHT into clinic, we are performing a pilot 'first-in-human'&#xD;
      biodistribution study in subjects with and without prostate cancer.&#xD;
