  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and find out what effects, good and/or bad,&#xD;
      dabrafenib (a BRAF inhibitor) alone or dabrafenib when given in combination with gamma knife&#xD;
      radiosurgery has on participants with a certain type of skin cancer (BRAFV600E melanoma) and&#xD;
      brain metastases (tumors that have spread to the brain).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm Phase II clinical trial. All patients will receive continuous dosing of&#xD;
      dabrafenib at 150 mg PO bid and trametinib beginning at Cycle 3 Day 1, at a starting dose of&#xD;
      2 mg PO once daily until progression of disease, withdrawal of consent, or the development of&#xD;
      intolerable treatment associated toxicity. An MRI will be performed after 28 days of&#xD;
      treatment with dabrafenib. Patients who have unequivocal disease progression in the brain at&#xD;
      that time will be deemed to have disease progression at 4 weeks. Patients with a complete&#xD;
      response of all lesions in the brain will continue to receive dabrafenib and trametinib on&#xD;
      study but they will not undergo SRS. For patients with stable disease or partial tumor&#xD;
      responses in the brain, Gamma Knife radiosurgery will be performed on treatment cycle 2, day&#xD;
      1 (+/- 3 days, 28 day cycle) using a stereotactic head frame and MRI imaging in accordance&#xD;
      with FDA-approved procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melanoma brain metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cutaneous melanoma is the most aggressive form of all skin cancers. Worldwide, it is&#xD;
      currently expected that approximately 132,000 people will be diagnosed with melanoma each&#xD;
      year and some 37,000 people are expected to die of the disease annually. Brain metastases are&#xD;
      a major source of morbidity and mortality in patients with metastatic melanoma and&#xD;
      approximately 3 out of 4 develop brain metastases at some point in their disease course. The&#xD;
      prognosis of metastatic melanoma with CNS involvement is dismal1, and, until recently, no&#xD;
      medical therapy demonstrated clear evidence of activity against melanoma in the brain. For&#xD;
      patients with fewer than 4 brain lesions and no brain lesion greater than 3 cm in diameter,&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is the standard-of-care. By delivering highly focal&#xD;
      irradiation to melanoma brain metastases, SRS confers local control rates exceeding 80% for&#xD;
      lesions under 2 cm in diameter. However, SRS does not treat micrometastatic disease in the&#xD;
      brain, and new brain metastases develop in approximately half of patients treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, local control rates are lower for lesions larger than 2 cm in diameter. As a&#xD;
      result, the median overall survival for melanoma patient treated with SRS is only 7 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BRAF mutant melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is a critical proliferation pathway in many human cancers. This&#xD;
      pathway can be constitutively activated by alterations in specific proteins, including BRAF,&#xD;
      which phosphorylates MEK1 and MEK2 on two regulatory serine residues. Approximately 90% of&#xD;
      all identified BRAF mutations that occur in human result in a V600 E/D/Kamino acid&#xD;
      substitution. This mutation appears to mimic regulatory phophorylation and increases BRAF&#xD;
      activity approximately 10-fold compared to wild type. BRAF mutations have been identified at&#xD;
      a high frequency in specific cancers, including approximately 40-60% of melanoma. The&#xD;
      frequency of this activating mutation and the pathway addiction to which it leads makes&#xD;
      mutated BRAF an extremely attractive target.&#xD;

                  (Pgp) or Bcrp transporter because they may alter dabrafenib concentrations. The&#xD;
                  list may be modified based on emerging data. These include but are not limited to&#xD;
                  those listed in Appendix 2; consider therapeutic substitutions for these&#xD;
