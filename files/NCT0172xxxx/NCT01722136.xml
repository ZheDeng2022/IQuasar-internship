      The overall goal is to determine whether any energy expenditure compensation in response to&#xD;
      16 weeks of aerobic exercise at a higher-dose is greater compared to a lower-dose&#xD;
      intervention in older women, and to begin to investigate underlying physiological mechanisms&#xD;
      that influence energy expenditure changes in older women.&#xD;

      The overall goal is to determine whether any energy expenditure compensation in response to&#xD;
      16 weeks of aerobic exercise at a higher-dose is greater compared to a lower-dose&#xD;
      intervention in older women, and to begin to investigate underlying physiological mechanisms&#xD;
      that influence energy expenditure changes in older women. Changes in all components of energy&#xD;
      expenditure, as well as concentrations of plasma leptin and serum free T3, in response to the&#xD;
      two different exercise programs (14 and 8 kcal/kg body weight weekly, 60-65% VO2max, 4&#xD;
      days/wk) will be compared in older, non-obese women (60-75 yrs, BMI=18-30 kg/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine whether differential changes in total daily energy expenditure&#xD;
      and its components occur in older women in response to two exercise programs of different&#xD;
      doses. State-of-the-art methods will be used (total daily energy expenditure by doubly&#xD;
      labeled water; non-exercise activity thermogenesis using Physical Activity Monitoring System;&#xD;
      resting metabolic rate and thermic effect of food via indirect calorimetry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Due to a greater decline in NEAT, women will exhibit a smaller increase&#xD;
      in total daily energy expenditure in response to the higher-dose, compared to the lower-dose,&#xD;
      exercise program, despite greater increases in resting metabolic rate and thermic effect of&#xD;
      food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To explore whether differential changes occur in plasma leptin and serum free&#xD;
      triiodo-L-thyronine (free T3) concentrations in older women in response to 16-week aerobic&#xD;
      exercise programs of two different doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that in response to the higher-dose exercise program, women will exhibit&#xD;
      larger decreases in plasma leptin and serum free T3 concentrations, compared to the&#xD;
      lower-dose exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also determine whether women exhibit greater improvements in plasma lipids, insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity (using homeostasis model assessment, HOMA, score), blood pressure, and aerobic&#xD;
      fitness in response to the higher-dose, compared to the lower-dose, exercise program.&#xD;
