      The investigators aimed in this study to investigate the effects of 4 weeks robot-assisted&#xD;
      locomotor training on motor recovery of lower extremities and walking ability compared with&#xD;
      the conventional gait training in subacute post-stroke non-ambulatory hemiplegic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      72 first-ever stroke patients who could not walk independently (FAC &lt; 2), and suffered within&#xD;
      6 months were enrolled and randomly assigned into 2 groups. The subjects with congestive&#xD;
      heart failure, malignancies, cardiopulmonary dysfunctions, and who could not walk&#xD;
      independently before stroke attack were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups received 30 minutes conventional gait training including Neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      Treatment (NDT) basically. The robotic assisted locomotor training group received additional&#xD;
      robotic-assisted gait therapy for 30minutes with Lokomat® (Hocoma, Zurich, Switzerland) daily&#xD;
      for 4 weeks, and the conventional gait training group received additional daily conventional&#xD;
      gait training with NDT for the same periods. The independent walking ability(FAC ≥ 3),&#xD;
      Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), Motricity index (MI), Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA),&#xD;
      Modified Barthel Index (MBI), Medical Research Council (MRC) for each lower extremity muscles&#xD;
      were assessed before, during (2weeks) and after training. And the independent walking ability&#xD;
      were followed until 3 months.&#xD;
