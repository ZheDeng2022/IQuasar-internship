      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of an intravenous (i.v.)&#xD;
      infusion of PAT-SM6 in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy and pharmacodynamics by analysis of serum and urine M protein,&#xD;
           serum free light chains (FLC) κFLC and λFLC, total immunoglobulins, β2-microglobulin,&#xD;
           C-reactive protein (CRP), exploratory biomarkers and anti-PAT-SM6 antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the duration of response and the progression free survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, single-centre, dose escalation phase I study designed to investigate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of intravenous (i.v.) infusions of PAT-SM6 administered over 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A screening examination will be performed within 14 days prior to dosing. Eligible subjects&#xD;
      will receive 4 doses of PAT-SM6 (cycle 1: Day 1 and Day 3, cycle 2: Day 8 and Day 10).&#xD;
      Subjects will be hospitalised for at least 48 hours after each dose administration (i.e. from&#xD;
      Day 1 to Day 5 in cycle 1 and from Day 8 to Day 12 in cycle 2). During hospitalisation&#xD;
      subjects will be under constant surveillance. Subjects will return for ambulatory visits on&#xD;
      Days 15, 22, 29 and 36 for safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serological staging will be performed at baseline, on Day 29 (+/- 2 days) and Day 36 (+/-2&#xD;
      days). Response will be assigned by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform&#xD;
      response criteria for multiple myeloma. Complete response (CR) will be confirmed by bone&#xD;
      marrow aspiration; CT scans or other radiograph are only intended when clinical symptoms are&#xD;
      suspicious for progressing disease or otherwise clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject shows an at least partial response (PR) on Day 29 or Day 36 (4 doses) the&#xD;
      sponsor discusses with the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to give an additional 2 doses&#xD;
      (therefore the maximal number of doses for each subject is 6 doses) and a further staging&#xD;
      will be performed 14 and 21 days after the last dose administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A completion visit will be performed 4 days after the last serological staging (e.g. after&#xD;
      cycle 2 on Day 40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four dose groups (cohorts) are planned: 0.3 mg/kg followed by doses of 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 6&#xD;
      mg/kg. Subjects will be enrolled in a strict sequential order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual safety results obtained until Day 5 will be evaluated by the investigator and the&#xD;
      sponsor before the next subject of the same dose group will be treated. After completion of&#xD;
      all 3 subjects of a dose group, safety results of all subjects obtained until Day 15 will be&#xD;
      reviewed by the DSMB and a decision for dose escalation will be made. Interim doses can be&#xD;
      administered if the increase is thought to be too high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who show definite signs of progressive disease including hypercalcemia, new&#xD;
      osteolytic lesions or new soft tissue plasmocytoma will be withdrawn from the study at any&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case dose limited toxicity (DLT) was seen in a subject, further dosing of subjects in the&#xD;
      same dose group will be discussed with the DSMB, in case of a second DLT in the same dose&#xD;
      group dose escalation will be stopped and the study will be continued at the next lower&#xD;
      intermediate dose level or the previous tested dose will be regarded as the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD). The MTD is defined as the dose level below the dose inducing a DLT in 2 subjects&#xD;
      within one dose level.&#xD;
