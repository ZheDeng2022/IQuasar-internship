      ROLE OF SUCTION IN EUS-FNA: Current suction technique involves suctioning the aspirate into&#xD;
      the needle that has an air column. The needle is not flushed with any liquid prior to passing&#xD;
      into the desired solid lesion. Suction is applied when the needle is within the lesion&#xD;
      leading to aspiration of tissue into the needle. This is the standard technique and some have&#xD;
      done with and without the stylet. There are some data that favor non use of a stylet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WET SCTION TECHNIQUE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wet suction technique involves flushing the needle with 1-2 cc of saline to replace the&#xD;
      column of air with saline. The needle is now passed into the desired lesion. Suction is&#xD;
      applied at maximal strength and needle moved back and forth within the lesion to obtain as&#xD;
      aspirate. Drops of saline can be seen moving into the suction syringe as the aspirate moves&#xD;
      into the needle. Needle is now withdrawn and aspirate delivered on to a slide by using a&#xD;
      stylet and or flushing air into the needle with a syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS The effect of suction for the purpose of aspirating cells and / or tissue during&#xD;
      fine needle biopsy may be significantly improved by filling the column of the needle with a&#xD;
      less compressible fluid. The volume of vacuum being pulled may be negatively impacted by the&#xD;
      expansion of air within the needle. Replacing the air with sterile saline may thus improve&#xD;
      the suction transferred to the needle tip by ensuring that the full volume of the vacuum&#xD;
      syringe is transferred to the distal tip of the needle. This effect would be most pronounced&#xD;
      in larger gauge needles which would have a larger internal volume. An additional benefit of&#xD;
      filling the needle with saline prior to aspiration is the speed of the pressure transfer. The&#xD;
      theory is that the air in the needle may absorb some of the force of the sudden application&#xD;
      of vacuum. A column of saline in the needle may increase the velocity of the pressure&#xD;
      transfer providing more tissue and less blood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has become the modality of choice for imaging the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal wall and surrounding structures. EUS is not only used for diagnostic&#xD;
      purposes but is also useful in tissue acquisition by fine needle aspiration (FNA) thus&#xD;
      helping in diagnosis and treatment of various lesions. EUS-FNA is being routinely used to&#xD;
      sample various cystic and solid lesion involving the pancreas, liver, gastric wall, adrenal&#xD;
      glands, kidney as well as lymph nodes in areas adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS-FNA is performed by passing a needle through a working channel located within the&#xD;
      echoendoscope. The needle passes out of the endoscope in the same plane as the ultrasound&#xD;
      sensor, allowing the operator to visualize the path of the needle. This allows directed&#xD;
      needle puncture of the lesion and avoidance of other structures such as blood vessels. After&#xD;
      the needle is passed into the lesion of interest, varying degrees of suction is applied to&#xD;
      obtain an aspirate. The needle is withdrawn from the scope channel and aspirate is pushed out&#xD;
      of the needle either with a stylet or by using a syringe to pump air to flush out the&#xD;
      aspirate for further cyto-pathological evaluation. The cells obtained at needle aspiration&#xD;
      can help in differentiating benign from malignant, and also tell the origin of the tumor if&#xD;
      malignant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the advantages of EUS-FNA is that the sample can be quickly stained and processed in&#xD;
      the procedure room and a diagnosis can be given to the endosonographer during the procedure.&#xD;
      The cyto pathologist if unable to provide an accurate diagnosis on the site is at least able&#xD;
      to assess the adequacy of cellularity. This optimal and in some centers 5-6 needle passes are&#xD;
      routinely made and the cells sent to the cytopathological laboratory for further examination,&#xD;
      preparation of cell block etc.,. The ability to make an accurate diagnosis, , is dependent on&#xD;
      the quality of the sample obtained. Not all the centers have the capability of having an on&#xD;
      site cytopathologist to assess the cellularity and or make a diagnosis at the bedside.&#xD;
      Moreover if the cellularity is inadequate or if the diagnosis is uncertain, the patient has&#xD;
      to undergo a repeat procedure resulting in increased costs, risks and also the agony of&#xD;
      waiting for a diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROLE OF SUCTION IN EUS-FNA It was believed that applying suction to the needle while it is&#xD;
      within the desired lesion, improves the quality of aspirate. However, recently there has been&#xD;
      a trend to use less or no suction as that provides a &quot;less bloody&quot; specimen. The only&#xD;
      randomized trial comparing suction to non suction techniques observed a higher sensitivity&#xD;
      and negative predictive values for malignancy in the suction group compared with the&#xD;
      non-suction group. In addition, bloodiness or contamination was not increased in the suction&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current suction technique involves suctioning the aspirate into the needle that has an air&#xD;
      column. The needle is not flushed with any liquid prior to passing into the desired solid&#xD;
      lesion. Suction is applied when the needle is within the lesion leading to aspiration of&#xD;
      tissue into the needle. This is the standard technique and some have done with and without&#xD;
      the stylet. There are some data that favor non use of a stylet.&#xD;

      aspirate. Drops of saline can be seen moving into the suction syringe as the aspirate moves&#xD;
