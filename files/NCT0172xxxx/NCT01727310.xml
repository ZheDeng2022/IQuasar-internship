  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Left valvular heart disease has become one of the most common heart disease in Western&#xD;
      countries. This disease evolve over many years and are characterized by a long phase where&#xD;
      the patient is &quot;asymptomatic&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      it is characterized by discomfort LV filling may worsen and lead typically to a pressure&#xD;
      increase of LV pressure and the left atrium (LA) (1). The onset of symptoms is unpredictable&#xD;
      and may occur at the stage of diastolic or systolic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventricular dysfunction may be insidious, the goal is to detect early dysfunction, knowing&#xD;
      that it is often very difficult to know if the patient is actually symptomatic. The onset of&#xD;
      symptoms sign an intolerance to the increase in LV filling pressures and LA , causing&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the study of the level of LV and LA filling pressures , if possible by a&#xD;
      noninvasive method, would identify patients apparently asymptomatic even though their&#xD;
      condition is advanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressures filling pressures can be explored by two methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cardiac catheterization, which is a direct and invasive measurement method&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  echocardiography, which is an indirect measurement method which has the advantage of&#xD;
           being non-invasive The goal of this research is to compare the two methods.&#xD;
