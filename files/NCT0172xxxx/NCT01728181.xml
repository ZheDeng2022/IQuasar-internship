      The current trial &quot;A Phase I/II study of Erlotinib +/- Tivozanib as initial treatment for&#xD;
      Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer assigned by VeriStrat® Serum Proteomic Evaluation&quot; will&#xD;
      begin by evaluating toxicity for the combination of Tivozanib and Erlotinib to determine a&#xD;
      phase II dose. The phase II portion of the study will seek to duplicate the finding of the&#xD;
      BEER trial in a selected population of patients with NSCLC with a VeriStrat® Good signature&#xD;
      using two oral agents with Tivozanib substituted for bevacizumab. Phase II will be designed&#xD;
      as a selection-based randomized trial. Patients with VeriStrat® Good signature will be&#xD;
      assigned to EGFR inhibitor therapy with a randomization to Erlotinib plus/minus Tivozanib.&#xD;
      Patients with VeriStrat® Poor signature will be assigned to standard of care.&#xD;
      Standard-of-care chemotherapy as first treatment at the discretion of patient and physician&#xD;
      will be evaluated for response to treatment, survival and repeat VeriStrat® signature.&#xD;
