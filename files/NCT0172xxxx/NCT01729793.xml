      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of Digestive Enzyme Blend #2, a&#xD;
      digestive enzyme dietary supplement product, on markers indicative of inflammation after a&#xD;
      meal. The markers will be assessed by blood levels tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha),&#xD;
      interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein&#xD;
      (hsCRP) at times 0, 45 minutes, 2 hours and 4 hours post-meal. A full complete blood count&#xD;
      (CBC)and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) blood test will also be conducted at times 0&#xD;
      and 4 hours post-meal. In addition, a questionaire on Gastrointestinal symptoms will be&#xD;
      administered 4 hours post-meal. The study hypothesis is that some or all of these potential&#xD;
      markers of inflammation will increase following the meal, and the amount of increase in&#xD;
      inflammation will be attenuated when a digestive enzyme is consumed with the meal compared to&#xD;
      the placebo. In addition, it is hypothesized that levels of gastric discomfort as assessed by&#xD;
      the questionaire will be reduced with the digestive enzyme compared to the placebo.&#xD;

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of Digestive Enzyme Blend #2, a&#xD;
      digestive enzyme dietary supplement product, on markers indicative of inflammation after a&#xD;
      meal. The study design is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over type&#xD;
      study. The markers will be assessed by blood levels TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and hsCRP at&#xD;
      times 0, 45 minutes, 2 hours and 4 hours post-meal. A full blood CBC panel and an ESR blood&#xD;
      test will also be conducted at times 0 and 4 hours post-meal. In addition, a questionaire on&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal symptoms will be administered 4 hours post-meal. The study hypothesis is&#xD;
      that some or all of these potential markers of inflammation will increase following the meal,&#xD;
      and the amount of increase in inflammation will be attenuated when a digestive enzyme is&#xD;
      consumed with the meal compared to the placebo. In addition, it is hypothesized that levels&#xD;
      of gastric discomfort as assessed by the questionaire will be reduced with the digestive&#xD;
      enzyme compared to the placebo.&#xD;
