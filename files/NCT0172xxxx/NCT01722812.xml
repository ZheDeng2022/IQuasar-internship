&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of stable plaque psoriasis of at least 6 months with a symmetric&#xD;
             distribution&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Two treatment areas with a symmetrical distribution each corresponding to 2-3% BSA and&#xD;
             each including at least one itchy psoriasis plaque&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Itchy psoriasis on both intended treatment areas of at least 40mm on the Visual&#xD;
             Analogue Scale (VAS) with a maximum difference of 10mm on the visual analogue scale&#xD;
             between each of the two treatment areas&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease severity graded mild, moderate or severe according to the Physician's global&#xD;
             assessment (PGA) of disease severity on psoriasis plaques on each of the two treatment&#xD;
             areas. The disease severity must be the same for both treatment areas&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic treatment with biological therapies, whether marketed or not, with a possible&#xD;
             effect on psoriasis vulgaris within the following time periods prior to randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  etanercept - within 4 weeks prior to randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  adalimumab, infliximab - within 8 weeks prior to randomisation&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any topical treatment of the treatment areas (except for emollients) within 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to randomisation.&#xD;

             within the following time periods prior to randomisation:&#xD;

               -  antihistamins - within 1 week prior to randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  gabapentin - within 4 weeks prior to randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received treatment with any non-marketed drug substance (i.e. a drug&#xD;
             which has not yet been made available for clinical use following registration) within&#xD;
             the 4-week period prior to randomisation or longer, if the class of substance required&#xD;
             a longer treatment free period as defined in exclusion criterion 1 for biological&#xD;
             treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PUVA or Grenz ray therapy within 4 weeks prior to randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  UVB therapy within 2 weeks prior to randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned initiation of, or changes to concomitant medication that could affect&#xD;
             psoriasis vulgaris (e.g., beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, anti-malaria drugs, lithium)&#xD;
             within 2 weeks prior to randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with current participation in any other interventional clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any of the following conditions present on the treatment areas: viral&#xD;

             on the treatment area that may confound the evaluation of psoriasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of serious allergy, allergic skin rash or sensitivity to any&#xD;
             component of the investigational products or formulations being tested&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected severe renal insufficiency or severe hepatic disorders&#xD;

          -  Current diagnosis of erythrodermic, exfoliative, guttate or pustular psoriasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned exposure to the sun during the study that may affect psoriasis vulgaris (i.e.,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects previously randomised into this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not all of the exclusion criteria listed due to limited space&#xD;
