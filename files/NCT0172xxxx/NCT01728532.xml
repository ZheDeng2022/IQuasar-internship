      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is performed only in adults who required a non-surgical root canal obturation. The&#xD;
      studied indication is the root canal sealing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-centre and open-label study comprises two groups corresponding to tested root&#xD;
      canal sealer (a reference product and investigational product). Randomization is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational product that is a dental cement based on biosilicate technology (PA0903) will&#xD;
      be applied with lateral compaction or single cone technique. On the contrary, reference&#xD;
      product that is a zinc oxide-eugenol used in dental practice (Pulp Canal Sealer) will be&#xD;
      applied with a single wave technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study start: 01/12/11&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion period: 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: 2 years after the end of inclusion period&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: The trial objective is to illustrate the clinical and radiographic outcome of&#xD;
      PA0903 in the described indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate: clinical and radiographic outcome of root canal&#xD;
      treatment at two years when using PA0903 as an endodontic sealer with gutta-percha. The&#xD;
      success rate is defined as no pain (score of 0 at the VAS scale) and absence or decrease in&#xD;
      the size of LEO (fulfilment of Strindberg's criteria). If a pre-existing lesion, the size&#xD;
      decrease associated with normal contours, width and structure of the periodontal margines is&#xD;
      considered as success. All cases in which lesion increases or is stabilized after 2 years&#xD;
      were judged as unsuccessful . Moreover, all cases in which Strindberg's criteria if they are&#xD;
      suitable were not fulfilled were judged as unsuccessful. A follow-up of two years is&#xD;
      described as the predictive time of success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the following criteria and in an indicative way, to&#xD;
      compare them between patients receiving the PA0903 and those receiving the reference product:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The success rate at each time point and also the components of this composite variable&#xD;
      (i.e. pain and Healing process for total class (vital teeth and necrotic teeth) of endodontic&#xD;
      status of teeth).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of pre-existing LEO associated with necrotic teeth, size of LEO and suitable&#xD;
      Strindgberg's criteria will be used to judge the outcomes of the root canal therapy as&#xD;
      described below :&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 2 (6 months) treatment is considered successful when LEO is stable or decreased in&#xD;
      comparison with V0 associated with Strindberg's criteria suitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At V3 (1 year), treatment is considered successful when LEO is decreased in comparison with&#xD;
      V2 associated with Strindberg's criteria suitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the Healing process associated with PA0903 application in each endodontic status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the handling, consistency and physical characteristics of PA0903&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the longevity and safety of the product associated with PA0903 after two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL POPULATION AND NUMBER OF PATIENTS: about 60 patients will have to be included in the&#xD;
      study, 20 by center with a ratio 2 (PA0903): 1 (reference). Adults will be included without&#xD;
      gender distinction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coordinating center Endodotontic service of Pitié Salpétrière Pitié Salpétrière Hospital&#xD;
      75634 Paris Cedex 13 France&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION OF TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product is applied on D0 (inclusion) of the study. The follow-up period includes 2 years&#xD;
      with 4 visits: Visit 1(Week 2), Visit 2 (Month 6), Visit 3 (Year 1) and Visit 4 (Year 2).&#xD;
