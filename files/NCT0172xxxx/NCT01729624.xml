      A qualitative study using interviews with patients who have antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody&#xD;
      (ANCA) associated vasculitis, to develop a patient reported outcome (PRO)measure&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis (AAV) have&#xD;
      inflammation in the small blood vessels leading to involvement in different body areas, e.g.,&#xD;
      the kidneys, lungs and skin. Untreated, the risk of death is over 80%; with current&#xD;
      treatment, patients often suffer from ongoing disease activity, damage or treatment side&#xD;
      effects which have a negative impact on quality of life. Because patients with AAV can have a&#xD;
      wide range of disease features, the investigators hypothesise that general patient reported&#xD;
      outcome (PROs) measurements, may not be specific enough to describe the full impact on&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project is to start from patients' experiences to develop a&#xD;
      disease specific PRO for patients with AAV. Patients diagnosed with AAV will be recruited&#xD;
      through clinics or inpatients at the Oxford University Hospitals (OUH) National Health&#xD;
      Service (NHS) Trust, or, if the patients have previously consented to be contacted about&#xD;
      future studies, through the Diagnostic and Classification of Vasculitis (DCVAS) or The&#xD;
      Characterisation and Determinants of Quality of Life in ANCA Associated Vasculitis (VasQoL)&#xD;
      study databases. After informed consent is obtained, individual patient interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted; these will last for approximately one hour and will be recorded and transcribed.&#xD;
      Themes will be independently extracted and amalgamated by the researchers. Approximately 25&#xD;
      patients with different types of ANCAassociated vasculitis and varying disease duration will&#xD;
      be interviewed until saturation, i.e., no new substantive themes emerge. These themes will&#xD;
      then evolve into individual candidate questionnaire items. Candidate items will be piloted on&#xD;
      approximately 25 different patients with AAV using questionnaires and interviews, until no&#xD;
      further comments arise, to produce a final set of candidate questionnaire items. The duration&#xD;
      of the study 1.5 years.&#xD;

    <measure>This is a qualitative research study based on semi-quantitive exploratory patient interviews and therefore it is not appropriate to define only one outcome measure.</measure>
    <time_frame>No formal outcome measure therefore not applicable</time_frame>
    <description>The principle research objective: The investigators are going to interview patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody associated vasculitis, to develop and pilot questionnaire items for a patient reported outcome measure specifically for their disease.&#xD;
The secondary research objective is to describe the impact of ANCA-associated vasculitis on the quality of life of patients attending the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, based on individual anonymised interviews.</description>
