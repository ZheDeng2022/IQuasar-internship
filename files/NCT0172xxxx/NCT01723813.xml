    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the intravenous and/or GM-CT-01&#xD;
      administration can correct Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) anergy and induce a more&#xD;
      efficient and long-lasting anti-tumoral immune response following peptide vaccination.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human cancers express tumor antigens that can be targeted by cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL).&#xD;
      These antigens consist of a small peptide, derived from endogenous proteins, that is&#xD;
      presented at the cancer cell's surface by an HLA class I molecule. Such antigenic peptides,&#xD;
      including MAGE-3.A1 and NA17.A2, have been tested in experimental therapeutic vaccines to&#xD;
      elicit CTL responses in cancer patients, mainly with metastatic melanoma. Up to now, only&#xD;
      rare tumor responses have been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor resistance to CTL killing is the most likely explanation for the poor effectiveness of&#xD;
      cancer vaccines. This resistance is probably acquired by the tumor during its development and&#xD;
      selected by its repetitive challenge with spontaneous anti-tumoral immune responses.&#xD;
      Recently, we have identified a novel mechanism causing anergy of tumor-associated T&#xD;
      lymphocytes, and established new approaches to correct this anergy in vitro. Galectin-3,&#xD;
      secreted by tumor cells, appears to inhibit CTL function the co-localization of the T cell&#xD;
      receptor and the cluster of differentiation 8 coreceptor. Importantly, this functional defect&#xD;
      is restored when anergic T cells are incubated with galectin-3 inhibitors such as the&#xD;
      disaccharides lactose and N-acetyllactosamine, and the polysaccharide GM-CT-01. GM-CT-01 is a&#xD;
      vegetal galactomannan oligomer, currently under clinical investigation in several types of&#xD;
      solid malignancies for its capacity to inhibit galectins and to synergize with chemotherapy&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our observations suggest that treatment of cancer patients with GM-CT-01 could correct TIL&#xD;
      anergy and induce a more efficient and long-lasting anti-tumoral immune response following&#xD;
      peptide vaccination.&#xD;
