      Considering the facts that: (i) IPT of malaria provides substantial protection against&#xD;
      anaemia and malaria in school children (ii); SP resistance has no significant impact on the&#xD;
      prophylactic efficacy (iii) SP-PQ is safe and as efficacious as SP: the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that antimalarial IPT with SP and SP-PQ will improve haemoglobin concentration,&#xD;
      reduce anaemia prevalence, malaria incidence and parasitaemia, and improve malnutrition and&#xD;
      school performance in school-aged children of Congo.&#xD;

      STUDY RATIONAL The education sector represents a reliable system for malaria control.&#xD;
      Intermittent preventive therapy in schoolchildren (IPTsc) is likely the most feasible and&#xD;
      appropriate chemoprevention in stable and endemic areas because schoolchildren are usually&#xD;
      asymptomatic to malaria infection and are consequently untreated in practice. Therefore, if&#xD;
      proven effective, IPTsc would be of direct benefit for the schoolchild, contribute to malaria&#xD;
      control at school, and facilitate community-wide the implementation of other control&#xD;
      interventions i.e. vector control, Intermittent preventive therapy in infants (IPTi), and&#xD;
      prompt diagnosis and treatment (PDT). Nevertheless, evidence about use of IPTsc is not yet&#xD;
      substantiated as only two clinical studies have so far been performed on IPTsc in hyper&#xD;
      endemic areas. Further clinical trials are warranted in other settings. Through a randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) we will assess the efficacy and safety, of two IPT regimens versus&#xD;
      controls in school children of the DRCongo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DRUGS Favourable drugs for use as IPT should balance long half-life against efficacy,&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and potentiality for cross-resistance selection.(16) Use of long-acting&#xD;
      drugs would result in fewer intake and higher treatment compliance. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine&#xD;
      is an established used product in the indication of IPT in pregnancy. The drug has further&#xD;
      proven safety and tolerability in children in clinical trials. SP is slowly eliminated and&#xD;
      allows 60 days antimalaria protection for fully sensitive P. falciparum. Other long-acting&#xD;
      drugs available are mefloquine, amodiaquine, and piperaquine. However, due safety concern&#xD;
      mefloquine might not be optimal for IPT. Amodiaquine is not suitable for IPT due to its 3&#xD;
      days treatment regimen that may be a concern regarding compliance. Piperaquine has been&#xD;
      extensively used for mass prophylaxis and treatment since 1978 in China and other malaria&#xD;
      endemic countries of Asia.(20) Piperaquine has a long half-live and points as good IPT&#xD;
      candidate in endemic country with SP resistance. For this study sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine&#xD;
      combined with piperaquine (SP-PQ) plus will be used. SP and SP-PQ will be given at 4 months&#xD;
      intervals in line with the long half-lives (around 20 days) in paediatric patients and for&#xD;
      higher treatment compliance,&#xD;
