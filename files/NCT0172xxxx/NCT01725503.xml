      The goal of the present study is to quantify the rate of synthesis of creatine in healthy&#xD;
      controls and endurance trained subjects. In addition, the effect of oral creatine supplement&#xD;
      for seven days on creatine kinetics will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten healthy controls (age 20-35 years) and ten endurance trained subjects will be recruited&#xD;
      by advertisement. Endurance trained subjects will be recruited from health clubs. They will&#xD;
      be screened for absence of any chronic disease (history, physical examination, CBC, metabolic&#xD;
      and liver panel, urinalysis). A DEXA measurement will be done to quantify whole body skeletal&#xD;
      muscle mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For five (5) days prior to the study, they will be placed on a creatine-free (essentially&#xD;
      meat-free) diet. Dietary compliance will be ensured by repeated communication with the&#xD;
      subject, by nurse coordinator and the CRU Nutritionist. Subject will maintain daily record of&#xD;
      the food intake for validation. On the last day, i.e. 24 hours prior to the tracer study,&#xD;
      subject will collect the 24 hours urine sample and bring it to the CRU on the day of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Creatine and phosphocreatine are the major intracellular buffers for adenosine triphosphate.&#xD;
      They also function as the energy shuttle for high energy phosphate from the mitochondrial&#xD;
      site of production to the cytoplasmic site of utilization. In addition, creatine has been&#xD;
      shown to affect satellite cell proliferation and differentiation and increase cell mitotic&#xD;
      activity during compensatory hypertrophy in rat skeletal muscle. Creatine is synthesized from&#xD;
      three amino acids: glycine, arginine and methionine. Although creatine metabolism has been&#xD;
      studied extensively in the rat, the data regarding the kinetics of creatine and their&#xD;
      regulation in humans are limited. This is in part due to a large and slow turning over pool&#xD;
      of creatine and lack of good tracer methods. Using a recently developed stable isotopic&#xD;
      tracer method (by us), we propose to quantify the rate of synthesis of creatine and its&#xD;
      regulation in healthy subjects and in those with large skeletal muscle mass as a result of&#xD;
      endurance training. In addition, the response to oral creatine administration on creatine&#xD;
      kinetics will be quantified. The site of regulation will be identified by the relative rate&#xD;
      of appearance of tracer glycine in guanidinoacetic acid and creatine. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      the fractional rate of synthesis of creatine will be higher in endurance trained subjects,&#xD;
      and that creatine will suppress the rate of synthesis of creatine. Since creatine is critical&#xD;
      for the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and satellite cell proliferation, these data will&#xD;
      provide the normative physiological data for future studies of subjects with manifest&#xD;
      sarcopenia, such as aging, and those with chronic diseases, e.g. cirrhosis of liver. These&#xD;
      data will form the basis for the studies of creatine metabolism in neurodegenerative&#xD;
      disorders where creatine is being increasingly used as a therapeutic agent.&#xD;
