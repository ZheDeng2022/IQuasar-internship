  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this evaluation is to observe the performance of two (2) different skin care&#xD;
      treatment protocols on the skin:&#xD;
&#xD;
      #1 Kendall™ Body Wash &amp; Shampoo in combination with the Moisture Barrier Cream; or #2&#xD;
      Kendall™ 2-in-1 Cleanser in combination with the Anti-fungal Cream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific evidence supports using these types of skin care products to keep the skin&#xD;
      healthy in the presence of moisture, urine, stool, or fungal infection. The cleansers are&#xD;
      preferred over soap and water and can be applied on all areas of the skin. The Moisture&#xD;
      Barrier Cream is formulated especially for skin exposed to moisture, urine, or stool. The&#xD;
      Antifungal Cream is utilized for fungal infections associated with athlete's foot, jock itch,&#xD;
      and ring worm to relieve itching, soreness, and irritation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The Kendall™ Body Wash &amp; Shampoo is a no-rinse cleanser that gently removed dirt, urine, and&#xD;
      stool while maintaining the natural pH of the skin (although it contains a shampoo&#xD;
      component); it can be applied on all areas of the skin. Kendall™ Moisture Barrier Cream&#xD;
      performs as a barrier to moisture and irritants when the natural barrier ability of the skin&#xD;
      has been compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kendall™ 2-in-1 Cleanser is a no-rinse cleanser that gently removes dirt, urine, and stool&#xD;
      and protects the skin from damage. Kendall™ Antifungal Cream is used on fungal infections to&#xD;
      relieve itching and discomfort.&#xD;
