      You are invited to participate in a research study to develop new ways to look for abnormal&#xD;
      areas/tissues of the colon. The current endoscopes used to look at the colon are very good,&#xD;
      but if the area doesn't look different to the naked eye, then the endoscope can't improve on&#xD;
      that. We are looking at using special fluorescent stains in addition to special endoscopes&#xD;
      designed to see abnormal areas that are not obvious to the naked eye. Currently specialized&#xD;
      microscopes and fluorescent stains are used in clinical laboratories but it takes several&#xD;
      days of processing to get results. It may be very helpful to look for areas to sample for&#xD;
      abnormal tissue during the endoscopy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You are being asked to let us spray a &quot;fluorescent peptides&quot; into your right colon. Peptides&#xD;
      are small chains of amino acids (the building blocks that make up proteins) linked together.&#xD;
      Our peptide is a chain of 7 amino acids attached to a fluorescent dye called FITC (like the&#xD;
      one used by your eye doctor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have prepared this special &quot;fluorescent peptide&quot; to target and bind to any abnormal areas&#xD;
      if present, and &quot;glow&quot; when a special light is used. In this study, we will apply the special&#xD;
      fluorescent peptide by a spray catheter to your right colon to asses for safety. The&#xD;
      colonoscope used in this study is the usual colonoscope used and is not able to see the&#xD;
      fluorescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 1 study. This means that this is the first time we have used this kind of&#xD;
      &quot;fluorescent peptide&quot; in people. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved this&#xD;
      agent, but is allowing us to test it in this study. The goal of this study is to see if there&#xD;
      are any side effects from using the peptide. We have used a similar peptide that we've&#xD;
      developed for the esophagus in over 40 patients without any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first test of this agent, so it won't be used to change how colonoscopy is done.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to develop the use of fluorescence-labeled peptides (Colon KCC)&#xD;
      that affinity bind to pre-cancerous mucosa in the digestive tract for use as an imaging agent&#xD;
      to aid in the early detection of colon cancer. Currently colon cancer prevention is achieved&#xD;
      by endoscopic evaluation and removal of pre-malignant lesions (adenomatous polyps) by&#xD;
      endoscopic resection and biopsy. Standard endoscopy uses white light illumination and is only&#xD;
      able to detect pre-cancerous tissue that has abnormal architectural features, such as a polyp&#xD;
      or mass. However, pre-cancerous lesions can also be flat in appearance and visually&#xD;
      indistinct from normal tissue; such as in the case of chronic ulcerative colitis and / or&#xD;
      some right-sided polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, flat and depressed lesions, which are more difficult to detect in white light&#xD;
      colonoscopy, may represent over 25% of all pre-malignant lesions and may confer a higher risk&#xD;
      for malignancy. Integration of molecular probes that home in to diseased tissues with high&#xD;
      resolution imaging instruments could greatly improve the diagnostic accuracy for missed&#xD;
      lesions of both polypoid and non-polypoid morphology, including the often fatal 'right-sided&#xD;
      ' adenomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic imaging with the use of fluorescent-labeled probes is a promising method for&#xD;
      achieving greater specificity, spatial localization and higher image contrast in the&#xD;
      detection of neoplastic lesions. This study is a 'first-in-humans' test of the safety of the&#xD;
      topically applied peptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase I study of the safety of a topically-administered fluorescent heptapeptide for&#xD;
      detecting neoplastic areas of the colon is proposed. The study will test the safety of&#xD;
      administering this agent to human subjects undergoing clinically-indicated colonoscopy.&#xD;
      Safety is defined as the occurrence of adverse events after the administration of topical&#xD;
      fluorescence-labeled peptides to the surface of intra-colonic mucosa.&#xD;
