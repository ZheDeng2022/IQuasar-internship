  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, single-dose, 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-way crossover study&#xD;
      with incomplete wash-out in subjects with solid tumors to determine the relative&#xD;
      bioavailability of test formulation with lower dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) content as compared&#xD;
      with standard reference formulation trametinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 18 subjects will be randomized to receive either a single dose of Treatment A&#xD;
      (standard target DMSO content [theoretical 11.3%] formulation of GSK1120212B) or a single&#xD;
      dose of Treatment B (lower DMSO Content [approximately 9.5%] formulation of GSK1120212B)&#xD;
      followed by a 7 day incomplete wash-out period, then a single dose of the other treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of the dose under fasted conditions in Periods 1 and 2 will be only on Day 1&#xD;
      followed by 7 days of serial blood sampling for PK analysis of plasma trametinib. Safety&#xD;
      assessments, including assessment of AEs, clinical laboratory (hematology and clinical&#xD;
      chemistry) and vital signs, will be made throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a subject completes the study, he or she may be eligible to enter study MEK114375, an&#xD;
      open-label rollover study of trametinib (no wash-out period or follow-up visit required) and&#xD;
      continue receiving trametinib. For those subjects who wish to discontinue or complete the&#xD;
      current study and choose not enter the rollover study, a follow-up visit should be performed&#xD;
      within 21 days after receiving the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
