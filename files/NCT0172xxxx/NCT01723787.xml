  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infantile spasms (IIS), a characteristic epilepsy syndrome of infancy with often catastrophic&#xD;
      developmental consequences, is known in some patients to have many different genetic,&#xD;
      metabolic and structural etiologies. However, for most patients IIS is the only presenting&#xD;
      clinical feature and the specific cause is unknown. Only two FDA approved pharmacologic&#xD;
      treatments for IIS exist, Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and vigabatrin. While vigabatrin&#xD;
      may be the treatment of choice for Tuberous Sclerosis as a cause for IS, ACTH is the&#xD;
      treatment of choice for all others. Unfortunately, a substantial number of patients may still&#xD;
      not respond to ACTH and there is no a priori way that suggests which patients may be&#xD;
      responders. This has led to the following key questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Can novel genetic analyses determine known genetic causes of IS with greater efficiency (more&#xD;
      timely and cost-effective)? Can novel genetic analyses determine previously unknown disease&#xD;
      modifying genes that predispose individuals to develop IS? Can novel genetic analyses&#xD;
      elaborate genes and gene polymorphisms that favor ACTH responsiveness? Do these polymorphisms&#xD;
      suggest strategies to improve ACTH responsiveness?&#xD;

      Primary Aim 1: Apply whole-exome sequencing to determine possible causes of cryptogenic IS&#xD;
      and evaluate adding whole-exome sequencing to standard practice for determining causes of IS.&#xD;
      Sub-aim 1: Determine the effectiveness of whole-exome sequencing in suggesting&#xD;
      disease-modifying genes that may contribute to triggering IS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 2: Determine genes, through whole-exome sequencing, that may play a role in&#xD;
      determining ACTH responsiveness for IS. Sub-aim 2: Correlate genes or genetic factors&#xD;
      (haplotypes) associated with ACTH responsiveness and disease modification.&#xD;
