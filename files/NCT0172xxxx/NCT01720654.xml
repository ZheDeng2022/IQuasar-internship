  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Expedited Partner Therapy (EPT) has been shown to reduce rates of persistent or recurrent&#xD;
      gonorrhea and chlamydia infection in heterosexual patients, but has not been evaluated for&#xD;
      use among men who have sex with men (MSM). CDC guidelines support the use of EPT for partner&#xD;
      management with heterosexual patients, but note the absence of evidence necessary to make an&#xD;
      equivalent recommendation for the use of EPT with MSM. Randomized clinical trials to assess&#xD;
      the impact of EPT on partner notification, treatment, and STI re-infection among MSM are&#xD;
      critical to the development of evidence-based partner management guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data from urban Peru has identified prevalences of rectal and pharyngeal gonorrhea and&#xD;
      chlamydia ranging from 5-20%. The elevated burden of disease among MSM in Peru suggests that&#xD;
      frequent transmission of undiagnosed gonorrhea and chlamydia through MSM sexual networks may&#xD;
      be a factor contributing to the persistently high incidence of HIV infection among MSM in the&#xD;
      region. The investigators propose a pilot evaluation of the effect of EPT on partner&#xD;
      notification and treatment among MSM in Peru diagnosed with gonorrhea or chlamydia at any&#xD;
      anatomic site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To explore the social norms and structural factors influencing partner&#xD;
      notification and treatment among MSM in Peru.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of EPT on anticipated and actual partner notification&#xD;
      among MSM diagnosed with gonorrhea or chlamydia infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To develop preliminary data on rates of gonococcal and chlamydial&#xD;
      re-infection among MSM randomized to receive EPT compared with standard partner notification&#xD;
      counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will provide pilot data on the use of EPT with MSM diagnosed with&#xD;
      gonorrhea or chlamydia and form the basis for a subsequent Phase III clinical trial of EPT as&#xD;
      an STI control method among MSM in Latin America.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: To determine the effect of Expedited Partner Therapy (EPT) on anticipated and&#xD;
      actual partner notification among MSM diagnosed with gonorrhea or chlamydia infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that provision of EPT will alter the behavioral and social contexts&#xD;
      of STI management in MSM partnerships by coupling the acts of partner treatment and partner&#xD;
      notification. As a result, the investigators hypothesize that MSM provided with EPT will&#xD;
      report higher rates of partner notification and treatment compared with men who receive&#xD;
      standard partner notification counseling. Quantitative analysis of partner notification&#xD;
      outcomes, using the specific examples of participants' five most recent sex partners, will&#xD;
      provide a broad estimate of notification and treatment behaviors within the study population.&#xD;
      Individual in-depth interviews with a diverse sub-set of participants will be used to provide&#xD;
      further interpretive depth regarding the behavioral, social, and structural issues associated&#xD;
      with anticipated and actual partner notification and treatment in specific interpersonal&#xD;
      contexts, and to address logistical issues related to implementation of the intervention and&#xD;
      the accuracy of the study's outcome measures for assessing participants' experiences of&#xD;
      partner management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To collect preliminary data on rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia re-infection&#xD;
      among MSM randomized to receive EPT compared with standard partner notification counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that MSM provided with EPT will have a lower prevalence of&#xD;
      persistent or recurrent urethral, rectal, or pharyngeal gonorrhea and/or chlamydia infection&#xD;
      at the one-month follow-up visit compared with men who receive only standard partner&#xD;
      notification counseling. Due to the exploratory nature of the proposed study, the&#xD;
      investigators have not designed the protocol as an evaluation of the clinical effectiveness&#xD;
      of EPT on STI re-infection among MSM. However, the data collected will provide essential&#xD;
      preliminary information on the behavioral, social, and epidemiologic contexts of partner&#xD;
      management among MSM in Peru needed to design a future clinical trial on the use of EPT as a&#xD;
      network-based strategy for STI control among MSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be selected for participation in the study depending on the findings of the&#xD;
      EPT/Partner Notification Screening Protocol. Participants in the EPT/Partner Notification&#xD;
      Screening Protocol diagnosed with urethritis and/or proctitis, or Gonorrhea and/or Chlamydia&#xD;
      in the urethra, rectum, or oropharynx will be eligible for enrollment in the EPT trial&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Recruitment: Participants in the EPT/Partner Notification Screening Protocol who are&#xD;
      diagnosed by the Study Physician as having clinical urethritis or proctitis, or diagnosed&#xD;
      with laboratory-confirmed Gonorrhea and/or Chlamydia infection will be invited by the Study&#xD;
      Counselor to participate in the EPT Intervention Protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Informed Consent: All potential subjects will receive an explanation of the study&#xD;
      procedures and risks and benefits and asked to provide written Informed Consent. Participants&#xD;
      will be given the opportunity to take the Informed Consent Document home for further review&#xD;
      and decide at a later time if they wish to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Enrollment: Subjects who consent to participate in the EPT Intervention Protocol will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the Intervention (EPT) or the Standard of Care (Partner Notification&#xD;
      Counseling) arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV Randomization: Eligible subjects who provide consent to participate will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to intervention or control groups using a random permuted block allocation (block&#xD;
      size=7 in an alternating 4/3 ratio). Computer-generated randomization assignments will be&#xD;
      stored in opaque, sealed envelopes opened at the time of allocation. Randomization&#xD;
      assignments will be recorded and identified by the participant's numeric study code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Intervention Delivery. Participants assigned to the EPT intervention will be provided with&#xD;
      standard partner notification counseling as well as a maximum of 5 EPT packets to distribute&#xD;
      to their recent (within 3 months) sex partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EPT packets will contain both Cefixime 400 mg and Azithromycin 1g in pill form, as well as a&#xD;
      card providing information on gonorrhea and chlamydia infections, the risks and benefits of&#xD;
      the antibiotics provided (including allergic reactions), and the importance of testing for&#xD;
      HIV and other STIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the control arm will receive standard partner notification&#xD;
      counseling by study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following delivery of the intervention, an appointment will be scheduled for participants to&#xD;
      return to the research site in 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Follow-up Evaluation. All participants will be asked to return to the study site 2-4&#xD;
      weeks after enrollment and randomization. At the Follow-up evaluation, participants will&#xD;
      complete a brief survey and undergo repeat testing for gonorrhea/chlamydia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Survey: Participants will complete a brief follow-up survey assessing the actual&#xD;
      notification and treatment outcome for all of their recent partners generally and each of&#xD;
      their three most recent partners specifically, as well as factors that impeded and/or&#xD;
      promoted partner notification and treatment. Participants will be asked to specify whether&#xD;
      each partner was notified, whether they received antibiotic treatment and/or sought HIV/STI&#xD;
      testing, the participant's degree of certainty of the outcomes, and the reasons why each&#xD;
      partner was or was not notified and/or treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Specimen Collection: Samples of urine, rectal and pharyngeal swabs will be collected as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Physical Examination: The study physician will conduct a brief physical examination and&#xD;
      clinical history to assess for signs or symptoms of STIs, including urethritis, proctitis,&#xD;
      and genital ulcer disease. During the physical examination, the study physician will obtain&#xD;
      swabs of the rectum and oropharynx. While performing the pharyngeal exam, the physician will&#xD;
      use a new Aptima GenProbe collection kit to obtain a swab of the tonsillar pillars. While&#xD;
      performing the rectal examination, the physician will use a new Aptima GenProbe collection&#xD;
      kit to obtain a swab of the anorectal canal. Participants will also be given the option to&#xD;
      self-collect the rectal swab specimen. No urethral swab will be obtained for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from the physical exam and clinical history will be recorded on a Case Report Form&#xD;
      (CRF) and identified by the participant's numeric study code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Specimen Collection: Following physical examination, participants will be asked to provide a&#xD;
      urine sample. Participants will also be instructed in how to collect a 20 mL clean,&#xD;
      first-catch urine specimen in a sterile container.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. Laboratory Testing: All samples will be tested for the presence of Gonorrhea and&#xD;
      Chlamydia at the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit Laboratory. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      return to the study site in 14 days for results of repeat Gonorrhea and Chlamydia testing.&#xD;
      Participants with recurrent or persistent infection will receive a second course of treatment&#xD;
      according to the treatment protocol described above. All participants with recurrent or&#xD;
      persistent infection will receive additional counseling on the importance of partner&#xD;
      notification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the possibility of fluoroquinolone-resistant gonorrhea infection, participants treated&#xD;
      with Ciprofloxacin will be informed of the high frequency of Ciprofloxacin resistance and&#xD;
      study staff will emphasize with all participants, but with these participants in particular,&#xD;
      the importance of returning to the study site to receive results of their repeat testing/test&#xD;
      of cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. Confirmation of Partner Notification: In order to provide independent confirmation of&#xD;
      participant-reported notification status, study staff will ask participants for permission to&#xD;
      conduct third party partner notification and confirmation of reported notification status.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked for permission to contact their recent partner(s) by telephone or&#xD;
      e-mail to confirm the notification outcome. Subjects will be informed that they are not&#xD;
      obligated to provide contact information for any of their partners. Subjects will also be&#xD;
      informed that if they provide contact information for their partner(s), study staff will&#xD;
      contact the person using the contact information provided and notify the person only that&#xD;
      someone they recently had sex with has been diagnosed with an STI, provide information on&#xD;
      local sites offering free or low cost testing for HIV and STIs, and answer any questions the&#xD;
      partner might have. Subjects will be informed that study staff will not reveal the&#xD;
      participant's name or other identifying information to their partner(s). If the participant&#xD;
      provides contact information for their partner(s), study staff will contact the person and&#xD;
      provide third-party partner notification using an IRB-approved script. After completing the&#xD;
      partner notification process, study staff will ask the partner only if they had previously&#xD;
      been notified by a partner about an STI diagnosis (&quot;Yes/No&quot;). Partners will not be asked for&#xD;
      any additional information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XI. Qualitative Evaluation. A randomly selected subgroup of participants in the EPT&#xD;
      Intervention Protocol will be invited to participate in individual interviews about the&#xD;
      partner notification process. Each participant will be asked to participate in two&#xD;
      interviews, one following randomization and one following the Follow-up Visit. Participants&#xD;
      will complete a separate informed consent process for the individual interviews and will&#xD;
      receive additional compensation for their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XII. Eligibility. A randomly selected subset of participants from the EPT intervention&#xD;
      protocol will be invited to participate in the individual qualitative interviews. Every&#xD;
      fourth participant randomized will be invited to participate in an individual interview until&#xD;
      reaching the projected qualitative study sample of 20 participants (10 each from the&#xD;
      intervention and control arms). Participants will be asked to complete a separate informed&#xD;
      consent document indicating their willingness to participate in a qualitative interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XIII. Interview Conduct. Interviews will be conducted in Spanish in a private room by a&#xD;
      trained interviewer. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed verbatim. Participants will&#xD;
      be advised that they can stop the interview at any time and that they will be able to stop&#xD;
      the tape and erase any response during the interview if they desire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XIV. Interview Content: Baseline interviews will focus on individual decision-making&#xD;
      processes regarding partner notification in specific partnership contexts with a focus on the&#xD;
      influence of: STI-related stigma and shame; the gender and sexual identity of participants&#xD;
      and their partner(s); perceived power differentials within the partnership(s); patterns of&#xD;
      communication within the partnership(s); and structural access to testing and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up interviews will discuss actual notification and treatment outcomes. Follow-up&#xD;
      interviews will emphasize: barriers or catalysts to implementing notification decisions in&#xD;
      specific partnership contexts; the impact of EPT on partner notification practices; practical&#xD;
      and logistical issues related to delivery of EPT; structural access to partner testing and&#xD;
      treatment within local social, cultural, and economic contexts; and the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      study's quantitative outcomes in accurately measuring participants' lived experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each interview is expected to last approximately 20-30 minutes. Audio recordings and&#xD;
      transcripts of interviews will be identified by the participant's numeric study code and the&#xD;
      date of the interview.&#xD;
