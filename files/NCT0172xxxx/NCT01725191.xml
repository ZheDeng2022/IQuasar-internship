  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of tivantinib in treating younger&#xD;
      patients with solid tumors that have returned after a period of improvement or have not&#xD;
      responded to treatment. Tivantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of tivantinib&#xD;
      administered orally twice daily to children with refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define and describe the toxicities of tivantinib administered on this schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of tivantinib (capsule as well as powder&#xD;
      formulation) in children with refractory cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of tivantinib within the confines of a&#xD;
      phase 1 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To preliminarily investigate whether cytochrome P450 (CYP450) polymorphisms impact&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics or toxicity of tivantinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To preliminarily investigate whether tumor c-Met and/or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)&#xD;
      expression or downstream c-Met signaling correlate with clinical response to tivantinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tivantinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;
