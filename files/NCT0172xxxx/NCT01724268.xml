      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation of the&#xD;
      joints and of the tissues around the joints, as well as in other organs in the body. Early&#xD;
      diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and early aggressive treatment can help prevent joint&#xD;
      damage, deformity and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of RA rests on several principles; drug treatment, which comprise disease&#xD;
      modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS), but also non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
      (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids (GCs), as well as non-pharmacological measures, such as&#xD;
      physical, occupational and psychological therapeutic approaches, together may lead to&#xD;
      therapeutic success. However, the mainstay of RA treatment is the application of DMARDs.&#xD;
      Methotrexate (MTX) is the anchor drug in the management of RA and has been used for many&#xD;
      decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New and highly effective DMARDS have continued to emerge until the most recent years- in&#xD;
      particular, biologic agents which target tumor necrosis factor, the interleukin 1 (IL -1)&#xD;
      receptor, the IL-6 receptor, B lymphocytes and T cell co-stimulation. Furthermore, treatment&#xD;
      strategies have changed during this period, initially by calling for early referral and early&#xD;
      institution of DMARD treatment on the basis of respective evidence of clinical efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EULAR (EUROPEAN LEAGUE AGAINST RHEUMATISM) recommendations for treatment of rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis (3) emphasize that treatment should be aimed at reaching the target of remission or&#xD;
      low disease activity (DAS 28 score ≤ 3.2) as soon as possible in every patient; as long as&#xD;
      the target has not been reached, treatment should be adjusted by frequent (every 1-3 months)&#xD;
      and strict monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTX (1) should be part of the first treatment strategy in patients with active RA and when&#xD;
      MTX contraindications (or intolerance) are present, other DMARDs should be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCs (1) added at low to moderately high doses to synthetic DMARD monotherapy (or combinations&#xD;
      of synthetic DMARDs) provide benefit as initial short-term treatment, but should be tapered&#xD;
      as rapidly as clinically feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a systematic review (4), GCs were found to be effective in relieving signs and symptoms&#xD;
      and inhibiting radiographic progression, either as monotherapy or combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients responding insufficiently to MTX and/or other synthetic DMARDs with or without&#xD;
      GCs, biological DMARDs should be started (1); current practice would be to start a TNF&#xD;
      inhibitor (adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab or infliximab) which should be&#xD;
      combined with MTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most of the studies which included GCs in the management of RA, it was included at the&#xD;
      beginning of the study (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent trial (2), Inclusion of low-dose prednisone from the start into a two-year&#xD;
      MTX-based tight control treatment strategy for early RA increases both effectiveness (i.e.&#xD;
      disease activity variables) and outcome (i.e. erosive joint damage) without increasing&#xD;
      toxicity. It also reduces the need for (early) treatment with biologicals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anti TNF treatment is expensive and carries the risk of infection. To our knowledge,&#xD;
      there is no study comparing the addition of small doses of steroids of steroids to the&#xD;
      addition of anti TNF in patients who failed or did not tolerate the 25 mg of MTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have designed this study to compare the efficacy of adding small doses of&#xD;
      prednisolone (10 mg) daily to the efficacy of adding one of the available anti TNF in&#xD;
      patients who did not achieve remission on maximum tolerated MTX dose (up to 25 mg).&#xD;
