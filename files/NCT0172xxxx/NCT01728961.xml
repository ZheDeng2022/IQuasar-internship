      The purpose of this study is to see if taking nevirapine (NVP) for HIV changes the way&#xD;
      artemether/lumefantrine (AL) works in children who are co-infected with both HIV and malaria.&#xD;
      The brand of AL used in this study is Coartem® Dispersible. This study will compare the blood&#xD;
      levels of AL in co-infected children who already take NVP prescribed by their doctor with the&#xD;
      co-infected children who do not take anti HIV medicines because they do not meet national&#xD;
      guidelines to start them. The study will also assess the safety of using both medications (AL&#xD;
      and NVP) in children.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Malaria and HIV are among the two most important global health problems of our time. Malaria&#xD;
      accounts for up to 3 million deaths each year, of which 90% occur in Africa where malaria is&#xD;
      the leading cause of mortality in young children. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT)&#xD;
      are the mainstay of antimalarial therapy throughout much of the world, yet pediatric&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data on the most widely adopted ACT regimen, artemether/lumefantrine (AL) are&#xD;
      lacking. Of equal importance is the assessment of key drug-drug interactions in HIV&#xD;
      co-infected children as ARVs are known to affect the metabolic enzyme activity responsible&#xD;
      for ACT elimination. This study proposes to investigate the drug-drug interaction between the&#xD;
      antimalarial artemether/lumefantrine and nevirapine based antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for&#xD;
      HIV in children co-infected in resource limited settings.&#xD;

             sterilization procedure (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or salpingotomy). If the&#xD;
