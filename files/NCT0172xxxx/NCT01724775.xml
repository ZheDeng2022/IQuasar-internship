  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2009, Prof. Hohenberger proposed complete mesocolic excision (CME) as standardized, in&#xD;
      which the same principle of TME in rectal cancer has been applied to the colon. More and more&#xD;
      surgeons pay attention to the rationality of this surgical approach. However, the clinical&#xD;
      application researches are still few, in particular the prospective controlled study is still&#xD;
      none. This clinical trial will compare the CME group and non-CME group to evaluate the&#xD;
      outcome and safety of CME for apply in clinic.&#xD;

      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients with colon cancer will undergo elective radical operation. The observations&#xD;
      were recorded during the operation and on the postoperative specimens. Intra-operative&#xD;
      photographs were taken at various stages, as were photographs of the postoperative specimen.&#xD;
      According to the CME operation keypoints, all the photographs will accept third-party&#xD;
      assessment of the expert group, while the third-party expert group will not participate in&#xD;
      the management of patients. Both of The evaluators and research doctors are double-blind&#xD;
      state. The postoperative patients will divided into two groups according to the results of&#xD;
      the assessment. The clinical and pathological data of the patients as well as follow-up&#xD;
      information will be recorded and collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Outcome of CME By comparison to clinicopathologic variables, and precise tissues&#xD;
           morphometry of two groups, the prognosis, lymph nodes harvest and removal of the&#xD;
           mesocolic area were investigated. Outcomes of interest also include disease-free&#xD;
           survival, local recurrence-free survival, recurrence rate. In addition, we analyzed the&#xD;
           correlation between mesocolic area and height, weight, body surface area and body mass&#xD;
           index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety of CME CME group and non-CME group were compared the differences of security,&#xD;
           included operation time, blood loss, postoperation complications, flatus restoring time,&#xD;
           defecation restoring time, drainage removal time, Diet restoring time, drainage volume&#xD;
           in three days after surgery, hospital deaths, the exhaust time, hospitalization time and&#xD;
           hospitalization costs. In addition, the feasibility of CME techniques as the surgical&#xD;
           approach of choice for elderly patients was also evaluated.&#xD;
