  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary care centres are a key setting to treat people with overweight and moderate obesity.&#xD;
      There is growing evidence that sitting for a long time is negatively associated with people's&#xD;
      health. Interventions with the aim of reducing daily time of sedentary activities can be an&#xD;
      effective strategy to increase daily energy expenditure. To improve the effectiveness of&#xD;
      programmes promoting physical activity in primary care we need some clear action protocols&#xD;
      that can be easily integrated in the daily routines of primary care professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. The objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a six-moth primary&#xD;
      care intervention to reduce diary hours of sitting time in overweight and obese sedentary&#xD;
      patients, as well as to increase their weekly caloric spend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. The design of the study is a simple randomized controlled trial. Ten primary care&#xD;
      centers will be invited to participate and will be randomized into control (CG) and&#xD;
      intervention group (IG). Each professional will randomly invite to participate voluntarily&#xD;
      moderate obese or overweight patients (BMI: 25-34,9 kg/m2) of both sexes, aged between 25 and&#xD;
      65 years old, who are 6 or more than 6 hours daily sitting. A total of 400 subjects (200&#xD;
      individuals in each group) are needed. In addition, 50 subjects with fibromyalgia will be&#xD;
      included in the study to know the feasibility of the intervention among them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main dependent variable (sitting times) will be measured with an ActivPAL during first&#xD;
      and last intervention week. There will be a follow up after 3, 6 and 12 months of the end of&#xD;
      the intervention. Other variables included in the study: number of steps walked, subjective&#xD;
      level of physical activity, weight, height, BMI, skinfolds, waist circumference,&#xD;
      triglycerides, total cholesterol, (LDL and HDL), glucose, sociodemographic variables, blood&#xD;
      pressure and quality of life related to health. A descriptive analysis of all variables and a&#xD;
      multivariate analysis to assess differences among intervention and control group will be&#xD;
      undertaken. Multivariate analysis will be carried out to assess time changes of dependent&#xD;
      variables. All the analysis will be done under the intention to treat principle.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention will be based on a recommendation to find alternatives to progressively&#xD;
      substitute Sitting time by doing the regular activities standing or walking. Control group&#xD;
      will receive minimum advice.&#xD;
