  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of intravitreal aflibercept (anti-VEGF therapy) in patients&#xD;
      with a type of macular degeneration known as vascularized pigment epithelial detachment.&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown a generally poor outcome in treating this difficult to treat form&#xD;
      of wet macular degeneration. More recently, multiple pilot studies have shown positive&#xD;
      benefits to using anti-VEGF therapy. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      treating vascularize pigment epithelial detachment associated with wet macular degeneration&#xD;
      with intravitreal aflibercept injection.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is ≥ 50 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is willing to participate in this study and to follow the criteria and&#xD;
             protocol of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study eye is treatment naïve regarding treatment of neovascular AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is not involved with another clinical study currently.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is willing to follow the protocol outlined in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand the informed consent and willingness to sign the informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a submacular vascularized or fibrovascular PED. The investigator must&#xD;
             search for the characteristic features of a vascularized PED summarized here:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A notch of irregularity associated with an orange-yellow round, oval, or&#xD;
                  bean-shaped elevation of the RPE with a smooth, convex surface is seen on&#xD;
                  examination and fundus photography (FP). Fluorescein angiography (FA) shows&#xD;
                  uniform staining of the PED with a well-defined margin, and more intense staining&#xD;
                  (hot-spot) for the focus of the CNV.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A fibrovascular PED with occult neovascularization typically shows stippled&#xD;
                  hyperfluorescence in the early phase with increasing hyperfluorescent staining&#xD;
                  and leakage in later phases of FA and a variable surrounding margin. There may be&#xD;
                  RPE folds.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Regarding PED with a component of retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP), the&#xD;
                  early features on FP including intraretinal neovascularization (IRN) frequently&#xD;
                  with adjacent small retinal hemorrhages in its lateral expansion in an&#xD;
                  irregularly stellate pattern before the development of retinal-choroidal&#xD;
                  anastomosis and the eventual PED in the later phases. The investigator is&#xD;
                  required to perform indocyanine-green (ICG) angiography at baseline to establish&#xD;
                  a RAP lesion and to rule-out polypoidal vasculopathy lesions, since the FA images&#xD;
                  may not be distinct.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. The investigator must also search for other features associated with a PED&#xD;
                  indicating the presence of a vascular component, i.e. hemorrhage, exudates,&#xD;
                  and/or chorioretinal folds.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. The investigator must confirm the presence of a PED on FA/FP and OCT. Spectral&#xD;
                  Domain OCT will be utilized. Specifically, the Spectralis OCT manufactured by&#xD;
                  Heidleberg to maintain uniformity for all the sites. The PED height, SA, GLD, and&#xD;
                  volume will be measured from the OCT images. The characteristic OCT findings of&#xD;
                  the vascularized PED must be confirmed, including a distinct elevation of the&#xD;
                  highly hyperreflective RPE layer with mild backscattering of the underlying&#xD;
                  choroidal layer in the portion of the PED without any CNV. For the portion of the&#xD;
                  PED with underlying CNV, typical OCT findings consist of moderate&#xD;
                  hyperreflectivity contiguous to the overlying markedly hyperreflective detached&#xD;
                  RPE corresponding to the CNV that usually extends to the choroidal layer. Besides&#xD;
                  the OCT characteristics confirmation must be made on the FP/FA images of the&#xD;
                  vascularized PED, as outlined above in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Central foveal involvement by the PED or the CNV due to age-related macular&#xD;
             degeneration (AMD). The CNV may be classic, occult, or mixed, as long as it is&#xD;
             associated with a PED. The CNV may be within the PED or adjacent to the margin of the&#xD;
             PED.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PED ≤ 12 disc area in size.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BCVA with ETDRS of ≥ 19 letters and ≤ 73 letters (20/400 to 20/40).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of submacular fluid outside or surrounding the PED.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surface area of the submacular hemorrhage needs to be &lt; 50% of the entire PED.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Submacular fibrosis needs to be &lt; 50% of the entire PED.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sufficiently clear media (cornea, anterior chamber, lens, vitreous) for OCT, FA and&#xD;
             FP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intraocular pressure (IOP) of 25mmHg or less in the study eye, with or without use of&#xD;
             ocular hypotensive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment of neovascular AMD or any other forms of neovascularization in the&#xD;
             fellow eye, including anti-VEGF or other forms of therapy targeted specifically for&#xD;
             the fellow eye does not exclude the fellow eye from enrollment in this study. Prior&#xD;
             focal corticosteroid treatment is allowed, as long as there is a lack of involvement&#xD;
             of the study eye. However prior (within 90 days of Day 0) or current systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroid therapy (oral or intravenous corticosteroid treatment) is not&#xD;
             permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior treatment of neovascular AMD in eye for proposed enrollment (non-naïve eye),&#xD;
             including previous anti-vascular endothelial factor (anti-VEGF) therapy, photodynamic&#xD;
             therapy (PDT), radiation therapy, corticosteroid treatment, surgical treatment for&#xD;
             CNV, thermal laser treatment, and any other prior treatment for neovascular AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known serious allergies to aflibercept, fluorescein dye, drugs for pupillary dilation,&#xD;
             topical anesthetic, sterilizing solution (e.g. Betadine Solution).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any condition (including inability to read visual acuity charts, or language barrier)&#xD;
             that may preclude subjects ability to comply with the study protocol and requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any advanced systemic condition or end-stage disease, advanced Alzheimer&#xD;
             Syndrome, end-stage cancer, etc., which will likely prevent subject from completing&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous therapeutic radiation in the region of the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tear in study eye.&#xD;

             glaucoma, optic neuritis, optic neuropathy, or atrophy, marked macular atrophy, ocular&#xD;
             vascular occlusion, history of retinal detachment, uveitis, viral or other forms of&#xD;
             chorioretinitis, etc.&#xD;

&#xD;
