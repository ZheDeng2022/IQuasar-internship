    <textblock>
      Background and Rationale Research studies have shown that patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (T2DM) who lose weight have better glucose control and less risk for heart disease. It has&#xD;
      been difficult to achieve these results in a non-research setting. Meal replacements (MR) are&#xD;
      pre-packaged meals with appropriate calories and nutrients that enhance adherence to a weight&#xD;
      loss program by reducing decision-making and facilitating target caloric intake. The&#xD;
      University of Southern California (USC) arm of the NIH funded Look AHEAD study at Roybal&#xD;
      Clinic has demonstrated acceptability and success of MRs in conjunction with a structured&#xD;
      lifestyle modification program in achieving weight loss in underserved Hispanic T2DM&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Our short-term objective is to determine the efficacy, safety and feasibility of a&#xD;
      3-month full MR program in conjunction with a 1 year standardized lifestyle modification&#xD;
      program in a clinic setting. Our longer-term goal is to acquire data for sample size and&#xD;
      power estimates for a larger NIH- or other funded prospective, randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methodology A 1-year, prospective trial study of 30 obese subjects with T2DM treated&#xD;
      with insulin randomized to 2 groups: standard care (SC) or Meal Replacement group (MR). The&#xD;
      SC will receive usual care at Roybal Diabetes Management Clinic (DMC). The MR will receive&#xD;
      MRs and a lifestyle course in addition to the usual clinical care at the Roybal DMC. Phase 1&#xD;
      consists of 3-months 1200 -1400cal diet using full MR. Phase 2 consists of a 3-month&#xD;
      transition to the same caloric intake using regular meals and 1 MR/day . Phase 3 consists of&#xD;
      a 6-month weight loss maintenance period with 1 MR/day. This will be about 1400-1600&#xD;
      calories/day for women and 1800 to 2000 calories/day for men. Individual and group&#xD;
      educational, support and counseling visits will be components of all 3 phases of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Efficacy of the program will be determined by weight, waist measurement and waist to&#xD;
      hip ratio, blood pressure, HbA1c, lipids, and medication use at baseline and at 3, 6, 9 and&#xD;
      12 months. These are all measurements that are done routinely in these patients. Safety will&#xD;
      be determined by monitoring of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis We will compare the outcomes between the SC and MR at 0,3,6,9 and 12 months to&#xD;
      determine if there is evidence that the intervention improves outcomes and is safe.&#xD;
