  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will receive the vaccine subcutaneously every 3 weeks x 3 with optional yearly&#xD;
      booster vaccines up to and including 5 years post last vaccine for those patients who are&#xD;
      confirmed responders to the vaccine . The rationale for using Poly-ICLC as an adjuvant are&#xD;
      two ongoing trials at University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) of the MUC1 100mer&#xD;
      peptide vaccine - one as a therapeutic vaccine in subjects with metastatic castrate resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer and the other in subjects with advanced colonic adenomas at risk for&#xD;
      developing colon cancer. The same formulation, MUC1 100mer peptide admixed with Poly-ICLC, is&#xD;
      used in both trials. There has been no toxicity observed and the vaccine is highly&#xD;
      immunogenic in early disease. In the proposed NSCLC trial the anti-MUC1 immune response will&#xD;
      be thoroughly characterized.&#xD;

             a negative pregnancy test&#xD;
