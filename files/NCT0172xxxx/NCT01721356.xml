  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emotional Intelligence (EI) is defined as the ability to accurately perceive and identify&#xD;
      emotions in oneself and others, understand and use emotions to enhance cognitive processes,&#xD;
      and effectively manage one's own emotions as well as those of others. Two major approaches to&#xD;
      the construct of emotional intelligence have emerged. These two approaches can be broadly&#xD;
      defined as the Trait and Ability Approaches. The Trait Approach, which is typically assessed&#xD;
      via self-report measures such as that Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory, appears to be&#xD;
      strongly related to existing models of personality and coping. The other major approach to EI&#xD;
      follows an Ability Model, assuming that EI is similar to but distinct from other types of&#xD;
      cognitive intelligence, and involves measurement of a variety of skills and abilities related&#xD;
      to emotional processing. An understanding of the neurobiological substrate of emotional&#xD;
      intelligence is beginning to emerge. One influential theory that is particularly relevant to&#xD;
      the neurobiology of emotional intelligence is the &quot;somatic marker hypothesis,&quot; yet there&#xD;
      still remains a limited understanding of the neurobiological basis of EI. The proposed&#xD;
      investigation will attempt to provide the most comprehensive study to date examining the&#xD;
      behavioral, psychological, functional, and brain structural correlates of EI. The proposed&#xD;
      study will use neuroimaging techniques to examine the relationship between current measures&#xD;
      of EI, behavioral expression of emotionally competent capacities, brain functional responses,&#xD;
      and structural cerebral organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific questions to be addressed and their associated hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The two major approaches to EI (i.e., Trait vs. Ability) will show only modest, though&#xD;
           significant positive correlations with one another.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. EI Trait measures will be highly correlated with measures of personality but weakly&#xD;
           correlated with specific skills such as facial affect identification, emotional&#xD;
           decision-making, and affectively based judgments, whereas EI Ability measures will&#xD;
           correlate more highly with specific emotional skill measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. During functional MRI affective challenge tasks, EI scores will be negatively correlated&#xD;
           with activity within the Somatic Marker Circuitry suggested by Damasio and colleagues&#xD;
           (i.e., ventromedial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, insular cortex), as suggested by the&#xD;
           neural efficiency hypothesis.&#xD;

        Between 70 and 80 healthy, English speaking, right-handed, adults between the ages of 18&#xD;
        and 45 participated. Attempts were made to include equal numbers of men and women to permit&#xD;
        the broadest generalization to the population and to permit direct assessment of gender&#xD;
        effects, an issue that has received considerable attention recently regarding the&#xD;
        neurobiology of affective processes. Subjects were not excluded on the basis of ethnicity,&#xD;
        gender, or sexual orientation. Healthy participants were recruited via local&#xD;
        advertisements, including email broadcasts such as the Harvard Hospital and Partners&#xD;
        Healthcare systems, internet advertisements, and posting of IRB-approved flyers in various&#xD;
        community centers. IRB-approved print advertisements were posted in local newspapers.&#xD;
