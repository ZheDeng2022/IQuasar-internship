  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blinded study. Subjects enrolled will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to receive either active treatments for axillary hyperhidrosis with the&#xD;
      Ulthera System in both axillas, or sham treatments, also with the Ulthera System but with the&#xD;
      energy settings on the device set to deliver no ultrasound energy. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio, with 2 subjects randomized to active treatment for every one&#xD;
      subject randomized to sham treatment. Subjects will receive 2 study treatments 30 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and study personnel conducting efficacy measures will be blinded to the assigned&#xD;
      treatment groups. The study hypothesis is that subjects in the active treatment group will&#xD;
      have a greater reduction in underarm sweating compared to those in the sham group as measured&#xD;
      by a quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo follow-up assessments at 14 days and 30 days from the date of their&#xD;
      first study treatment, and 14 days, 30 days, 3 months and 6 months from the date of their&#xD;
      second study treatment. Subjects in the active treatment group will also undergo follow-up&#xD;
      assessments at 9 months and 12 months from the date of their second study treatment.&#xD;
