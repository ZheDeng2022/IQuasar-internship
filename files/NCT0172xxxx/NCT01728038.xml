  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 6.6 million parents who smoke visit pediatric emergency departments (PED)&#xD;
      annually. Up to 50% of these parental smokers are from low-income, racially/ethnically&#xD;
      diverse households in which a variety of tobacco-related disparities (TRD) exist for both the&#xD;
      parents and their children. The PED is an ideal setting in which to address these&#xD;
      disparities, which include differences in tobacco use, pediatric second hand smoke exposure&#xD;
      (SHSe), quit rates, access to cessation resources, and morbidity such as cancer. The team has&#xD;
      conducted the only two small-scale randomized control trials (RCTs) investigating the&#xD;
      efficacy of providing smoking cessation counseling to parents in the PED setting. This&#xD;
      previous research indicates that parental smokers who visit the PED are aware of the&#xD;
      pediatric effects of SHSe, motivated to quit, eager to receive cessation counseling in this&#xD;
      setting, and show trends towards quitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents with children who have a SHSe-related illness will have higher prolonged abstinence&#xD;
      and point prevalence cessation rates, higher motivation to quit, greater number of quit&#xD;
      attempts, and lower child SHSe compared to those parents who have a child with a&#xD;
      non-SHSe-related illness at baseline.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The long-range goal of my research is to test PED-based cessation interventions that are&#xD;
      readily translated into practice in large, multi-center trials. However, before this can&#xD;
      occur, preliminary data are needed, including analyses of: (1) the types of cessation&#xD;
      intervention components that low-income parental smokers regard as essential to their&#xD;
      cessation success; (2) perceived organizational barriers to the sustainability of the&#xD;
      intervention after the study period ends which will impede translation into practice; (3)&#xD;
      factors associated with parental cessation outcomes such as the presence of an acute&#xD;
      SHSe-related chief complaint in the child; and (4) the effect size of the intervention. This&#xD;
      data will be used to develop a parental cessation intervention that is tailored to low-income&#xD;
      parents who are likely to quit. Data from the proposed project will be used in a RO1&#xD;
      application to test the efficacy of this cessation intervention in a large, multi-center&#xD;
      randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed developmental study will be conducted in three phases. During Phase I, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct focused interviews of PED nurses, physicians, and hospital&#xD;
      administrators to explore barriers to intervention sustainability that will assist in future&#xD;
      intervention planning. During Phase II, The investigators will conduct a pilot prospective&#xD;
      trial to examine the effectiveness of this screening, brief intervention, and assisted&#xD;
      referral to treatment (SBIRT) intervention on parental smoking cessation. Equal numbers of&#xD;
      parental smokers who bring their child to the PED for either a SHSe-related illness or non&#xD;
      SHSe-related illness will be given a brief intervention using an adapted form of the Clinical&#xD;
      Practice Guidelines: Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence. Intervention components may include&#xD;
      brief cessation counseling using an &quot;Advise, Assess, and Assist&quot; approach; information on&#xD;
      SHSe in children; direct connection to the Quitline (QL) in the ED; and/or free&#xD;
      administration of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). The Health Belief Model will be used to&#xD;
      explore whether factors unique to this setting (e.g., child's acute illness) moderate the&#xD;
      effect of the intervention on cessation outcomes. Outcomes will be assessed following the&#xD;
      intervention via phone, email, or text messaging, based on parental preference. In Phase III&#xD;
      we will explore the feasibility of a pilot study to collect, send, analyze, and store child&#xD;
      saliva samples in twenty five children whose parents consent to the study. The same PED-based&#xD;
      SBIRT cessation intervention will be given to these parental smokers as in Specific Aim 2,&#xD;
      however, only English-speaking parents and parents of children who are 0-5 years of age who&#xD;
      present to the PED with SHSe-related illnesses will be asked if they agree to have their&#xD;
      child participate in this baseline and then 1-month after baseline, saliva sample collection.&#xD;
      These saliva samples will be analyzed to assess child cotinine levels at baseline and again&#xD;
      at 1 month after the SBIRT cessation intervention. Leftover saliva will be stored and frozen&#xD;
      indefinitely for possible future research, if parents consent.&#xD;
