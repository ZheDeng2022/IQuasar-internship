  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a great need for new therapies for carcinomas that have progressed on or not&#xD;
      responded to current therapy. There are no approved Met targeted agents in standard clinical&#xD;
      use. In the population of subjects with advanced carcinomas that are unresponsive to standard&#xD;
      of care, and based on the relatively safe, reversible and monitorable toxicity profile of&#xD;
      ASLAN002 in non clinical studies, the potential for benefit from ASLAN002 outweighs the&#xD;
      potential risks for toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose of ASLAN002 in subjects&#xD;
      with advanced or metastatic solid tumours, as well as to define the overall safety profile of&#xD;
      ASLAN002.&#xD;

      The purpose of the study is&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ASLAN002 in subjects with advanced or&#xD;
           metastatic solid tumours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the overall safety profile of ASLAN002&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effects of ASLAN002 on overall cardiac function as measured by blood&#xD;
           pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and left ventricular&#xD;
           function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASLAN002 and its N-oxide metabolite,&#xD;
           following single and multiple dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide a preliminary assessment of anti-tumour activity, as assessed by the Overall&#xD;
           Response Rate (ORR) and changes from baseline in tumour size&#xD;
