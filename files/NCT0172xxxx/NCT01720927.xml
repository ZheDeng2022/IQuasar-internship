      GABHS are common etiological agents for acute pharyngitis. However, local data is limited and&#xD;
      large scale surveillance studies have not been done. This study aims to evaluate the disease&#xD;
      burden in the community due to GABHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients presenting with signs of acute pharyngitis will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Patients with fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be tested for Rapid Antigen Detection&#xD;
      test (RADT)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pharyngitis is a common reason for patients' visit to doctors. Group A beta- hemolytic&#xD;
      streptococci (GABHS) account for 15-30 percent of cases of acute pharyngitis in children and&#xD;
      5 to 20 percent in adults1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the signs and symptoms of GABHS pharyngitis overlap extensively with other infectious&#xD;
      causes, making a diagnosis based solely on clinical findings is difficult. In patients with&#xD;
      acute febrile respiratory illness, physicians accurately differentiate bacterial from viral&#xD;
      infections using only the history and physical findings about one half of the time.2 No&#xD;
      single element of the patient's history or physical examination reliably confirms or excludes&#xD;
      GABHS pharyngitis.3 Sore throat, fever with sudden onset (temperature greater than 100.4° F&#xD;
      [38° C]), and exposure to Streptococcus within the preceding two weeks suggest GABHS&#xD;
      infection. Cervical node lymphadenopathy and pharyngeal or tonsillar inflammation or exudates&#xD;
      are common signs. Palatal petechiae and scarlatiniform rash are highly specific but uncommon;&#xD;
      a swollen uvula is sometimes noted. Cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and diarrhea are more&#xD;
      common with viral pharyngitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original Centor score uses four signs and symptoms to estimate the probability of acute&#xD;
      streptococcal pharyngitis in adults with a sore throat.4 The score was later modified by&#xD;
      adding age and validated in 600 adults and children.5,6 The cumulative score determines the&#xD;
      likelihood of streptococcal pharyngitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid Antigen Detection Tests (RADTs) have been developed for the identification of GABHS&#xD;
      directly from throat swabs. Although these rapid tests are more expensive than blood agar&#xD;
      culture, they provide results faster. Rapid identification and treatment of patients with&#xD;
      streptococcal pharyngitis can reduce the risk of the spread of group A b-hemolytic&#xD;
      streptococci, allowing the patient to return to school or work sooner, and can reduce the&#xD;
      acute morbidity associated with the illness. The use of RADTs for certain populations (e.g.,&#xD;
      patients in emergency departments) has been shown to significantly increase the number of&#xD;
      patients who are appropriately treated for streptococcal pharyngitis, compared with use of&#xD;
      traditional throat cultures.7&#xD;
&#xD;
      The great majority of the RADTs that are currently available have an excellent specificity of&#xD;
      95%, compared with blood agar plate culture. This means that false-positive test results are&#xD;
      unusual, and, therefore, therapeutic decisions can be made with confidence on the basis of a&#xD;
      positive test result. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of most of these tests is 80%-90%, or&#xD;
      even lower, compared with blood agar plate culture. It has been suggested that most of the&#xD;
      false-negative RADT results occur for patients who are merely Streptococcus carriers and are&#xD;
      not truly infected. However, early studies of first-generation RADTs demonstrated that a&#xD;
      large proportion of patients with false-negative RADT results were truly infected with group&#xD;
      A b-hemolytic streptococci and were not merely carriers.8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute pharyngitis is commonly encountered in clinics and hospitals across Pakistan. It is&#xD;
      common not only in children but also among adults. Limited data are available on the&#xD;
      prevalence of this condition and existing data are from small single center based studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The available data from Pakistan suggest that the most common bacterial organism is GABHS,&#xD;
      however, majority of throat swabs did not yield any isolate.9 The signs and symptoms of GABHS&#xD;
      pharyngitis overlap extensively with other infectious causes, thus to make an etiologic&#xD;
      diagnosis based solely on clinical findings is difficult. Improving diagnosis of bacterial&#xD;
      causes of pharyngitis will lead to more rational use of antibiotics among clinicians, and&#xD;
      potentially have a positive impact on the development of bacterial resistance in community&#xD;
      acquired infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modified Centor score is a valid tool to estimate the probability of acute streptococcal&#xD;
      pharyngitis in patients with a sore throat. (reference) Patients with a score of zero or 1&#xD;
      are at very low risk for streptococcal pharyngitis and do not require testing (i.e., throat&#xD;
      culture or rapid antigen detection testing [RADT]) or antibiotic therapy. Patients with a&#xD;
      score of 2 or 3 should be tested using RADT or throat culture; positive results warrant&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy. Patients with a score of 4 or higher are at high risk of streptococcal&#xD;
      pharyngitis, and empiric treatment may be considered. (reference)&#xD;
&#xD;
      RADT allows for earlier treatment, symptom improvement, and reduced disease spread.&#xD;
