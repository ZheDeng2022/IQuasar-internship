  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      THAR2011-1 is a Phase I, single dose, open-label dose-escalation study to determine the&#xD;
      safety, absolute bioavailability, dose proportionality, and pharmacokinetics of T121 in&#xD;
      healthy postmenopausal women. The study is expected to identify a safe dose that can be&#xD;
      further tested in subsequent multiple dose studies comparing the safety, PK and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of T121 with the currently marketed IV zoledronic acid (Zometa).&#xD;

    <description>Pharmacokinetic parameters will include maximum serum concentration (Cmax), time corresponding to the occurrence of maximum serum concentration (tmax), area under the serum concentration-time curve from zero to the last observed quantifiable concentration (AUCtlast), area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC), terminal exponential half-life (t1/2,z), absolute bioavailability, cumulative amount recovered in urine (Ae) and renal clearance (CLr).</description>

    <time_frame>7 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be assessed by the number and severity of adverse events (AE) and changes in clinical laboratory safety parameters and vital signs from pre to post dose in each dose group. The frequency, severity and type of AEs between the dose groups will also be assessed. AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03; June 14, 2010).</description>
