    <textblock>
      Resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins through the acquisition and expression of&#xD;
      Extended-Spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) among Enterobacteriacea is increasing. The clinical&#xD;
      implications of ESBLs are extremely serious and sensitive diagnostic methods are urgently&#xD;
      needed to guide therapy, monitor resistance development and implement intervention&#xD;
      strategies. Conventionally, detection of expression of ESBLs was based on reduction of&#xD;
      ceftazidime of cefotaxime MICs by ≥ 3 two fold dilutions in the presence of clavulanic acid.&#xD;
      However, the use of the above method was limited to cover only some of the bacterial species,&#xD;
      including predominantly E. coli and Klebsiella spp., or tested strains which were all&#xD;
      transconjugants generated in vitro. ESBLs are now reported in a growing number of genera&#xD;
      other than E. coli or Klebsiella spp., and Serratia marcescens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbapenems, including ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem, are the drugs of choice used for&#xD;
      severe ESBL-producing bacterial infections. Failure to detect ESBL at the presence of AmpC&#xD;
      β-lactamase might result in an important clinical concern because 4th generation&#xD;
      cephalosporins, which are stable to AmpC β-lactamase, is not a drug of choice for severe&#xD;
      infections caused by ESBLs-producing isolates. Fluoroquinolone-resistance in ESBL-producing&#xD;
      Enterobacteriacea is common. In this study, the investigators will use isolates of&#xD;
      Enterobacteriacea collected from different hospitals (isolates offered by the Taiwan&#xD;
      Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance [TSAR] program) to investigate the susceptibility of&#xD;
      ertapenem and five other antimicrobial agents against ESBLs-producing Enterobacteriacea.&#xD;

      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collection of bacterial isolates&#xD;
&#xD;
           The staffs in National Health Research Institute have established a long term&#xD;
           surveillance of antimicrobial resistance from 22 to 44 hospitals distributed in all&#xD;
           parts of Taiwan-Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance (TSAR) since 1998. It&#xD;
           has been conducted five times in year 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006 and were named as&#xD;
           TSAR-I, TSAR-II, TSAR-III, TSAR-IV and TSAR-V. In this study, isolates of&#xD;
           Enterobacteriaceas from TSAR-IV will be recruited. Each 50 isolates of Escherichia coli,&#xD;
           Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and&#xD;
           Morganella morganii will be enrolled (about 10% of the TSAR IV collected isolates) for&#xD;
           the following microbiological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Isolates will be divided to ESBL-producing or non-producing groups by screening tests.&#xD;
           All the available isolates were identified to the species or genus level by means of&#xD;
           conventional methods. Isolates with same species recovered from the same an individual&#xD;
           patient, are considered one isolate. The isolates were all stored at -70℃ in trypticase&#xD;
           soy broth (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) supplemented with 15% glycerol before being&#xD;
           tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
           Information collected for each isolate included: collection date, test date,&#xD;
           identification, site of infection, hospital unit of the patient, and whether the isolate&#xD;
           was acquired in the community (i.e., specimen obtained &lt;48 hours after admission), the&#xD;
           length of patient's hospital stay. The susceptibility of all the isolated against&#xD;
           targeted antimicrobial agents will be determined by their Minimum Inhibitory&#xD;
           Concentration (MIC values) follow the CLSI breakpoints for respective antimicrobial&#xD;
           agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inoculums preparation Sterile saline (0.85% NaCl), suitable buffer or broth for&#xD;
                inoculums preparation, depending on the organism. The CLSI inoculums procedure for&#xD;
                aerobes and other microorganisms should be used. 0.5 McFarland turbidity will be&#xD;
                used as the standard for aerobes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inoculation Use sterile loops/swabs to obtain optimal amount of inoculums&#xD;
                suspension. Swab the entire agar surface three times; rotating the plate&#xD;
                approximately 90 degrees each time to ensure an even distribution of inoculums.&#xD;
                Allow excess moisture to be absorbed for about 10-15 minutes so that the surface is&#xD;
                completely dry before applying E test strips.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Application of E test strips Ensure that the inoculated agar surface is completely&#xD;
                dry before applying E test strips. Use a Etest applicator or use a forceps to grip&#xD;
                the handle of the strip (are labeled E) and place them on to the inoculated agar&#xD;
                surface, ensuring that the MIC scale is facing upwards and that the concentration&#xD;
                maximum is nearest to the rim of the plate. Make sure the whole strip is in&#xD;
                complete contact with the agar surface. Once applied, the strip cannot be moved&#xD;
                because of the instantaneous release of antibiotic into the agar. It is recommended&#xD;
                to apply 4-6 different E test strips onto a 150 m agar plate. In this study, the E&#xD;
                test strips of six antimicrobial agents, including cefepime, cefepime plus&#xD;
                clavulanic acid (for the identification of ESBL producing isolates), ciprofloxacin,&#xD;
                cefmetazole, amikacin, tigecycline will be applied in addition to ertapenem.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Incubation The incubation temperature and atmosphere used must be optimal for&#xD;
                growth of particular bacterial species and the antibiotic being tested. CLSI&#xD;
                recommend 35℃/16-18 hours/ambient atmosphere for non-fastidious aerobes and&#xD;
                facultative anaerobes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Reading of the MIC After complete the period of incubation and when bacterial&#xD;
                growth become distinctly visible, read the MIC value at the point of intersection&#xD;
                between the inhibition ellipse edge and the E test strip. Use the E test reading&#xD;
                Guide and other technical guides to correctly read different patterns. Etest strip&#xD;
                (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) containing cefepime (MIC test range, 0.25-16 mg/L) and&#xD;
                cefepime (MIC test range, 0.064-4 mg/L) plus 4 mg/L clavulanic acid will be used to&#xD;
                detect the expression of ESBL according to the manufacturer's instruction.reduction&#xD;
                of MIC by ≥3 two-fold dilutions in the presence of clavulanic acid is indicator of&#xD;
                ESBL production. Deformation of the ellipses or the presence of &quot;phantom&quot; zone is&#xD;
                also indicator of ESBL production even if the MIC ratio is &lt;8 or can not be read.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality control In order to check the system with respect to correct handing,&#xD;
                quality and consistency of materials and methods, test quality control strains with&#xD;
                the antibiotics concerned. S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae can be determined by&#xD;
                broth microdilution under ambient incubation. The following organisms are included&#xD;
                as control strains: S. aureus ATCC 29213, E. faecalis ATCC 29212, S. pneumoniae&#xD;
                ATCC 49619, E. coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 35218, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, and&#xD;
                P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. For every 500 Etests performed, a control test including&#xD;
                the above 5 control strains will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Molecular studies Isolates with expression of ESBLs will be further typed using&#xD;
                Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method. The detailed procedures of PFGE and&#xD;
                the interpretations of PFGE banding patterns are as the description in our previous&#xD;
                report (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isolates are categorized into susceptible, intermediate, and resistant according to the&#xD;
      guidelines provided by the CLSI. Isolates intermediate or resistant to antimicrobial agents&#xD;
      are also categorized as nonsusceptible to the agents. The rates of nonsusceptibility among&#xD;
      major bacterial pathogens will be analyzed according to the different sites of infection and&#xD;
      origin of the isolates. The associations between geographic area, hospital types from whom&#xD;
      these isolates were obtained against the antimicrobial susceptibility will be analyzed.&#xD;
