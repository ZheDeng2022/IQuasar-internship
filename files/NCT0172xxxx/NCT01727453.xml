      4.c. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this prospective, randomized study is to evaluate&#xD;
      whether the substitution of VKA therapy for low molecular weight heparin (bemiparin) in&#xD;
      patients who have had an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding and have the indication for&#xD;
      anticoagulant therapy, is associated with a decreased incidence of recurrent gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives consist of all of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of thromboembolic events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding from other locations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severity of recurrent episodes of haemorrhagea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transfusion requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of risk factors associated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
           5. TYPE OF TRIAL AND DESING.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, in which patients with gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeding and indication for anticoagulation will be randomized into two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (low molecular weight heparin: bemiparin), which is the study group: after passing&#xD;
      the bleeding episode, will receive low molecular weight heparin (bemiparin) in anticoagulant&#xD;
      dose. Check should be made by measurement of anti-factor Xa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (VKA oral anticoagulation: warfarin), which is the control group will receive VKA&#xD;
      anticoagulation as before they had the bleeding episode, with regular monitoring by&#xD;
      measurement of prothrombin time (INR). Patients taking acenocoumarol before bleeding episode&#xD;
      will be treated with warfarin and the once who were receiving warfarin will continue with the&#xD;
      same treatment. Treatment control is performed by measuring the INR periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed using sealed opaque envelopes that contain the treatment&#xD;
      option that will be obtained through a list of random numbers generated by computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. SELECTION OF SUBJECTS 6.1 CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.1. Inclusion criteria: patients with anticoagulant treatment criteria (treated with&#xD;
      acenocoumarol or warfarin) and high or very high risk of embolism, who have an acute&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding (high or low) endoscopically untreatable, secondary to multiple&#xD;
      vascular lesions, diverticular origin or unclarified origin (after VGC and DC) who have no&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.2. Exclusion criteria. Not be included patients with one or more of the following&#xD;
      criteria: A) less than 18 years old. B) pregnancy. C) patient refusal to participate in the&#xD;
      study. D) patients in whom the decision has been taken not to provide active treatment for&#xD;
      the existence of any clinical situation considered terminal (severe associated diseases&#xD;
      evolved).&#xD;
&#xD;
      E) Contraindication LMWH (allergy, heparin induced thrombocytopenia). F) bleeding secondary&#xD;
      to esophageal varices and / or gastric. G) associated bleeding peptic injury. H) bleeding&#xD;
      secondary to tumors or polyps. i) Presence of portal hypertension with or without cirrhosis.&#xD;
      J) bleeding due to Mallory-Weiss syndrome. K) anticoagulation for low risk embolic lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND DEFINITIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding: presence of hematemesis and / or melena noted by&#xD;
           the medical staff. Any acute gastrointestinal bleeding episode is defined as the&#xD;
           presence of macroscopic signs of bleeding (hematemesis, rectal bleeding, hematochezia&#xD;
           and / or melena) noted by the medical staff. Severe gastrointestinal bleeding is defined&#xD;
           as one that also present hemodynamic repercusion (systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mm Hg and&#xD;
           heart rate&gt; 100 bpm) or hemoglobin (Hb) &lt;80 g / l decrease in Hb&gt; 20 g / l in 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upper GI bleeding caused by peptic ulcer, in which cases urgent endoscopy identify an&#xD;
           ulcer with one of the following stigmata of recent haemorrhage: 1) active arterial&#xD;
           bleeding jet or oozing hemorrhage2) non-bleeding visible vessel, 3) clot attached, 4)&#xD;
           indirect signs of bleeding (spots deep ulcer), and 5) ulcer without signs and evidence&#xD;
           of blood remains in the gastric lumen without other potentially bleeding lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variceal hemorrhage, those cases where urgent endoscopy identify varices with one of the&#xD;
           following signs of bleeding: 1) active bleeding or oozing /spurting, 2) adherent clot on&#xD;
           varices or platelet clot, with recent blood remnants in esophagogastric light, or 3)&#xD;
           varices with red blood in esophagogastric light in the absence of other injuries in&#xD;
           complete endoscopic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upper GI bleeding non-variceal neither ulceral origin, those cases where urgent&#xD;
           endoscopy identifies a lesion (Mallory-Weiss, Dieulafoy lesion, angiodysplasia or&#xD;
           other), with active bleeding, non-bleeding visible vessel, or adherent clot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lower gastrointestinal bleeding, those cases with evidence of bleeding (melena or&#xD;
           hematochezia), in which urgent endoscopy is normal and has no history of hematemesis or&#xD;
           coffee ground vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rebleeding hemorrhage cases that present 1) new hematemesis or recurrence/ persistence&#xD;
           of fresh melena, associate with 2) a decrease in hemoglobin greater than 20 g / l in a&#xD;
           period of less than 24 hours, or hemodynamic (TAS &lt;100 mmHg and / or heart rate&gt; 100&#xD;
           ppm). All cases will be assessed through a new emergency endoscopy to confirm it is a&#xD;
           recurrence and proceed to a second endoscopic treatment if it's necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Very high thromboembolic risk:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patients in the first month after they have had an episode of venous&#xD;
                thromboembolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Presence of mitral or tricuspid mechanical valve.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Multiple mechanical prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High risk of thromboembolism, any mechanical prosthesis (except mitral or tricuspid that&#xD;
           they are very high risk), atrial fibrillation embolism, valvular atrial fibrillation,&#xD;
           venous thromboembolism in the first three months or thrombophilia, atrial fibrillation&#xD;
           at high risk (index CHA2DS2- VASC ≥ 4, see table in appendix).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low thromboembolic risk: atrial fibrillation (CHA2DS2-VASC index &lt;4), venous&#xD;
           thromboembolism more than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality: Any death that occurs during the course of the study. We considered&#xD;
           attributable to bleeding all deaths within 30 days after clinical onset of bleeding,&#xD;
           whatever the immediate cause of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7. DESCRIPTION OF TREATMENT. Initially, hemodynamic stabilization shall be of all&#xD;
           patients according to clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the bleeding episode prophylactic dose heparin will be administered by continuous&#xD;
      infusion (120 mg / d 1-2mg/kg/d), starting at 6 hours after the administration of vitamin K.&#xD;
      After 48 hours without clinical signs of hemorrhagic activity (with no macroscopic blood&#xD;
      remnants) will start the treatment of choice (at thehospital). Patients randomized to VKA&#xD;
      receive will warfarin. Patients receiving acenocoumarol will take warfarin. Patients&#xD;
      randomized to receive LMWH will receive bemiparina (Hibor) to maintain an a-Xa levels between&#xD;
      0.4-1.0 U / ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. ASSAY DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF RESPONSE. 8.A. Parameters to evaluate: The following&#xD;
      primary and secondary parameters were evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary variables: incidence of upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the&#xD;
           follow-up period in both groups. Acute gastrointestinal bleeding it will be recorded,&#xD;
           when they occur, at any time during the monitoring period. Is defined as any acute&#xD;
           gastrointestinal bleeding episode in which medical care personnel finds the presence of&#xD;
           macroscopic signs of bleeding (hematemesis, rectal bleeding, hematochezia and / or&#xD;
           melena). Serious Gastrointestinal bleeding is defined as one that also present&#xD;
           hemodynamic repercussion (systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mm Hg and heart rate&gt; 100 bpm) or&#xD;
           hemoglobin (Hb) &lt;80 g / l decrease in Hb&gt; 20 g / l in 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1-Mortality: We included all deaths in this period whatever the reason immediately. Shall&#xD;
      specify the date of death to calculate the actuarial probability curves. This will be&#xD;
      considered as time 0, the entry in the first hospital where the patient go, or the first&#xD;
      bleeding sign if the patient were hospitalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      where and when they were admitted first symptom of bleeding. 2.2-Severity of rebleeding (TA,&#xD;
      FC, low Hb, transfusion requirements). 2.3- Association with NSAIDs, aspirin or other&#xD;
      antiplatelet agents. 2.5 -treatment complications. It will collect any adverse events&#xD;
      observed during follow-up, either initially or not attributable to treatment. Notification of&#xD;
      serious adverse events and unexpected will be modeled and general instructions contained in&#xD;
      Royal Decree 223/2004 of 6 February laying down the requirements for conducting clinical drug&#xD;
      trials 2.6-Time of hospitalization during follow-up. 2.7-Number of hospitalizations during&#xD;
      follow-up. 2.8-In case of rebleeding, is reported: initial anticoagulation level, endoscopic&#xD;
      findings, endoscopic treatment, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.B.Study development:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initially there will be an evaluation of all patients with anticoagulation criteria&#xD;
           (treated with acenocoumarol or warfarin) that present and upper or lower&#xD;
           gastrointestinal bleeding. All patients were submit to an initial clinical evaluation&#xD;
           including history and physical examination and request a blood test (with blood count,&#xD;
           biochemistry and coagulation), ECG, chest radiography and abdominal ultrasonography.&#xD;
           Anticoagulation be corrected by the administration of vitamin K (10 mg) and analytical&#xD;
           control are performed at 6 hours to check the reversal of the anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then it will be a diagnosis or therapeutic endoscopy as early as possible (at least&#xD;
           partial correction of anticoagulation, INR &lt;1.6). All patients will be practised VGC&#xD;
           (also in patients with suspected lower gastrointestinal bleeding, to rule out completely&#xD;
           high origin). In patients with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (normal VGC), after&#xD;
           conducting VGC will be VCC. In cases where the source of bleeding is not clarified with&#xD;
           gastroscopy and colonoscopy, capsule endoscopy was carried out, and according to its&#xD;
           results shall be practised an enteroscopy (forward/backward or both). Furthermore it&#xD;
           will practised an endoscopy, only if the clinical situation of each case requires. In&#xD;
           both groups, all suspected rebleeding be evaluated by endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As mentioned in point 7, during the bleeding episode will be administered to all&#xD;
           patients prophylactic dose heparin and after 48 hours without clinical signs of&#xD;
           hemorrhagic activity it will be divided the participation in the study and proceed to&#xD;
           randomization for treatment LMWH vs. warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the acute episode is resolved, outpatient will be visited at 30th day and then&#xD;
           every 3 months (complete blood counts).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Controls of anticoagulant therapy using anti-Xa or INR it will be held every four weeks,&#xD;
           except in the cases that need to change the dose, in which cases the controls will be&#xD;
           more frequent.&#xD;
