  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to explore and compare the efficacy and safety of etomidate and&#xD;
      propofol with or without analgesic for painless gastroscopy, and to provide more reliant&#xD;
      support for implementation and promotion of comfort care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To widely implement painless gastroscopy is required by diagnose and treatment with&#xD;
      gastroscopy due to the large number and significant suffering of the patients. Also,&#xD;
      development and exploration of anesthesiology will be bound to prompt the development and&#xD;
      exploration of painless gastroscopy. However, the anesthesia risk of painless gastroscopy are&#xD;
      usually higher than that of general anesthesia performed in operating room due to the&#xD;
      condition, monitoring and equipments as well as the staffing for its implementation. Thus,&#xD;
      the finding of a safe and convenient approach for general anesthesia will have a profound&#xD;
      impact on a full promotion and implementation of comfortable care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etomidate, with the main advantage of little effect on circulatory and respiratory systems,&#xD;
      and the features of rapid onset and metabolism, may be helpful to guarantee the safety of&#xD;
      painless diagnosis and treatment, thus appropriate for the procedure with short duration of&#xD;
      anesthesia. However, there is controversy regarding whether analgesic should be used in&#xD;
      combination, as well as how to given the combined regimen.&#xD;
