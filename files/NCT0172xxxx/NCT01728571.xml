  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL; NCT 01169259) is an ongoing randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      in 25,871 U.S. men and women investigating whether taking daily dietary supplements of&#xD;
      vitamin D3 (2000 IU) or omega-3 fatty acids (OmacorÂ® fish oil, 1 gram) reduces the risk of&#xD;
      developing cancer, heart disease, and stroke in people who do not have a prior history of&#xD;
      these illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This ancillary study is being conducted among participants in VITAL and will examine whether&#xD;
      vitamin D or fish oil reduces respiratory morbidity, including COPD and asthma exacerbations,&#xD;
      the risk of pneumonia, and airflow obstruction/decline of pulmonary function; and whether&#xD;
      either of these interventions improves asthma control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and pneumonia are leading causes of death in United&#xD;
      States and worldwide. COPD, which is also a significant source of disability, is increasing&#xD;
      in prevalence. Approximately 14 million adults have asthma, which leads to approximately 12&#xD;
      million missed work days per year in the United States. In adults, COPD and asthma often&#xD;
      coexist. Treatment options for COPD are limited, and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is&#xD;
      high. COPD lung disease (COPD, asthma, airflow obstruction), and most COPD additional&#xD;
      co-morbidities responsible for COPD progression (e.g., respiratory infections/pneumonia,&#xD;
      muscle weakness, cardiac failure) may benefit from vitamin D supplementation therapy, but&#xD;
      this requires rigorous testing. Marine omega-3 fatty acids work through different pathways&#xD;
      from vitamin D to affect inflammation. Observational studies and clinical trials suggest that&#xD;
      consumption of fish and/or fish oil may protect against COPD, asthma or pneumonia, but the&#xD;
      data are not consistent. Thus, there is a compelling need for a clinical trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the potential benefits or risks of vitamin D and fish oil supplementation on COPD and asthma&#xD;
      exacerbations, airflow obstruction and decline of lung function, and risk of pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes of interest in Lung VITAL are COPD exacerbations; airflow obstruction&#xD;
      and decline of pulmonary function; and pneumonia. Asthma exacerbations and asthma control are&#xD;
      secondary outcomes. A tertiary goal is to assess whether the effects of the interventions&#xD;
      differ by baseline dietary intake or baseline blood levels of the nutrients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the primary outcome, Lung VITAL will be conducted among all participants in&#xD;
      VITAL (NCT 01169259), or in subsets of the VITAL population who were followed by detailed&#xD;
      respiratory questionnaire and/or lung function testing.&#xD;
