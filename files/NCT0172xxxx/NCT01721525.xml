  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to develop a new induction chemotherapy regimen which is a combination of&#xD;
      two pill drugs taken by mouth and two drugs given by vein. This is a phase I study, which&#xD;
      means that the primary goal is to establish the recommended dose of an investigational drug&#xD;
      when added to chemotherapy. The researchers wish to evaluate the effects, good and bad, of&#xD;
      the investigational drug.&#xD;

    <description>Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using modified international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) (51). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.</description>

    <description>PK measurements will be collected from patients in the dose excalation cohort during the first cycle of therapy. The area under the curve (AUC0→∞), half-life (t½), and maximum concentration (Cmax) for afatinib will be determined by noncompartmental analysis.</description>

    <description>This will be a single institution phase I study with an expansion cohort. Up to 2 dose levels of daily afatinib will be studied: 30 mg/day and 40 mg/day. The doses of ribavirin, carboplatin, and paclitaxel are fixed. A standard 3 + 3 phase I dose escalation design will be used.</description>

    <intervention_name>Afatinib, Ribavirin, and weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will receive oral daily afatinib (days 1 - 21, per dose escalation scheme) plus daily oral ribavirin (days 1- 21) and paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 intravenously, days 1 and 8) + carboplatin (AUC 1.5 intravenously, days 1 and 8) of a 21-day cycle. Ribavirin will be administered according to standard weight-based dosing for this drug (1). Subjects ≤75 kg receive Ribavirin 400 mg PO qAM and 600 mg PO qPM (= 1000 mg/day). Subjects &gt; 75 kg receive Ribavirin 600 mg PO BID (=1200 mg/day). During the Dose Escalation portion of the study (Part 1), research bloodwork for pharmacokinetics is performed on days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 only.</description>
