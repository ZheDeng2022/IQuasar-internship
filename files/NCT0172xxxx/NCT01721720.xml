      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common and inheritable&#xD;
      of all neuropsychiatric disorders. It causes problems with attention and impulse control.&#xD;
      However, the genetic component of ADHD has not been fully studied, including how genes&#xD;
      interact with the environment. Researchers want to study children and adults who have ADHD.&#xD;
      They will look at how genetic, brain structure, and environmental factors affect ADHD in&#xD;
      children and adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study genetic, brain structure, and environmental factors in ADHD in children and&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 3 years of age who have ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be interviewed about their ADHD. They will also complete behavior and&#xD;
           psychological tests. Parents or guardians will complete the tests along with&#xD;
           participants under 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide saliva or blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also have imaging studies of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants under 25 years of age will return once a year to repeat the tests. Those&#xD;
           over 25 years of age will have only the one set of tests. Those who are starting&#xD;
           stimulant drugs and who are receiving behavioral treatment for the first time will also&#xD;
           have another set of tests 12 weeks after the start of treatment.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to provide novel phenotypes for genomic studies into Attention- Deficit&#xD;
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), one of the most common and heritable of all neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      disorders. It proposes to split the disorder into neurobiologically more meaningful entities&#xD;
      by delineating subgroups based on neurobehavioral profiles. It will also explore factors that&#xD;
      impact clinical course, focusing on the neural effects of treatment and the role of the child&#xD;
      s social environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION AND DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a prospective longitudinal design, a group of children and adolescents with ADHD will&#xD;
      be followed. Additionally, families that have several members affected by ADHD will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will link the onset and clinical course of ADHD with genotype, brain structure and&#xD;
      function, behavior and the child s social environment.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Three or more years of age with no upper limit for age at time of enrollment. The lower&#xD;
        limit of 3 years of age is chosen as it is difficult to diagnose ADHD below this age, but&#xD;
        the diagnosis can be reliably made from age 3 onwards. As this study examines the&#xD;
        developmental trajectories of ADHD into adulthood, no upper age limit has been set.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR CLINICAL POPULATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) defined&#xD;
        ADHD. The DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD will be based on the Parent Diagnostic Interview for&#xD;
        Children and Adolescents in participants 18 years or age and younger and the&#xD;
&#xD;
        Structured clinical interview for the Diagnosis of DSM Disorders for participants above 18&#xD;
        years of age. We include all forms of ADHD in DSM-5 (i.e. combined, predominately&#xD;
        hyperactive/impulsive, predominately inattentive and other specified presentations). ADHD&#xD;
        is rarely found in isolation and comorbidity is common. Thus the protocol will include&#xD;
        individuals with ADHD and the&#xD;
&#xD;
        following disorders: oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, anxiety disorders&#xD;
        (generalized anxiety, specific phobias), tic disorders, mood disorders (dysthymia,&#xD;
        depression); specific learning disabilities and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will also include families where there is a incidence of &gt;30% of ADHD in first, second&#xD;
        and third degree relatives. This level is chosen as it is well above the incidence rate of&#xD;
        ADHD in the general population (~5-7%). Additional inclusion criteria are families where&#xD;
        the proband has at least one sibling and only one or neither parent is affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In studying the acute effects of treatment we will include all participants with ADHD who&#xD;
        are starting psychostimulant medications for the first time (all psychostimulant&#xD;
        preparations are included). We will also include participants with ADHD who are receiving&#xD;
        behavioral&#xD;
&#xD;
        management for ADHD for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSIONS CRITERIA FOR THE FAMILY STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will also include families where there is a incidence of &gt;30% of ADHD in first, second&#xD;
        and third degree relatives. This level is chosen as it is well above the incidence rate of&#xD;
        ADHD in the general population (~5-7%). Additional inclusion criteria are families where&#xD;
        the proband has at least one sibling and only one or neither parent is affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We have already identified families of our currently enrolled probands in which at least 4&#xD;
        other first, second or third degree relatives have a current diagnosis of ADHD or had this&#xD;
        diagnosis in childhood (and have a similar number of unaffected relatives). We will recruit&#xD;
        further families with a similar density of individual affected by ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Full scale IQ of less than 70. Below this level a child is considered to have global&#xD;
        intellectual disability (classified in DSM-IVR as mental retardation). By definition this&#xD;
        means the individual cannot be considered to be a healthy control . While many individual&#xD;
        with IQ below 70 have symptoms of ADHD, the diagnosis is complicated by problems in&#xD;
        assessing attentional abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Finally, there are often issues around the ability to give informed consent in adults with&#xD;
        global intellectual disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Birth before 32 weeks of gestation. Premature birth can have a profound effect on brain&#xD;
        function and structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Presence or history of medical conditions known to affect cerebral anatomy (eg epilepsy,&#xD;
        history of stroke). Genetic syndromes which are associated with well-established&#xD;
        alterations of gross cerebral structure- such as NF1, tuberous sclerosis and some forms of&#xD;
        epilepsy. Children with known microdeletion syndromes will not be excluded provided (1) the&#xD;
        syndrome is not known to be associated with alteration of cerebral anatomy (detectable on&#xD;
        current clinical MRI sequences) and (2) other exclusionary criteria do not apply such as&#xD;
        global intellectual impairment (defined in this protocol as IQ above 70). Data from these&#xD;
        individuals with microdeletion syndromes will&#xD;
&#xD;
        not however be included in GWAS due to analytic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Dental braces (as these distort the MRI image). Metal in the body or other&#xD;
        contraindications for MRI scanning. For females who have reached menarche and have not yet&#xD;
        past menopause: pregnancy or inability or unwillingness to undergo pregnancy testing (for&#xD;
        MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        safety).&#xD;
&#xD;
        For participants 60 years or older. Folstein mini mental state examination score of 26 or&#xD;
        greater. This is a widely accepted screening test for dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS ONLY: Presence of any DSM-IV&#xD;
        psychiatric disorder in the subject or current use of psychiatric medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE CLINICAL POPULATION ONLY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Some neuropsychiatric disorders are either so rare or associated with such profound&#xD;
        alterations of brains structure and function that they will be excluded. This includes&#xD;
        psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia, psychosis NOS) bipolar affective disorder;&#xD;
        autism, substance dependence; dementia.&#xD;
