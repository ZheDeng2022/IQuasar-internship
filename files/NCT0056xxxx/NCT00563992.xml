      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two different mood stabilizing medications,&#xD;
      lithium and valproate, in treating people with bipolar disorder and suicidal behavior.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder, also called manic-depressive illness, is a brain disorder that causes&#xD;
      dramatic changes in a person's mood and energy. Bipolar disorder normally forms in late&#xD;
      adolescence or early adulthood and requires treatment for the rest of a person's life. People&#xD;
      with bipolar disorder undergo periods of extreme happiness and extreme sadness, known as&#xD;
      episodes of mania and depression. Symptoms of mania can include increased energy, euphoric&#xD;
      moods, mind racing, aggressive behavior, substance abuse, and poor decision making. Symptoms&#xD;
      of depression can include persistent feelings of anxiety, guilt, or hopelessness; irregular&#xD;
      sleep and appetite patterns; lethargy; disinterest in previously enjoyed activities;&#xD;
      excessive irritability and restlessness; and inability to concentrate. Some people with&#xD;
      bipolar disorder also become suicidal. Suicidal behaviors are more likely to occur at the&#xD;
      onset of the illness, making it vital to recognize and treat the disorder early on. Current&#xD;
      treatments include mood stabilizing medications and psychotherapy. This study will evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of two different mood stabilizing medications, lithium and valproate, in&#xD;
      treating people with bipolar disorder and suicidal behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this double-blind study will be randomly assigned to take one of two&#xD;
      medications, either lithium or valproate. In the first 2 to 6 months, depending on clinical&#xD;
      condition, participants may also be required to take the antidepressant paroxetine and/or the&#xD;
      medication olanzapine. Participants will attend regular visits to a psychiatrist or a&#xD;
      psychologist at the Neuroscience Clinic. A blood sample will be taken at each visit to&#xD;
      monitor medication blood levels. Participants will also undergo periodic routine laboratory&#xD;
      and urine tests to assure their safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the psychiatrist feels improvement has occurred by the end of the 2- to 6-month period,&#xD;
      participants will be gradually taken off paroxetine and/or olanzapine over a 2-week period.&#xD;
      They will then continue taking the assigned lithium or valproate for the remainder of the&#xD;
      study. If the psychiatrist feels the condition has worsened, participants will be prescribed&#xD;
      new medications as needed. These medications include other antidepressants (bupropion or&#xD;
      venlafaxine) or other antimanic or antipsychotic drugs (perphenazine or haloperidol). Once&#xD;
      these participants have achieved at least 2 weeks of normal moods, they will be gradually&#xD;
      taken off all other prescribed medications and will remain taking the assigned lithium or&#xD;
      valproate. Participants who do not achieve at least 2 weeks of normal moods will stop study&#xD;
      participation but will still be offered clinical treatment. The remaining participants taking&#xD;
      only lithium or valproate will continue their regular visits with a psychiatrist for the last&#xD;
      6 months of the study. The entire study will last 12 months.&#xD;
