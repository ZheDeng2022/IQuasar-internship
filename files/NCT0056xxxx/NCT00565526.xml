      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s Syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the glands that&#xD;
      produce saliva and tears, causing dry eyes and dry mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers do not know the exact cause of SS, but they believe that it may be caused by&#xD;
      abnormalities in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) that stimulate these glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand ANS function in patients with SS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare information about ANS function in healthy individuals and in patients with SS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s Syndrome who are 18 years of age and older, and who&#xD;
      are not pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to taper or discontinue the use of certain medications or dietary&#xD;
      supplements before the ANS testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must be willing to discontinue the use of alcohol and tobacco 24 hours prior to&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will require one inpatient admission and/or outpatient visits to the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva, tear, and sweat production measurements to evaluate the function of glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing of changes to the cardiovascular system, including blood pressure and blood flow&#xD;
           testing, and an electrocardiogram designed to evaluate hemodynamic changes controlled by&#xD;
           the ANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing of changes to the gastrointestinal system, including a swallowing assessment&#xD;
           study, barium swallow study, and gastric emptying study designed to evaluate&#xD;
           gastrointestinal function controlled by the ANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests to evaluate the ANS function in response to certain drugs (edrophonium, glucagon&#xD;
           and acetylcholine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported questionnaire on ANS function and emotional/psychological well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional procedures and tests may include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional skin biopsy to study sweat glands and nerve supply of the skin.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome (SjS) is a systemic exocrinopathy that affects as high as 5&#xD;
      percent of the population. It is manifested predominantly as dry eyes, dry mouth, and&#xD;
      fatigue. The exocrinopathy can be encountered alone (primary SjS) in approximately one half&#xD;
      of the patients or in the presence of another autoimmune disorder such as rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or systemic sclerosis (secondary SjS). The most&#xD;
      widely accepted classification for SjS is the American-European consensus classification&#xD;
      criteria for SjS.(Vitali, Bombardieri et al. 2002)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current understanding about the pathogenesis of SjS stems from the assumption that the&#xD;
      autoimmune destruction of the exocrine glands leads to their hypofunction and symptoms of&#xD;
      dryness. The existing evidence however does not fully support this assumption and cannot&#xD;
      explain the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of SjS for the following reasons: 1) Discordance&#xD;
      between severely affected function and abundance of histologically normal and ex vivo&#xD;
      functional salivary glands; 2) at least 20% of patients have no evidence of systemic&#xD;
      autoimmunity; 3) Animal models of SjS develop glandular dysfunction long before they develop&#xD;
      autoimmunity; 4) Dryness and related symptoms respond poorly to immunosuppressive, including&#xD;
      newer biologics, but fairly well to secretagogues such as pilocarpine. 5) No pathogenic&#xD;
      antibodies or target epitopes have been identified to date to unify the pathogenesis of the&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All exocrine glands are innervated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and dysautonomia can&#xD;
      mimic the phenotype of SjS, particularly cardinal manifestations, such as xerostomia and&#xD;
      xerophthalmia. Thus we hypothesize that ANS dysfunction is central to the pathogenesis of SjS&#xD;
      and propose to systematically study the ANS function in our cohort of patients with primary&#xD;
      SjS compared with normative data from age and sex-matched controls. This protocol calls for a&#xD;
      comprehensive evaluation of autonomic function, using physiological, neuropharmacologic,&#xD;
      neurochemical, and imaging approaches, to identify consistent distinctive patterns of ANS&#xD;
      involvement in SjS and thereby improve the diagnosis and understanding of pathophysiologic&#xD;
      mechanisms of SjS.&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Severe anemia (Hgb less than 8)&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Psychosis&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Pregnant or lactating women&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. A candidate subject is excluded if, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator,&#xD;
             protocol participation would place the subject at substantially increased acute&#xD;
             medical risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Not able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medications: A candidate subject is excluded if clinical considerations require that the&#xD;
        subject continue treatment with a drug likely to interfere with the scientific results i.e.&#xD;
        a tricyclic antidepressant or fludrocortisone. Subjects with known or suspected allergy or&#xD;
        hypersensitivity to any test drug are excluded from receiving that drug. Subjects who must&#xD;
        take medications daily in the following categories are excluded: tricyclic antidepressants,&#xD;
        beta blockers, barbiturates, if they cannot be safely held during testing. Subjects unable&#xD;
        to discontinue nicotine or alcohol temporarily are excluded. Subjects are not to&#xD;
        discontinue any medications before the subject or the subject s physician discusses this&#xD;
        with the Principal Investigator, Dr. Nikolov, or the Associate Investigator, Dr. Goldstein.&#xD;
        If it is decided that discontinuing medications would be unsafe, then the subject is&#xD;
        excluded from the study. Subjects must discontinue use of alcohol and tobacco throughout&#xD;
        the period of testing in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Herbal Medicines and Dietary Supplements: Certain herbal medicines or dietary supplements&#xD;
        are known or suspected to interfere with the experimental results, and such herbal&#xD;
        medicines or dietary supplements must be discontinued before enrollment in the study. For&#xD;
        many herbal medicines or dietary supplements, the mechanisms of action and therefore the&#xD;
        possible effects on the experimental results are unknown. In cases where the subjects wish&#xD;
        to continue their herbal medicines or dietary supplements while on study, and search of the&#xD;
        available medical literature fails to identify effects that are known or expected to&#xD;
        interfere with the experimental results, then the subjects may participate.&#xD;
