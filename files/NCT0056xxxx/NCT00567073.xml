      This Sub-registry is a multicenter, international, longitudinal, observational, and voluntary&#xD;
      program designed to track pregnancy outcomes for any pregnant woman enrolled in the Pompe&#xD;
      Registry, regardless of whether she is receiving disease-specific therapy (such as ERT with&#xD;
      alglucosidase alfa) and irrespective of the commercial product with which she may be treated.&#xD;
      No experimental intervention is given; thus a patient will undergo clinical assessments and&#xD;
      receive standard of care treatment as determined by the patient's physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this Sub-registry is to track pregnancy outcomes, including&#xD;
      complications and infant growth, in all women with Pompe disease during pregnancy, regardless&#xD;
      of whether they receive disease-specific therapy, such as ERT with alglucosidase alfa.&#xD;
