    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of dasatinib&#xD;
      and Zometa (zoledronic acid) that can be given in combination for the treatment of breast&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to the bone. The safety and effectiveness of this combination will&#xD;
      also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zoledronic acid is designed to strengthen the bone and prevent fractures or breaks in the&#xD;
      bone. Dasatinib is designed to block (stop) cells responsible for the breakdown of bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be enrolled in a group&#xD;
      of at least 3 participants to begin receiving zoledronic acid and dasatinib. The dose of&#xD;
      dasatinib you receive will depend on when you enrolled in this study. All participants will&#xD;
      receive the same amount of zoledronic acid. The first group of participants will be treated&#xD;
      with the lowest dose of dasatinib given in combination with zoledronic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerable dose level is found, up to 25 additional participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled at that dose level. This is called the Phase II portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive zoledronic acid through a needle in your vein on Day 1 over 15 minutes. You&#xD;
      will take dasatinib by mouth daily for 28 days. Dasatinib should be taken on an empty stomach&#xD;
      or after a light meal. Every 28 days is called a study &quot;cycle.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits for Participants in the Phase I Portion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will have the following tests and procedures performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 8 of Cycle 1, you will have the following tests and procedures performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 15 of Cycle 1, you will have the following tests and procedures performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 21 of Cycle 1, you will have the following tests and procedures performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 2, you will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of all other cycles, you will have the following tests and procedures performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have MRIs, CT scans, and/or x-rays to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1 and 28 of Cycle 1 and then every 3rd month, urine will be collected over 24 hours&#xD;
      to check for markers of bone loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Cycles 3, 6, 9 and so on, you will have CT scans, MRIs, and/or x-rays to check the&#xD;
      status of the disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all study visits, you will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects&#xD;
      you may be experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits for Participants in the Phase II Portion:&#xD;

      you may be experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may remain on study for as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off study if&#xD;
      the disease gets worse or you experience intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you go off-study, you will have an end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have MRIs, CT scans, and/or x-rays to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Zoledronic acid is FDA approved and commercially available&#xD;
      for the treatment of breast cancer. Dasatinib is not FDA approved or commercially available&#xD;
      for the treatment of breast cancer. It has been authorized for use in research only. Up to 28&#xD;
      patients will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 12 will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

             Response in Bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must not have had &gt;1 chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. Patients&#xD;

             continue this regimen in combination with protocol therapy. For the purposes of this&#xD;
             study disease progression while receiving hormonal therapy will be defined as:&#xD;
             Radiographic evidence of progressive disease according to RECIST criteria, Progression&#xD;
             of disease by physical exam in patients with skin involvement. Continued in # 9&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Patients must have a baseline ECG with QTc within the normal range within 28 days&#xD;
             prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of the study and must sign and&#xD;
             give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients may have received previous radiation but must have completed radiation at&#xD;

             prescribed by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Sexually active patients with reproductive potential must agree to use an effective&#xD;
             method of birth control during the course of the study and for no less than 4 weeks&#xD;
             after discontinuing study drug. Contraceptives must be used in a manner such that risk&#xD;
             of failure is minimized. Oral contraceptives should be avoided in women with estrogen&#xD;
             or progesterone receptor positive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be advised of&#xD;
             the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk&#xD;
             factors for an unintentional pregnancy. In addition, men enrolled on this study should&#xD;
