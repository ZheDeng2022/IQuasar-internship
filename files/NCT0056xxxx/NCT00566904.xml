    <textblock>
      Shingles is an outbreak of rash or blisters on the skin that is caused by the same virus that&#xD;
      causes chicken pox. Some people experience continued pain even after the shingles rash and&#xD;
      blisters have healed; this pain is known as postherpetic neuralgia. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new topical treatment for postherpetic neuralgia in&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After an initial infection of chicken pox, the varicella-zoster virus can remain dormant&#xD;
      inside nerve cells. Years later, the virus can be reactivated, causing a repeat outbreak&#xD;
      called shingles. The first symptom of shingles is usually a burning or tingling pain in one&#xD;
      particular location and on one side of the body. This pain can range from mild to severe.&#xD;
      Other possible symptoms of shingles include numbness and itching. After several days or 1&#xD;
      week, a rash of fluid-filled blisters similar to chicken pox appears. For most healthy&#xD;
      people, a case of shingles heals within a month. However, some people continue to feel pain&#xD;
      after the rash and blisters have resolved; this pain is known as postherpetic neuralgia.&#xD;
      Current treatments for postherpetic neuralgia include antiviral drugs, steroids,&#xD;
      antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and topical products. A new topical treatment consists of a&#xD;
      liquid product that is applied directly to the skin to let dry and form a thin, transparent&#xD;
      barrier film. In contrast to creams or ointments that can stay in contact with skin for only&#xD;
      minutes, this product remains intact on the skin for many hours, providing sustained delivery&#xD;
      of a drug or medication while maintaining barrier protection for the skin. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of this new topical treatment for postherpetic&#xD;
      neuralgia in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last about 3 weeks and will include seven study visits on Days 1, 8, 9, 15,&#xD;
      16, 22, and 23. All study visits will include questionnaires on pain levels and an&#xD;
      examination and digital photos of the affected skin area. The study visit on Day 1 will also&#xD;
      include a urine pregnancy test and a review of medical and medication history. During the&#xD;
      study visits on Days 8, 15, and 22, one of three topical products will be applied to&#xD;
      participants' affected skin. The product will dry on the skin in 30 to 45 seconds.&#xD;
      Participants will then wait at the study site for 1.5 hours, after which they will record the&#xD;
      time when they experienced pain relief. At each of these three treatment visits, participants&#xD;
      will receive one of the following three topical products: Epikeia coatings with aspirin,&#xD;
      Epikeia coatings with local anesthetic, and Epikeia coatings alone. At these three study&#xD;
      visits, questionnaires, examinations, and digital photographs will occur both before and&#xD;
      after the products are applied to the skin. Throughout the study, participants will record&#xD;
      their pain levels and medications in a diary, which will be reviewed at all study visits.&#xD;
