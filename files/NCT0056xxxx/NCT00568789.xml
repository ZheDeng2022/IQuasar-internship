      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of ramelteon in elderly subjects on&#xD;
      balance, mobility and memory impairment after awakening in the middle of the night following&#xD;
      bedtime dosing.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Insomnia affects more than half of the US population. Epidemiological data indicate that&#xD;
      between 36% and 56% of American adults report occasional insomnia, while 9% to 17% report&#xD;
      chronic or severe problems with insomnia. This condition is most prevalent in the elderly.&#xD;
      Elderly insomnia sufferers may experience more difficulty staying asleep than younger adults;&#xD;
      increasing wakefulness during the sleep period and resulting in the opportunity to get out of&#xD;
      bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly individuals with insomnia are at risk of falling when they get out of bed during the&#xD;
      sleep period. It is not known if this risk merely is the result of being out of bed, or if&#xD;
      insomnia or some other physiological processes (eg, postural hypotension) contribute. This&#xD;
      risk is significant because falling may result in severe injuries, including hip fractures,&#xD;
      for which morbidity and mortality statistics are remarkable. Approximately one-third of those&#xD;
      who sustain a hip fracture are placed in long-term care facilities. Of those patients&#xD;
      hospitalized due to a hip fracture, 15% die while in the hospital and 33% die within one year&#xD;
      of sustaining the fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One important concern regarding the risk of falling in elderly patients with insomnia relates&#xD;
      to the commonly accepted pharmacological treatments of insomnia. Although normal control of&#xD;
      the sleep-wake cycle is exerted by the suprachiasmatic nucleus via melatonin receptor&#xD;
      subtypes 1 and 2 receptors, current pharmacologic treatments for insomnia mainly involve&#xD;
      GABAergic (gamma aminobutyric acid) mechanisms: most currently prescribed sleep agents are&#xD;
      benzodiazepine receptor agonists, which bind to the benzodiazepine receptor site of the gamma&#xD;
      aminobutyric acid receptor complex. Gamma aminobutyric acid is the major inhibitory&#xD;
      transmitter in the central nervous system and its receptors are distributed widely throughout&#xD;
      the brain. In addition to sleep, benzodiazepine receptor agonists can cause a wide range of&#xD;
      ancillary effects not directly related to sleep, depending on the precise subset of gamma&#xD;
      aminobutyric acid receptors activated. These include sedative, anxiolytic, muscle-relaxant,&#xD;
      and amnesic effects. Drugs that act at this receptor complex, specifically the&#xD;
      benzodiazepines, have deleterious effects on body sway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ramelteon is marketed in the United States as Rozerem for the treatment of insomnia&#xD;
      characterized by difficulty with sleep initiation. It's mechanism of action is based on the&#xD;
      agonism of melatonin receptor subtype 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the effects of ramelteon on balance, mobility and memory&#xD;
      impairment awakening in the middle of the night following bedtime dosing. Participation in&#xD;
      this study is anticipated to be about 1 to 1.5 months.&#xD;
