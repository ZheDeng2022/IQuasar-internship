  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor diet, physical inactivity, and sedentary behaviors among low-income, minority&#xD;
      populations have been linked to greater risk of chronic health conditions such as&#xD;
      overweight/obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Low-income clinics that&#xD;
      serve these populations often represent an untapped opportunity for health promotion in&#xD;
      impoverished individuals. This exploratory project proposes to address this scientific gap by&#xD;
      introducing and conducting a randomized controlled pilot of the Self-Care Stimulating Disease&#xD;
      Prevention Program to address poor dietary habits, physical inactivity, and sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle behaviors among low income, uninsured patient populations.&#xD;

      Poor diet, physical inactivity, and sedentary behaviors among low-income, minority&#xD;
      populations have been linked to greater risk of chronic health conditions such as&#xD;
      overweight/obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Low-income clinics that&#xD;
      serve these populations often represent an untapped opportunity for health promotion in&#xD;
      impoverished individuals. Few studies have examined the feasibility of using brief physician&#xD;
      advice and multi-level, clinic-based interventions to change poor dietary habits, physical&#xD;
      inactivity, and sedentary lifestyle behaviors among these culturally diverse populations that&#xD;
      comprise the clinic population. This exploratory project proposes to address this scientific&#xD;
      gap by introducing and piloting a Self-Care Stimulating Disease Prevention Program (SCSDPP)&#xD;
      to address poor dietary habits, physical inactivity, and sedentary lifestyle behaviors among&#xD;
      low income, uninsured patient populations (primarily Latinos) served by the community clinics&#xD;
      of the Venice Family Clinic (VFC) health center in Los Angeles County. The program will&#xD;
      include the development of 1) a simple-to-use patient Health Priority Assessment (HPA) tool&#xD;
      designed to assess patient preferences for behavior change; 2) a standard protocol for&#xD;
      physicians to provide brief health advice using motivation interviewing (&lt; 2 minutes per&#xD;
      visit); 3) a protocol for distributing self-help aids for patient use (e.g., pedometer,&#xD;
      exercise videos); and 4) a series of monthly follow-up counseling sessions by lay health&#xD;
      educators (e.g., promotores) to help patients address their lifestyle change priorities over&#xD;
      time. We will conduct a randomized controlled pilot of the SCSDPP in approximately 100&#xD;
      patient cases at two community health clinics within the VFC health center system. The pilot&#xD;
      will utilize precise outcome measures, including commonly-accepted biomarkers (e.g., HgbA1c,&#xD;
      fasting blood glucose) and psychometrically-validated measures of process and health status,&#xD;
      to accurately assess the magnitude of changes in diet and physical activity among patients&#xD;
      over a 12-month observation period. The feasibility of integrating the SCSDPP into the&#xD;
      community health clinic setting will be evaluated, and is the primary aim of this project.&#xD;
      The results will inform efforts to plan a larger, successor study. Relevance to Public&#xD;
      Health: this study evaluates a clinic-based brief intervention to help prevent&#xD;
      overweight/obesity, a public health problem that has been linked to the development of the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome and other precursors of diabetes.&#xD;
