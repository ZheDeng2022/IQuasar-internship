      The purpose of this study was to determine whether the adhesion prevention gel was safe to&#xD;
      use, and was effective for the prevention/reduction of adhesion formation that typically&#xD;
      occurs following gynecological surgery to remove myomas&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative adhesions are a common medical complication of gynecologic and pelvic&#xD;
      surgeries, and are frequently associated with chronic or recurrent pelvic pain, intestinal&#xD;
      obstruction and infertility. This randomized, controlled, multicenter, clinical study was&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the safety and performance of Adhibit™ Adhesion Prevention Gel versus&#xD;
      the standard of care for the reduction of postoperative adhesions in subjects undergoing&#xD;
      myomectomy via laparotomy or laparoscopy. Subjects were scheduled to return within 6-8 weeks&#xD;
      after the initial surgical procedure. At that time, a second-look laparoscopy was performed&#xD;
      for postoperative adhesion assessment. Adhesions were graded using a modified American&#xD;
      Fertility Society (mAFS) scoring method.&#xD;

    <description>A resorbable hydrogel, which adheres to itself and the tissues it contacts, is approved for use in sealing vascular reconstructions. The hydrogel is formed when two synthetic derivatized polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers are mixed together and applied to tissue. Using a gas-assisted delivery device, the hydrogel is sprayed over all myomectomy suture lines and all surgically treated areas during the myomectomy surgery. The hydrogel is totally resorbed within 30 days post-application.</description>
