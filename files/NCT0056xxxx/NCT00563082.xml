  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that predominantly affects&#xD;
      younger premenopausal women. The risk of coronary heat disease (CHD) in women with SLE is up&#xD;
      to 50 times higher than in the general population. The conventional risk factors are&#xD;
      insufficient to explain this increased risk of CHD in SLE-affected women. This study will&#xD;
      perform genetic analysis to determine if genetic variation in the F2 gene is associated with&#xD;
      both SLE risk and CHD risk in women with SLE.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SLE is a condition of chronic inflammation of the internal organs, caused by an autoimmune&#xD;
      disease. An autoimmune disease is a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks its&#xD;
      own tissues through production of abnormal antibodies in the blood. Current treatments for&#xD;
      SLE focus on reducing inflammation and production of unusual antibodies. While the exact&#xD;
      cause of SLE is unknown, genetics, drugs, viruses, and ultraviolent light are all possible&#xD;
      contributors. Previous genetic studies have determined that antiphospholipid antibodies (APA)&#xD;
      are present in 50% of people with SLE compared with only 1 to 5% in the general U.S. white&#xD;
      population. These antibodies interfere with standard blood vessel function, resulting in&#xD;
      blood clots and narrowing of vessels. The F2 gene codes for prothrombin, a precursor of&#xD;
      thrombin, which is a key enzyme in blood clotting. Prothrombin can be detected by APA as an&#xD;
      antigen, resulting in anti-F2 antibodies. Recent studies have reported the association of F2&#xD;
      genetic variants with non-fatal heart attack, further suggesting that the F2 gene and APA&#xD;
      play a role in CHD. In addition to being a biological candidate gene for CHD, F2 is also a&#xD;
      positional candidate gene for SLE, as it is close to a region of linkage for SLE on&#xD;
      chromosome 11. This study will perform genetic analysis to determine if genetic variation in&#xD;
      the F2 gene is associated with both SLE risk and CHD risk in women with SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using genetic analysis techniques, this study will examine previously collected case-control&#xD;
      samples of serum DNA. Study researchers will resequence the entire F2 gene and then examine&#xD;
      the role of sequence variations in relation to SLE and the risk of CHD in SLE patients.&#xD;
      Researchers will identify rare and common variants of the F2 gene and further screen variants&#xD;
      to determine gene-trait relations.&#xD;
