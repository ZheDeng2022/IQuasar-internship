      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The relation between eye movement and brain function is a subject of interest to the&#xD;
           National Eye Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By comparing eye movement in healthy volunteers to research conducted on patients who&#xD;
           have difficulty moving their eyes, the National Eye Institute hopes to develop and&#xD;
           improve diagnostic procedures for people with eye diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The purpose of this study is to understand how we see visual patterns and how we move our&#xD;
      eyes to see.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  must have no serious illnesses and must be 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  who are 18 years of age or older must be willing to wear contact lenses that record&#xD;
                eye movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  individuals with a history of eye or brain diseases, or previous eye or eye muscle&#xD;
                surgery, are not allowed to participate in this study. Individuals who are&#xD;
                currently using eye medications also are not eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  who are 18 years of age or older must be willing to wear contact lenses that record&#xD;
                eye movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will visit the National Eye Institute outpatient clinic for examination and&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and eye examination (including eye&#xD;
           pressure and eye movement tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with healthy eyes will participate in eye movement testing experiments:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  One or more sessions lasting less than three hours each.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Eye movements will be recorded with either a special contact lens or a&#xD;
                video/infrared camera system.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For the majority of the studies done under this protocol, only one or two sessions&#xD;
                will be required. A few studies recording very small eye movements will require&#xD;
                three or more sessions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This natural history study will investigate eye movements and other responses to visual&#xD;
      stimuli in normal individuals (normal volunteers) and patients. This protocol replaces a&#xD;
      similar protocol (80-EI-0093) which served the same purpose. Normal adult volunteers will be&#xD;
      recruited and will undergo an eye exam to assure that there are no visual system problems.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be studied in one or more sessions where eye movement, verbal or hand&#xD;
      movement responses are recorded in response to visual stimuli. Patients with diseases&#xD;
      affecting the oculomotor or visual systems will also be recruited to help us better&#xD;
      understand these systems and to help characterize their specific disease.&#xD;
