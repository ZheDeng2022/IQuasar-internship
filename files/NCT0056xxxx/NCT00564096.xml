    <textblock>
      Until recently stimulation of nervous tissue deeper than approximately 2 cm from the scalp&#xD;
      (will hence be called non-deep TMS) was not possible (3).A new coil (&quot;H&quot;-coil invented in&#xD;
      Weizmann Institute of Science, Neurobiology Department, Rehovot, Israel ) capable of&#xD;
      stimulating more than twice this depth (Up to 5 cm)was recently developed.Deep TMS is using&#xD;
      this h-coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auditory hallucinations are reported by 50% to 70% of patients with schizophrenia and&#xD;
      generally consist of spoken speech or &quot;voices.&quot; . Patients usually describe the hallucinatory&#xD;
      experience as distressing, consistent with evidence that the most common hallucinated&#xD;
      utterances are abusive terms,contributing in up to 25% of the cases to a serious suicide&#xD;
      attempt.The neuroanatomical basis of auditory hallucinations is thought to involve increasing&#xD;
      blood flow of the speech perception areas of the brain, such as the superior temporal cortex&#xD;
      of the dominant hemisphere as well as right and left superior temporal cortex.Brain imaging&#xD;
      studies of patients with auditory hallucinations have revealed an active area in the right&#xD;
      and left superior temporal cortex, Broca's area, and the left temporoparietal cortex.&#xD;
      Shergill et al. reported the presence of active areas in the anterior cingulate cortex, right&#xD;
      thalamus, left hippocampus, and parahippocampal cortex when subjects were experiencing&#xD;
      auditory hallucinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Stimulation of Left Temporoparietal Cortex suggest that the mechanism of auditory&#xD;
      hallucinations involves activation of the left temporoparietal cortex.Reasons to believe that&#xD;
      right frontotemporal TMS stimulation cortex can ameliorate auditory hallucinations include&#xD;
      evidence that right temporoparietal stimulation achieved significant changes in the frequency&#xD;
      of auditory hallucinations,in the patients with auditory hallucinations an increase in blood&#xD;
      flow is noted in the right superior temporal gyrus,right temporal lobe activation during&#xD;
      auditory hallucination,effect of rTMS can spread to the opposite hemisphere through&#xD;
      interhemispheric connections,some evidence that brain circuits involved in the production of&#xD;
      auditory hallucinations and symptoms of schizophrenia are widespread and not confined in the&#xD;
      left temporoparietal cortex.Deep TMS can reach brain structures as deep as 5 cm whereas&#xD;
      non-deep TMS can reach structures less than half that distance. As deep brain structures such&#xD;
      as thalamic, limbic and paralimbic regions have been shown to be activated during auditory&#xD;
      hallucinations and suspected to play a role in the pathogenesis of auditory hallucinations,&#xD;
      their stimulation may attenuate auditory hallucinations. Non-deep TMS can stimulate the&#xD;
      cortex but not the neuronal pathways connecting it to deeper brain structures and which&#xD;
      stimulation may be additive.&#xD;

      Research of deep TMS treatment in patients with schizophrenia experiencing auditory&#xD;
      hallucinations, double blind placebo(sham) controlled study October 14, 2007&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern TMS began in 1985 when Barker and colleagues in Sheffield, UK, developed the first TMS&#xD;
      device. However, the original commercially available stimulators were limited in the&#xD;
      frequency with which they could produce stimuli by the recharging circuits therefore only&#xD;
      allowing for the application of single-pulse TMS. To date, devices capable of stimulating the&#xD;
      brain at frequencies up to 100 Hz have opened up new possibilities in magnetic stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS is based on Faraday's principle of electromagnetic induction. A rapidly changing magnetic&#xD;
      field (2 T) is generated by passing a very brief (0.2-0.9 milliseconds (ms)) high-current&#xD;
      alternating electric pulse through an insulated coil made of wire. When the coil is placed&#xD;
      against the scalp the magnetic field passes readily through the skull and induces a weak&#xD;
      electrical current in the superficial cortex of the brain lasting exactly as long as the&#xD;
      current pulse in the coil. The induced electrical activity can cause cortical neurons to&#xD;
      discharge action potentials.Until recently stimulation of nervous tissue deeper than&#xD;
      approximately 2 cm from the scalp was not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurobiological background&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS have been proved to modulate a variety of brain substances including increase in the&#xD;
      expression of neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) mRNA in rats, increases the firing rate of&#xD;
      dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area and in the substantia nigra,elevation of&#xD;
      taurine serine and aspartate in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, release of&#xD;
      monoamines in the hippocampus,(which is believed to be highly involved in the pathophysiology&#xD;
      of depression), increase in hippocampal serotonin and 5-HIAA content after acute rTMS, a&#xD;
      selective increase in 5-HT1A binding sites in the frontal cortex, the cingulated cortex, and&#xD;
      the anterior olfactory nucleus in response to a single train of rTMS,as well as down&#xD;
      regulation of cortical b-adrenergic receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General clinical background&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS holds the potential of being able to selectively modulate activity in brain areas&#xD;
      involved in pathological processes such as depression, mania, obsessive-compulsive disorder,&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The largest single area of TMS research in psychiatry has been the exploration of possible&#xD;
      therapeutic effects of cortical, usually prefrontal, stimulation on symptoms of major&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical, neurophysiological and imaging background of auditory hallucinations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auditory hallucinations are reported by 50% to 70% of patients with schizophrenia and&#xD;
      generally consist of spoken speech or &quot;voices.&quot; Evidences include review of 16 studies that&#xD;
      found an average prevalence of 60% for auditory hallucinations in patients with a diagnosis&#xD;
      of schizophrenia. Patients usually describe the hallucinatory experience as distressing,&#xD;
      consistent with evidence that the most common hallucinated utterances are abusive&#xD;
      terms,contributing in up to 25% of the cases to a serious suicide attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neuroanatomical basis of auditory hallucinations is thought to involve increasing blood&#xD;
      flow of the speech perception areas of the brain, such as the superior temporal cortex of the&#xD;
      dominant hemisphere as well as right and left superior temporal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain imaging studies of patients with auditory hallucinations have revealed an active area&#xD;
      in the right and left superior temporal cortex, Broca's area, and the left temporoparietal&#xD;
      cortex. Shergill et al. reported the presence of active areas in the anterior cingulate&#xD;
      cortex, right thalamus, left hippocampus, and parahippocampal cortex when subjects were&#xD;
      experiencing auditory hallucinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Stimulation of Left Temporoparietal Cortex suggest that the mechanism of auditory&#xD;
      hallucinations involves activation of the left temporoparietal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPET during auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia demonstrated blood flow in&#xD;
      the left inferior frontal region (Broca's area) during hallucinations, thus implicating the&#xD;
      language-production areas in the experience of auditory hallucinations.Other Positron&#xD;
      emission tomography study demonstrated activations in subcortical nuclei (thalamic,&#xD;
      striatal), limbic structures (especially hippocampus), and paralimbic regions&#xD;
      (parahippocampal and cingulate gyri, as well as orbitofrontal cortex).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS based double blind study showed that in auditory hallucinations, the preferentially&#xD;
      affected area appears to be located in the primary auditory cortex, rather than the secondary&#xD;
      or association areas of the posterior planum temporale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose in 12 DSM-III schizophrenic&#xD;
      patients who experienced auditory hallucinations during glucose uptake compared with the&#xD;
      patients who did not experience hallucinations showed that the patients who did experience&#xD;
      hallucinations had significantly lower relative metabolism in auditory and Wernicke's regions&#xD;
      and a trend toward higher metabolism in the right hemisphere homologue of Broca's region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some researchers have suggested that the hallucinated voice might actually be inner speech&#xD;
      that is misperceived as stimulation from the outside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, the TMS treatment was reported to be well tolerated. No serious adverse effects&#xD;
      were reported by any of the patients. There is no evidence that rTMS causes structural brain&#xD;
      damage or detrimental cellular alterations. There is however, a low risk of inducing seizures&#xD;
      with rTMS and the risk increases with higher stimulation frequencies and intensities.&#xD;
      Headache was the main side effect reported,however, the incidence of headaches after&#xD;
      approximately 250 treatment sessions, was found to be as high as 8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding auditory hallucinations, Safety of TMS when given to Left Temporoparietal Cortex&#xD;
      was generally well tolerated with the exception of transient Concentration and memory&#xD;
      difficulties lasting 5 to 10 minutes following rTMS ,and that also not more frequently than&#xD;
      sham arm of the study.With regard to slow transcranial magnetic stimulation aimed at&#xD;
      resistant auditory hallucinations no significant adverse events have been disclosed. In a&#xD;
      double blind study in which the left or right temporoparietal cortex was stimulated&#xD;
      repeatedly for two weeks, subjects reported headache (N = 5), dizziness (N = 2), and amnesia&#xD;
      (N = 1), while subjects in the sham arm of the study reported headache (N = 2), dizziness (N&#xD;
      = 1), and difficulty in concentrating (N = 1). These adverse effects disappeared within 10&#xD;
      min of the completion of each rTMS treatment and were seen with both left and right&#xD;
      hemisphere treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with clinical studies, the rodent studies available so far support the notion&#xD;
      that rTMS is a safe technique even when used chronically, i.e. up to 11 weeks in rats. The&#xD;
      use of rTMS in humans is regarded as safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding deep TMS, a study of 35 healthy volunteers conducted in collaboration of Shalvata&#xD;
      Mental Health Care Center, Sheba Medical Center and Neurobiology Department of Weitzman&#xD;
      Institute of Science, has demonstrated the safety of deep TMS treatment. The study is&#xD;
      enclosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study Deep TMS will be administered by a trained doctor, and all patients will wear&#xD;
      ear-plugs as to avoid hearing damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rational of this study is based on the following :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance to treatment , significant subjective suffering &amp; risk of suicide&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. As mentioned earlier auditory hallucinations are reported by 50%-70% of patients with&#xD;
           schizophrenia, most of whom, indeed, are successfully treated with antipsychotic&#xD;
           medication, but 25%-30% of whom are refractory to antipsychotic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Auditory hallucinations can cause great distress, functional disability, and lack of&#xD;
           behavioral control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A variety of psychosocial treatments have been used, but their efficacy has been&#xD;
           described mainly in individual case reports and their relative merits are unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Falloon and Talbot (1981) reported that more than quarter of their schizophrenic&#xD;
           patients had made a serious suicide attempt in response to auditory hallucinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Promising response of auditory hallucinations to TMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A double blind study of Thirty-nine patients with schizophrenia with&#xD;
           treatment-refractory auditory hallucinations showed that daily repetitive TMS at 1 Hz&#xD;
           for 20 min per day for 10 treatment days over the left or right temporoparietal achieved&#xD;
           significant changes in the frequency of auditory hallucinations, positive symptoms of&#xD;
           PANSS, and CGI-I.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation of Left Temporoparietal Cortex in frequency of 1 Hz&#xD;
           for 9 days in 24 patients with schizophrenia /schizoaffective disorder and&#xD;
           medication-resistant auditory hallucinations achieved substantial improvement in&#xD;
           hallucinations frequency and attentional salience with 52% of patients maintaining&#xD;
           improvement for at least 15 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A study of 24 patients with schizophrenia given low frequency (1 Hz) repetitive&#xD;
           transcranial magnetic Stimulation to the left temporoparietal cortex over 5 consecutive&#xD;
           working days achieved improvement in Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale scores as well&#xD;
           as in source monitoring (= increased ability in identifying self-generate items as&#xD;
           having come from themselves).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A double-blind crossover study in ten schizophrenia patients with resistant auditory&#xD;
           hallucinations given 5 days of low frequency rTMS (1 Hz) over the left temporoparietal&#xD;
           cortex demonstrated a diminution of 56% of the hallucinations as reflected in reduction&#xD;
           in all seven items of the auditory hallucinations rating scale as well as a diminution&#xD;
           in SAPS scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasons to believe that right frontotemporal TMS stimulation cortex can ameliorate auditory&#xD;
      hallucinations include evidence that right temporoparietal stimulation achieved significant&#xD;
      changes in the frequency of auditory hallucinations,in the patients with auditory&#xD;
      hallucinations an increase in blood flow is noted in the right superior temporal gyrus, right&#xD;
      temporal lobe activation during auditory hallucination, effect of rTMS can spread to the&#xD;
      opposite hemisphere through interhemispheric connections,some evidence that brain circuits&#xD;
      involved in the production of auditory hallucinations and symptoms of schizophrenia are&#xD;
      widespread and not confined in the left temporoparietal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advantages of deep TMS over non-deep TMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep TMS can reach brain structures as deep as 5 cm whereas non-deep TMS can reach structures&#xD;
      less than half that distance. As deep brain structures such as thalamic, limbic and&#xD;
      paralimbic regions have been shown to be activated during auditory hallucinations and&#xD;
      suspected to play a role in the pathogenesis of auditory hallucinations, their stimulation&#xD;
      may attenuate auditory hallucinations. Non-deep TMS can stimulate the cortex but not the&#xD;
      neuronal pathways connecting it to deeper brain structures and which stimulation may be&#xD;
      additive. According to Cleghorn et al the striatum plays a critical role in auditory&#xD;
      hallucinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each site is intended to recruit 20 patients aged 18-60 years old, diagnosed as suffering&#xD;
      from schizophrenia and experiencing auditory hallucinations on daily basis. The operator as&#xD;
      well as the rater will be blind to the kind of treatment being given to the specific patient&#xD;
      they treat/evaluate clinically. Patients will be randomly and equally divided to 2 study&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 patients will be given 20 minutes stimulation with real deep H1-Coil TMS to the Left&#xD;
      Temporo-parietal Cortex in frequency of 1 Hz with 120% motor threshold during 20 consecutive&#xD;
      working days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 patients will be given 20 minutes stimulation with sham deep H1-Coil TMS to the Left&#xD;
      Temporo-parietal Cortex in frequency of 1 Hz with 120% motor threshold during 10 consecutive&#xD;
      working days, and thereafter 20 sessions of real TMS with the same parameters (=Left&#xD;
      Tempor-oparietal Cortex in frequency of 1 Hz with 120% motor threshold).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of Patient evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated by the following manner:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 72 hours before first TMS study session , 24 hours after 10th session, right before&#xD;
      the 11th session and again 24 hours after 20th session, one week after last session and one&#xD;
      month after last session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 72 hours before first TMS study session , 24 hours after 10th session, right before&#xD;
      the 11th session and again 24 hours after 20th session right before the 21th session, 24&#xD;
      hours after 30th session ,one week after last session and one month after last session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' evaluation will include the following measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Auditory hallucinations Rating Scale developed by Hoffman and colleagues (2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms scores (SAPS; Andreasen and Olsen 1982).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical Global Impressions (CGI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology ( QIDS-SR16 )&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Personal and Social Functioning (GAF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The magnitude of auditory hallucinations will be evaluated in every patient by his&#xD;
           closest care taker according to the care taker impression of the patient's behavior (For&#xD;
           example talking to himself), acts which the patient explains as being an obedience to&#xD;
           the &quot;voices'&quot; commands or an attempt to lessen the voices (For example not leaving home&#xD;
           due to fear of voices escalation), or being unresponsive to care takers questions or&#xD;
           orders due to distraction by hallucinations. The care taker evaluation will take place&#xD;
           one week prior to first TMS session, continuing on daily basis until one week after the&#xD;
           last TMS session. This evaluation will hence be called &quot;Care taker auditory&#xD;
           hallucinations evaluation&quot; or CTAHE. The care taker will evaluate the patient's&#xD;
           hallucinatory behavior on a scale from 0 to 10, in which &quot;0&quot; is completely hallucination&#xD;
           free and &quot;10&quot; being behavior dictated by hallucinations alone.This could be done using a&#xD;
           visual analogue scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Average ratings can later be compared between pre &amp; post treatment periods. As the care taker&#xD;
      will be blind to TMS given to the patient (sham or real) and A care taker &quot;Placebo&quot;&#xD;
      impression can be thus overcome. Clinical response will be judged according Hoffman's&#xD;
      definition of positive response (50% or greater improvement in the auditory hallucinations&#xD;
      scores)&#xD;
&#xD;
