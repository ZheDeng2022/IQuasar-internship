  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether doxorubicin HCL liposome injection,&#xD;
      bortezomib, and Dexamethasone in combination, are effective in previously untreated multiple&#xD;
      myeloma patients. Bortezomib inhibits the function of proteasomes, a novel mechanism of&#xD;
      action.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-arm, open-label, Phase II multi-centre study in Canada only. A total of 50&#xD;
      newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who were eligible for stem cell transplant were&#xD;
      targeted for recruitment to this study. Combination doxorubicin HCL liposome injection,&#xD;
      bortezomib and dexamethasone induction therapy was given for 4 cycles in preparation for stem&#xD;
      cell collection and transplant. As remission status after induction and prior to the first or&#xD;
      second auto-transplant has been shown to be the major determinant of both event free and&#xD;
      overall survival in multiple myeloma patients, the goal has been to improve response rates&#xD;
      through the use of various combinational approaches. As such, the objective of the present&#xD;
      study was to test the hypothesis that treatment with this regimen could result in a higher&#xD;
      complete + near complete response rate (CR + nCR) prior to stem cell transplant, than&#xD;
      obtained with current regimens, and then to confirm the response rate post-transplant. Safety&#xD;
      was evaluated using adverse event reportings, clinical laboratory tests and tests for cardiac&#xD;
      function (multiple-gated acquisition scan/echocardiogram and electrocardiogram). Four 21-day&#xD;
      cycles of combination induction therapy consisting of 1.3 mg/m2 bortezomib (given i.v. Days&#xD;
      1, 4, 8, 11) + 30 mg/m2 Doxil/Caelyx (given i.v. Day 4) + 40 mg Dex (given po Days 1-4, 8-11,&#xD;
      15-18 Cycle 1 only; Days 1-4 Cycles 2-4).&#xD;
