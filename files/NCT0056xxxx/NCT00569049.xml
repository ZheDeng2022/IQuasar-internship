    <textblock>
      This is a research-based study that is looking at the biologic features of breast tissue,&#xD;
      lymph node tissue, or blood in order to study breast cancer development growth, and spread.&#xD;
      Through tissue and/or blood samples we hope to gain further knowledge and understanding of&#xD;
      how to improve diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by identifying the molecular markers&#xD;
      that predict clinical outcome and response to therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The tissue obtained in this protocol will be used for genome-wide examination of DNA, RNA&#xD;
      expression profiling, proteomic analyses, isolation and analyses of normal and cancer stem&#xD;
      cells, isolation and analyses of circulating tumor cells, possible analyses of immune cells,&#xD;
      and possible analyses of serum factors. The tissue may also be used to develop&#xD;
      patient-specific cell culture models or mouse xenograft models of breast cancer for biologic&#xD;
      study of tumor progression and metastases and for therapeutic testing. In general, the tissue&#xD;
      will be used in studies that will molecularly classify tumors, identify prognostic markers,&#xD;
      identify potential therapeutic markers, identify potential treatment targets, and help us&#xD;
      better understand the biology and specific role played by different tumor cells in the&#xD;
      metastatic process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal is to use molecular analyses to improve the diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:People eligible for this study include anyone older than 18 years who is&#xD;
        undergoing one of the following procedures: core needle or surgical breast biopsy,&#xD;
        lumpectomy, mastectomy, axillary lymph node surgery, breast reduction surgery, or ductal&#xD;
        lavage or ductoscopy. Patients who have had breast cancer in the past who are currently&#xD;
        free of disease or who have a breast cancer recurrence are also eligible. All patients who&#xD;
        participate must be able to understand and sign the informed consent. Although most&#xD;
        patients will be female, any males undergoing the above procedures are also eligible for&#xD;
        this study. Exclusion Criteria:Any patient who is less than 18 years old, who is unable to&#xD;
        understand the informed consent, or not undergoing the above procedures will be excluded&#xD;
        from this research.&#xD;
