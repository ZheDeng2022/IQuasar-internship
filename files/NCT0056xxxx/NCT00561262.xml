      RATIONALE: High-intensity focused ultrasound energy may be able to kill tumor cells by&#xD;
      heating them without affecting normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation&#xD;
      therapy works in treating patients with localized prostate cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine patient acceptability, feasibility, and side-effect profile by evaluating&#xD;
           records of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine patient acceptability, feasibility, and side-effect profile by evaluating&#xD;
           urinary symptoms and erectile function before study stage 1 (verification), before study&#xD;
           stage 2 (treatment), and at each follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effectiveness of therapy by post-treatment transrectal&#xD;
           ultrasound-guided biopsies at 6 months and if there is evidence of biochemical failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effectiveness of therapy by post-treatment MRI to evaluate area of&#xD;
           necrosis and presence of any residual tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effectiveness of therapy by measurement of prostate-specific antigen&#xD;
           (PSA) at each follow-up visit and measurement of time to PSA nadir.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effectiveness of therapy by recording the need for secondary or&#xD;
           adjuvant treatment following therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients undergo hemiablation using high-intensity focused ultrasound to the side of&#xD;
      the prostate with cancer and up to 5 mm over into the contralateral side to ensure adequacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete questionnaires periodically during study to assess urinary symptoms and&#xD;
      erectile dysfunction. These include the International Index of Erectile Function-15&#xD;
      [IIEF-15]; the International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS] and IPSS-QoL; the Functional&#xD;
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P); and the Continence Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 2-7 days, 7-14 days, and at 1,&#xD;
      3, 6, 9, and 12 months.&#xD;
