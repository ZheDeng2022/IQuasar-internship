    <textblock>
      It is generally understood that smoking during pregnancy has deleterious effects on the&#xD;
      developing fetus, although research on smoking during pregnancy has been limited in focus,&#xD;
      with most studies focused on birth weight of newborns and children's behavioral disturbances.&#xD;
      However, little is known about the neurobiological underpinnings of nicotine-related&#xD;
      developmental deficits and even less is known about genetic and environmental factors that&#xD;
      may exacerbate the risk for such deficits in some children. In this study, we propose to&#xD;
      examine the relation between antenatal exposure to nicotine and infants' stress-responses&#xD;
      before and after birth (2-days, 6-months) and its moderation of by family-based stressors and&#xD;
      genes related to nicotine metabolism and stress responsivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the risk imposed on infants by antenatal exposure to nicotine is&#xD;
      moderated by genotype that influences functioning of the HPA axis, metabolism of nicotine,&#xD;
      and stress-levels and parenting that influence the development of neural substrates (HPA&#xD;
      axis) and infants' capacity to cope with stress. There is a growing consensus that Gene x&#xD;
      Environmental (G x E) interplay likely mediated by epigenetic effects constitute one of the&#xD;
      central mechanism by which complex disorders develop. Our proposal offers an exceptional&#xD;
      paradigm to explore the association between genes, environment, and G x E interactions on the&#xD;
      neural and behavior response of children to stressful challenges.&#xD;

      Detailed Description of the Proposed Research&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design overview. A large cohort of pregnant women will be recruited, and those who meet&#xD;
      criteria will be divided into two groups according to their testimony regarding their smoking&#xD;
      behavior and saliva cotinine screening, as in our previous studies. At 3-time points, the&#xD;
      antenatal period, 2-days and 6-months of age; we will assess infants' responses to challenges&#xD;
      using biochemical, behavioral, and subjective measures. The challenges selected are &quot;proven&quot;&#xD;
      stressors and previous research has demonstrated their effectiveness in eliciting&#xD;
      stress-reactions (e.g., increased cortisol). In parallel, we will obtain an obstetric history&#xD;
      (from medical records), demographics, measure of symptomology, information on smoking and&#xD;
      drinking habits, life stresses, and family cohesion at each time point, plus information&#xD;
      about mothers' feelings/behavior and mothers' ratings of infants &quot;regulatory&quot; behavior after&#xD;
      birth. The antenatal and neonatal sessions will be carried out in Hadassah Hospital and the&#xD;
      6-month session in the developmental laboratory at Hebrew University. Genetic material will&#xD;
      be collected from parents and their infant at childbirth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Women smokers will be recruited will be recruited by nurses in well-baby clinics&#xD;
      (where physicians do routine prenatal check-ups), gynecologists, midwives, and by&#xD;
      advertisement. In addition, we will recruit women at the time of routine checks in Hadassah&#xD;
      hospital (Nuchal translucency test) at 12 weeks, triple/quadra test blood testing at 16&#xD;
      weeks, early (14-16 weeks) and advanced (20-22 week) fetal anatomy scan, and glucose test at&#xD;
      24-28 weeks) (supervised by Dr. Mankuta). In all, we will recruit 150 women for the &quot;smoking&quot;&#xD;
      group, using the following inclusion criteria: smokes at least 10 cigarettes a day (i.e.,&#xD;
      habitual smokers) no abuse of alcohol or drugs, no chronic physical disability, 22-35 years&#xD;
      of age, living with partner, speaks English, Hebrew, or Russian, natural conception). A&#xD;
      (second) group of 150 women who meet inclusion criteria (except smoking) and matched in age,&#xD;
      education, gender of infant, and parity to the &quot;smokers&quot; will serve as controls. At&#xD;
      recruitment and each time-point, mothers (and their spouses) who agree to participate in the&#xD;
      research protocol will be interviewed for smoking habits (Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire,&#xD;
      FTQ) as detailed in our previous studies on smoking. At recruitment, women will be explicitly&#xD;
      told that we are not encouraging smoking and will provide resources if, at any time, during&#xD;
      the study, they want to stop smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antenatal period (Dr. David Mankuta)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prenatal session will be carried out at 34-36 weeks of gestation (by last menstrual&#xD;
      period and confirmed by early ultrasound) and will consist of 3 phases: (1) waiting room- in&#xD;
      which mothers receive instructions, (2) ultrasound- to evaluate limb movement before and&#xD;
      after vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS), as well as measures of fetuses' well-being&#xD;
      (cardiotocograph test, biophysical profile), and (3) post exam- administration of&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limb movement. Measures of fetal limb movement are good reflections of infant state, are&#xD;
      stable from late gestation out to 4-weeks postnatal age 80 , are affected by antenatal stress&#xD;
      81, and forecast infants' state regulation 2 weeks after birth. Ultrasound (ATL 3500 and&#xD;
      5000) will be used to visualize and film the fetus for offline coding of limb movements. To&#xD;
      begin testing, infant must be in state 1F, characterized by minimal fetal movement for 2&#xD;
      minutes. When this criterion is met, baseline the VAS (Fetal Acoustic Corometrics Stimulator&#xD;
      Model 146; ≈75 HZ, ≈82 db) will be presented for 5 s. Fetal movements will be videotaped with&#xD;
      the recorder built into the scanner. During off-line time-event coding, each limb movement&#xD;
      will be counted. From these raw counts, we will average the number of movements observed in&#xD;
      10 s intervals during the 1 min prior to (baseline) and during the 5 min after stimulation.&#xD;
      Reactivity will be derived by calculating the difference between the mean baseline count and&#xD;
      the mean count recorded during the 5 s of stimulation. Regulation will be calculated as (1)&#xD;
      the slope of the counts across the post stimulation period (5 minutes), and (2) the&#xD;
      difference between the mean baseline count and the mean count of last three 10 second epochs.&#xD;
      for first time point. Previous studies have shown limb-counts to be stable (24-36 weeks),&#xD;
      reliable, and sensitive to maternal stress.&#xD;
