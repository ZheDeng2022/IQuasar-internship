  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a strain and dose-finding study in which LSN03-016011/A ETEC will be&#xD;
      administered at a starting inoculum of 5x108 cfu to 5 subjects to establish a human disease&#xD;
      model. If 80% attack rate (AR) is achieved without high output diarrhea, the same inoculum&#xD;
      will be given to 10 more subjects for confirmation of AR. If 80% AR is not achieved, attack&#xD;
      rate and severity of disease will be evaluated to determine if the dose should be increased.&#xD;
      The same sequence may be conducted with WS6788A if applicable. If the LSN strain causes high&#xD;
      output diarrhea the dose will be adjusted down and further dose characterization continued.&#xD;
      An iterative process will be used to select the optimal strain and dose with each step&#xD;
      reviewed and approved by the medical monitor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label, strain and dose-finding study designed to establish a human&#xD;
      challenge model for CS17+ ETEC that causes &gt; 80% attack rate without causing high output&#xD;
      diarrhea. Based on the strain histories, testing will commence using LSN03-016011/A. This&#xD;
      strain was isolated from a naïve adult U.S. citizen living in Turkey with a typical clinical&#xD;
      presentation for ETEC diarrheal disease and no bacterial co-pathogens isolated from the&#xD;
      stool. The host is representative of the study population for this study and for future&#xD;
      efficacy studies with anti-CS17+ ETEC vaccines. As shown in the figure below, 5x108 cfu of&#xD;
      ETEC strain (LSN03-016011/A) will initially be administered to 5 subjects. If an attack rate&#xD;
      of &gt;80% (at least 4/5 subjects) occurs with no high output diarrhea, results will be&#xD;
      confirmed in an additional 10 subjects. Additionally, an inoculum at least ½ log lower&#xD;
      (1x108) (depending on the severity of illness documented) may be administered to 10 subjects&#xD;
      to characterize the dose-response relationship. If the 5x108 cfu inoculum does cause high&#xD;
      output diarrhea, then the inoculum will be reduced appropriatelyIf the 5x108 cfu of&#xD;
      LSN03-016011/A does not cause a &gt; 80% attack rate, the next step will depend on the observed&#xD;
      attack rate and severity of illness. A low attack rate with mild disease would prompt a&#xD;
      change to the alternate strain (WS7688A) for testing, using the same pathway used with the&#xD;
      LSN strain . An attack rate &lt; 80% with most diarrhea classified as at least moderate diarrhea&#xD;
      would prompt an upward adjustment of the LSN inoculum appropriate to the findings. The&#xD;
      decision to move up or down in inoculum or to change CS17 + strains will only occur with the&#xD;
      concurrence of the medical monitor. Following each step in the strain and dose finding&#xD;
      iterations, a report summarizing the results of that step, and detailing the planned next&#xD;
      step will be signed by the principal investigator and the medical monitor. The maximum dose&#xD;
      of either strain is 1 X 109. The anticipated maximum number of subjects planned for this&#xD;
      study is 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the inpatient facility on study day -1. On study day 0, subjects&#xD;
      will have their morning meal, fast for 90 minutes, and then be given 120mL of sodium&#xD;
      bicarbonate buffer to neutralize stomach acidity. Approximately one minute later they will&#xD;
      ingest the appropriate dose and strain (either LSN03-016011/A or WS6788A ) of CS17+ ETEC&#xD;
      diluted in 30mL sodium bicarbonate buffer. Doses of the challenge inoculum will be prepared&#xD;
      by one of the study staff microbiologists. Treatment with antibiotics will start on study day&#xD;
      5, or earlier if criteria for early antibiotic treatment are fulfilled. Subjects will be&#xD;
      discharged when they feel well and have 2 consecutive stool cultures negative for CS17+ ETEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each group of 5 study subjects, the study period will include the screening period, one&#xD;
      month for the inpatient and outpatient phases, and six-months for the final phone check. The&#xD;
      study period, accounting for the serial scheduling of multiple groups of 5, processing&#xD;
      immunology specimens, study analysis and report writing, is 1 ½ years.&#xD;
