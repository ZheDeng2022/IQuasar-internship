  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SB-681323 is a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor and is currently under development by&#xD;
      GlaxoSmithKline. This will be an open label study conducted at one site. Six healthy male&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled to ensure at least four fully evaluable subjects. Each subject will&#xD;
      receive a single 10mg/ 50 µCurie oral dose of [14C]SB-681323. Urine and faecal samples will&#xD;
      be collected until 216 h after dosing but subjects may be discharged after 168 h if 90% of&#xD;
      the dose is recovered and/or &lt;1% of the dose is excreted in a 24 h period. Blood and plasma&#xD;
      will be collected at various sample times after dosing to measure parent drug and total&#xD;
      drug-related material. Samples of urine, faeces and plasma will be transferred into separate&#xD;
      study to characterise and quantify metabolites in these matrices. Safety will be assessed by&#xD;
      adverse event monitoring, vital signs, ECG and clinical laboratory tests.&#xD;
