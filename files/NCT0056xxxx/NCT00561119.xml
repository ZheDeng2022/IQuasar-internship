  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer is palliation and&#xD;
      prolongation of life with quality. Although there are no randomized trials comparing&#xD;
      chemotherapy with supportive care in women with metastatic breast cancer, chemotherapy&#xD;
      clearly provides a survival benefit in metastatic breast cancer. Due to diagnosis at earlier&#xD;
      phases of metastatic disease and more effective therapies, the median survival of patients&#xD;
      treated with modern taxane-based chemotherapy is now reaching approximately 2 years. The&#xD;
      duration of chemotherapy in patients responding or stable disease remains controversial,&#xD;
      since quality of life is not usually adversely affected and may even be improved in many&#xD;
      patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. In addition, many commonly used chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents are not limited by cumulative toxicity in metastatic breast cancer patients. Several&#xD;
      studies investigated the role of maintenance chemotherapy suggest that maintenance&#xD;
      chemotherapy is associated with superior time to progression but no survival gain. However,&#xD;
      these randomized trials did not incorporate taxane-based chemotherapeutic regimens, the new&#xD;
      standard of care in metastatic breast cancer patients these days. A 1998 metaanalysis of&#xD;
      1,986 patients randomly assigned between combination chemotherapy and single-agent therapy in&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer patients demonstrated a survival advantage to combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy, with a hazard ratio of 0.82 (range, 0.75 to 0.90). Although there are several&#xD;
      randomized trials showing negative results for survival gain in patients who received&#xD;
      maintenance chemotherapy, the role of maintenance chemotherapy with newer agents, such as&#xD;
      docetaxel or paclitaxel, have not been established yet. Although Italian MANTA trial&#xD;
      demonstrated no difference in PFS or survival between the two arms, their metaanalysis&#xD;
      advocated survival benefit of maintenance therapy. Since gemcitabine/paclitaxel (GP)&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy is one of the two regimens which showed definite survival gain with&#xD;
      favorable toxicity from a randomized trial, we plan to randomize patients who responded to&#xD;
      six cycles of GP induction chemotherapy to receive additional maintenance GP chemotherapy&#xD;
      until disease progression versus observation. We hypothesize that patients who receive&#xD;
      maintenance GP chemotherapy will do better in terms of progression free survival.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary goal of therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer is palliation and&#xD;
      prolongation of life with quality, because many if not most patients with metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer ultimately die of their disease. Although there are no randomized trials comparing&#xD;
      chemotherapy with supportive care in women with metastatic breast cancer, chemotherapy&#xD;
      clearly provides a survival benefit in early breast cancer and produces tumor shrinkage in&#xD;
      metastatic disease. Institutional databases show an improvement in the survival of patients&#xD;
      with metastatic disease over the past two decades, which may be due to diagnosis at earlier&#xD;
      phases of metastatic disease and more effective therapies. The median survival of patients&#xD;
      treated with modern taxane-based chemotherapy is now reaching approximately 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of chemotherapy in patients responding or stable disease remains controversial,&#xD;
      since quality of life is not usually adversely affected and may even be improved in many&#xD;
      patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. In addition, many commonly used chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents are not limited by cumulative toxicity in metastatic breast cancer patients. Several&#xD;
      trials have reported that continuous therapy generally prolonged the duration of remission,&#xD;
      but the effect on survival and quality of life were less consistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coates et al compared continuous therapy with AC or CMF with intermittent therapy using 3&#xD;
      cycles of the same regimen with reinstitution of therapy at the time of disease progression.&#xD;
      Patients receiving continuous therapy had superior response rates, time to progression, and&#xD;
      better quality of life, but no improvement in overall survival in this trial. A similar trial&#xD;
      by the Peidmont Oncology Association randomly assigned patients who had responding or stable&#xD;
      disease after six cycles of CAF to either CMF or observation, followed by reinstitution of&#xD;
      CMF at disease progression . Although time to progression was more than twice as long for&#xD;
      patients on continuous therapy than for those with interrupted treatment, overall survival&#xD;
      was similar. Falkson et al randomly assigned 141 patients whose measurable disease showed a&#xD;
      complete response after 6 cycles of CAF to receive either chemohormonal therapy or&#xD;
      observation and found no difference in overall survival despite of prolongation of time to&#xD;
      progression in treatment arm . In summary, these data suggest that maintenance chemotherapy&#xD;
      is associated with superior time to progression but no survival gain. However, these&#xD;
      randomized trials did not incorporate taxane-based chemotherapeutic regimens, the new&#xD;
      standard of care in metastatic breast cancer patients these days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 10 years since their initial licensing in Europe, the taxanes, paclitaxel and&#xD;
      docetaxel, have emerged as critical drugs in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      patients. In TAX 303 trial, patients with prior alkylating agent exposure were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either docetaxel, 100 mg/m2, or doxorubicin, 75 mg/m2, every 3 weeks.&#xD;
      Docetaxel produced a superior response rate (48% versus 33%, P=.008) and time to treatment&#xD;
      failure. In addition, docetaxel was less marrow suppressive, with statistically significantly&#xD;
      lower rates of thrombocytopenia, anemia, transfusions of blood and platelets, and neutropenic&#xD;
      fever. Paclitaxel has been compared with doxorubicin in two randomized trials. In a European&#xD;
      Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer study, paclitaxel (200mg/m2 administered in&#xD;
      a 3-hour infusion) was inferior to doxorubicin . In an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group&#xD;
      (ECOG) trial, 24-hour paclitaxel and doxorubicin produced equivalent results . Paclitaxel has&#xD;
      also been shown to be equivalent to CMFP (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil,&#xD;
      prednisone) chemotherapy as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survival advantage of combination chemotherapy has not been firmly established in breast&#xD;
      cancer patients yet. No trial has shown a convincing survival advantage from combination&#xD;
      therapy over single agents given in sequence. However, all published trials have been&#xD;
      criticized for being underpowered and unable to demonstrate survival differences as high as&#xD;
      20% . A 1998 metaanalysis of 1,986 patients randomly assigned between combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy and single-agent therapy in metastatic breast cancer patients demonstrated a&#xD;
      survival advantage to combination chemotherapy, with a hazard ratio of 0.82 (range, 0.75 to&#xD;
      0.90). Two recently published studies, capecitabine and docetaxel versus docetaxel alone and&#xD;
      paclitaxel and gemcitabine versus paclitaxel alone , have shown significant survival&#xD;
      advantages of combination chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the capecitabine/docetaxel study, 511 patients with measurable metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      who had received a prior anthracycline were randomly assigned to receive either docetaxel and&#xD;
      oral capecitabine or docetaxel alone [16]. The combination of docetaxel and capecitabine&#xD;
      demonstrated a higher response rate (42% vs 30%, P=.006), longer time to progression (6.1 vs&#xD;
      4.2 months, P=.0001), and longer overall survival (14.5 vs 11.5 months, P=.0126). The&#xD;
      gemcitabine/paclitaxel study randomized 529 women with chemo-naïve, measurable metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer to receive either paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 over 3 hours every 3 weeks) and&#xD;
      gemcitabine (1,250 mg/m2 over 30 minutes, on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks), or paclitaxel (175&#xD;
      mg/m2 over 3 hours every 3 weeks) alone. The combination arm showed higher response rates&#xD;
      (41% vs 22%, P&lt;.0001), longer time to progression (5.2 vs 2.9 months, P&lt;.0001), and longer&#xD;
      survival (18.5 vs 15.8 months, P=.018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the ASCO meeting 2005, Chan and colleagues reported the results of a European phase III&#xD;
      study comparing gemcitabine/docetaxel versus capecitabine/docetaxel for&#xD;
      anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients . 305 patients were randomized to&#xD;
      receive gemcitabine/docetaxel over capecitabine/docetaxel and there were no significant&#xD;
      difference in response rate, PFS, or survival between the two arms. However,&#xD;
      gemcitabine/docetaxel had a better risk-benefit profile in terms of less drug-related&#xD;
      discontinuation, less gastrointestinal toxicity, and less skin toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are several randomized trials showing negative results for survival gain in&#xD;
      patients who received maintenance chemotherapy, the role of maintenance chemotherapy with&#xD;
      newer agents, such as docetaxel or paclitaxel, have not been established yet. The Italian&#xD;
      MANTA trial has registered 451 metastatic breast cancer patients to receive induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy with epirubicin or doxorubicin/paclitaxel and further randomized 253 responders&#xD;
      (CR, PR, SD) to receive maintenance therapy with paclitaxel or observation . Although this&#xD;
      trial demonstrated no difference in PFS or survival between the two arms, their metaanalysis&#xD;
      advocated survival benefit of maintenance therapy. Since gemcitabine/paclitaxel (GP)&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy is one of the two regimens which showed definite survival gain from&#xD;
      a randomized trial, we plan to randomize patients who responded to six cycles of GP induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy to receive additional maintenance GP chemotherapy until disease progression&#xD;
      versus observation. We hypothesize that patients who receive maintenance GT chemotherapy will&#xD;
      do better in terms of progression free survival.&#xD;
