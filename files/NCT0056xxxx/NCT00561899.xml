  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) offers a way of preventing malaria infection without&#xD;
      compromising the development of malaria immunity or encouraging drug resistance. The effect&#xD;
      of IPT in children in the prevention of malaria has been evaluated in a number of trials in&#xD;
      areas of seasonal malaria transmission. Results from these trials have shown that IPTc&#xD;
      provided between 40% - 86% protection against clinical malaria. In 2006, a trial that&#xD;
      compared two methods of IPTc delivery was carried out in Upper River Division, The Gambia.&#xD;
      Preliminary results of the trial have shown that the treatment was very effective as only 4%&#xD;
      (45/1133) of the children seen at the end of year cross-sectional survey were parasitaemic.&#xD;
      Tolerability was assessed in a subset of 1100 children and the results showed that about&#xD;
      13.5% of children developed mild to moderate vomiting. Malaise was present in about 10% of&#xD;
      the study subjects. Severe adverse events were rare. Thus it is important to investigate if&#xD;
      other drug regimens might be equally effective in preventing malaria but less likely to cause&#xD;
      adverse events. During the 2007 malaria transmission season, 1009 children aged 1-5 years&#xD;
      will be individually randomized to receive amodiaquine plus SP, piperaquine plus SP or&#xD;
      Artekin TM (dihdroartemisinin plus piperaquine) at monthly intervals on three occasions&#xD;
      during the months of September, October, and November. To determine the prevalence of side&#xD;
      effects following drug administration participants in each treatment group will be visited at&#xD;
      home three and seven days after each round of drug administration and a side effects&#xD;
      questionnaire completed. To help establish whether these adverse events are drug related, the&#xD;
      same questionnaire will be administered after each treatment round, to 286 age-matched&#xD;
      children who are not part of the trial. The primary ends points will be the incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective To determine the safety and tolerability of amodiaquine(AQ) (three days)&#xD;
      plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine(SP) (one day), piperaquine(PQP) (three days) plus SP (one&#xD;
      day), and Artekin TM (PQP plus dihydroartemisinin, DHA) (3 days) when used for seasonal IPT&#xD;
      in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective To determine the efficacy of AQ (three days) plus SP (one day), PQP&#xD;
      (three days) plus SP (one day) and Artekin TM (3 days) when used for seasonal IPT in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Randomisation Open-label, individual randomisation was carried out three weeks before the&#xD;
      first dose of IPTc administration in September 2007. Study subjects were individually&#xD;
      randomised into either the AQ plus SP, PQP plus SP or ArtekinTM treatment groups in a 1:1:1&#xD;
      fashion. An independent statistician generated the randomizing subject study number (SSN)&#xD;
      that assigned each SSN to one of the treatment groups. A photo ID card was given to all&#xD;
      participants to facilitate identification at every contact, at home or in the health centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Drug distribution at the health centres Study subjects and their parents were informed&#xD;
      about the date of treatment approximately one week before any intervention. Treatment is&#xD;
      scheduled to be given during the months of September, October and November. Drugs are to be&#xD;
      given at the nearest health centre by a designated member of staff. Tablets are crushed,&#xD;
      mixed with honey or suspended in water and given on a spoon. Staff who administer drugs at&#xD;
      the health centre play no further part in the trial. All participants are kept under&#xD;
      observation for 30 minutes after drugs are taken. In case of vomiting, the drug is&#xD;
      re-administrated. At the time of each monthly drug administration, a brief clinical&#xD;
      assessment is carried out. Children who are febrile are screened for malaria using a rapid&#xD;
      antigen test. Children found to have malaria are treated with Lumefantrine-artemether&#xD;
      (CoartemTM, Norvatis Pharma., Basel Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7 Morbidity surveillance during the rainy season Passive surveillance for malaria will be&#xD;
      maintained throughout the transmission season. Parents/guardians are being encouraged to take&#xD;
      their children to the health centre identified as being closest to their home at any time&#xD;
      that their child becomes unwell. Project staff are based at each of these health facilities&#xD;
      to identify children in the trial and to ensure that they are seen, properly investigated and&#xD;
      treated promptly. At each clinic visit, axillary temperature is recorded using a digital&#xD;
      thermometer and haemoglobin concentration measured using a Hemocue machine. A dipstick for&#xD;
      diagnosis of malaria is to be used if fever (axillary temperature of ³ 37.5°C) or a history&#xD;
      of fever within the previous 48 hours is present. In such cases, a thick blood smear is also&#xD;
      be collected for subsequent confirmation of the diagnosis. Study subjects with documented&#xD;
      fever (axillary temperature of ³ 37.5°C) or history of recent fever and malaria parasitaemia&#xD;
      are treated with Coartem. The treatment of study subjects seen at the health centres for&#xD;
      other conditions is being carried out in accordance with national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.8 End of malaria transmission season cross-sectional survey Children enrolled in the study&#xD;
      will be seen at the OPD clinic at the end of malaria transmission season for examination by a&#xD;
      study physician and a finger-prick blood sample will be obtained for preparation of a thick&#xD;
      blood smear and determination of haemoglobin concentration. A standardized questionnaire will&#xD;
      be administered to the parents/guardians of the study subject, to collect information&#xD;
      regarding illness that had occurred since the last visit, symptoms experienced, use of&#xD;
      healthcare facilities and use of medicines. Information on the use of bed nets will be&#xD;
      collected again at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.10. Assessment of adverse events To determine the prevalence of minor side effects&#xD;
      following drug administration such as headache, fever, weakness, abdominal pain, anorexia,&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, itching or sleep disorder participants in each treatment&#xD;
      group are to be visited at home three and seven days after each round of drug administration&#xD;
      and a side effects questionnaire completed. Field workers who complete these questionnaires&#xD;
      will be unaware of the treatment group to which the child belongs. To help establish whether&#xD;
      these adverse events are drug related, the same questionnaire will be administered once after&#xD;
      each treatment round, to 286 children who are not part of the trial, recruited from nearby&#xD;
      villages and matched for age to children in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any serious adverse event that occurs during the study period will be reported to the Local&#xD;
      Safety Monitor and Chairman of DSMB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-point:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Incidence of any adverse events during the observation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean Hb (g/dl) at the end of malaria transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevalence of malaria parasitaemia at the end of the malaria transmission season.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of OPD attendances with malaria that meet the case definitions as indicated below&#xD;
           during the surveillance period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and analysis All baseline, surveillance and laboratory data will be collected&#xD;
      on forms designed for the trial. Field and laboratory staff will be trained to follow the&#xD;
      procedures set out in a series of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Key data will be&#xD;
      double entered and inconsistencies checked; range checks will be used for standard variables.&#xD;
      Primary analyses will be performed on an intention to treat (ITT) basis. Any child who&#xD;
      receives a first dose of drug will be included in the ITT analysis. Children who are&#xD;
      randomised but who do not receive any mediation will not be included in this analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations Drugs for IPT need to be acceptable and have low frequency of&#xD;
      adverse events. If the frequency of adverse events is 20% in the SP/AQ group, a trial with&#xD;
      286 children per arm has 90% power to detect a halving in the frequency of adverse events,&#xD;
      using a significance level of 0.05, or a reduction to 9% or less if a significance of 0.025&#xD;
      is used (to preserve an overall type 1 error rate of 5% for the primary endpoint when there&#xD;
      are 2 comparisons, each alternative drug group with SP/AQ). If the frequency of adverse&#xD;
      events is 15%, a reduction to 5% or less can be detected with the same power, and if the&#xD;
      frequency is 10% a reduction to 2% or less can be detected. Based on experience from several&#xD;
      studies the drop-out rate is not expected to exceed 15% and is likely to be less. Allowing&#xD;
      for 15% drop out, a sample size of 286*3/(1-0.15)=1009 is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal during the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects may be withdrawn from the study for any one of the following reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Withdrawal of parental / legal guardian's consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Serious adverse event attributable to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Loss to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children who develop adverse events attributable to study drugs should not receive further&#xD;
      doses but should be followed-up to monitor safety until the resolution of the adverse&#xD;
      reaction.&#xD;
