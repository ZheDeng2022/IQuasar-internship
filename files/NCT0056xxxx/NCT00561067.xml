    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of erythropoietin&#xD;
      (EPO) treatment in spinal shock in comparison with the methylprednisolone treatment (MP).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) is devastating for the patient and costly to society.&#xD;
      Currently, methylprednisolone (MP) administered according NASCIS (III) protocol is the only&#xD;
      therapy which has minor benefits and is accompanied by dangerous side effects. Any new&#xD;
      treatment of TSCI that allows major recovery of function would be a significant advance in&#xD;
      clinical care. Much of the motor and sensory paralysis following TSCI occurs because of a&#xD;
      delayed and widespread oligodendrocyte apoptosis and demyelination of long spinal tracts. We&#xD;
      have recently reported that erythropoietin (EPO) administration significantly attenuates such&#xD;
      delayed secondary degeneration and promotes functional recovery in TSCI animal models. The&#xD;
      research proposed is a multicenter trial involving the Italian Spinal Units that have&#xD;
      developed a multidisciplinary experience on the management of TSCI. Primary objective of the&#xD;
      study is to assess the superiority of EPO compared to MP in improving the clinical outcome of&#xD;
      SCI (ASIA Impairment Scale); secondary objectives are: to assess the safety of EPO compared&#xD;
      to MP, the effects on the motor and sensory functions and on improving functional autonomy,&#xD;
      the influence on spasticity and neurogenic pain, and, the impact on surrogate end-points&#xD;
      (Somatosensory Evoked Potentials and Magnetic Resonance Imaging).The study population is&#xD;
      characterized by all patients with TSCI (ASIA Impairment Scale A or B) admitted to Italian&#xD;
      Spinal Units: we estimate an enrolment of 100 subjects , 50 in each therapeutic arm. The&#xD;
      study proposed is a single-blind randomized phase III parallel group trial in which eligible&#xD;
      patients are randomized to one of the following treatment modalities: MP according to NASCIS&#xD;
      III protocol or EPO iv (500 UI/kg within 8 hours after the SCI, dosage repeated at 24 and 48&#xD;
      hours). The duration of the study will be 24 months, with a 21-month maximum time to engage&#xD;
      all the patients required by the power calculation.The primary end-point will be assessed&#xD;
      using the Cochrane-Mantel-Haenzel test; the changes in the SEP (latency) and size of the MRI&#xD;
      lesions using the Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), the Ashworth, VAS, PENN,&#xD;
      and SCIM scores with the parametric Wilcoxon's signed-ranks test. The effect of treatment on&#xD;
      the primary end-point will be evaluated using a multivariate analysis model (binary logistic&#xD;
      regression). The non-parametric alternative will be conducted if the assumption of normality&#xD;
      will be not verified.&#xD;
