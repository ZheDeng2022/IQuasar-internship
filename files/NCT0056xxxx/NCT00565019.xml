      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dupuytren's contracture is a common hand problem that causes certain fingers to bend towards&#xD;
      the palm. Patients with this condition cannot perform daily activities and many are unable to&#xD;
      work. It is usually treated by an operation to straighten the fingers followed by therapy if&#xD;
      the angle that the fingers are bent at is large enough. However, no treatment has been able&#xD;
      to completely prevent the angle from persisting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to examine whether or not the use of a drug in combination with&#xD;
      surgery will improve the angle at which the fingers are bent more than surgery alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who receive triamcinolone acetonide will have straighter fingers compared with&#xD;
      subjects who only have the operation and no triamcinolone acetonide at both 3 months and 6&#xD;
      months after the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients interested in having the operation to treat Dupuytren's contracture will be&#xD;
      asked if they would like to join the study. Subjects will be randomly placed into one of two&#xD;
      groups: the steroid injection group or the control group. Subjects will have a pre-operative&#xD;
      visit, the surgery, and follow-ups at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. All subjects will have&#xD;
      the operation, but only those in the steroid injection group will receive an injection of the&#xD;
      drug. During the 6 week and 3 month follow-ups, subjects in the steroid injection group may&#xD;
      receive another injection if their fingers are still bent. Angles are measured at the&#xD;
      pre-operative visit and at 3 and 6 months. The change in angle from before to after and any&#xD;
      differences in the groups, in time points and interactions between the two will be analyzed.&#xD;

    <description>Triamcinolone acetonide will be administered into the cord following surgery with a tuberculin syringe and a 25-gauge needle.&#xD;
Doses will range from 60-120 mg depending on extent of the disease.&#xD;
Patients will receive injections at 6 weeks and 3 months for persisting nodules or cords.&#xD;
PI will determine the dosages. Estimates will be made based on the following:&#xD;
Size of nodule/cord: 1-2 cm2, dosage 20-40 mg&#xD;
Size of nodule/cord: 2-6 cm2, dosage 40-80 mg&#xD;
Size of nodule/cord: 6-10 cm2, dosage 80-100 mg&#xD;
Size of nodule/cord: &gt;10 cm2, dosage 100-120 mg</description>
