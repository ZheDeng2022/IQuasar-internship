      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from mouse DNA may help the body build an effective immune response&#xD;
      to kill cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of mouse DNA vaccine&#xD;
      in treating patients with recurrent B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and feasibility of intramuscular DNA vaccination with a plasmid&#xD;
           DNA vector expressing the mouse extracellular domain of CD20, namely pINGmminiCD20.&#xD;
           Doses of pING-mminiCD20 will be escalated by group to determine the optimal biological&#xD;
           dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate antibody and T-cell responses to CD20 after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe patients for evidence of any antitumor response generated after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: The entire immunization schedule comprises five injections administered every three&#xD;
      weeks (for a total of approximately four and one half months). After the second injection,&#xD;
      blood will be drawn for assessment of antibody and T-cell responses. After the fifth and&#xD;
      final injection, blood will again be drawn for assessment of antibody and T-cell responses.&#xD;

    <description>This single arm, open-label, phase I clinical trial of xenogeneic CD20 DNA vaccination is designed to evaluate its safety in patients with B cell lymphoma. The study is a dose escalation study at three test doses, 0.5 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg of purified plasmid DNA per injection. There will be an initial cohort of three patients receiving a pre-level 1 dose of 0.1 mg/vaccination before proceeding to the three test doses.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a functional immune system as determined by the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum proteins immunoelectrophoresis (serum IgG levels ≥ 0.5 g/dL are required)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of anergy as shown by positive skin test with tetanus toxoid, mumps or&#xD;
             Candida. OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Circulating T-cells as measured by flow cytometry (serum CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts ≥&#xD;
             250 and 150 cells/μL, respectively) Patients must have histologically proven (and&#xD;
             confirmed at MSKCC) B-cell lymphoma of any histology, excluding Burkitt's lymphoma,&#xD;
             Lymphoblastic lymphoma (due to their aggressiveness and low likelihood of response to&#xD;
             immune therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD20 surface expression must be confirmed by immunohistochemical staining or flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease is not a pre-requisite for enrollment in the study. However, if a&#xD;
             patient does have measurable disease as evidenced by imaging studies, these have to be&#xD;
             done within eight weeks of starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;

             following one or more prior regimens of chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiation&#xD;
             therapy (including autologous stem cell transplants), not requiring immediate&#xD;
             cytoreductive chemotherapy. All treatment must be completed at least four weeks prior&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more&#xD;
             than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
