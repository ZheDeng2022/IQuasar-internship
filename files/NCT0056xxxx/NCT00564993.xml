      Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to identify markers of right ventricular dysfunction in patients with&#xD;
      severe pulmonary regurgitation following repair of Tetralogy of Fallot, that allow prediction&#xD;
      of the optimal timing of the replacement of the regurgitant valve. The investigators will use&#xD;
      MR as a gold-standard reference for measurement of cardiac function during rest and&#xD;
      dobutamine stress. The investigators will also evaluate the predictive potential of tissue&#xD;
      Doppler imaging in this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To predict the optimum timing of pulmonary valve replacement for severe regurgitation in&#xD;
      repaired Tetralogy of Fallot using Cardiac Magnetic resonance with dobutamine stress testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is the single commonest complex cardiac condition. It consists of&#xD;
      ventricular septal defect (VSD), overriding of the aorta in association with the VSD,&#xD;
      pulmonary stenosis and right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy. Surgical repair is indicated as it&#xD;
      significantly improves life-expectancy. The results of surgical repair have improved steadily&#xD;
      over the last 40 years resulting in a significant population surviving into young adulthood.&#xD;
      However, standard repair techniques induce regurgitation of the pulmonary valve due to relief&#xD;
      of the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Over time this regurgitation induces&#xD;
      right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction. RV dilatation and dysfunction correlate with&#xD;
      reduced exercise tolerance, arrhythmias, and sudden death following repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Replacement of the pulmonary valve, late after primary repair of ToF, has generally been&#xD;
      shown to improve symptoms as measured by NYHA classification as it improves haemodynamics,&#xD;
      exercise tolerance and dysrhythmia. Though generally safe, surgical replacement of the&#xD;
      pulmonary valve exposes the patient to cardio-pulmonary by-pass, which may have detrimental&#xD;
      effects on both the myocardium and the brain. Furthermore transplanted valves of various&#xD;
      types have a limited life span and thus early repair of the pulmonary valve may instigate a&#xD;
      series of re-operations, which will recur throughout the patient's life exposing them to a&#xD;
      cumulative risk of morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately there is evidence in the literature&#xD;
      that symptomatic improvement is reduced if pulmonary valve replacement is delayed for too&#xD;
      long. This is probably due to irreversible myocardial damage with little remodeling of the RV&#xD;
      despite a competent pulmonary valve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the light of these two opposing factors; potential for failure to recover and avoiding&#xD;
      multiple operations there is a need to establish preoperative markers which will allow&#xD;
      identification of the failing ventricle before it passes the point of recovery. This will&#xD;
      allow close follow-up with intervention timed to minimize loss of function whilst taking into&#xD;
      account the likely need for re-operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is still unclear, which criteria give the best indication for the need of&#xD;
      re-interventions. Two other studies of the Competence Network for Congenital Heart Defects&#xD;
      (&quot;Follow up of Post-Repair Tetralogy of Fallot (HP 4.1)&quot; and &quot;Early re-intervention in&#xD;
      infants and small children after correction of Tetralogy of Fallot: Prospective analysis of&#xD;
      myocardial benefit using cardiac MRI and echocardiography (HP 4.2)&quot; analyze the benefit of&#xD;
      such re-interventions and will hopefully provide substantive information on timing of PVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are however references in literature that cardiac imaging procedure under stress&#xD;
      possibly results in more sensitive predictive parameters of right ventricular insufficiency&#xD;
      than conducted under rest. Dobutamine stress testing has a long history of safe and&#xD;
      clinically useful application in ischemic cardiomyopathy and recent studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      it's useful predictive value in various outcomes for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate post-operative characterization will allow identification of pre-operative&#xD;
      predictive markers. The investigators believe that dobutamine stress testing may in fact be&#xD;
      an excellent predictive marker. Dobutamine increases intrinsic contractability as well as&#xD;
      reducing after load. It is thought that the failing heart is not able to positively respond&#xD;
      to the dobutamine stimulus, and dobutamine stress will thus demonstrate evidence of&#xD;
      irreversible damage. Identification of predictive markers of the point at which irreversible&#xD;
      myocardial damage occurs will allow better timing of pulmonary valve replacement and will&#xD;
      have significant ramifications for the management of this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study imaging procedures (MRI and echocardiography) under rest and stress&#xD;
      (dobutamine) are compared before and after pulmonary valve replacement at severe pulmonary&#xD;
      insufficiency after repair of Tetralogy of Fallot, whereas the imaging procedure of&#xD;
      echocardiography under stress is optional. The data obtained are supposed to determine new&#xD;
      parameters of the early right ventricular insufficiency. The investigators will correlate the&#xD;
      above objective data with subjective data of change in symptoms and exercise capacity pre-&#xD;
      and post-repair. Fallot patients with a good result of repair and good right ventricular&#xD;
      function will serve as a comparison group.&#xD;
