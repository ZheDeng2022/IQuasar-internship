    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies carboplatin, paclitaxel and gemcitabine hydrochloride&#xD;
      when given together with or without bevacizumab after surgery to see how well it works in&#xD;
      treating patients with ovarian, epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that&#xD;
      has come back. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, paclitaxel and gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet&#xD;
      known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective when given with or without&#xD;
      bevacizumab after surgery in treating patients with ovarian, epithelial, primary peritoneal,&#xD;
      or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if surgical secondary cytoreduction in addition to adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      increases the duration of overall survival in patients with recurrent platinum sensitive&#xD;
      epithelial ovarian cancer, peritoneal primary or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if the addition of bevacizumab to the second-line and maintenance phases of&#xD;
      treatment increases the duration of overall survival relative to second-line paclitaxel and&#xD;
      carboplatin alone in patients with recurrent platinum sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer,&#xD;
      peritoneal primary or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if the addition of bevacizumab to the second-line and maintenance phase of&#xD;
      treatment increases the duration of progression-free survival relative to second-line&#xD;
      paclitaxel and carboplatin alone in patients with recurrent platinum sensitive epithelial&#xD;
      ovarian cancer, peritoneal primary or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To prospectively determine the incidence of carboplatin and paclitaxel hypersensitivity&#xD;
      in these patients undergoing retreatment with both agents as first recurrence therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine if surgical secondary cytoreduction in addition to adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      increases quality of life (QOL) in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive epithelial&#xD;
      ovarian cancer, peritoneal primary or fallopian tube cancer, as measured by the Functional&#xD;
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian (FACT-O) trial outcome index and Rand Short Form (SF)-36&#xD;
      physical functioning scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine if the addition of bevacizumab to the second-line and maintenance phases of&#xD;
      treatment increases QOL relative to second-line paclitaxel and carboplatin alone in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, peritoneal primary or fallopian tube&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define molecular and biochemical profiles associated with the duration of&#xD;
      progression-free survival in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian, peritoneal primary or&#xD;
      fallopian tube carcinoma treated with combination chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab&#xD;
      followed with or without maintenance bevacizumab therapy in the presence or absence of&#xD;
      secondary surgical cytoreduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To identify molecular determinants that predict sensitivity or resistance to carboplatin&#xD;
      and paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab followed with or without maintenance bevacizumab&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To bank deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from whole blood for research and evaluate the&#xD;
      association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and measures of clinical outcome&#xD;
      including overall survival, progression-free survival and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups. Patients who are not candidates&#xD;
      for surgical cytoreduction (i.e., those for whom complete cytoreduction in the estimation of&#xD;
      the investigator is impossible or a medical infirmity precludes exploration and debulking)&#xD;
      are eligible to receive chemotherapy after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are eligible for surgery undergo abdominal exploration with cytoreduction.&#xD;
      Patients are then randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours or docetaxel IV over 1&#xD;
      hour and carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive chemotherapy as in Arm I and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 8 and&#xD;
      carboplatin as in Arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM IV: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV as in Arm III, bevacizumab IV and&#xD;
      carboplatin IV as in Arm II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with measurable disease achieving a clinical response (CR) receive 6-8 courses of&#xD;
      therapy. Patients with stable disease or partial regression receive a maximum of 8 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients without measurable lesions as determined by a computed tomography (CT) scan prior to&#xD;
      initiating study treatment continue therapy for 6 courses or, if cancer antigen (CA)-125&#xD;
      normalizes, for 2 courses beyond CA-125 normalization, whichever is greater. Patients in Arm&#xD;
      II then receive a maintenance regimen comprising bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes. Treatment&#xD;
      with bevacizumab alone repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,&#xD;
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then yearly for 5 years.&#xD;

    <description>Patient reported quality of life was measured with the Treatment Outcome Index (TOI) of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for ovarian cancer (FACT-O TOI). The FACT-O TOI is a scale for assessing general QOL of ovarian cancer patients. It consists of three subscales: Physical Well Being (7 items), Functional Well Being (7 items), and Ovarian Cancer subscale (11 items). Each item in the FACT-O TOI was scored using a 5-point scale (0=not at all; 1=a little bit; 2=somewhat; 3=quite a bit; 4=very much). The FACT-O TOI score ranges 0-100 with a large score suggests better QOL.</description>

    <description>Patient reported physical functioning was measured with physical functioning subscale of the RAND SF-36. The Physical Functioning Subscale consists of 10 items concerning activities of daily living: walking, climbing stairs, bathing, dressing, and performance of physical activities. Each item is rated on a three-point scale of limitation of activity due to the patients' health from 1=limited a lot to 3=not limited. The total PF score is the summation of item scores and then rescaled to 0-100. A larger score suggests better physical functioning.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have clinically evident recurrent disease for the purpose of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]) is defined&#xD;
             as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension&#xD;
             (longest dimension to be recorded); each lesion must be more than or equal to 20 mm&#xD;
             when measured by conventional techniques, MRI or CT, or more than or equal to 10 mm&#xD;
             when measured by spiral CT&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500/mm^3, equivalent to&#xD;
             Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version (v)4.0 (CTCAE) grade 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mm^3 (CTCAE grade 0-1)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  This eligibility criterion does not apply to patients enrolled after August 28, 2011;&#xD;
             patients who are not candidates for surgical cytoreduction are eligible for the&#xD;
             chemotherapy randomization; patients are not considered candidates for surgical&#xD;
             cytoreduction if complete cytoreduction in the estimation of the investigator is&#xD;

             excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior histologic diagnosis of borderline, low malignant potential&#xD;
             (grade 0) epithelial carcinoma that was surgically resected and who subsequently&#xD;
             developed an unrelated, new invasive epithelial ovarian or peritoneal primary cancer&#xD;
             are eligible provided that they meet the criteria listed above&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require parenteral hydration or nutrition and have evidence of partial&#xD;
             bowel obstruction or perforation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy for any abdominal or pelvic tumor (other&#xD;
             than ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal) are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with synchronous primary endometrial cancer, or a past history of primary&#xD;
             endometrial cancer, are excluded, unless all of the following conditions are met:&#xD;
             stage not greater than I-B; no more than superficial myometrial invasion, without&#xD;
             vascular or lymphatic invasion; no poorly differentiated subtypes, including papillary&#xD;
             serous, clear cell or other International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics&#xD;
             (FIGO) grade 3 lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with concurrent severe medical problems unrelated to the malignancy that&#xD;
             would significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to&#xD;
             extreme risk or decreased life expectancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with &gt;= grade 2 peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of allergic reactions to carboplatin and/or paclitaxel or&#xD;
             chemically similar compounds; patients with allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions to&#xD;
             these chemotherapeutic agents are NOT excluded IF they were successfully retreated&#xD;
             following a desensitization program or protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This criterion applies only to the patients enrolled before August 29, 2011 and those&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients of childbearing potential, not practicing adequate contraception, patients&#xD;
             who are pregnant or patients who are nursing are not eligible for this trial; to date,&#xD;
             no fetal studies in animal or humans have been performed; the possibility of harm to a&#xD;
             fetus is likely; bevacizumab specifically inhibits VEGF, which is responsible for the&#xD;
             formation of new blood vessels during development, and antibodies can cross the&#xD;
             placenta; therefore, bevacizumab should not be administered to pregnant women; in&#xD;
             addition, there are unknown immediate and long-term consequences of chemotherapy&#xD;
             administration to these women; in addition, surgical exploration as mandated by&#xD;
             randomization during pregnancy may cause imminent mortal consequences; further, it is&#xD;
             not known whether bevacizumab is excreted in human milk; because many drugs are&#xD;
             excreted in human milk, bevacizumab should not be administered to nursing women;&#xD;
             subjects will be apprised of the large potential risk to a developing fetus&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other invasive malignancies, with the exception of non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancer, who had (or have) any evidence of the other cancer present within the last 5&#xD;
             years or whose previous cancer treatment contraindicates this protocol therapy&#xD;
&#xD;

             enrolled after this date electing to receive bevacizumab; patients with active&#xD;
             bleeding or pathologic conditions that carry high risk of bleeding such as a known&#xD;
             bleeding disorder, coagulopathy, or tumor involving major vessels&#xD;
&#xD;

             primary brain tumor, seizures not controlled with standard medical therapy, any brain&#xD;
             metastases or a history of stroke within 5 years of the first date of treatment on&#xD;
             this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This criterion applies only to the patients enrolled before August 29, 2011 and those&#xD;
             enrolled after this date electing to receive bevacizumab; patients with clinically&#xD;
             significant cardiovascular disease; this includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with significant cardiac conduction abnormalities, i.e. PR interval &gt;&#xD;
                  0.24 seconds (sec) or 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular (AV) block&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as systolic &gt; 150 mm Hg or diastolic &gt; 90 mm&#xD;

                  permanent deficit)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of cerebrovascular attack (CVA) within six months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This criterion applies only to the patients enrolled before August 29, 2011 and those&#xD;

             surgery/procedure that results in an open wound, or significant traumatic injury&#xD;
             within 28 days prior to the first date of treatment on this study, or anticipation of&#xD;
             need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study; patients with&#xD;
             placement of vascular access device or core biopsy within 7 days prior to the first&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing pre-treatment secondary cytoreduction will undergo therapy with&#xD;
             bevacizumab on cycle #2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing pre-treatment surgery for purposes other than cytoreduction may&#xD;
             also participate provided they meet eligibility; patients randomized to arms&#xD;
             containing bevacizumab must wait a minimum of 28 days since that procedure to begin&#xD;
             protocol treatment; patients who undergo an uncomplicated port placement must wait a&#xD;
             minimum of 7 days to begin protocol treatment&#xD;

        <description>Patient reported quality of life was measured with the Treatment Outcome Index (TOI) of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for ovarian cancer (FACT-O TOI). The FACT-O TOI is a scale for assessing general QOL of ovarian cancer patients. It consists of three subscales: Physical Well Being (7 items), Functional Well Being (7 items), and Ovarian Cancer subscale (11 items). Each item in the FACT-O TOI was scored using a 5-point scale (0=not at all; 1=a little bit; 2=somewhat; 3=quite a bit; 4=very much). The FACT-O TOI score ranges 0-100 with a large score suggests better QOL.</description>

        <title>Patient Reported Physical Functioning (Surgery Analysis)</title>
        <description>Patient reported physical functioning was measured with physical functioning subscale of the RAND SF-36. The Physical Functioning subscale consists of 10 items concerning activities of daily living: walking, climbing stairs, bathing, dressing, and performance of physical activities. Each item is rated on a three-point scale of limitation of activity due to the patients' health from 1=limited a lot to 3=not limited. The total PF score is the summation of item scores and then rescaled to 0-100. A larger score suggests better physical functioning. This measure was completed by US patients only.</description>
