    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to use computed tomography urography (CTU) scans&#xD;
      and intravenous urography (IVU) scans to check the status of urothelial cancer, in order to&#xD;
      try to learn the level of effectiveness of possibly using CTU by itself in future patients.&#xD;

      Background for the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, IVU is used to detect urothelial tumors and then computed tomography (CT) scans&#xD;
      are performed after that, to check the status of the disease. This is typically done every 3&#xD;
      months for the first 2 years after diagnosis, and then every 6 months for the next 2 years.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn if this current routine method of using 2 diagnostic procedures can&#xD;
      be replaced with CTU alone, in future patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTU uses the same scanner machine as CT scans do. The difference between these 2 types of&#xD;
      scans is that in addition to collecting the same type of images and information that CT scans&#xD;
      do, CTU may also allow the doctor to look at the lining of the tubes that carry urine from&#xD;
      the bladder. Looking at the lining of these tubes is something that IVU is used for, and&#xD;
      researchers want to find out if CTU can also be used for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have a CTU procedure&#xD;
      performed at least a day before or after your routine IVU. If your doctor has ordered a CT of&#xD;
      your abdomen and pelvis and IVU, the CTU will be performed instead of a routine CT scan of&#xD;
      the abdomen and pelvis that would normally occur. If your doctor has ordered just a CTU, you&#xD;
      will have an IVU as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTU Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CTU procedure is very similar to the standard CT of the abdomen/pelvis that you would&#xD;
      otherwise receive along with an ITU. To prepare for the CTU, you will be asked to drink&#xD;
      contrast solution (a type of dye) in order to allow the tumor(s) to be more easily seen and&#xD;
      checked. You will be given about 30 ounces (3 3/4 cups) of contrast solution to drink at 30&#xD;
      minutes before the CTU and another 7 Â½ ounces (about a cup) of contrast solution to drink&#xD;
      while you are on the scanning table. You will also receive Lasix (furosemide) by injection.&#xD;
      Furosemide is given to help the tubes in your kidney dilate (expand) to improve the quality&#xD;
      of the images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the CTU , you will lie flat on a CT scanner and will receive additional contrast solution&#xD;
      by vein during the scan. While the scan is being performed, you will be asked to hold your&#xD;
      breath several times, for about 15-20 seconds each time. The process of having the CTU&#xD;
      performed should take about 10 minutes longer than a regular CT scan. If the images are not&#xD;
      clear enough, all or part of the scanning process may need to be repeated (without repeating&#xD;
      the contrast).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVU Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Either before the CTU or after it, depending on the order in which you were assigned to&#xD;
      receive these procedures, you will receive the IVU as part of your routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one set of IVU and CTU scans have been performed, your participation in this study will&#xD;
      be over. At least 3 months after your scans are performed, your images will be reviewed a&#xD;
      second time by 2 additional M. D. Anderson doctors (radiologists) to compare their findings&#xD;
      with the original radiologist's findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The routine way to check the status of urothelial cancer is&#xD;
      to use IVU and CT scanning. It is considered experimental, however, to use CTU instead of&#xD;
      routine CT scanning for checking the status of urothelial cancer. At this time, using CTU for&#xD;
      this purpose is being done in research only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 135 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
