  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoglycemia is the principal barrier to the achievement of target glycemic goals in type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. Alcohol consumption is very prevalent in our society and a proven cause of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. Population studies suggest that elderly, insulin requiring type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      patients are particularly vulnerable to severe hypoglycemia and that this problem accounts&#xD;
      for an estimated $50 million or more in healthcare costs in the USA each year. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that low dose ethanol significantly increases the vulnerability to overnight hypoglycemia and&#xD;
      impairs the recovery of plasma glucose in elderly, insulin requiring patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. Our preliminary studies suggest that low dose ethanol impairs recovery from day&#xD;
      time insulin-induced hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes patients but not in age matched healthy&#xD;
      control subjects. The proposed studies will examine the effects of low dose ethanol on&#xD;
      overnight glucose regulation in elderly, insulin requiring type 2 diabetes patients and will&#xD;
      establish the mechanism of these impairments through a series of systematic evaluations.&#xD;
      Specifically, these studies will document suppression of the dawn phenomenon by ethanol,&#xD;
      and/or exacerbation of a deficient counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia during sleep,&#xD;
      especially growth hormone. Specific mechanisms for the suppression of growth hormone to be&#xD;
      examined include that evening ethanol (3) inhibits peak overnight ghrelin secretion and/or&#xD;
      (4) reduces pituitary sensitivity to GHRH. Additionally, these studies will characterize (5)&#xD;
      the dose response characteristics of ethanol on overnight glucose homeostasis and will (6)&#xD;
      carefully evaluate the effect of the timing of ethanol administration in relation to meal&#xD;
      ingestion on overnight hypoglycemic vulnerability. To address these aims, we will assess the&#xD;
      effect of moderate doses of orally administered ethanol or placebo on overnight growth&#xD;
      hormone release, ghrelin, total IGF-1, free IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein&#xD;
      1 (IGFBP-1) concentrations, glucose production and other parameters of glucose homeostasis&#xD;
      among elderly control subjects versus elderly, insulin requiring subjects with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. These important studies will provide a scientific basis for the prevention of&#xD;
      overnight hypoglycemia (and the attendant cost savings) by providing mechanistic insights&#xD;
      into the causes of nocturnal hypoglycemia.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria: All type 2 diabetes subjects will be aged 50 to 75 years and will have&#xD;
        carried the diagnosis of diabetes according to standard criteria and will be receiving&#xD;
        insulin therapy alone or in combination with oral diabetes medications for at least 6&#xD;
        months. To exclude subjects with type 1 diabetes, all patients will be anti-GAD antibody&#xD;
        negative and will retain the ability to secrete some nominal level of c-peptide in response&#xD;
        to stimulation (i.e.- at least 2 ng/ml after ingesting Boost Plus). All subjects will be&#xD;
        mentally fit to give informed consent. Nondiabetic control subjects will meet similar&#xD;
        inclusion criteria (except for diabetes and hemoglobin A1C criteria). Control subjects will&#xD;
        be matched as a group for age, gender and BMI. Finally, control subjects will undergo a&#xD;
        standard 75 gram Oral Glucose Tolerance Test to assure the presence of normal glucose&#xD;
        tolerance (142).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria: Exclusion criteria for all study subjects will include the existence of&#xD;
        severe cardiovascular, hepatic or renal disease, or current malignancy as determined by the&#xD;
        screening evaluation. Subjects with a past or current history of drug or alcohol abuse will&#xD;
        also be excluded from study, as will subjects with a previously diagnosed seizure disorder,&#xD;
        subjects with sleep apnea by medical history or as demonstrated during the accommodation&#xD;
        sleep study night, subjects with diabetic gastroparesis, or subjects receiving current&#xD;
        treatment medications that interfere with glucose homeostasis other than for diabetes&#xD;
        therapy (e.g.- glucocorticoids, orlistat). Because of the known adverse effects of ethanol&#xD;
        on unborn children, current intrauterine pregnancy will exclude patients from study. A body&#xD;
        mass index greater than 36 kg/m2 will also be exclusionary. Additionally, subjects with a&#xD;
        score of more than eight points on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)&#xD;
        will be excluded from study.&#xD;
