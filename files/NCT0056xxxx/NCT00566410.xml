  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a small molecule that has been used for years to treat lactic&#xD;
      acidosis and rare metabolic disorders in humans. Further testing now shows that it may&#xD;
      suppress the growth of human cancer cells. Tests of DCA on human cells cultured outside of&#xD;
      the body found that it killed lung, breast, and brain cancer cells, without affecting human&#xD;
      normal cells. Tumors in rats that were infected with human tumors also shrank considerably.&#xD;
      Most cancers are characterized by a resistance to apoptosis (cell death that removes abnormal&#xD;
      cells) that makes them more likely to grow as well as be resistant to most cancer treatments.&#xD;
      Plus, many current cancer treatments kill both cancerous and healthy cells and are highly&#xD;
      toxic. DCA works by reversing the damage to the mitochondria that is present in cancer cells,&#xD;
      thus reactivating the apoptosis (cell death) mechanism in them. The result is the death of&#xD;
      the cancer cells. This mitochondrial reactivation presents an entirely new approach to&#xD;
      treating cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DCA is known to be relatively well tolerated with few significant side effects and its&#xD;
      selectivity, effectiveness and ease of delivery (oral) make it an attractive opportunity. It&#xD;
      is hoped that one day this treatment may become a safe and effective treatment, either along&#xD;
      or in conjunction with other treatments, for many forms of cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As cancer cells have a hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane and deficiency in Kv channel&#xD;
      expression, it was postulated that the reversal of this observation may increase apoptosis&#xD;
      and inhibit tumor growth. Bonnet and colleagues reported that the administration of DCA led&#xD;
      to the switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation in the Krebs Cycle through&#xD;
      inhibition of PDHK. This was associated with an increase in the production of reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species and a decrease in hyperpolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane, leading to&#xD;
      efflux of proapoptotic proteins and apoptosis as measured by increased in TUNEL-positive&#xD;
      cells. In addition, DCA also decreased the expression of survivin, an anti-apoptotic protein.&#xD;
      DCA upregulated the expression of Kv channels in cancer cells, leading to efflux of potassium&#xD;
      ions and further increased the proapoptotic effect of DCA. Such change in energy metabolism&#xD;
      and apoptosis was not observed in normal cells. DCA was also shown to inhibit tumor growth&#xD;
      both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, inhibition of PDHK by DCA represents a novel anti-cancer&#xD;
      therapy target with reasonable toxicities to normal tissue. It is therefore of interest to&#xD;
      study DCA in refractory cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the bioavailability was only 50-60% in normal subjects treated with 2.5 microgram/kg&#xD;
      of DCA , in a study using clinically relevant dose of DCA at 50 mg/kg, the bioavailability&#xD;
      was 100% in health volunteers. DCA administered at 50 mg/kg/day can achieve plasma&#xD;
      concentrations above those require for inhibition of PHDK, the target enzyme for at least 24&#xD;
      hours, without exceeding the concentration for maximal lactate lowering. There was a high&#xD;
      incidence of peripheral neuropathy in adults with MELAS after administration of DCA at 50&#xD;
      mg/kg/day for 6 months, but peripheral neuropathy is part of the MELAS syndrome, and many&#xD;
      adult patients with MELAS develop diabetes mellitus, which commonly presents with peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy. In the contrary, no peripheral neuropathy was observed in children with&#xD;
      congenital acidosis after prolonged treatment with DCA at 50 mg/kg/day up to 2 years.&#xD;
      Therefore, with exclusion of patients with any grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy and&#xD;
      with careful monitoring of peripheral neuropathy using monofilaments, the likelihood of&#xD;
      developing severe peripheral neuropathy in adult cancer patients should be minimized. Given&#xD;
      the presence of significant neuropathy in adult patients with MELAS after treatment with DCA&#xD;
      at 25 mg/kg/day, it is judged to be safe and reasonable to establish the starting dose at&#xD;
      12.5 mg/kg/day in adult cancer patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic&#xD;
             solid tumours. All patients will have no meaningful therapies available to them&#xD;
             including hormone therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapies. For the malignancies&#xD;
             that have no proven therapy, they can be enrolled without any prior systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Four weeks must have elapsed since prior chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted&#xD;
             therapy, or radiation therapy. There is no restriction in the amount of bone marrow&#xD;
             previously radiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Recovery to baseline or, at most, grade 1 of all drug-related toxicities due to prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal therapy, or molecular targeted therapy, except for&#xD;
             alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥70%, see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hemoglobin ≥90 g/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets ≥100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin ≤1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT) and ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 X ULN or ≤ 5 X ULN in the presence of liver&#xD;
                  metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Cardiac ejection fraction by MUGA scan or echocardiogram must be &gt;50% for patients at&#xD;
             baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The effects of DCA on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and&#xD;
             because DCA can be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to&#xD;
             use adequate contraception (e.g.: hormonal or barrier method of birth control,&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,&#xD;
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Ability to understand the purpose of the study and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, molecular targeted therapy, or&#xD;
             radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents, chemotherapy,&#xD;
             immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or molecular targeted agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that could confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to DCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Due to the possibility of peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy from DCA, the presence of&#xD;
             grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy due to prior medical condition (such as&#xD;
             multiple sclerosis), medications, or other etiologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not&#xD;
             permit medical follow-up and compliance with the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements. Specifically, for patients who are taking either or both oral&#xD;
             hypoglycemics and insulin for diabetes mellitus will not be eligible as DCA in&#xD;
             combination with these agents may increase the risk of clinically significant&#xD;
             hypoglycemia, compromising patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because DCA is an agent with the potential&#xD;
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential&#xD;
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             DCA, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with DCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with DCA. In addition, these patients&#xD;
             are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive&#xD;
             therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. 5 years must have elapsed since the initial curative procedure for other malignancies,&#xD;
             except for in situ cervical cancer, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, and localized&#xD;
             prostate cancer after curative therapy such as surgery, or radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of malabsorption syndrome or substantial amount of small bowels or stomach&#xD;
             removed that may impair absorption of DCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients taking warfarin. Low dose or therapeutic dose of heparin or low molecular&#xD;
             weight heparin is allowed.&#xD;
