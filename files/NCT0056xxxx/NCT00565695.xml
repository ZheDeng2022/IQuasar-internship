      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the visual outcomes and patient satisfaction after&#xD;
      bilateral implantation of the aspheric ReSTOR multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) and compare&#xD;
      it to a historical control group of patients implanted bilaterally with the spherical ReSTOR&#xD;
      multifocal IOL.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cataract is prevalent throughout the world and IOLs are routinely implanted after the&#xD;
      extraction of the cataractous lens. It is the most frequently performed surgery in the United&#xD;
      States with an estimated 2-3 million procedures performed annually. With the aging population&#xD;
      on the rise, as well as the increasing popularity of refractive intraocular lenses, the&#xD;
      number of intraocular surgeries continues to rise. Over the years, the surgical technique has&#xD;
      evolved from intracapsular extraction to modern phacoemulsification. This development has&#xD;
      helped with the evolution of IOLs as well. The IOLs have advanced extensively: different&#xD;
      materials and designs are available, permitting implantation through smaller, sutureless&#xD;
      incisions. Traditional IOLs are of monofocal design providing vision at one distance,&#xD;
      typically far. Patients implanted with traditional monofocal IOLs usually require glasses for&#xD;
      near distance tasks such as reading. The new multifocal IOLs offer the possibility of seeing&#xD;
      well at more than one distance, without glasses or contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AcrySof ReSTOR (Alcon Laboratories) uses apodized diffractive technology - a design that&#xD;
      responds to how wide or small the eye's pupil might be - to provi de near, intermediate, and&#xD;
      distance vision. Clinical studies used to support the March 2005 FDA approval showed that 80%&#xD;
      of people who received the lens did not use glasses for any activities after their cataract&#xD;
      surgery; 84% who received the lens in both eyes had distance vision of 20/25 or better, with&#xD;
      near vision of 20/32 or better. Wavefront analysis is a technique currently used to measure&#xD;
      the aberrations of the entire optical system. The term aberration derives from the Latin&#xD;
      ab-erratio, which means going offtrack or deviating. Therefore, and aberration is the&#xD;
      difference that exists between the ideal image of that we would expect to see when the&#xD;
      luminous rays are refracted in the perfect optical system (Snell's law) and what is actually&#xD;
      achieved. This technology is widely used in refractive surgery with successful outcomes. With&#xD;
      the introduction of wavefront analysis, a new tool is available to re-design and study the&#xD;
      performance of IOLs. Regarding IOL design, it has been used to modify the IOL to partially&#xD;
      compensate for the average spherical aberration. The goal is to improve the ocular optical&#xD;
      quality of pseudophakic patients. Clinical results using the aspheric monofocal IOLs confirm&#xD;
      that this modification leads to a significant improvement, particularly in contrast&#xD;
      sensitivity, mesopic visual quality and reduction of high order aberrations mainly spherical&#xD;
      aberration when compare to spherical IOLs. The new aspheric ReSTOR IOL is the first single&#xD;
      piece acrylic multifocal IOL to be available in the United States and a comparison to a&#xD;
      regular (spherical) multifocal IOL is necessary to determine if the aspheric ReSTOR lens&#xD;
      shows the same improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the visual outcomes and patient satisfaction after&#xD;
      bilateral implantation of the aspheric ReSTOR multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) and compare&#xD;
      it to a historical control group of patients implanted bilaterally with the spherical ReSTOR&#xD;
      multifocal IOL.&#xD;
