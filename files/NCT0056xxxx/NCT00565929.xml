  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare how the body's immune system reacts to a vaccine&#xD;
      against smallpox infection, called Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) and to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      of this vaccine. Study participants will include 24 adults, ages 18-60 years, who have&#xD;
      undergone a stem cell transplant more than 2 years ago. Study procedures will include a&#xD;
      physical exam, blood samples, heart activity assessments, and urine samples. Participants&#xD;
      will be assigned to 1 of 2 possible study vaccine groups. The participants will receive 1 of&#xD;
      2 possible vaccine doses or placebo (substance containing no medication) 28 days apart.&#xD;
      Participants will make at least 8 visits to the clinic during the course of the study;&#xD;
      additional visits may be needed if the participant experiences side effects from the vaccine.&#xD;
      Participants may be involved in study related procedures for about 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the event of a smallpox outbreak, or threat of one, mass immunization of all vulnerable&#xD;
      individuals would take place. This would include persons with immunodeficiency as seen post&#xD;
      Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT). The current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      approved smallpox vaccine (Dryvax®) is a live replicating virus (vaccinia) and is&#xD;
      contraindicated in both immunocompromised persons and those in close physical contact with&#xD;
      them. The Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA), specifically IMVAMUNE® has been developed as a&#xD;
      safer, less reactogenic vaccine against smallpox. Study participants will include 24 male or&#xD;
      female participants, from 18 to 60 years of age. This study assesses the safety,&#xD;
      reactogenicity and immunogenicity of 2 doses of MVA-BN (IMVAMUNE®) given to persons who have&#xD;
      undergone an HSCT more than 2 years prior to study participation. There are 2 arms in the&#xD;
      study, each receiving 2 doses 28 days apart of either 1 x 10^7 or 1 x 10^8 tissue culture&#xD;
      infectious dose 50 (TCID50). Each arm will be comprised of 12 subjects, 10 of whom will&#xD;
      receive IMVAMUNE® and 2 of whom will receive placebo under a double blind, randomized&#xD;
      allocation. Subjects will be followed for safety and reactogenicity. Clinical assessments&#xD;
      will be performed and blood samples will be obtained sequentially for safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity determinations. All subjects will complete a memory aid for 15 days after each&#xD;
      vaccination to record oral temperature and note the occurrence of solicited and unsolicited&#xD;
      adverse events as well as any medication use. Adverse events will be collected for 56 days&#xD;
      after each vaccination. Serious adverse events and concomitant medications will be collected&#xD;
      throughout the entire study period. Study staff will assess subjects clinically at days 14&#xD;
      and 28 after each vaccination and on days 42, 56, 84, and 180. Hematology and blood chemistry&#xD;
      studies including hemoglobin, white blood cell and platelet counts and kidney and liver&#xD;
      function tests will be obtained. Electrocardiogram and Troponin I or T will be obtained prior&#xD;
      to first vaccination and on days 14 and 28 after each immunization and at day 180. Clinical&#xD;
      laboratory assays will be conducted in the clinical laboratory at both the Brigham and&#xD;
      Women's Hospital or the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. The primary objective of this study is&#xD;
      to determine the safety and reactogenicity of MVA in persons who have undergone allogeneic&#xD;
      HSCT more than 2 years prior to study participation. The secondary objective of this study is&#xD;
      to determine the immunogenicity of MVA in persons who have undergone HSCT more than 2 years&#xD;
      prior to study participation. Immunogenicity will be determined by humoral immune responses&#xD;
      and cell mediated immune responses.&#xD;
