      This will be a strain and dose-finding study in which CS19-ETEC strain WS0115A will be&#xD;
      administered at a starting inoculum of 5 x 108 colony forming units (cfu) to 5 subjects as&#xD;
      the initial step to establish a human disease model. If an 80% attack rate (AR) for&#xD;
      predefined diarrheal disease is achieved without high output diarrhea, the same inoculum will&#xD;
      be given to 5 - 10 more subjects for confirmation of AR. If an 80% AR is not achieved, AR and&#xD;
      severity of disease will be evaluated to determine if the dose should be increased. The same&#xD;
      sequence may be conducted with DS26-1 as necessary. If the WS0115A strain causes high output&#xD;
      diarrhea, the dose will be adjusted down and further dose characterization continued. An&#xD;
      iterative process will be used to select the optimal strain and dose with each step reviewed&#xD;
      and approved by the medical monitor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label, strain and dose-finding study designed to establish a human&#xD;
      challenge modelfor CS19-ETEC that causes a &gt; 80% attack rate without causing high output&#xD;
      diarrhea. This study design is identical to that of the CS17 challenge model recently&#xD;
      completed. Two strains of CS19-ETEC isolated from human diarrheal cases have been identified&#xD;
      and characterized. Each clinical isolate was used to generate a cGMP MCB and procedures were&#xD;
      established to create a fresh inoculum to administer orally in a sodium bicarbonate solution&#xD;
      for challenge. Refer to Section 8 for full details on the isolation and preparation of these&#xD;
      strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CS19-ETEC strain WS0115A (toxin phenotype of LT+ ST+ and serotype O114:H-) will be the lead&#xD;
      strain and will be administered orally to an initial cohort of 5 subjects. This strain was&#xD;
      isolated from the stool of a 12-month-old Egyptian girl suffering from watery diarrhea&#xD;
      identified during a surveillance study conducted in Abees, Egypt from 1993 to 1995 by&#xD;
      investigators at the Naval Medical Research Unit-3 (NAMRU-3), Cairo, Egypt. A negative&#xD;
      microbiologic work-up for copathogens (other bacterialenteropathogens, rotavirus, Giardia&#xD;
      lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium) supports that the isolated WS0115A&#xD;
      strain was pathogenic in this child. Since this strain has an LT+ST+ toxin phenotype, it is&#xD;
      the preferred strain to lead in testing the challenge model, since heterologous protection by&#xD;
      bovine milk IgG anti-CsbD against an LT+ST+ phenotype would offer a more robust test of the&#xD;
      protection afforded by anti-colonization. The alternate strain, CS-19 ETEC strain DS26-1&#xD;
      (toxin phenotype LT+ST-;serotype O8:H9) was isolated in 1990 at the U.S. Navy Forward&#xD;
      Laboratory from a U.S. soldier with diarrhea while on deployment to Saudi Arabia during&#xD;
      Operation Desert Shield. A negative microbiologic work-up for copathogens (Salmonella typhi,&#xD;
      Vibrio cholerae, Giardia lamblia or Entamoeba histolytica)supports that the isolated DS26-1&#xD;
      strain was pathogenic in this individual. Each clinical isolate was used to generate a cGMP&#xD;
      master cell bank and procedures were established to create a fresh inoculum to administer&#xD;
      orally in a sodium bicarbonate solution for challenge. Refer to Section 8 for full details on&#xD;
      the isolation and preparation of these strains.&#xD;
