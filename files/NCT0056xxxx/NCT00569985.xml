      This pilot clinical trial studies biological therapy in treating patients with acquired&#xD;
      immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphoma undergoing stem cell transplant. Giving&#xD;
      chemotherapy before a stem cell transplant stops the growth of cancer cells by stopping them&#xD;
      from dividing or killing them. After treatment, stem cells are collected from the patient's&#xD;
      blood and stored. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the&#xD;
      blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy. Giving biological therapy as&#xD;
      part of the stem cell transplant may be more effective in treating patients with AIDS-related&#xD;
      lymphoma&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of using lentivirus-transduced hematopoietic&#xD;
      progenitor cells (HPCs) (lentivirus vector rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ-transduced hematopoietic&#xD;
      progenitor cells) in the setting of autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for&#xD;
      treatment of AIDS related lymphoma. The safety of the of the genetically modified product&#xD;
      used in the transplant procedure will be assessed by monitoring each subject for adverse&#xD;
      events (procedure related toxicity); absolute neutrophil count (ANC)/platelet engraftment&#xD;
      (sustained recovery); and evidence of replication competent vector or vector recombination&#xD;
      with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) quasi-species present in the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the quantity and duration of vector-marked peripheral blood cells and to&#xD;
      characterize: the duration and level of gene marking and expression of the anti-HIV&#xD;
      ribonucleic acids (RNAs) in these transduced cells, and the characterization of the&#xD;
      integration sites of vector sequences in circulating cells if there is a clinical syndrome&#xD;
      suggestive of a clonal expansion of hematopoietic cells. In addition, the feasibility of the&#xD;
      process will be assessed based on the results of the release testing of the transduced cells&#xD;
      prior to injection into the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine whether the design of the vector prevents vector mobilization and rescue by&#xD;
      wild-type HIV-1. IV. To measure the effect of HIV infection on the presence of HIV-resistant&#xD;
      blood cells as measured by genetic marking for vector sequences before and after antiviral&#xD;
      treatment interruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITIONING: Patients receive carmustine intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days -7 to -5,&#xD;
      etoposide IV over 4 hours on day -4, and cyclophosphamide IV on day -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      comprising lentivirus vector rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ-transduced hematopoietic progenitor cells&#xD;
      and non-bound cluster of differentiation (CD)34+ cells IV on day 0. After completion of study&#xD;
      treatment, patients are followed up every 2 weeks for 3 months; at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, and&#xD;
      24 months; every 6 months for 3 years; and then annually for 10 years.&#xD;
