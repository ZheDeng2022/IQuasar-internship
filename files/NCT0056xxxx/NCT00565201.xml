  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of injections of&#xD;
      BOTOX® in spastic muscles of the arm and hand compared with injections of saline (which would&#xD;
      do nothing) when combined with rehabilitation therapy for the improvement of active function&#xD;
      tasks in post-stroke patients. Injections will be targeted to reduce common spasticity&#xD;
      patterns of the arm and hand which include: bent elbow, palm down forearm, bent wrist,&#xD;
      thumb-in-palm, clenched fist, and other hand deformities. This will be done only at Emory&#xD;
      University. Neither the doctor injecting the drug nor the subject receiving the drug will&#xD;
      know if they are getting BOTOX® or saline. Which type of injection the subject receives will&#xD;
      be completely randomized (like flipping a coin). All subjects will have rehabilitation&#xD;
      therapy after their injections. Subjects will be assessed at a total of 5 scheduled visits&#xD;
      (qualification (Week 1), Injection (Week 2), Evaluations on Weeks 8, 10, and 14. All subjects&#xD;
      will receive rehabilitation therapy immediately after their injections for 1 hour a day, 3-5&#xD;
      times a week, for 4 weeks. The results from this project will provide valuable data on the&#xD;
      ability of BOTOX® and physical rehabilitation to provide effective treatment to spastic&#xD;
      muscles of the arm and hand after stroke. This project has the potential to increase the&#xD;
      availability of effective rehabilitation techniques to patients with stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a stroke, patients commonly experience tightness in their affected arm from wrist and&#xD;
      hand muscle overactivity called spasticity. Spasticity is difficult to manage with only one&#xD;
      type of treatment. Usual treatments of spasticity are not very effective and may produce&#xD;
      unwanted side effects. Untreated spasticity may result in muscular problems and decrease a&#xD;
      patient's general ability to function and thus affect his/her quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BOTOX®, a botulinum toxin type A produced from Clostridium botulinum, blocks certain&#xD;
      chemicals that cause spasticity. With appropriate injections of BOTOX® in the correct muscle,&#xD;
      it can change the tightness in the muscle temporarily. Published reports indicate that&#xD;
      several hundred adult patients with arm and/or leg spasticity of various causes (e.g.,&#xD;
      poststroke, multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury) have benefited from injections of&#xD;
      BOTOX® in the spastic muscle. The efficacy of BOTOX® in patients with post-stroke spasticity&#xD;
      in their arms and hands has been demonstrated in seven phase 2 placebo-controlled studies and&#xD;
      two phase 3 studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of injections of&#xD;
      BOTOX® in spastic muscles of the arm and hand compared with injections of saline (which would&#xD;
      do nothing) when combined with rehabilitation therapy for the improvement of active function&#xD;
      tasks in post-stroke patients. Injections will be targeted to reduce common spasticity&#xD;
      patterns of the arm and hand which include: bent elbow, palm down forearm, bent wrist,&#xD;
      thumb-in-palm, clenched fist, and other hand deformities. This will be done only at Emory&#xD;
      University. Neither the doctor injecting the drug nor the subject receiving the drug will&#xD;
      know if they are getting BOTOX® or saline. Which type of injection the subject receives will&#xD;
      be completely randomized (like flipping a coin). All subjects will have rehabilitation&#xD;
      therapy after their injections. Subjects will be assessed at a total of 5 scheduled visits&#xD;
      (qualification (Week 1), Injection (Week 2), Evaluations on Weeks 8, 10, and 14. All subjects&#xD;
      will receive rehabilitation therapy immediately after their injections for 1 hour a day, 3-5&#xD;
      times a week, for 4 weeks. The results from this project will provide valuable data on the&#xD;
      ability of BOTOX® and physical rehabilitation to provide effective treatment to spastic&#xD;
