  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to Quetiapine's particulars and the promising receptor profile, we want to examine the&#xD;
      efficacy concerning relapse prevention of alcoholics suffering from persisting craving and/or&#xD;
      affective symptoms (persisting sleep disorder, persisting excitement, persisting depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, persisting anxiety symptoms) in comparison to matching placebo in a double-blind&#xD;
      pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We further want to compare the course of the above mentioned craving and affective symptoms&#xD;
      under medication with quetiapine / matching placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Naltrexone and Acamprosate are the best evaluated and established therapy options in relapse&#xD;
      prevention of alcoholics at present (Litten et al. 1996, Mann et al. 2004). Studies on cue&#xD;
      exposure showed that Naltrexone (Monti et al. 1999) and Haloperidol (Modell et al. 1993)&#xD;
      block stimuli triggered craving. In addition, they indicate that both may also stop the&#xD;
      craving for further alcohol consumption that is induced by a priming dose of alcohol (Modell&#xD;
      et al. 1993). However, the clinical relevance of Haloperidol is rather limited due to the&#xD;
      risk of extrapyramidal side effects. New atypical dopamine antagonists are reported to have&#xD;
      this profile as well, but without the risk of developing extrapyramidal side effects. In a&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical trial, the atypical antipsychotic Olanzapine has proved to reduce&#xD;
      craving for alcohol both after alcohol exposure and a priming dose of alcohol in&#xD;
      non-dependent heavy social drinkers (Hutchison et al. 2001). However, Amisulpride in a dose&#xD;
      of 50 mg per day failed to prevent alcohol relapse in a double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study in 71 patients over 6 months (Marra et al. 2002).&#xD;
