    <textblock>
      In this study, we investigate the role of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging in patients with&#xD;
      suspected, but not yet proven, &quot;acute cardiac syndrome ACS&quot;. Patients are included if they&#xD;
      presented to the local Emergency Department with chest pain, but the first tests in the&#xD;
      Emergency Department are negative or not clearly indicative of cardiac ischemia. For example,&#xD;
      the first lab value Troponin T is negative or borderline elevated; or the first ECG is not&#xD;
      clearly indicative of ischemia. The standard procedure for these patients is to wait 4-6&#xD;
      hours and then repeat the test; if they continue to be negative, the patients are discharged&#xD;
      home, if the have become positive, an invasive coronary artery angiography has to be&#xD;
      performed. We think, that a CMR study can shorten the time needed to make the decision of&#xD;
      either &quot;discharge&quot; or &quot;admit to CCU and perform a coronary artery angiography&quot;. CMR has been&#xD;
      shown to be the gold standard for heart function (thus, can see even subtle wall motion&#xD;
      abnormalities), for tissue characterization (so-called T2-weighted images can identify tissue&#xD;
      edema (swelling); perfusion images can identify areas with reduced blood supply; late&#xD;
      enhancement images can safely identify fibrotic or irreversibly damaged tissue) and can even&#xD;
      be used to stress the patients to exclude a critical or non-critical narrowing of coronary&#xD;
      arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study will be the impact of CMR on the time-to-decision in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be possible to a) identify all patients WITH an acute infarct by CMR and send them&#xD;
      to a cath lab sooner compared to waiting for a second test; b) identify all patients WITHOUT&#xD;
      an acute infarct and c) perform a stress test in those patients to exclude severe coronary&#xD;
      artery disease.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unstable angina (UA) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are serious forms of&#xD;
      acute coronary syndromes1. They require rapid clinical assessment, diagnosis and&#xD;
      therapeutical intervention. A delay in the diagnosis and a delay in treatment may lead to&#xD;
      serious complications such as ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure and sudden cardiac&#xD;
      death. In NSTEMI, time delay to diagnosis might lead to irreversible loss of salvageable&#xD;
      myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current recommendations of the American Heart Association for the management of patients&#xD;
      with UA/ NSTEMI rely on the patient's symptoms, ECG changes and serum markers (Troponin) 1.&#xD;
      The algorithm for diagnosis and therapy is straight-forward for patients presenting with&#xD;
      positive Troponin and/ or ongoing ECG changes; however, an up to 8 hours delay occurs in a&#xD;
      patient presenting with chest pain, but without diagnostic ECG changes and negative Troponins&#xD;
      (figure 1). During this period, repeat ECGs are recommended to observe changes, and the&#xD;
      Troponin test will be repeated at 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This delay in diagnosis and treatment might be abbreviated by the diagnosis of UA/NSTEMI with&#xD;
      the help of cardiac MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing body of evidence supports the capability of MRI to diagnose and rule out UA/&#xD;
      NSTEMI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2003, Kwong et al could show that CMR has not only a high sensitivity and specificity for&#xD;
      detecting acute coronary syndromes in the Emergency Room, but it also was the strongest&#xD;
      predictor of acute coronary syndromes as compared to ECG, Troponin and a TIMI risk score ≥3.&#xD;
      The method appeared suitable for triage of patients presenting with chest pain to the&#xD;
      Emergency Room; it was also found to be very safe2. In another study, Plein et al found that&#xD;
      CMR could be useful to diagnose coronary artery disease with high sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      in patients presenting to the Emergency Room with chest pain3. Furthermore, it was recently&#xD;
      shown that in patients presenting to the ER with chest pain, in whom negative Troponin tests&#xD;
      had excluded an acute coronary syndrome, an adenosine stress CMR study was a very powerful&#xD;
      predictor of adverse outcomes if positive for perfusion deficits, and a powerful negative&#xD;
      predictor if no perfusion deficits were found4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMR can visualize irreversible myocardial injury, even if those lesions affect as little as&#xD;
      less than 2 grams of myocardial tissue5. Our own data show that CMR is an accurate tool to&#xD;
      diagnose acute myocardial infarcts, when T2-weighted imaging for the detection of acute edema&#xD;
      is used in conjunction with imaging for irreversible injury6; we also showed that&#xD;
      irreversible myocardial injury can be detected as soon as 1 hour after infarction7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it has been shown that CMR can diagnose UA/ NSTEMI2, 3 as well as rule those out&#xD;
      with an excellent negative predictive and prognostic value4, it has not been shown whether&#xD;
      CMR can lead to a shortening of time-to-diagnosis. It has also not been studied yet, whether&#xD;
      or not the incorporation of CMR into the diagnostic pathway would be cost-efficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac MRI can shorten the time to diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes in patients&#xD;
      presenting with a differential diagnosis of UA/NSTEMI, in whom the initial ECG and Troponin&#xD;
      tests are non-diagnostic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of CMR into the diagnostic pathway is cost efficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will examine patients admitted to the ER with chest pain suggestive of a first acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome. If the initial ECG and Troponin tests are inconclusive and the patient is&#xD;
      supposed to wait for a second Troponin test, an urgent CMR study will be performed to&#xD;
      diagnose UA/NSTEMI (see figure 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time will be measured from the initial Troponin test to the second decisive Troponin test&#xD;
      (control variable). The time will as well be measured from the first Troponin test to the&#xD;
      result of the CMR test (test variable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with a negative CMR study, the CMR study will be extended by a stress perfusion&#xD;
      study, and the time will be measured from first negative Troponin to the result of the stress&#xD;
      test (test variable). In patients in whom the second Troponin returns negative, and a&#xD;
      conventional stress test is scheduled for further diagnostic work-up (independent of the CMR&#xD;
      test), the time from the first Troponin to the result of the stress test will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CMR study will be performed to assess&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. LV function (global and regional function)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Myocardial edema&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Myocardial perfusion at rest&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If all of the above do not show any pathological result: adenosine stress perfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following protocol will be used for the CMR study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Localizer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LV function in multiple long axes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T2w STIR in 3 short axis views&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BOLD study in 3 short-axis views&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rest perfusion study in 3 long axes and 1 short axis view&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Late enhancement study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If all of the above do not show any pathological result: stress perfusion study with&#xD;
           adenosine in 3 long axes and 1 short axis views&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be rated positive for an Acute Coronary Syndrome if any one or more of the&#xD;
      following will be present:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regional wall motion abnormality (in the presence of late enhancement: regional wall&#xD;
           motion abnormality in conjunction with positive STIR, or regional wall motion&#xD;
           abnormality exceeding the area of late enhancement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regional myocardial edema on the STIR images&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regional perfusion deficit (in presence of late enhancement: regional perfusion deficit&#xD;
           exceeding the area of late enhancement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If performed: stress-induced perfusion deficit&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CMR study will be positive for coronary artery disease, but without Acute Coronary&#xD;
      Syndrome, when the following criteria will be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Late enhancement without corresponding high signal on STIR, and with or without a regional&#xD;
      wall motion abnormality corresponding to but not exceeding the area of late enhancement&#xD;
