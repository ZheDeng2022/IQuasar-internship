    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to determine if administering repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) simultaneously to two sites in the temporal lobes, one on the left and one&#xD;
      on the right, produces greater improvements in &quot;voices&quot; and other symptoms of schizophrenia&#xD;
      compared to rTMS given to just one site in the temporal lobes.&#xD;

      This study is an extension of an ongoing clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT&#xD;
      00308997) that was initiated in 2006. The primary objective of the ongoing clinical trial&#xD;
      (hereafter called the &quot;parent trial&quot;) is to determine efficacy of rTMS in curbing auditory&#xD;
      hallucinations when delivered to a part of the left temporal lobe called Wernicke's area and&#xD;
      a corresponding region in the right temporal lobe. The parent trial appears to show robust&#xD;
      effects for active rTMS compared to effects of sham stimulation. However, observed responses&#xD;
      following active rTMS have often been incomplete. Moreover, in some cases there has been a&#xD;
      subsequent return of symptoms 1 to 6 months after the trial ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We consequently have initiated a trial where patients who have participated in the parent&#xD;
      trial and demonstrated an incomplete response or a subsequent return of symptoms may return&#xD;
      to receive additional active rTMS. We hypothesize that efficacy of suppressive rTMS will be&#xD;
      enhanced if directed simultaneously to right/left Wernicke's area (the site used in the&#xD;
      parent trial) as well as to a second site located in the opposite middle temporal cortex.&#xD;
      Roughly half of subjects in the re-enrollment will be randomized to receive active rTMS to&#xD;
      right/left Wernicke's area plus active rTMS to opposite hemisphere middle temporal region,&#xD;
      while half of subjects will be randomized to receive active rTMS to right/left Wernicke's&#xD;
      area plus sham rTMS to opposite hemisphere middle temporal region. The position of the middle&#xD;
      temporal regions will be determined by two recently completed brain imaging studies of&#xD;
      auditory hallucinations suggesting that activation in these sites triggers auditory&#xD;
      hallucinations. The two-position design will allow us to determine if active rTMS delivered&#xD;
      to the middle temporal cortex is superior in amplifying efficacy of active rTMS targeting&#xD;
      Wernicke's area and in reducing auditory hallucinations to sham stimulation to the same site.&#xD;
      The re-enrollment protocol will utilize two rTMS devices simultaneously where one directly&#xD;
      triggers the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study record has been amended to remove a third arm that was added in 2012. The third&#xD;
      arm described was not actually a comparative arm, but rather an added objective with a&#xD;
      different study population. Dr. Ralph Hoffman unexpectedly passed away while this study was&#xD;
      being conducted. This study has been submitted as a separate study (NCT04548622) where the&#xD;
      summarized study results of the terminated study will be presented.&#xD;

    <description>Week 1 treatment includes rTMS for 5 sessions to either to left or right Wernicke's area (BA22) synchronous with rTMS to opposite hemisphere middle temporal cortex (BA21). Week 2 treatment includes rTMS given for 5 sessions with positions reversed (e.g., if Wernicke's stimulation was on the left during Week 1, position of rTMS will switch to the right side during Week 2 and vice-versa). As in Week 1, active rTMS will also be given synchronously to the opposite hemisphere middle temporal cortex. Weeks 3 and 4 include 10 stimulation sessions to the configuration of sites producing greater improvement in comparing results of Week 1 and Week 2. rTMS for each stimulation session will be given at 1-Hertz (once per second) for 16 minutes without interruption.</description>
