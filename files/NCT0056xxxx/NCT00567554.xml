  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anthracycline-taxane based chemotherapy regimens are recommended mainly by current guidelines&#xD;
      for neoadjuvant application of systemic treatment. The addition of other cytotoxic agents,&#xD;
      e.g. antimetabolites, vincaalkaloids, or platinum salts resulted in marginal increase in&#xD;
      efficacy, but was associated also with an increase in toxicity. Recently, only the addition&#xD;
      of the Her-2 antibody trastuzumab has significantly improved pathologic response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, two major strategies are followed in current research projects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve the selection of patients according to their tumors' sensitivity to&#xD;
           chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To implement small molecules with specific mechanism of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the GeparQuinto trial, the first strategy is followed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The PREDICT substudy. A gene signature specific for the response to anthracyclines and&#xD;
           taxanes will be prospectively evaluated for its ability to identify patients with chance&#xD;
           higher than 50% for a pCR. The results may leed to a better risk-benefit ratio for the&#xD;
           use of conventional chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adapting further chemotherapy to the response of the tumor to the first couple of&#xD;
           chemotherapy cycles. Based on the previous experience made by the GeparTrio study,&#xD;
           patients not responding early have a low chance to respond with a pCR irrespective of&#xD;
           the type of chemotherapy. So, if further chemotherapy is planned, therapy should be&#xD;
           selected according to a favorable toxicity profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second strategy is followed by investigating in three parallel group comparisons the&#xD;
      efficiency of three distinct small molecules which appear to be generally active in breast&#xD;
      cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bevacizumab, an inhibitor of the VEGF pathway targeting tumor neo-angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lapatinib, an inhibitor of the Her-1 and Her-2 receptor tyrosine kinase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RAD001 (Everolimus), an inhibitor of the mTOR molecule, a central controller of tumor&#xD;
           cell growth and angiogenesis and chemosensitizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment for patients participating in the GeparQuinto study will be allocated according to&#xD;
      the Her-2 status of the tumor as well as according to the sonographic response after the&#xD;
      first 4 cycles of treatment. Experimental therapy with bevacizumab, lapatinib, and everolimus&#xD;
      (RAD001) will be randomly added in distinct settings.&#xD;

      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the pCR rates of neoadjuvant treatment of epirubicin / cyclophosphamide followed&#xD;
      by docetaxel (EC-T) with or without bevacizumab (EC-T vs. ECB-TB) in patients with Her-2&#xD;
      negative primary breast cancer (Setting I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the pCR rates of neoadjuvant treatment with weekly paclitaxel with or without&#xD;
      Everolimus (RAD001) (Pw vs. PwR) in patients with Her-2 negative primary breast cancer&#xD;
      showing no sonographic response to 4 cycles of EC +/-B (Setting II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the pCR rates of neoadjuvant treatment with epirubicin / cyclophosphamide followed&#xD;
      by docetaxel with either trastuzumab or lapatinib (ECH-TH vs. ECL-TL) in patients with Her-2&#xD;
      positive primary breast cancer (Setting III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the toxicity of and compliance to all six treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the response rates of the breast tumor and axillary nodes by physical&#xD;
           examination and imaging tests (sonography, mammography, or MRI) after treatment in all&#xD;
           arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the breast conservation rate after each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the (loco-regional and distant) disease-free and overall survival after&#xD;
           each treatment. In Her-2 positive disease, the cerebral disease-free survival will be&#xD;
           determined separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess treatment efficacies in subgroups defined according to tumor stage (T2-3 vs.&#xD;
           T4), receptor status (ER and / or PgR positive vs. ER and PgR negative) and response by&#xD;
           best appropriate imaging method to the first four cycles of treatment (complete vs.&#xD;
           partial vs. no change).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To examine and compare pre-specified molecular markers such as Ki-67, phospho-mTOR,&#xD;
           YB-1, COX-2, HuR, phospho-p70 S6K, p65 NF kappa B, PTEN, PI3-K, Akt, and a marker for&#xD;
           stem cell like breast cancers (SOX-10) on core biopsy before and after end of&#xD;
           chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of Substudies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess and correlate circulating tumor cells and proteins with the effect of&#xD;
           treatment(CTC Substudy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the pathologic complete response (pCR), breast conservation, clinical and&#xD;
           imaging response rate (after four cycles and before surgery) in patients where the tumor&#xD;
           shows a favorable profile of a predetermined combined biomarker set to those where the&#xD;
           tumor does not show it (PREDICT Substudy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the percentage of patients in which conventional axillary clearance can be&#xD;
           substituted by sentinel node biopsy when a predetermined clinical algorithm is used&#xD;
           (SENTINA Substudy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the surgical outcome according to patient's and surgeon's perspectives in&#xD;
           correlation with clinical and pathological response to systemic treatment (SOS -&#xD;
           Surgical Outcome Substudy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To correlate Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes which are either involved&#xD;
           in the metabolism or in the effectiveness of the distinct therapies with the associated&#xD;
           toxicity and histologically assessed treatment effect (Pharmacogenomic Substudy).&#xD;
