  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite treatment with aspirin a large number of patients suffer a myocardial infarction. It&#xD;
      has been speculated that these patients might be &quot;resistant&quot; to aspirin, and studies have&#xD;
      indicated that this phenomenon is related to a less favourable prognosis. Furthermore,&#xD;
      patients with diabetes mellitus have an increased risk of myocardial infarction and other&#xD;
      vascular events and, recently, it has been suggested that diabetics do not respond adequately&#xD;
      to aspirin. The purpose of this study is to compare the prevalence of &quot;aspirin resistance&quot; in&#xD;
      diabetics and non-diabetics. Furthermore, patients who suffered a myocardial infarction while&#xD;
      being treated with aspirin are included. We hypothesize that the prevalence of &quot;aspirin&#xD;
      resistance&quot; will be higher among diabetics compared to other patients and to healthy&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A considerable number of patients suffer acute coronary events despite being treated with&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin. Taken together with laboratory findings of a low&#xD;
      response to aspirin, the term &quot;aspirin resistance&quot; has been coined. Diabetics have an&#xD;
      increased risk of suffering ischemic vascular events and, recently, an increased prevalence&#xD;
      of &quot;aspirin resistance&quot; was reported in these patients. The purpose of the present study is&#xD;
      to compare the aspirin response in diabetics and non-diabetics in a population with&#xD;
      angiogram-verified coronary artery disease. Furthermore, healthy volunteers and patients who&#xD;
      suffered a myocardial infarction while being treated with aspirin are included. Eligible&#xD;
      patients are identified in the Western Denmark Heart Registry.&#xD;
