  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, pharmacokinetic study involving a single-dose phase, a wash out phase&#xD;
      and a two-week once or twice-daily dosing phase for each of 49 volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the single-dose phase, each volunteer will apply the single dose in the clinic.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to have cervicovaginal samples and biopsies collected at one&#xD;
      of seven time-points [0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hour(s)] after the single-dose. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be drawn at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hour(s) after the single-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the two-week phase, the study supplies will be distributed and the participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to apply each dose either once or twice-daily for two weeks. At the one week&#xD;
      follow-up visit a blood sample will be drawn prior to the morning dose to obtain a trough&#xD;
      value and cervicovaginal samples will be collected four hours after the morning dose. At the&#xD;
      two week follow-up visit blood samples will be drawn prior to the morning dose to obtain a&#xD;
      trough value and then at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hour(s) from the final morning dose.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to have cervicovaginal samples and biopsies collected at&#xD;
      either 4, 8 or 24 hours after the final morning dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 10 participants who have completed the first two phases of the study, will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in a third phase to have cervicovaginal samples, biopsies and blood samples&#xD;
      collected 12 hours after a single-dose.&#xD;
