      The purpose of this study is to determine where amitriptyline is effective in the treatment&#xD;
      of functional abdominal pain in children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent gastro-intestinal complaints constitute one of the most common reasons for medical&#xD;
      consultation among daycare and school children. Studies suggest an association between&#xD;
      childhood functional abdominal pain and psychiatric disorders. Although most children with&#xD;
      mild symptoms are mostly managed by reassurance and simple measures, a large range of&#xD;
      interventions such as dietary changes, use of antidepressant and medications are being widely&#xD;
      used with little evidence to suggest their effectiveness. In view of the high prevalence of&#xD;
      this disorder and the lack of pediatric scientific evidence on extensively used drug&#xD;
      therapies there is critical need to develop trials of all suggested pharmacologic&#xD;
      interventions in children with functional pain disorders. This study has the potential to&#xD;
      fill a critical void in pediatric gastroenterology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the medication (amitriptyline)&#xD;
      on symptoms of patients with abdominal pain of non-organic origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are that amitriptyline results in adequate relief of symptoms in children with&#xD;
      functional abdominal pain and that is more effective than placebo in controlling pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double masked placebo controlled study, using standard current measures&#xD;
      and diagnostic criteria to address the question whether the treatment with amitriptyline is&#xD;
      efficacious, and that leads to an improvement in severity of the symptoms for which the&#xD;
      patient sought medical attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted on a group of children (eight to eighteen years) suffering from&#xD;
      functional abdominal pain. The study population is randomly assigned (by chance) into 2&#xD;
      groups (half of the patients receive drug and half of patients receive a non-acting&#xD;
      drug-placebo). Each individual will randomly receive the medication or placebo at night time&#xD;
      for 4 weeks. In order to qualify for the study the patients have to complete one week on&#xD;
      baseline questionnaires to assess their symptoms and have to be diagnosed with a condition&#xD;
      associated with functional abdominal pain by the investigators. The patient will complete&#xD;
      initial questionnaires and end of the study questionnaires as well as daily questionnaires to&#xD;
      assess the symptoms. At the end of the study both groups will be compared to establish&#xD;
      differences.&#xD;
