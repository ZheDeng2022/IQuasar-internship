      Background The acute occlusion due to intrastent thrombosis represented a major event causing&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction, cardiac death and necessity for a new procedure or coronary&#xD;
      by-pass intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid such complications different high anticoagulation regimens (heparin, antiplatelets&#xD;
      agents and warfarin) were employed. Even if effective, such treatments were accompanied by a&#xD;
      higher cost of side effects due to major bleeding (hemorrhagic stroke, retroperitoneal&#xD;
      bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, need for transfusion, site access complications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment with aspirin and ticlopidine was found to be very effective reducing intrastent&#xD;
      acute thrombosis. Since several days of pre-treatment were required it became a limiting&#xD;
      factor for interventional procedures forcing physicians to adopt a two-stage strategy that&#xD;
      separated the diagnostic from interventional time increasing the hospital's costs and the&#xD;
      patient's risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside that, high doses of heparin were still required during the procedures. The&#xD;
      introduction of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors was initially reserved to acute coronary syndrome,&#xD;
      later it was shown how they reduce the composite incidence of death, myocardial infarction&#xD;
      and the need for target vessel revascularization after percutaneous coronary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As major benefits arising from the use of those drugs, interventional procedures could be&#xD;
      carried out at end of diagnostic procedure and major bleedings were reduced as require a&#xD;
      lower heparin regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays the most recent guidelines for the management of patients with acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome strongly recommend the use of IIb/IIIa inhibitors when percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention is performed. Although several randomized trials with different IIb/IIIa&#xD;
      inhibitors have demonstrated the usefulness of this therapeutic strategy a number of unsolved&#xD;
      issues concerning which agent should be used and most appropriate timing and dosage remain to&#xD;
      be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of tirofiban (10µ/Kg bolus followed by a 0.15µ/Kg/min infusion) during PCI has been&#xD;
      evaluated with controversial results. The TARGET trial showed that tirofiban provides a&#xD;
      significantly less protection during PCI than abciximab, and the RESTORE trial found that&#xD;
      tirofiban did not significantly reduce the combined endpoint in comparison with heparin&#xD;
      alone. The sub-therapeutic inhibition of GP IIb/IIIa binding activity has been invoked, in&#xD;
      the first hour of tirofiban treatment, as plausible explanation, in fact with a 10µ/Kg bolus&#xD;
      as employed in the TARGET study about 60% of platelet inhibition was achieved in the first&#xD;
      hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schneider first proposed an high dose bolus (25µ/Kg bolus followed by a 0.15µ/Kg/min 18-h&#xD;
      infusion) to improve the efficacy of tirofiban during percutaneous coronary interventions and&#xD;
      the extent of average inhibition increased during first hour to 95% that is similar with that&#xD;
      achieved by abciximab. This observation was followed by several papers (with short series of&#xD;
      patients) comparing the efficacy and safety of high dose bolus of tirofiban and abciximab&#xD;
      that showed similar efficacy for both IIb-IIIa inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among those the works of Danzi (Brescia I), Bolognese (EVEREST sudy ) (Arezzo I) and&#xD;
      Gunasekara (Brisbane Au). In all these studies the number of enrolled patients was slightly&#xD;
      enough to compare tirofiban and abciximab for their efficacy but it is still uncertain if&#xD;
      high dose bolus of tirofiban could suffer of major side effects due to bleeding. Even if in&#xD;
      all those studies the safety of high dose bolus of tirofiban was disclaimed, the study&#xD;
      populations were too small for conclusive data. Actually no data are available in the&#xD;
      literature on larger series of patients treated with high dose bolus of tirofiban.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S. Anna Hospital Report After the preliminary results showing a similar effect using&#xD;
      abciximab and high dose bolus of tirofiban, from September 2002, we started high dose regimen&#xD;
      of tirofiban with good therapeutic result and no evidence of major side effects. Since&#xD;
      January 2003 high dose bolus of tirofiban was then adopted as routine regimen for all&#xD;
      patients undergoing to percutaneous coronary interventions considering that treatment as&#xD;
      having the best efficacy to cost ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of all those patients (about 2000) were collected in our files and could be&#xD;
      retrieved for a safety study with regard to the major side effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is mortality. Secondary endpoints are: incidence of major bleeding and&#xD;
      the rate of site access complication. Major bleeding is defined as cerebrovascular,&#xD;
      (emorrhagic stroke), retroperitoneal bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, need for&#xD;
      transfusion. Site access complications is defined as pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula,&#xD;
      major hematoma (decrease in hematocrit level more than 15%) and need for surgical repair.&#xD;
      Sub-groups of patients referred to our institution to perform a rescue-PCI few hours after&#xD;
      thrombolyses failure and treated with high dose bolus of tirofiban will be also be&#xD;
      investigated as patient with high-risk of bleeding side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postdischarge clinical outcomes were ascertained by means of a hospital visit or information&#xD;
      collected through the referring cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data obtained from about 2000 patient's files will be written on a dedicated data form and&#xD;
      then they will be collected by means of a friendly user, dedicated program, compiled for that&#xD;
      study and then exported in a data file that will be analysed by BMDP package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables are expressed as mean value ± SD, and discrete variables are expressed&#xD;
      as absolute values and percentages. Clinical and instrumental variables will be compared&#xD;
      using the Student's t-, chi square and Fisher's exact test. For groups and and subgroups&#xD;
      analise of variance as well logistic regression will be performed. P values of &lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We planned to perform random controls to check the quality of data collection and interinal&#xD;
      analyse when 500th patient's data will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We think that even with the limitations of a retrospective study, such an investigation may&#xD;
      be of high interest and thus set the base, for future, to collect and perform a prospective&#xD;
      analyse of our data, in comparison (or in random allocation, with a 3 to 1 design) with&#xD;
      different agent(s).&#xD;
