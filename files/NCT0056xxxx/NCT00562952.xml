    <textblock>
      Increased levels of NT-proBNP are known to increase the risk of cardiac events in diabetic&#xD;
      patients. The other way around, patients with normal values have an excellent prognosis on&#xD;
      short-term. We intend in our study to proof the hypothesis, whether it is possible to&#xD;
      decrease NT-proBNP levels by intensified cardiac prevention care We aim those patients, who&#xD;
      already have elevated levels, although no history of a cardiac disease. This decrease in&#xD;
      NT-proBNP should be translated consequently in a decrease in cardiac events&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes mellitus have a several-fold increased risk for cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (1-3, 16). Early diagnosis of theses diseases might prevent or at least postpone occurence of&#xD;
      clinical manifest CAD and CHF. Multifactorial intervention, with a special interest on&#xD;
      cardiac disease are proven to be beneficial for diabetic patients (4). Whether all patients&#xD;
      benefit from a multi-drug supply including lipid lowering agents or antihypertensive drugs is&#xD;
      not known. Thus, special population have to be defined, who profit most. E.g. the STENO-&#xD;
      study population (4) consisted of patients with microalbuminuria. Microalbuminuria is known&#xD;
      to be a good marker for outcome in this population (5). Consistently to the fact that&#xD;
      microalbuminuria is a good marker for long-term outcome, the STENO-Investigators found a&#xD;
      long-term benefit (average 7.8 years) for multi-factorial intervention in this special&#xD;
      population. We recently found, that Nt-proBNP (Roche) is an excellent short-term predictor of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events and death (10 months on average) in diabetics without a history of&#xD;
      cardiac disease (6), which is already known for long-term (7-10). Patients above the normal&#xD;
      range have a 10 % risk of first occurrence of a cardiac disease or death within short time.&#xD;
      The advantage of Nt-BNP as a marker of risk is based on the fact, that it is increased in all&#xD;
      cardiac disease dependent on the severity. Our data reveal that Nt-proBNP is superior to most&#xD;
      known markers. The limitations of traditional surrogate marker of risk in diabetic patients&#xD;
      was recently discussed in a joint statement of the American Heart and Diabetic Associations (&#xD;
      Diabetes Care 2007 Januar).Whether lowering blood pressure or cholesterol is the optimal&#xD;
      surrogate for therapeutic success is questionable. The Jikei Heart study (11) nicely shows a&#xD;
      comparable decrease in blood pressure in several treatment groups, but a tremendous&#xD;
      difference in outcome. The heart failure paradoxon demonstrates, that in this population&#xD;
      patients with low blood pressure (12) or low cholesterol (13) are those with worse prognosis.&#xD;
      And heart failure is immanent in diabetes. On the other hand a decrease in Nt-proBNP under&#xD;
      therapy is known to be an excellent marker of outcome (14). We hypothesize, that including&#xD;
      diabetic patients without a history of cardiac disease but increased levels of Nt-BNP will be&#xD;
      an excellent short-term risk-population for prevention therapy. And, decreasing Nt-proBNP&#xD;
      levels by optimized therapy will be a good marker for success to decrease the risk for future&#xD;
      imminent events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Patients will be cared by a cardiologic unit. In accordance to the guidelines&#xD;
      investigations will be performed to proof the existence of a manifest cardiac disease.&#xD;
      Further on treatment will be tailored to minimize the individual risk profile in accordance&#xD;
      to the guidelines (15). The main therapeutic focus will be a decrease in Nt-proBNP to 50% of&#xD;
      the value at index time or below normal values. Secondly, a special focus will be set on&#xD;
      optimizing anti-hyperglycemic therapy by a diabetologist (treatment to target). Further&#xD;
      guideline-recommended medical treatment will be initiated if not yet started (if no&#xD;
      contraindication exists all patients will receive oral anti-platelet therapy and lipid&#xD;
      lowering medication). After obtained informed consent, patients will be investigated as&#xD;
      clinical appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance of echocardiography is mandatory to exclude aortic stenosis and to proof the&#xD;
      existence of heart failure- as recommended by the guidelines. Group A:patients will receive&#xD;
      scheduled visits monthly to optimize pharmacologic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After optimization visits will be performed as clinical appropriate. In between patients have&#xD;
      the opportunity to contact a responsible person and will be contacted additionally by&#xD;
      telephone to proof therapeutic success. As clinical appropriate every visit laboratory sample&#xD;
      will be drawn, demographic data, data about diabetic complications, pulse and blood pressure&#xD;
      will be taken, to test, whether treating goals are reached (see CRF for details). After one&#xD;
      year a scheduled visit is mandatory to obtain laboratory samples, pulse and blood pressure to&#xD;
      proof final therapeutic success based on the goal parameter, cholesterol, Nt-pro-BNP, heart&#xD;
      rate, blood pressure, HBA1c. Group B patients will be cared by the treating physicians as&#xD;
      before. The patient and the physicians will be informed about the results of the&#xD;
      investigations. After 1 year the patients receive a scheduled visit, where demographic data,&#xD;
      data about diabetic complications, lab samples, ECG, and blood pressure will be taken.&#xD;
      Anamnesis about hospitalization and drug prescription will be obtained. If a patient&#xD;
      prematurely dies, data will be obtained by the treating physician or other responsible&#xD;
      institutions. After two years only data about hospitalization and death will be obtained by&#xD;
      telephone contact with the patient or the Melderegister in Group A and B. Observation period:&#xD;
      1 year Cohort: 150 patients in each group&#xD;
