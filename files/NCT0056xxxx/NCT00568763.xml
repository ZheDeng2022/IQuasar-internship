      RATIONALE: Radiofrequency therapy and radiofrequency ablation use a high-frequency electric&#xD;
      current to kill tumor cells. Radiofrequency therapy can also cause the body to produce&#xD;
      heat-shock proteins which may help kill more tumor cells. Cryotherapy kills tumor cells by&#xD;
      freezing them. It is not yet known whether heat-shock proteins caused by radiofrequency&#xD;
      therapy given together with radiofrequency ablation or cryotherapy is more effective in&#xD;
      treating stage IV melanoma than radiofrequency therapy-induced heat-shock proteins alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the side effects of radiofrequency&#xD;
      therapy-induced endogenous heat-shock proteins when given alone or together with&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation or cryotherapy in treating patients with stage IV melanoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of endogenous heat-shock protein (hsp)70 synthesis&#xD;
           at the site of the tumor using radiofrequency therapy (RFT) in patients with stage IV&#xD;
           malignant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of hsp70 release into the circulation using RFT&#xD;
           alone vs RFT followed by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or cryotherapy in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the feasibility of inducing a primary antitumor immune response using RFT with&#xD;
           or without additional local therapy (i.e., RFA or cryotherapy) in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gain preliminary insight into the antitumor efficacy of an in vivo heat shock vaccine in&#xD;
           these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (closed to enrollment as of 12/7/06): Patients undergo percutaneous biopsy of the&#xD;
           target lesion and placement of a localization marker. Patients then undergo&#xD;
           radiofrequency therapy (RFT) to the target lesion to induce the production of endogenous&#xD;
           heat-shock proteins. After the procedure is completed, patients undergo a second biopsy&#xD;
           of the target lesion. Patients also receive an intratumoral injection of sargramostim&#xD;
           (GM-CSF) to promote further ablation at the tumor site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients undergo percutaneous biopsies and RFT as in arm I followed by&#xD;
           radiofrequency ablation of the target lesion. Patients also receive intratumoral GM-CSF&#xD;
           as in arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm III: Patients undergo percutaneous biopsies and RFT as in arm I followed by&#xD;
           cryoablation of the target lesion. Patients also receive intratumoral GM-CSF as in arm&#xD;
           I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor tissue samples are obtained by core biopsy immediately before and immediately after RFT&#xD;
      for RNA and protein analysis. Tissue samples are assessed by immunohistochemistry for tumor&#xD;
      phenotype (i.e., MART-1, tyrosinase, or gp100) and for quantification of infiltrating&#xD;
      lymphocytes. Peripheral blood samples are also obtained before and after treatment and&#xD;
      periodically during study for immunologic analyses. Peripheral blood-derived lymphocytes are&#xD;
      tested with a panel of monoclonal antibodies to estimate the percentages of cytotoxic T&#xD;
      lymphocytes (CTLs), including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as B cells, monocytes, and&#xD;
      dendritic cells. In addition, assays are performed to estimate T-cell responses to polyclonal&#xD;
      stimulus (i.e., PHA), recall antigens (i.e., tetanus toxoid), and HLA alloantigens. Estimates&#xD;
      of peptide-specific CTLs are also obtained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays after&#xD;
      in vitro stimulation with peptide-sensitized stimulator cells. Antibodies to extractable&#xD;
      nuclear antigens (ENA) and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) will also be evaluated. GM-CSF levels&#xD;
      and Hsp70 is assessed in tumor cells and peripheral blood by flow cytometry or enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.&#xD;
