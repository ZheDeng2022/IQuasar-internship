  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Src expression has been identified in a majority of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cell&#xD;
      lines and there is preclinical evidence that Src family kinases may be important in hypoxic&#xD;
      growth and angiogenesis in NSCLC. We hypothesize that the inhibition of Src pathway with&#xD;
      dasatinib will demonstrate anti-tumor activity in early stage NSCLC, with a tolerable safety&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive dasatinib, a Src inhibitor, for 3 weeks prior to surgical resection for&#xD;
      early stage NSCLC. Fresh frozen tumor tissue is needed for genomic analysis. If fresh frozen&#xD;
      tumor tissue is not available from the initial diagnosis, a biopsy will be required to&#xD;
      participate in this trial. A second tumor sample will be obtained at time of surgical&#xD;
      resection to evaluate for changes in genomic expression profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be eligible to receive 3 months of adjuvant dasatinib therapy after completion&#xD;
      of standard adjuvant therapy or after recovery from surgery if no standard adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      is given, if there is evidence of neoadjuvant tumor response (radiologic and/or pathologic)&#xD;
      to dasatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients who present with NSCLC are active smokers. Patients who are smoking up until&#xD;
      the time of their surgery experience increased peri-operative complications compared to&#xD;
      patients who have not smoked cigarettes immediately prior to surgery. While this trial will&#xD;
      not be limited to active smokers, the period of smoking cessation prior to surgery is an&#xD;
      attractive window of opportunity during which the potentially active novel anticancer therapy&#xD;
      dasatinib can be offered to the patient.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of dasatinib, a targeted biologic agent, known to inhibit Src. It is&#xD;
      difficult to assess outcome in phase II adjuvant trials because there is no measurable&#xD;
      disease to evaluate efficacy and there are many variables that could confound comparing&#xD;
      survival of subjects on trial to historical controls. Therefore, after a fresh frozen tumor&#xD;
      tissue sample is obtained for genomic analysis, we plan to treat subjects with neoadjuvant&#xD;
      dasatinib and then measure tumor response to therapy prior to surgery. Resected tumor will&#xD;
      also be assessed for pathologic response as well as for changes in genomic expression&#xD;
      patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be treated with neoadjuvant dasatinib 70 mg PO twice daily for 3 weeks, with a&#xD;
      mandatory minimum of 3 days (72 hours) off of study drug prior to surgical resection. Imaging&#xD;
      studies will be done pre-treatment and pre-surgery to assess radiologic response to therapy.&#xD;
      The surgical specimen will be evaluated for pathologic response. A tumor tissue sample will&#xD;
      be obtained from the surgical specimen for genomic analysis and will be evaluated for changes&#xD;
      in genomic expression profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose tumors have a response to neoadjuvant dasatinib therapy might benefit with&#xD;
      better cancer control if they receive a potentially therapeutic course of adjuvant dasatinib.&#xD;
      Patients that have at least a 15% decrease or better objective response, without evidence of&#xD;
      progression to neoadjuvant dasatinib (per tumor evaluation pre-surgery) or pathologic&#xD;
      response (as defined as ≥30% tumor necrosis or cell death) to neoadjuvant dasatinib therapy&#xD;
      will be eligible to receive dasatinib 70 mg twice daily for 90 days after the completion of&#xD;
      standard adjuvant therapy or after recovery from surgery if no standard adjuvant therapy is&#xD;
      given. Patients will be followed for approximately 30 days after the last dose of dasatinib&#xD;
      to assess toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response will be evaluated in Src regulated and Src deregulated cohorts of tumors. If&#xD;
      responses to neoadjuvant dasatinib occur, then accrual to either or both cohorts will be&#xD;
      expanded. If there are no responses to neoadjuvant dasatinib in the cohort groups, then&#xD;
      accrual to either or both cohorts will be stopped. The results of this study may be useful in&#xD;
      designing future studies in early stage NSCLC using dasatinib alone or in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
