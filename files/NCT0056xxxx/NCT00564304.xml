  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal Potential Difference measurements (NPD) have been performed in Israel since 1996. NPD&#xD;
      measurements are used to assess the voltage across nasal epithelium, which correlates with&#xD;
      the transport of sodium and chloride across cell membranes. NPD was first demonstrated to be&#xD;
      abnormal in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) in 1981 and the technique has since been used to increase&#xD;
      our understanding of this condition. It is now established as an important diagnostic tool&#xD;
      and more recently has been used to assess the effectiveness of new treatments such as gene&#xD;
      and alternative therapy (Knowles 1995; Wilschanski 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nasal cavity is accessible which makes it a good site to examine the ion transport&#xD;
      characteristics of airway epithelia. Less than a centimetre into the nose the squamous (&quot;skin&#xD;
      type&quot;) epithelium becomes ciliated pseudocolumnar epithelium, characteristic of the proximal&#xD;
      airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change in NPD with the perfusion of different solutions is demonstrated. By employing NPD&#xD;
      protocols with perfusion of different solutions and drugs, different aspects of the nasal ion&#xD;
      transport characteristics can be examined. In CF, this ion transport profile is abnormal and&#xD;
      the NPD measurement has a number of features that differentiate CF from non-CF. This&#xD;
      methodology is well established for measurements in subjects over 6 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements on smaller children and infants have been very difficult to perform. We propose&#xD;
      a new method using smaller, single lumen catheters with much lower perfusion rates (0.2&#xD;
      ml/min compared to up to 5 ml/min with the adult method) .Perfusion measurements will be&#xD;
      possible in newly born infants. Obviously this opens up the potential for using NPD as a&#xD;
      diagnostic test in babies. This is important as the diagnosis of CF is often difficult to&#xD;
      make or refute in babies because of the problems in collecting enough sweat. This may be the&#xD;
      ideal diagnostic test for CF in the neonatal nursery in infants with meconium plug syndrome.&#xD;
