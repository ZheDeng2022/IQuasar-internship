  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to investigate the impact of a comprehensive, team-based,&#xD;
      family-centered, lifestyle modification program on body weight, metabolic abnormalities,&#xD;
      fitness measures, and self-esteem in overweight adolescents beginning the study at ages 11-18&#xD;
      years. The intensive program will uniquely include a &quot;team&quot; structure and a component&#xD;
      designed to address the role of parental modeling in effective lifestyle changes. By&#xD;
      comparing the demographic, psychosocial, and metabolic characteristics of adolescents&#xD;
      according to the degree of weight loss, the study will also more fully characterize the&#xD;
      barriers that prevent successful participation in an intensive lifestyle modification&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

      The study will annually enroll 100 - 200 adolescent male and female subjects between 11 and&#xD;
      18 years of age with a BMI &gt; the 85th percentile and one parent. Adolescents enrolled in the&#xD;
      study, will participate in a structured exercise program and meet regularly with a dietitian&#xD;
      and behavior specialist for nutrition education and review and update of progress and goals.&#xD;
      The study is designed for 2 years of participation with data collection points at baseline, 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. Data collected from adolescents include demographic&#xD;
      information anthropometric information (height, weight, blood pressure, temperature, pulse,&#xD;
      percent body fat); assessments of nutritional knowledge, food choices and dietary intake;&#xD;
      assessments of activity and fitness level of behavioral status (depression, self-esteem,&#xD;
      self-confidence, satisfaction with life, happiness, perspectives on health, exercise and&#xD;
      diet, family environment, quality of life, body awareness, teasing, social efficacy,&#xD;
      self-perception, coping mechanisms), assessments of sleep time and quality and physiological&#xD;
      and medical data (including blood and urine tests)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will accompany their children to the nutrition and behavior support visits, and&#xD;
      attend 12 group educational sessions to learn skills and strategies to help their children&#xD;
      adopt healthier eating and exercise behaviors. Data collected from parents will include&#xD;
      demographic, anthropometric measures (height, weight, blood pressure, temperature, pulse,&#xD;
      percent body fat); and assessments of activity level, dietary intake and eating habits,&#xD;
      behavioral status, child-feeding practices, and understanding of their child.&#xD;
