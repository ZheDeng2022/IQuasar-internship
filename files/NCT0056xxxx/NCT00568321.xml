        <description>Participants assessed their average daily pain during the past 24 hours on an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) with lower scores indicating less pain. Scores for each time interval over the weeks were calculated from the mean of daily pain score of participants over that specified duration. Change from baseline was calculated as the average of each specified week interval (Week 1 to 4, 1 to 8, 1 to 12, 5 to 8, 5 to 12 and 5 to 16) values minus the baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (mBPI-sf) Scale Score for Worst Pain, Average Pain and Pain Severity at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 ,12 and 16</title>
        <description>mBPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire (5 questions) to assess pain severity and impact of pain on daily functions. Questions 1 to 4 measure the magnitude of pain (Q1 for worst, Q2 for least, Q3 for average and Q4 for pain right now) on an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) with lower scores indicate less pain. Question 5 consists of 7 item subsets which measure the level of interference of pain on daily functions: 1: general activity, 2: mood, 3: walking ability, 4: normal work, 5: relations with other, 6: sleep, 7: enjoyment of life. Each item assessed on an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (no interference) to 10 (complete interference), where lower scores indicate less interference of pain. Pain severity score was derived from the sum of responses of questions 1-4 and ranged from 0 (no pain) to 40 (worst possible pain) with lower scores indicates less pain. Results are reported for worst pain score, average pain score and pain severity score.</description>

        <description>Participants assessed their average daily pain during the past 24 hours on an 11--point NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) with lower scores indicating less pain. Post-baseline weekly scores were calculated as the mean of average daily pain NRS scores over the past 7 days for each specified time point. Number of participants with &gt;=30% or &gt;=50% of reduction in average daily pain scores from baseline at Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 were reported.</description>

        <description>mBPI-sf:questionnaire (5 questions) to assess pain severity and impact of pain on daily functions. Questions 1-4 assess magnitude of pain(Q1 for worst, Q2 for least, Q3 for average and Q4 for pain right now) on an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) with lower scores indicate less pain. Question 5 consists 7 item subsets which assess level of interference of pain on daily functions: 1: general activity (GA),2: mood, 3: walking ability, 4: normal work (NW),5: relations with other,6: sleep, 7: enjoyment of life. Each item assessed on an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (no interference) to 10 (complete interference), where lower scores =less interference of pain. These 7 items were averaged to obtain pain interference composite score (CS), ranging from 0 (no interference) to 10 (complete interference), where lower scores =less interference of pain. Change from baseline in mBPI-sf score for pain interference with CS score, GA subtest and NW subtest were reported.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Patient's Global Assessment of Pain Score at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16</title>
        <description>Patient's global assessment of pain from post-herpetic neuralgia assessed participant's overall impression of disease activity. Participants answered: &quot;Considering all the ways your pain from post-herpetic neuralgia, how are you doing today?&quot;. Participants responded using a 5--point Likert scale with a score of 1 being the best (very good) and a score of 5 being the worst (very poor) with lower scores indicating better condition. Number of participants who reported a change from Baseline of -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in Patient's Global Assessment of Pain scores at each specified time-point were presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Each Response Level of Patient's Global Evaluation of Study Medication</title>
        <description>Participants provided their response for patient's global evaluation of study medication by answering a question. Participants answered: &quot;In all ways, how would you rate your overall response to the study medication today?&quot; Participants responded using a 4-¬point likert scale where 1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good and 4 = excellent. Higher score indicating better overall response to the treatment. Number of participants with each response level (poor, fair, good and excellent) were reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (mBPI-sf) Score for Pain Interference With Sleep at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 ,12 and 16</title>
        <description>mBPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire (5 questions) to assess pain severity and impact of pain on daily functions. Questions (Q) 1-4 assess magnitude of pain severity (Q1 for worst, Q2 for least, Q3 for average, Q4 for pain right now) on an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) with lower scores indicate less pain. Question 5 consists of 7 item subsets which assess the level of interference of pain on daily functions: 1: general activity, 2: mood, 3: walking ability, 4: normal work, 5: relations with other, 6: sleep, 7: enjoyment of life. Each item was assessed on an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (no interference) to 10 (complete interference), where lower scores indicated less interference of pain. Change from Baseline in mBPI-sf score for pain interference with sleep were reported.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population included all randomized participants who received Day 1 IV infusion (either tanezumab or placebo). Here, ''overall number of participants analyzed'' signifies number of participants evaluable for this outcome measure and &quot;number analyzed&quot; signifies those participants who were evaluable at given time points.</population>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 112 days after last dose (up to Week 16) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised (HVLT-R) at Week 2, 6, 12, 16 and End of Study</title>
        <description>HVLT-R was a word-list learning and memory test used to assess the changes in memory. The task was repeated, for a total of 3 learning trials. After a delay interval of 20 to 25 minutes, delayed recall trial was administered. 1)Learning efficiency: Assessed by examining the learning curve over 3 learning trials and by evaluating the sum of the scores for all 3 learning trials. Raw scores for each of the 3 learning trials were summed for the total recall (TR) score. The TR score ranges from 0 to 36, where higher scores indicated greater verbal learning and recall, 2) Ability to access newly learned information: Assessed by the number of words retained on the delayed recall (DR) trial and the percentage of words recalled from the word list. DR trial score ranges from 0 to 12, where higher scores indicated greater verbal learning and recall.</description>

Raw scores for each of the 3 learning trials were summed for the total recall (TR) score. The TR score ranges from 0 to 36, where higher scores indicated greater verbal learning and recall, 2) Ability to access newly learned information: Assessed by the number of words retained on the delayed recall (DR) trial and the percentage of words recalled from the word list. DR trial score ranges from 0 to 12, where higher scores indicated greater verbal learning and recall.</description>
