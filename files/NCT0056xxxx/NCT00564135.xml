  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the advent of minimally invasive surgery, laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy&#xD;
      (LAVH) is currently advocated as an alternative to abdominal hysterectomy. Reported benefits&#xD;
      of LAVH in short-term study, when compared with the abdominal hysterectomy, include shorter&#xD;
      hospital stays and convalescence, less postoperative pain, lower morbidity. To our best&#xD;
      knowledge, no study has been conducted to examine bladder catheterization is associated with&#xD;
      PUR and UTI after LAVH. No study has been performed to evaluate the long-term sequelae of PUR&#xD;
      after LAVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 150 patients undergoing LAVH are randomly assigned to have an indwelling Foley&#xD;
      catheter for 0 (n = 50), at 7AM-8AM in the morning of postoperative day 1 (n = 50), at&#xD;
      7AM-8AM in the morning of postoperative day 2 (n = 50) after the procedure by selecting a&#xD;
      sealed envelope, which is opened before the operation. The inclusion criteria are uterine&#xD;
      fibroids, endometriosis, abnormal bleeding, uterine prolapse and intra-epithelial neoplasia&#xD;
      of the cervix grade 3. Patients are excluded if they experienced pelvic reconstructive&#xD;
      surgery for pelvic organ prolapse or stress urinary incontinence; if they have bacteriuria&#xD;
      and clinical urinary tract symptoms, e.g. dysuria, frequency, urgency and stress incontinence&#xD;
      before surgery. After surgery, all patients stay at least 2 days in the hospital. The&#xD;
      incidences of febrile morbidity and other postoperative complications are recorded. The&#xD;
      outcome is assessed as immediate postoperative urinary tract symptoms, urinary tract&#xD;
      bacteriuria (defined as a positive culture &gt; 105 organisms/µl), postoperative fever &gt; 38°C&#xD;
      and urinary retention or the inability to pass urine 6 hours after catheter remove. All&#xD;
      patients are followed up at 3 months and one year after surgery. To demonstrate quality of&#xD;
      life of women after undergo LAVH, a generic instrument of MOS Short Form 36 (SF-36) and two&#xD;
      specific instruments for urinary problems, Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ7) and&#xD;
      Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI) are asked to answer in all patients before surgery and&#xD;
      postoperative follow-up. All data are analyzed by the two-tailed Fisher exact test when&#xD;
      appropriate. Correlation coefficients are calculated to determine the associations of&#xD;
      preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors with the incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      urinary retention and positive urine cultures. A value of p &lt; 0.05 is considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hysterectomy is the most common major gynecological operation performed; in previous study,&#xD;
      20% of women will have undergone a hysterectomy by the age of 50 years, mostly for&#xD;
      nonmalignant conditions such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis, abnormal bleeding, uterine&#xD;
      prolapse and intra-epithelial neoplasia of the cervix grade 3. (1) Fever is the most common&#xD;
      perioperative complication of hysterectomy, arising in about 25%. (2) The other early&#xD;
      complications associated with hysterectomy including hemorrhage, infection, and injury to&#xD;
      adjacent organs, femoral neuropathy, and thromboembolic disease. (3) However, whether&#xD;
      hysterectomy is linked to the development of urinary symptoms remains controversial. Some&#xD;
      groups observed no effect or improved urinary dysfunction after hysterectomy, (4-7) others&#xD;
      reported that hysterectomy is the cause of a variety of urinary symptoms including the&#xD;
      urethral syndrome, stress incontinence, detrusor overactivity and voiding difficulty. (8, 9)&#xD;
      Voiding difficulty in the female is a condition in which the bladder fails to empty&#xD;
      completely and easily after micturition. Failure to detect voiding difficulties after surgery&#xD;
      may lead to bladder overdistention and irreversible damage of the detrusor muscle. (10)&#xD;
      Postoperative urinary retention (PUR) is defined as the inability to void with a full bladder&#xD;
      during the postoperative period. The etiology of PUR involves a combination of many factors,&#xD;
      including sedation, type of anesthesia, increased sympathetic stimulation, overdistension of&#xD;
      bladder by large quantities of fluids given intravenously, pain and anxiety. (11) In the&#xD;
      literature, incidence of postoperative urinary retention (PUR) has ranged from 3.8% to 80%,&#xD;
      depending on the definition used and the type of surgery performed. (12-15) There is no&#xD;
      consensus on how to diagnose PUR and various criteria, such as clinical symptoms, bladder&#xD;
      palpation and a fixed time interval or drainage by catheterization of more than 500 ml of&#xD;
      urine, have been used. (16) Traditionally gynecologists have used an indwelling catheter for&#xD;
      abdominal surgical procedures for several reasons, including the beliefs that women would be&#xD;
      unable to void satisfactorily in the immediate postoperative period, that the indwelling&#xD;
      catheter provided the only reliable method of assuring adequate exposure, and that a catheter&#xD;
      would be necessary in the recording of intake-output. In fact, prompted by women's dislike of&#xD;
      the catheter as well as an increased incidence of postoperative urinary tract infection&#xD;
      (UTI). (17) The potential sequelae of UTI include gram-negative bacteremia, antimicrobial&#xD;
      toxicity, chronic bacteriuria and chronic renal disease. (18) In most cases the infection is&#xD;
      mild and easily treated, but UTI is the commonest nosocomial infection and leads to increased&#xD;
      morbidity and treatment costs. (18-20) Some North American studies addressing postoperative&#xD;
      UTI have been confounded by the use of perioperative antibiotics, (17, 21) suggesting UTI&#xD;
      rates of 3-10%, whereas British work has suggested a rate of 35% in control patients&#xD;
      receiving no antibiotics. (22) It has been estimated that the risk of UTI associated with&#xD;
      indwelling catheterization is 5-10% per day of catheterization (18) and that the commonest&#xD;
      cause of UTI in hospital is urinary catheterization (23). Short-term catheterization has been&#xD;
      associated with subsequent bacterial colony counts of &gt; 105/ml of urine in 21% of women&#xD;
      undergoing minor surgery, (24) and the incidence of positive urine cultures rises with the&#xD;
      length of time catheterization is continued. (17, 18) In a randomized trial study for the&#xD;
      effect of prophylactic antibiotics on the postoperative UTI in patients undergoing abdominal&#xD;
      hysterectomy, Ireland et al found single dose cotrimoxazole is effective in reducing the&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative UTI from 35% in the control group to 4% in the treated group. (25)&#xD;
      Hakvoort et al studied whether prolonged urinary bladder catheterization after vaginal&#xD;
      prolapse surgery is advantageous. (26) They found that residual volumes &gt; 200 ml and need for&#xD;
      recatheterization occurred in 9% in the 4 days catheterization group versus 40% of patients&#xD;
      in the one day catheterization group (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.045-0.47). Positive urine cultures&#xD;
      were found in 40% of cases in the 4 days catheterization group versus 4% of patients in the&#xD;
      one day catheterization group (OR 15, 95% CI 3.2-68.6). By contrast, in a prospective study&#xD;
      of postoperative infection after abdominal and vaginal gynecological surgery, Kingdom et al&#xD;
      reported 40% of 115 patients receiving no prophylactic antibiotics developed a UTI in the&#xD;
      postoperative period and this was not clearly related to the need for postoperative&#xD;
      catheterization. (25) Since prolonged indwelling urinary catheterization may be associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk of UTI, increasing patient morbidity and potentially prolonging the&#xD;
      hospital stay (18), prophylactic antibiotics and a reduction in catheter time or no catheter&#xD;
      after surgery might be expected to reduce this risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the relationship of bladder catheterization with PUR, in published data of&#xD;
      prospective or retrospective studies on PUR after abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy, we found&#xD;
      that several factors of postoperative care affect the result of PUR including type of&#xD;
      surgery, use of catheter, duration of catheterization, and postoperative analgesia. (16, 17,&#xD;
      25, 27-30) During 4-year period, Summitt et al have not used postoperative bladder catheter&#xD;
      drainage after routine vaginal hysterectomy. (28) To assess the potential differences in&#xD;
      postoperative outcome, they prospectively compared the use of indwelling bladder catheter&#xD;
      drainage with no catheter use after standard vaginal hysterectomy. Their data showed 2&#xD;
      patients in the catheterized group required recatheterization after the catheters were&#xD;
      removed; none in the no-catheter group required a catheter. The results inferred that&#xD;
      indwelling catheterization appears unnecessary after routine vaginal hysterectomy. In a&#xD;
      prospective randomized trial study, Dobbs et al compared the infection rate and postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity between indwelling catheterization and in-out catheterization at the time of&#xD;
      abdominal hysterectomy. (27) Of the 95 patients in their study, 36% of that undergoing in-out&#xD;
      catheterization had PUR, requiring bladder emptying, compared with 4% of those receiving an&#xD;
      indwelling catheter. In addition, 29% of the catheterized group had urinary tract bacteriuria&#xD;
      compared with 13% of the uncatheterized group. They concluded that in-out urinary&#xD;
      catheterization at the time of routine abdominal hysterectomy was associated with a&#xD;
      significantly higher incidence of PUR compared with indwelling catheterization, and may have&#xD;
      implications for long-term bladder function. (27) Dobbs et al also pointed out that abdominal&#xD;
      muscular pain when the intra-abdominal pressure is increased during voiding coupled with the&#xD;
      decreased sensation for voiding due to analgesia, suggests that an indwelling catheter in the&#xD;
      immediate postoperative period will help to prevent long-term morbidity from bladder atony.&#xD;
      Bodker and Lose presented the prevalence of PUR was 9.2% in their patients receiving&#xD;
      gynecological surgery. (16) Of 124 patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy, 13.7% had PUR.&#xD;
      Of 24 patients undergoing laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH), 8.7% had PUR.&#xD;
      They concluded patients at risk of PUR are difficult to predict. The risk is higher after&#xD;
      laparotomy than after laparoscopy. A retention rate of 13.7% after abdominal hysterectomy is&#xD;
      fairly similar to that of 11.8% after gynecologic laparotomies reported by Schiotz, (29) Who&#xD;
      used an indwelling Foley catheter routinely for 20-24 hours to ascertain the risks of UTI and&#xD;
      aymptomatic bacteriuria. Based on 949 gynecologic laparotomies without the use of catheters&#xD;
      but with bladder needling at the end of surgery, Bartzen and Halferty found that 26% needed&#xD;
      catheterization. (17) They suggested that abstaining from the use of an indwelling catheter&#xD;
      was also associated with lower cost and greater patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the advent of minimally invasive surgery, LAVH is currently advocated as an alternative&#xD;
      to abdominal hysterectomy. Reported benefits of LAVH in short-term study, when compared with&#xD;
      the abdominal hysterectomy, include shorter hospital stays and convalescence, less&#xD;
      postoperative pain, lower morbidity, and, in some series, greater cost-effectiveness. (31-35)&#xD;
      Whereas benefits of LAVH in long-term follow-up, only few studies have appeared in the&#xD;
      literature. A report from Taiwan, Shen et al compared 1-month and 8-year follow-up of LAVH&#xD;
      and abdominal hysterectomy. In their 8-year follow-up showed no statistically significant&#xD;
      differences in vaginal vault prolapse, cystocele, rectocele, enterocele, postcoital bleeding,&#xD;
      and cuff granulation between LAVH and abdominal hysterectomy procedures. (36) However, with&#xD;
      regard to the consequences of PUR and UTI after LAVH, to our best knowledge, no study has&#xD;
      been conducted to examine bladder catheterization is associated with this problem.&#xD;
      Furthermore, no study has been performed to evaluate the long-term sequelae of PUR after&#xD;
      LAVH.&#xD;
