  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial tests the hypotheses that 1) body decolonization of patients with&#xD;
      recurrent community-associated (CA) MRSA infections and their household members and 2)&#xD;
      environmental decolonization of the patients' households will significantly reduce the&#xD;
      likelihood of recurrent CA-MRSA infection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Staphylococcus aureus is a ubiquitous pathogen, and causes infections of the skin, lung,&#xD;
      bloodstream, and other body parts. Over the past decade,community-acquired methicillin&#xD;
      resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) infections, which were previously extremely rare, are occurring&#xD;
      commonly worldwide. CA-MRSA is the most common cause of skin infection in many locales in the&#xD;
      U.S., including Southern California.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CA-MRSA strains are notable for their ability to spread in closed settings and cause&#xD;
      recurrent infections among healthy persons. Management of recurrent CA-MRSA infection is&#xD;
      challenging and optimal prevention strategies are undefined. Many experts recommend topical&#xD;
      agents that decontaminate the body and/or anterior nares. Others suggest environmental&#xD;
      decontamination to help control recurrences or transmission within households. However, there&#xD;
      are no data that quantify the efficacy and safety of these approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a multi-center clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of body and&#xD;
      environmental decolonization regimens in the prevention of CA-MRSA infection. This trial is&#xD;
      being conducted at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) sites among KPSC enrollees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will comprise of persons suffering from recurrent CA-MRSA infection.&#xD;
      Household members of this &quot;index subject&quot; will also be offered the chance to enroll in the&#xD;
      study. For this clinical trial, all subjects will be randomized in a 2 x 2 design to test: 1)&#xD;
      chlorhexidine body washes and nasal mupirocin ointment vs. usual care, and 2) environmental&#xD;
      cleansing with ethanol spray and aggressive laundering vs. no environmental cleansing.&#xD;
      Household members, should they consent, will also be enrolled into the study into the same&#xD;
      treatment arm as &quot;index subjects&quot;. We will also perform selected secondary analyses,&#xD;
      including studying the efficacy of the interventions at preventing infections in household&#xD;
      members. Additionally, we will examine strain relatedness of colonizing and infecting CA-MRSA&#xD;
      strains to better understand colonization dynamics within households.&#xD;

             decongestants, antihistamines, or anticholinergics). Patients who use these products&#xD;
             who are willing to discontinue therapy for seven days while mupirocin is administered&#xD;

             preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity among household members to the agents listed above,&#xD;
