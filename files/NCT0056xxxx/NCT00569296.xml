      RATIONALE: Giving autologous lymphocytes that have been treated in the laboratory with&#xD;
      antibodies may stimulate the immune system to kill tumor cells. Aldesleukin may stimulate the&#xD;
      lymphocytes to kill tumor cells. Colony-stimulating factors, such as GM-CSF, may increase the&#xD;
      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Giving laboratory-treated&#xD;
      autologous lymphocytes together with aldesleukin and GM-CSF may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of laboratory-treated&#xD;
      autologous lymphocytes when given together with aldesleukin and GM-CSF in treating patients&#xD;
      with recurrent, refractory, or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of EGFRBi-armed autologous activated&#xD;
           T-cells (ATC) when administered in combination with low-dose aldesleukin and&#xD;
           sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with recurrent, refractory, or extensive (metastatic)&#xD;
           non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess clinical outcome based on tumor responses, overall survival, and progression-free&#xD;
           survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitor changes in sera concentrations of the tumor marker in association with&#xD;
           EGFRBi-armed ATC administration throughout the study and at time points thereafter in&#xD;
           patients with elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) prior to beginning the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitor patient sera for human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate immune response, which may reflect immune augmentation in response to&#xD;
           EGFRBi-armed ATC infusions, in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples as well&#xD;
           as purified immune cell populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate proliferation in response to ex vivo stimulation with NSCLC tumor-associated&#xD;
           antigens, sera cytokine profiles (Th1 vs Th2), cytotoxicity of patient PBMC, and&#xD;
           interferon gamma ELISPOTS as a surrogate marker for assessing generation of&#xD;
           EGFR-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are collected by 1 or 2 leukaphereses for&#xD;
      the generation of activated T cells (ATCs). The PBMCs are activated with OKT3 (anti-CD3) and&#xD;
      expanded in aldesleukin for up to 14 days. The ATCs are then armed with EGFRBi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive EGFRBi-armed autologous ATCs IV over 30-60 minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks&#xD;
      (a total of 8 infusions) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients also receive low-dose aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) once daily and sargramostim&#xD;
      (GM-CSF) SC twice weekly beginning 3 days before the first ATC infusion and continuing for 1&#xD;
      week after the last ATC infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
