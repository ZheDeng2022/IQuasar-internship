  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To assess whether EMG directed biofeedback therapy or Botulinum toxin type A&#xD;
      injection of the levator ani muscles has any effect on pain from the levator ani syndrome,&#xD;
      and, in addition, to what extent either treatment is superior to the other in terms of&#xD;
      anorectal physiologic measurements, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized, prospective, unblinded double-armed study with crossover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Female subjects, aged 18 and over, with painful levator ani muscle spasm for at&#xD;
      least one month duration will be randomized to receive either biofeedback therapy or&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin type A injection. After randomization they will all undergo visual analog&#xD;
      pain scoring, anorectal manometry, colonoscopy (if clinically indicated), and self-reported&#xD;
      SF-36 quality of life measurement. Each patient will also complete numerical pain scale&#xD;
      scoring, an SF-36, and a satisfaction questionnaire at each treatment visit and follow-up&#xD;
      visit. Patients will submit these by mail. Identification numbers will be assigned to each&#xD;
      subject for use on the SF-36 and Satisfaction Questionnaires throughout the study. Subjects&#xD;
      will again undergo anorectal manometry at the end of their treatment arms. In the biofeedback&#xD;
      arm patients will be treated biweekly for up to eight treatments and be provided exercises to&#xD;
      practice at home based on their muscle function noted during the biofeedback training&#xD;
      session. Subjects will keep a treatment diary of the exercises they do at home to help ensure&#xD;
      compliance with the protocol. In the Botulinum toxin injection arm patients will be treated&#xD;
      with scheduled injections of the levator ani muscles every six weeks for up to three total&#xD;
      injections of 100U each. These injections will be directed to the painful areas of the&#xD;
      levator muscles as guided by physical exam and EMG measurements. Should any patient fail&#xD;
      their initial randomized treatment assignment (failure defined as &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;dissatisfied&quot; on the satisfaction questionnaire), they will then be allowed to cross over to&#xD;
      the other study arm. In addition to numerical pain scale scoring, an SF-36 questionnaire and&#xD;
      anorectal manometry will also be repeated at the time of crossover. We intend to include all&#xD;
      randomized patients in the final data analysis (according to their originally assigned&#xD;
      treatment arm), regardless of outcome or reason for dropout, thus making this an&#xD;
      &quot;intent-to-treat&quot; analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pivotal Study Definitions: The definition of adequate pain reduction, for the purposes of&#xD;
      data analysis, will be a reduction in a subject's mean pain score of two on a numerical pain&#xD;
      scale (0-10). Failure of either therapy will be defined as a response of &quot;very dissatisfied&quot;&#xD;
      or &quot;dissatisfied&quot; on the satisfaction questionnaire at the end of either biofeedback (eight&#xD;
      treatment visits) or Botulinum toxin (three injections) both before and after crossover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: We will determine the following for biofeedback therapy and Botulinum toxin type A&#xD;
      injection: mean pain reduction, any differences in anorectal physiologic measurements (such&#xD;
      as mean resting anal sphincter pressure), any changes in self-reported quality of life, and&#xD;
      overall patient satisfaction.&#xD;
