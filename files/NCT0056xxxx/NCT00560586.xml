      -Intranasal budesonide therapy may lead to improved symptoms and sleep study findings in&#xD;
      children with mild obstructive sleep apnea with and without allergic rhinitis that would not&#xD;
      be treated with T&amp;A. The aim of the study is to conduct a randomized double blind cross-over&#xD;
      trial comparing the effect of once a day intranasal budesonide therapy vs. placebo in&#xD;
      children with mild sleep apnea that would not be candidates for T&amp;A.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Untreated OSAS can result in serious morbidity, primarily affecting neurobehavioral and&#xD;
      cardiovascular systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of OSAS is only partially related to the adenoid and tonsillar size. While&#xD;
      adenotonsillectomy (T&amp;A) is the most common treatment for children with OSAS, this approach&#xD;
      is reserved for children whose apnea/hypopnea index in the overnight sleep study exceeds a&#xD;
      critical value. However, there is no consensus on the appropriate management of children with&#xD;
      AHI &gt;1 but &lt;7 events/hour of sleep. These children constitute between 4-6% of all children&#xD;
      and there are no alternative long-term interventions, and therefore a medical approach that&#xD;
      obviates surgery, yet leads to substantial amelioration in the sleep-disordered breathing is&#xD;
      critically needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-inflammatory agents like intra-nasal corticosteroids are considered an effective&#xD;
      treatment for children with allergic rhinitis. However, only one study has been conducted so&#xD;
      far, and has examined the effect of intranasal corticosteroids, in pediatric patients with&#xD;
      florid OSAS. Thus, no studies are available on topical steroids in patients with OSAS&#xD;
      severity that would not justify T&amp;A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our leading hypothesis is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Intranasal budesonide therapy may lead to improved symptoms and polysomnographic findings&#xD;
      in children with OSAS with and without allergic rhinitis that would not be treated with T&amp;A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects And Methods Study population Specific Aim. Up to 100 children will be recruited from&#xD;
      all pediatric patients referred for evaluation of snoring and who underwent clinical&#xD;
      evaluation, lateral neck x-ray, and an overnight sleep study at the Kosair Children's&#xD;
      Hospital Sleep Medicine and Apnea Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Specific Aim: After informed consent is obtained from the parents, children&#xD;
      fulfilling the entry criteria will be randomized using a table of random numbers that will be&#xD;
      provided by Astra-Zeneca. Patients will be allocated into parallel treatment groups with&#xD;
      simple randomization in blocks of 4 in a double blind fashion, according to the randomization&#xD;
      procedure delineated by Astra-Zeneca All patients will complete a questionnaire regarding&#xD;
      symptoms of snoring and allergic rhinitis symptoms prior to starting the study. One of the&#xD;
      groups will start a-6 week course of either nasal topical budesonide (32 mcg/puff/nostril to&#xD;
      both nostrils (total of 64 mcg), once a day or placebo. Parents will be instructed to give&#xD;
      the drug at bedtime. Parents will be contacted weekly by the investigators to determine&#xD;
      whether the study drug is being given as prescribed. When unable to contact parents by phone,&#xD;
      they will be sent a follow up letter accompanied with the weekly questionnaire and a&#xD;
      postage-paid return envelope. After 6 weeks, patients will have an overnight sleep study,&#xD;
      lateral neck x-ray, and they will fill in a questionnaire regarding snoring and rhinitis&#xD;
      symptoms.. At the end of the 6 weeks, patients will start a 6-week course with the compound&#xD;
      that they were not receiving during the 1st phase of the study. All the outcome endpoints&#xD;
      will be assessed again upon completion of the 2nd 6-week course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall rationale for this schedule is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are aiming to assess whether intranasal budesonide is effective in ameliorating&#xD;
      sleep-disordered breathing in these children. Therefore, we aim to maximize the number of&#xD;
      children receiving intranasal budesonide. This is achieved in the above experimental scheme&#xD;
      since all children will receive 6 weeks of the therapy, either at the onset of their 12-week&#xD;
      participation or after 6 weeks (for those who will be randomized to placebo treatment in the&#xD;
      initial 6 weeks). The rationale for a 6-week duration period is that we anticipate that the&#xD;
      reduction in adenoid volume will be a slow process that requires between 3-6 weeks to reach&#xD;
      its peak effect. We also wish to determine whether cessation of intranasal budesonide is&#xD;
      associated with exacerbation of the SDB. To this effect, the group of children who were&#xD;
      initially treated with budesonide for 6 weeks will provide the data towards answering this&#xD;
      important question. We anticipate that rebound increase in severity will occur but may take&#xD;
      several weeks to manifest since the incremental growth of adenoid tissue will also take time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both nasal-budesonide and placebo inhalers will be provided in identical containers by the&#xD;
      drug manufacturer. The appearance and smell of the budesonide and placebo will be&#xD;
      indistinguishable. The investigators will not be aware of the compound being used. The codes&#xD;
      for each patient will be kept by Astra-Zeneca. If any adverse event develops, the patients&#xD;
      will be withdrawn from the study and followed clinically to assess overall clinical course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms questionnaire All patients will fill a snoring and symptom questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lateral Neck X-Rays This will be performed using standard techniques in the Radiology&#xD;
      Department at KCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overnight Polysomnography All children participating in the study will be&#xD;
      polysomnographically studied before inclusion as part of their routine clinical evaluation.&#xD;
      In addition, they will undergo 2 additional sleep studies, each at the end of the 6-week&#xD;
      intervention period of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics A sample size of 50 patients per arm in this parallel design study was estimated&#xD;
      based on an alpha error of 0.05, beta error of 0.2, a baseline mean apnea hypopnea index&#xD;
      (AHI) of 3, with an SD of 1.5, and a potential decrease in AHI by 20%. In addition, such&#xD;
      number of subjects would allow for detection of a 30% improvement in rhinitis scores. Even if&#xD;
      attrition occurs, 40 subjects per arm will be sufficient assuming a 30% improvement in AHI&#xD;
      according to sleep study. This design and number will also permit accurate determination of&#xD;
      rebound exacerbation following transition from budesonide to placebo in half the subjects.&#xD;
      (see above). Results will be expressed as the mean +/- SEM. To assess treatment&#xD;
      effectiveness, paired t-tests will be used to compare normally distributed variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks Nasal budesonide (Rhinocort Aqua, AstraZeneca) is generally well tolerated..&#xD;
      The most commonly reported adverse events( more then 2%) for Rhinocort Aqua and vehicle&#xD;
      placebo (a formulation with no active drug) respectively were: epistaxis (nosebleed) - 8&#xD;
      percent vs 5 percent; pharyngitis (sore throat) - 4 percent vs 3 percent; bronchospasm 2&#xD;
      percent vs 1 percent; nasal irritation - 2 percent vs &lt;1 percent; and coughing - 2 percent vs&#xD;
      &lt;1 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rare adverse events reported include: nasal septum perforation, pharynx disorders (throat&#xD;
      irritation or pain, swollen throat, burning throat, itching throat, angioedema, anosmia and&#xD;
      palpitations. Even though, studies have shown detectable adrenal suppression with intranasal&#xD;
      steroids administration,30 intranasal budesonide 200 Âµg once daily has been found to have no&#xD;
      effects on 24 hour, or fractionated cortisol profiles in serum or urine.31 And although&#xD;
      transient growth suppression have been reported with medium to high dose inhaled steroids, no&#xD;
      similar side effects were reported during clinical studies with intranasal budesonide.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the addition of intranasal budesonide therapy to medium dose of inhaled&#xD;
      budesonide in children with asthma for approximately 24 months had no significant effect on&#xD;
      final adult height.32&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits It is possible that the participants will have improvements in the&#xD;
      severity of their OSAS and their snoring severity during nasal budesonide therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information obtained in our study, will help to define the role of nasal budesonide&#xD;
      intervening in the pathophysiology of OSAS, and the potential role of nasal budesonide as a&#xD;
      nonsurgical therapy for children with otherwise mild OSAS who would not be considered as&#xD;
      candidates for T&amp;A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of Research For children with OSAS that is too mild to justify T&amp;A surgery,&#xD;
      Intranasal therapy with budesonide may become a safe and effective new therapy aiming to&#xD;
      minimize the morbidity associated with OSAS in children.&#xD;
