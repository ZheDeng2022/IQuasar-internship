      To evaluate the effects of a single sc administration of TEZAMPANEL at one of three different&#xD;

      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Headache relief (headache response) defined as the percentage of patients in each treatment&#xD;
      group who experience a decrease in pain from moderate or severe intensity pre-dose (baseline)&#xD;
      to mild or no pain 2 hours after study drug administration and prior to use of rescue&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients in each treatment group who are pain-free two hours after study&#xD;
           drug administration, prior to the use of any rescue medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sustained headache response rate (percentage of patients in each treatment group with&#xD;
           headache response at Hour 2 and no rescue medication or headache recurrence from 2&#xD;
           through 24 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sustained pain-free rate (percentage of patients in each treatment group who are pain&#xD;
           free at Hour 2 with no rescue medication or headache recurrence from 2 through 48 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recurrence rate (percentage of patients in each treatment group with an Hour 2 mild&#xD;
           response or pain-free response who subsequently develop a headache rated as moderate to&#xD;
           severe in intensity within 2 to 24 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relapse rate (percentage of patients in each treatment group with an Hour 2 pain free&#xD;
           response who subsequently develop a headache rated as moderate to severe in intensity&#xD;
           within 2 to 48 hours&#xD;
