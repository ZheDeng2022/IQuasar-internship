  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. It is estimated that, in 2004,&#xD;
      173,700 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in the United States alone and 164,440&#xD;
      deaths due to this disease will occur(13) . NSCLC accounts for approximately 80% of all lung&#xD;
      cancers. Among NSCLC cases approximately 30% present with locally advanced and 40% with&#xD;
      metastatic disease (14,15) . In metastatic disease, chemotherapy is the treatment of choice,&#xD;
      but benefits obtained in survival have been modest. Five-year survival is less than 15%,&#xD;
      probably due to diagnosis at late stages. Surgical results in earlier stages are poor&#xD;
      compared to other tumor types (about 40% of recurrence in stages I-II). Results of&#xD;
      chemotherapy in advanced stages are also poor (one-year survival of 40%) (15,17). It is&#xD;
      commonly accepted that the standard treatment for advanced disease (stage IV and IIIb with&#xD;
      malignant pleural effusion) consists of platinum-based chemotherapy(15,16) . However, there&#xD;
      are many open questions in the management of these patients, such as the role of 3-drugs&#xD;
      combinations, non-platinum-based therapies, and new biologic therapeutics' approaches.&#xD;
      Currently, in the treatment of advanced NSCLC response rates of about 20%-30% and median&#xD;
      survival times of 6 to 11 months have been achieved (16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,). Several&#xD;
      combinations of drugs are used and show similar efficacy. Cisplatin plus vinorelbine or&#xD;
      Cisplatin plus Gemcitabine are among the most commonly used regimens in the first-line&#xD;
      therapy of NSCLC.&#xD;
