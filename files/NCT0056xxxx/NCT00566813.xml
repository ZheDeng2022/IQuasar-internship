    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety of allogeneic islet&#xD;
      transplantation in type 1 diabetic patients performed at the University of Illinois at&#xD;
      Chicago (UIC). The purpose is to reproduce the Edmonton protocol to demonstrate that&#xD;
      pancreatic islets isolated at UIC are safe and of sufficient quality to provide reproducible&#xD;
      graft function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is becoming an unbearable burden for the health care system worldwide. The&#xD;
      incidence of disease has increased over the past 50 years, both for type I and type II&#xD;
      diabetes. In 2002, the expenditure for direct and indirect costs of diabetes reached the&#xD;
      astronomical amount of $132 billion for the USA alone. The burden suffered by patients is&#xD;
      also grave when we consider that diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy are now the leading&#xD;
      causes of renal failure and blindness in industrialized countries. Although major&#xD;
      improvements in insulin treatment and glycemic control have been achieved, the development of&#xD;
      hypoglycemic unawareness still represents a challenging clinical problem in the management of&#xD;
      diabetes. Severe hypoglycemic episodes are not only acutely life threatening but lead to&#xD;
      overall impairment of the quality of life of diabetic patients. Even under ideal study&#xD;
      conditions the pathophysiology of hypoglycemic unawareness is not fully understood. It seems&#xD;
      that each hypoglycemic episode reduces the counterregulatory hormone responses and the&#xD;
      subjective awareness of the following episode, generating a self-worsening mechanism. Islet&#xD;
      transplantation can effectively eliminate severe hypoglycemia and restore good glycemic&#xD;
      control. However, there are still several limitations to the widespread application of islet&#xD;
      transplantation. First, insulin independence is mostly achieved by transplanting a high&#xD;
      number of islets that are harvested from 2-4 donors. Second, post-transplant&#xD;
      insulin-independence is progressively lost over time despite continued endogenous insulin&#xD;
      secretion. Lastly, current immunosuppression carries potential risks and can only&#xD;
      incompletely prevent sensitization of the host and rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, clinical trials in islet transplantation face stringent federal regulations,&#xD;
      which define islets as a biological drug and islet transplantation as an experimental&#xD;
      procedure. Limited resources impose small and uncontrolled trials investigating a limited&#xD;
      number of new interventions to improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Phase 1/2 single center, uncontrolled trial in which 1-3 allogeneic&#xD;
      pancreatic islet transplants are performed for each study subject. Post-transplant follow-up&#xD;
      continues for 64 weeks after the final islet transplantation. Thereafter, subjects are&#xD;
      enrolled for a 5-year follow-up study and a 5 to 10 year follow-up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of islet transplantation depends primarily on the incidence of serious and&#xD;
      unexpected complications or adverse events and the ability of the cell isolation laboratory&#xD;
      to produce uncontaminated islet cell preparations with minimal endotoxin content. All study&#xD;
      subjects are followed for safety for one year. An independent Data Monitoring Committee&#xD;
      (DMC), composed of 3 members who have training in medicine and/or organ transplantation, will&#xD;
      review eligibility and safety data approximately 2 weeks after each islet transplantation and&#xD;
      every two months thereafter. An independent monitor knowledge on Good Clinical Practice(GCP)&#xD;
      guidelines and regulations monitors the study for compliance with 21 CFR and according to ICH&#xD;
      GCP Guidelines. Within the Clinical Research Center, the Scientific Advisory Committee and&#xD;
      the Research Subject Advocacy Program monitor safety. These entities report to the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board, which also reviews safety data annually and on occurrence of&#xD;
      serious adverse events. The principal investigator also report serious adverse events to the&#xD;
      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success: Islet transplantation is considered a success when subjects do not use insulin and&#xD;
      they achieve a fasting glucose level not exceeding 140 mg/dL more than three times in a week,&#xD;
      and not exceeding two-hour post-prandial values of 180 mg/dL more than four times in a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partial Success: Subjects who have a reduction in insulin requirements but who do not achieve&#xD;
      insulin independence and present with a reduction in HbA1c and number of hypoglycemic&#xD;
      episodes are considered to have partial success of islet transplantation. Reduction in&#xD;
      insulin-requirements are assessed by comparing the pre-transplant insulin requirement&#xD;
      recorded over two consecutive days (expressed as insulin units per kg) with the requirement&#xD;
      on the two consecutive days preceding the subsequent islet infusion, and the requirements on&#xD;
      two consecutive days at six months and again on two consecutive days at one year after the&#xD;
      final transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure: Absence of measurable levels of C-peptide after transplantation is considered as&#xD;
      failure of islet cell transplantation.&#xD;

    <description>Primary efficacy outcome: independence from insulin injections with adequate control of blood glucose in subjects with Type 1 diabetes. Transplant is considered a success when 2 weeks after their last transplant, subjects are not using insulin, and fasting glucose levels do not exceed 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) more than 3 times/week, and two-hour post-prandial glucose values do not exceed 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) more than 4 times/week. During the 15 months after last transplant, a subject will be considered a success if an illness or other event (e.g., high tacrolimus level) causes need for insulin not exceeding 14 days providing evidence of graft rejection is not apparent. The proportion of subjects who are insulin independent and meet criteria for glucose control will be determined at 2 weeks and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 15 months following their final islet transplant.</description>

        <description>Primary efficacy outcome: independence from insulin injections with adequate control of blood glucose in subjects with Type 1 diabetes. Transplant is considered a success when 2 weeks after their last transplant, subjects are not using insulin, and fasting glucose levels do not exceed 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) more than 3 times/week, and two-hour post-prandial glucose values do not exceed 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) more than 4 times/week. During the 15 months after last transplant, a subject will be considered a success if an illness or other event (e.g., high tacrolimus level) causes need for insulin not exceeding 14 days providing evidence of graft rejection is not apparent. The proportion of subjects who are insulin independent and meet criteria for glucose control will be determined at 2 weeks and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 15 months following their final islet transplant.</description>
