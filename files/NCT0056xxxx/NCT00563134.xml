  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis sometimes occurs in people who have a serious infection. It is caused by toxic&#xD;
      substances (toxins) from bacteria and other germs entering your bloodstream. Most people with&#xD;
      sepsis will recover with routine medical care before the illness gets more serious. However,&#xD;
      in some people, sepsis does become more serious. This severe sepsis can cause damage to&#xD;
      internal organs (such as your heart, lungs, kidneys, and liver) and can be life threatening.&#xD;
      Special natural fats, (called 'lipoproteins') in our blood are thought to help protect us&#xD;
      from the toxins produced by bacteria during sepsis. Levels of these lipoproteins are often&#xD;
      low in people with sepsis and this may make it more difficult to recover from the disease.&#xD;
      GR270773 is a new drug that has been developed to help the lipoproteins in protecting the&#xD;
      body against toxins. GR270773 is made from purified fats and oils from the soyabean and does&#xD;
      not contain cholesterol. This research study will test the safety (side effects) of GR270773&#xD;
      and whether or not it is effective in preventing complications in people with severe sepsis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is 18 years of age or over.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has one of the following bacterial infections (as defined in Section 14.5) and&#xD;
             a suspected or confirmed Gram-negative etiology:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Confirmed Gram-negative bacteremia (Gram-negative pathogen must be isolated from&#xD;
                  blood culture prior to study entry)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intra-abdominal infection&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Nosocomial pneumonia (Evidence of Gram-negative organism from histology or by&#xD;
                  direct stain of a respiratory specimen required prior to study entry)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pyelonephritis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is receiving new parenteral antibacterial treatment for the suspected or&#xD;
             confirmed Gram-negative infection believed to be responsible for this episode of&#xD;
             sepsis. The subject must receive study drug within 36 hours of commencing treatment&#xD;
             with this new antibacterial agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Changes in antibiotic coverage made to treat the infection causing the current&#xD;
        episode of sepsis or needed to treat a deteriorating subject in whom previous antibiotic&#xD;
        coverage was deemed inadequate will be viewed as a new antibiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has signs of new-onset severe sepsis as evidenced by at least ONE of the&#xD;
             following hypoperfusion abnormalities OR organ failures caused by the current episode&#xD;
             of sepsis. Subject must receive study medication within 12 hours from onset of the&#xD;
             first sepsis-related hypoperfusion abnormality or organ failure:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Persistent oliguria (urine output &lt;0.5 mL/kg/hr for at least two hours after&#xD;
                  adequate volume resuscitation (ie, &gt;=2 L isotonic crystalloid or appropriate&#xD;
                  colloid to achieve the same effect)) Note: This criterion does not apply to&#xD;
                  subjects with chronic renal insufficiency/failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Metabolic acidosis (either a pH &lt;=7.3 or a base deficit &gt;5 mmol/L and a blood&#xD;
                  lactate level &gt;2X the upper limit of normal)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Respiratory failure: PaO2/FiO2 &lt;200&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Coagulopathy: acute sepsis-related changes in either platelet count (&lt;100,000&#xD;
                  cells/mm3) or INR (&gt;1.5)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cardiovascular failure: sustained hypotension requiring vasopressor support&#xD;
                  (dopamine &gt;5 µg/kg/min, epinephrine, norepinephrine, phenylephrine or vasopressin&#xD;
                  at any dose if used to increase blood pressure) for &gt;1 hour in subjects in whom&#xD;
                  volume resuscitation is believed to be adequate (ie, subject has received &gt;=2 L&#xD;
                  isotonic crystalloid or appropriate colloid to achieve the same effect) Note:&#xD;
                  Where a hypoperfusion abnormality/organ failure definition requires a condition&#xD;
                  to persist for a specified period of time, the organ failure is not considered to&#xD;
                  exist until the condition specified by the definition is met. The 12 hour window&#xD;
                  for start of study drug begins when the criteria for the organ&#xD;
                  failure/hypoperfusion are fulfilled. For organ failure/hypoperfusion abnormality&#xD;
                  defined in terms of a laboratory result (ie, metabolic acidosis, respiratory&#xD;
                  failure, and coagulopathy) the criteria for the organ failure/hypoperfusion are&#xD;
                  considered to be fulfilled at the time the laboratory sample was drawn.&#xD;
                  Otherwise, the 12 hour window begins at the time the organ failure definition&#xD;
                  criteria are fulfilled (ie, persistent oliguria and cardiovascular failure).&#xD;
                  Organ failures occurring subsequent to subject randomization but prior to&#xD;
                  initiation of study drug infusion do not constitute a secondary endpoint. These&#xD;
                  are treated as organ failures at study entry and should be documented as such in&#xD;
                  the relevant CRF pages. The occurrence of a subsequent organ failure does not&#xD;
                  redefine the start of the 12 hour window for start of study drug. This period is&#xD;
                  defined above to begin at the onset of the first sepsis-related organ failure&#xD;
                  qualifying the subject for study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject or their legally acceptable representative has provided written and dated&#xD;
             informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject, if female of childbearing potential or less than one year post menopausal&#xD;
             (including those who are practicing birth control and those with tubal ligations), has&#xD;
             a negative urine pregnancy test (measuring human chorionic gonadotropin(HCG) result&#xD;
             prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is currently participating in or has participated in an investigational drug&#xD;
             or medical device trial within 30 days or five half-lives, which ever is longer, prior&#xD;
             to enrollment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is unlikely to remain in hospital for a minimum of three days (72 hours)&#xD;
             following enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has neutropenia (e.g., subject recently receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy with&#xD;
             absolute neutrophil count &lt;500/µL or expected to decline to &lt;500/µL in the next 3&#xD;
             days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is known or believed to suffer from hereditary spherocytosis or S.E. Asian&#xD;
             elliptocytosis.&#xD;
&#xD;

             hemoglobinopathies (sickle cell anemia and thalassemia major).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a known bone marrow disorder of inadequate red cell production (eg,&#xD;
             aplastic anemia, myelodysplasia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is at increased risk of complications from GR270773-related hemolysis due to&#xD;
             the inability to increase cardiac function sufficiently to meet the demands for oxygen&#xD;
             delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a hemoglobin level at screening &lt;9.0 g/dL (5.59 mmol/L). This hemoglobin&#xD;
             assessment should be based on the most recent available data in the subject's medical&#xD;
             record at the time of screening and is not used in the assessment of the hemoglobin&#xD;
             stopping rule described in Section 6.2.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is currently being treated with Xigris (Drotrecogin alfa (activated)) or its&#xD;
             use is considered imminent (ie, a decision to treat with Xigris has been made).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history of allergic reaction to eggs (or egg products), soybeans,&#xD;
             Intralipid, or any component of GR270773.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has been designated as 'not full support', 'do not resuscitate' (DNR), or&#xD;
             other equivalent status which prohibits the use of life supporting interventions&#xD;
             (e.g., mechanical ventilation, dialysis/hemofiltration, or others) thereby limiting&#xD;
             the treatment options available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Subjects with advanced directives prohibiting only chest compression (CPR) are&#xD;
        eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has preexisting severe liver disease such as cirrhosis, primary biliary&#xD;
             cirrhosis or known preexisting Child-Pugh class B or C liver dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is moribund (a state in which death is perceived to be imminent) or has a life&#xD;
             expectancy of less than 3 months due to an underlying disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is currently receiving one of the following prohibited concomitant&#xD;
             medications; parenteral nutrition supplements containing lipid emulsions (eg,&#xD;
             Intralipid), or systemic administration of amphotericin preparations (for example;&#xD;
             amphotericin, liposomal amphotericin, or amphotericin B lipid complex).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: the use of topical amphotericin and oral amphotericin products are permitted and may&#xD;
        be administered concomitantly with study drug at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is pregnant (positive urine pregnancy test at baseline) or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has previously been enrolled in this study.&#xD;
