    <textblock>
      Since steroids carry a moderate beneficial effect in Bell's palsy, and to address this&#xD;
      question, valacyclovir was added to prednisone for the treatment of this condition.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Between December 2002 and December 2003, a total of 52 subjects with BP were evaluated, 42&#xD;
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria and entered the study, 1 patient was lost to follow-up after&#xD;
      the first visit, leaving a total of 41 patients with complete clinical follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be included in the study, patients had to be evaluated within the first 72 hours and could&#xD;
      have no contraindications to steroid or valacyclovir therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned to either the prednisone-valacyclovir (group 1) or the&#xD;
      prednisone-placebo group (group 2) Among the 41 patients completing the study, 19 pertenecian&#xD;
      al group 1 and 21 group 2 Both groups received prednisone, a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight was&#xD;
      given daily for 7 days (one single dose after breakfast). The treatment was tapered over the&#xD;
      next 14 days. Those taking valacyclovir received 1000 mg in two daily doses for 7 days. All&#xD;
      subjects were instructed about eye protection and lubrication were followed at regular&#xD;
      intervals until recovery or for a minimum period of 3 months. Follow-up included examination&#xD;
      at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the first visit. Patients with incomplete recovery at 3&#xD;
      months were controlled until complete recovery or stabilization of the paralysis. All&#xD;
      subjects were evaluated for laboratories parameters. Routine blood count, blood sugar, and&#xD;
      liver function tests were performed at first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were no severe side effects attributable to the valacyclovir-prednisone treatment in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Facial nerve function was assessed using the&#xD;
      facial grading system (FGS) The scale used provides a quantitative score with three&#xD;
      components; resting symmetry, symmetry of voluntary movement and synkinesis and a composite&#xD;
      score was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Student's t-test was employed for quantitative….variables. Comparison of treatment results&#xD;
      between both groups was performed by….means of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test of two&#xD;
      ways (therapy and time).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical tests were considered received the same level of significance (P = 0.05).&#xD;
