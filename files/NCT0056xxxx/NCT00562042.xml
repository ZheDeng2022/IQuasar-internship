      Hypothesis: Increases in CRP, trop T, and BNP values will correlate significantly with right&#xD;
      heart failure on echocardiogram and with mortality, ICU stay, hospital stay, and escalations&#xD;
      in care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate whether CRP, trop T, and BNP correlate significantly with right heart failure&#xD;
           on echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate whether CRP, trop T, BNP, and echocardiogram correlate significantly with&#xD;
           clinical outcomes: mortality, ICU stay, hospital stay, and escalations in care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare each test's correlation with clinical outcomes to the others, to determine which&#xD;
           test provides the best risk ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compare each trop T value's correlation with echo findings and clinical outcomes to&#xD;
           determine the optimal time to draw trop T levels on a patient presenting with acute PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. These tests will not be used in an attempt to establish a diagnosis of PE.&#xD;

      Purpose: This study will help us to determine whether laboratory tests used to evaluate&#xD;
      cardiac function and blood flow (troponin T (trop T), C-reactive protein (CRP), and&#xD;
      brain-natriuretic peptide (BNP)) correlate with findings on echocardiogram and with&#xD;
      meaningful clinical outcomes when patients present with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). We&#xD;
      will be studying these tests for prognostic purposes only, in patients with an established&#xD;
      diagnosis of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design: Prospective cohort study Methodology: Patients diagnosed with acute PE (see&#xD;
      exclusion and inclusion criteria below) will be offered enrollment in the study. Once&#xD;
      enrolled, he/she will then have a trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed by a member&#xD;
      of the cardiology service who will not be aware of the patient's clinical status,&#xD;
      co-morbidities, or lab results (other than knowing that the patient has been diagnosed with&#xD;
      acute PE). The patient will then have trop T, CRP, and BNP levels drawn (or added to&#xD;
      laboratory tests that have already been drawn), which will be ordered by a member of the&#xD;
      research team. CRP and BNP will be drawn only once, while trop T levels will be drawn every 4&#xD;
      hours for the first 24 hours, and every 8 hours from 24 to 48 hours. The primary team&#xD;
      managing the patients will be privy to both the additional laboratory values ordered by the&#xD;
      research team and the results of the TTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be followed for the remainder of their hospital stay by a member of the&#xD;
      research team. The following outcomes will be recorded: deaths, length of ICU stay, length of&#xD;
      hospital stay, and escalations in care (pressor support, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR),&#xD;
      administration of thrombolytics, mechanical ventilation, ICU transfer).&#xD;
