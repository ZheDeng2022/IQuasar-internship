  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with asthma can be effectively treated using an Internet-based management system as&#xD;
      demonstrated by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physician utilization (emergency department visits and unscheduled physician visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Health-related quality of life scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Global health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Frequency of severe exacerbations and time to first exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Asthma control days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patient education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective patient education will be associated with decreased markers of inflammation and&#xD;
      improved indices of airways function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over a one-year period, we will evaluate specific outcomes related to the use of the&#xD;
      internet-based asthma treatment plans. Patients identified by their physician as candidates&#xD;
      for the study will be screened by the CAE. All subjects will be provided with an information&#xD;
      sheet and will be asked to sign an informed consent. All subjects asthma treatment will be&#xD;
      reviewed for adequacy of medical management (as defined by the Canadian Consensus Guidelines&#xD;
      for Asthma Care) and may have treatment adjusted by one of the study physician specialists to&#xD;
      ensure compliance with guideline-based best practice if necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following obtaining consent, all subjects will receive identical standardized education. This&#xD;
      will include: review of medications and inhaler device technique, review any environmental&#xD;
      triggers, and generate a written action plan. All subjects will receive a peak flow meter and&#xD;
      will be instructed in its use. All subjects will undergo baseline pulmonary function tests if&#xD;
      they have not had one conducted in the previous six months that will include flow-volume&#xD;
      loops pre and post bronchodilator. Subjects that do not demonstrate a 12% improvement in FEV1&#xD;
      post bronchodilator will also have a methacholine challenge test to assess airway&#xD;
      hyperreactivity. A urine sample will be obtained and frozen for subsequent NMR spectroscopy.&#xD;
      Standard demographic information will be obtained from all subjects including smoking status,&#xD;
      age, education status, and weight assessed as BMI. Subjects successfully completing screening&#xD;
      tests and fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to either to&#xD;
      the active therapy using the Internet site, or to a placebo therapy using a web-based&#xD;
      intervention. Randomization will occur using an internet based program created by the EPICORE&#xD;
      Centre at the University of Alberta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be given an individualized access code and the website address and will&#xD;
      receive a brief demonstration of the website. Following initial log-on to the website the&#xD;
      subject's in the intervention group will have their asthma profile reviewed daily by a&#xD;
      Certified Asthma Educator (CAE). Patients who do not log-on to the website within 1 week of&#xD;
      randomization will be contacted by telephone. The intervention group will have access to the&#xD;
      full version of the website with access to the CAE and they will be expected to enter daily&#xD;
      symptoms, evening and morning peak flows and medication use under their subject profile.&#xD;
      Patients who consent but do not log-on despite additional telephone contact will be deemed as&#xD;
      an immediate compliance failure. Otherwise patients' individual profiles will be evaluated&#xD;
      until the end of the 12-month period. Non-compliance to the asthma management program will be&#xD;
      defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Failure to enter any information for 7 consecutive days for patients experiencing poor&#xD;
           asthma control in the preceding 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Failure to enter any information for 14 consecutive days for patents experiencing good&#xD;
           asthma control in the preceding 2 weeks. This point will be deemed the time to&#xD;
           compliance failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The internet-based system will utilize a secure website to deliver the following to the&#xD;
      intervention group: 1) ongoing patient education, 2) regular feedback regarding significance&#xD;
      of symptoms, 3) regular feedback regarding significance of peak flows, and 4) a written&#xD;
      action plan. Patients will also have their individual files monitored regularly by a CAE.&#xD;
      Finally patients in the intervention group will have on-line access to an asthma educator&#xD;
      through a secure email system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo web-based intervention will include basic patient information on asthma and&#xD;
      asthma management; however will not include an interactive component. They would not have&#xD;
      personalized information tracked on the asthma management website, however they will be asked&#xD;
      to complete the outcome measurements at regularly scheduled intervals online. All subjects&#xD;
      will be sent regular email reminders to continue to log into the program and complete the&#xD;
      outcome measures. These reminders will be sent at regular intervals and include basic&#xD;
      information on asthma to encourage participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be requested to provide their Alberta Health Care Insurance Plan Number to&#xD;
      allow access to their individualized health care utilization data from Capital Health and the&#xD;
      Calgary Regional Health Authority. In particular, clinic visits; emergency room visits; and&#xD;
      hospitalization data will be requested from the health regions. Patients will also be asked&#xD;
      to provide a copy of their prescription records for the duration of the study. All data will&#xD;
      be entered into a SPSS database and will be analyzed using this and other statistical&#xD;
      programs. Data analysis will be conducted by EPICORE at the University of Alberta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be monitored via website for one year. All subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the 15D and AQLQ at baseline, six months post enrollment and 12 months post&#xD;
      enrollment. Additionally, they will be asked to complete the Weekly Survey every two months.&#xD;
      The intervention group only will be asked to complete the symptom survey at each login, as it&#xD;
      is used primarily for clinical reasons by the CAE. All subjects will have seven days to&#xD;
      complete and submit the outcome measures and reminders will be sent via email every second&#xD;
      day. If a subject fails to complete the measurements within the seven-day period, they will&#xD;
      receive a phone call reminder. Subjects will be asked to return 12 months post enrollment to&#xD;
      the clinic for repeated spirometry testing and a second urine sample collection. No&#xD;
      additional office visits are anticipated.&#xD;
