      CHEMOTHERAPY-NAIVE PATIENTS WITH LOCALLY ADVANCED OR METASTATIC PANCREATIC CANCER&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is responsible for 227.000 deaths per year, and is the eighth most common&#xD;
      cause of death from cancer in both sexes combined, a position relatively high when compared&#xD;
      to incidence (thirteenth position) because of the very poor prognosis (the M/I ratio is 98%)&#xD;
      (Global Cancer Statistics, 2002). The incidence of pancreatic carcinoma has increased almost&#xD;
      300% since 1950 and now exceeds the incidence of stomach cancer and cancer of the rectum.&#xD;
      Carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas is nearly always a fatal disease. The overall 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate for the disease is 4.1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer is relatively unresponsive to chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Gemcitabine therapy provides some benefit and modestly improves survival compared with&#xD;
      fluorouracil, but median survival in patients with advanced disease remains less than 6&#xD;
      months (Burris et al, 1997). Cytotoxic drug combinations were not able to show survival&#xD;
      advantage compared to Gemcitabine alone in numerous randomized phase III studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altered expression or constitutive activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor&#xD;
      (EGFR/HER1/erbB1) commonly occurs in both primary and metastatic pancreatic cancers and is&#xD;
      often a critical factor in progressive growth and resistance to normal mechanisms of cell&#xD;
      death. Epidermal growth factor receptor expression in pancreatic cancer has been correlated&#xD;
      with tumor aggressiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials already suggest that EGF-R targeted therapy may improve the antitumor&#xD;
      activity of chemotherapy for treatment of pancreatic carcinoma. Monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
      specific to EGF-R can be combined safely and effectively with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nimotuzumab (OSAG101, hR3, Theraloc) is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to&#xD;
      the EGFR. In preclinical studies the antibody has shown potent antitumor activity. Based on&#xD;
      phase I data, the recommended dose has been established at 200 mg weekly. A previous phase II&#xD;
      study in children with high grade brain tumors showed activity of Nimotuzumab as a&#xD;
      monotherapeutic agent, even in prognostic very unfavourable diffuse, intrinsic pontine&#xD;
      glioma. No drug related side effects were reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nimotuzumab (OSAG101, Theraloc) in combination with radiotherapy for treatment of locally&#xD;
      advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck resulted in high rates of antitumor&#xD;
      response, and was accompanied by a favourable safety profile. Nimotuzumab (OSAG101, Theraloc)&#xD;
      has a high hepatic uptake level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, placebo-controlled Phase IIb/IIIa study analyzes the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Nimotuzumab in combination with Gemcitabine for the treatment of chemotherapy-naive patients&#xD;
      with advanced unresectable or metastatic pancreatic carcinoma.&#xD;
