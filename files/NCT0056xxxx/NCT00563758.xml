  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic or functional constipation is a common disorder, affecting up to 20% of the&#xD;
      population depending on demographic factors, the sampling situation and the definitions used.&#xD;
      Constipation is a symptom of many diseases and is a collective term, used by the patient to&#xD;
      imply that stools are too hard, too infrequent or too difficult to pass. A recent survey&#xD;
      conducted in Hong Kong showed a prevalence of 14% according to the Rome criteria. Based on an&#xD;
      epidemiological study in US, there were 2.5 million annual physician visits for this problem.&#xD;
      Exact epidemiological data however are lacking, mainly because of the difference between&#xD;
      self-reported constipation and scientifically defined constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of constipation is usually based on increased dietary fiber and supplementation&#xD;
      with bulking agents, exercise, and habit training. However, often only partial relief is&#xD;
      obtained, and the majority of patients use non-bulking laxatives on a regular basis without&#xD;
      medical supervision. Chronic use of non-bulking laxatives is often inappropriate3, and may&#xD;
      lead to side effects such as dependency and progressive tolerance, electrolyte imbalance,&#xD;
      and, for the anthraquinones, melanosis coli. In addition, stimulant laxatives may damage the&#xD;
      myenteric plexus4, resulting in cathartic colon5. A more appropriate approach to the therapy&#xD;
      of constipation consists of physiologically stimulating intestinal motility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tegaserod, an aminoguanidine indole compound, is a representative of a new class of 5-HT4&#xD;
      agonists, with regard to both chemistry and pharmacology. Activation of 5-HT4 receptors&#xD;
      triggers the release of neurotransmitters from the enteric nerves resulting in increased&#xD;
      contractility and stimulation of the peristaltic reflex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal models, tegaserod acts as a motility-enhancing agent, exerting activity throughout&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract11. Tegaserod has also been shown to significantly accelerate bowel&#xD;
      transit in healthy volunteers and in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome (C-IBS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the pharmacodynamic properties, tegaserod is a promotile compound suitable for the&#xD;
      treatment associated with small and/or large bowel dysfunction e.g. constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From phase III adequate and well-controlled studies in patients with C-IBS it has been shown&#xD;
      that tegaserod was effective in relieving symptoms of C-IBS. The effect was seen as early as&#xD;
      the first week of treatment with sustained effects over 12 weeks. Both tegaserod 4 mg/d (2 mg&#xD;
      bid) and 12 mg/d (6 mg bid) significantly increased bowel frequency and decreased stool&#xD;
      consistency. It is proposed to test both doses for the phase III program in chronic&#xD;
      constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate the effect of tegaserod on bowel habits in patients&#xD;
      suffering from chronic idiopathic constipation.&#xD;

          -  Male and females of at least 18 years of age (no upper limit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of constipation for at least 12 months before screening. Constipation is&#xD;
             defined as follows: less than three spontaneous bowel movements per week that result&#xD;
             in a feeling of complete evacuation, and one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 25% of the stools are very hard and/or hard stools (Type 1 and/or 2 on&#xD;
                  the Bristol Stool Form scale)14,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sensation of incomplete evacuation following at least 25% of the bowel movements&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Straining on at least 25% of the defecations The above criteria are only&#xD;
                  applicable for spontaneous bowel movements, i.e. not preceded within a period of&#xD;
                  24 hours by the intake of a laxative agent or by the use of an enema. Patients&#xD;
                  who never have spontaneous bowel movements (that is, all bowel movements are&#xD;
