      Laser photocoagulation has become the treatment of choice in PDR. Laser photocoagulation has&#xD;
      become the treatment of choice in PDR. The aim is to destroy a substantial portion of the&#xD;
      peripheral retina in order to reduce the angiogenic stimulus (decrease the difference between&#xD;
      oxygen demand and the administration). Their effectiveness is determined by the extent of&#xD;
      destruction of the retina (2.4).&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of retinal photocoagulation was introduced by Meyer-Schwickerath for treatment of&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy in the 50s (1, 6). The first successfully used laser was the arc xenon&#xD;
      laser (polychromatic, inefficient, and hard to handle). Then the ruby and argon laser&#xD;
      appeared (with mayor improvements in design and management). The modern era of&#xD;
      photocoagulation as we know it began in the late 70s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these available technologies, the focal photocoagulation, the panretinal&#xD;
      photocoagulation and the grid photocoagulation were developed. Witch proved effective for the&#xD;
      treatment of severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, proliferative diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy in different multicenter studies (ETDRS, DRS) (1.6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients usually receive from 1200 to 1500 laser shots in 2 to 4 sessions lasting from 10 to&#xD;
      20 minutes, during 2 to 4 weeks. The procedure can be time consuming, tedious and painful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now little has changed in the overall design of lasers of 30 years ago. The differences&#xD;
      are the introduction of fibre optics and air-based cooling systems. These innovations do not&#xD;
      have any impact on the way in which the treatment or the success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early efforts to improve photocoagulation included complex recognition systems and eye&#xD;
      tracking to try to manage a fully automated process. That required a preview image of the&#xD;
      retina. Attempts were also made to determine the appropriate dose of energy for getting the&#xD;
      job done. The complexity of these systems prevented their clinical use (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PASCAL is a system of semiautomatic pattern laser, which allows much faster processing,&#xD;
      accuracy and control of treatment by a doctor at all times. The difference with the regular&#xD;
      laser systems is that PASCAL manages a dual frequency Nd: YAG that works at a wavelength of&#xD;
      532nm, which is capable of firing a single shot from up to 56 shots in pre patterns (1x1, 2&#xD;
      x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5). By using time exposures of between 10 and 20 ms, you can make multiple&#xD;
      shots at the same time that a shot with conventional laser is done (100 ms). These short&#xD;
      pulses allow energy laser focus better in the tissues, produces less pain, Reduce the heat&#xD;
      delivered to the choroid, and less diffusion of heat with the subsequent less damage to&#xD;
      surrounding tissues (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first study was published in the Retina 2006, by Blumenkanz, Palanker, Marcelino, et al.&#xD;
      In which describe their use in rabbit's retinas. In which compared the effect of a number of&#xD;
      pulses of different durations and powers. They applied exposition of 10, 20, 50 and 100 ms.&#xD;
      The study found that at lower exposure time is required energy of 2 to 3 times more to&#xD;
      produce the same effect, but the pulse had less energy. As they increased the exposure time,&#xD;
      les power was needed, but the pulsed had also more energy. As the energy increased the shots&#xD;
      was less homogeneous, less localized and changes in the final size (110-170micm) (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERG: It reflects the activity of the retina in &quot;mass&quot;. In studies of the effect of&#xD;
      photocoagulation on the activity of the retina, it have typically been used the amplitude of&#xD;
      them a and b wave as criteria of tissue destruction. But there is no consistency among the&#xD;
      various studies that have already reported variations of 10 to 95% in the amplitude&#xD;
      (especially in wave b) due to the variability in the length of effective ablation of the&#xD;
      retina. Others suggest that a wave to be smaller than the b, showing an injury in the primary&#xD;
      layer of photoreceptors. Others say that the decline was equal in both waves. But something&#xD;
      we all conclude is that the response in the ERG is reduced more than expected based in the&#xD;
      coagulated area. But when it is higher, the fall in the ERG is more than what was expected&#xD;
      (60% of destruction = 80% decrease of ERG). An average photocoagulation destroys about 40% of&#xD;
      the retina approximately (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The destruction of the peripheral retina decreases the ERG response, besides laser affect&#xD;
      regions of adjacent tissue, causing deterioration in the transmission of signals from the&#xD;
      photoreceptors in the proximal retina. What explains the previous reports of large decrease&#xD;
      in amplitude on the basis of the area coagulated (2). The laser energy is absorbed by the RPE&#xD;
      cells, and the adjacent layer of photoreceptors. What also produces external injury to the&#xD;
      retina so you can also observe an increase in the implicit time (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few years ago changing arc xenon to argon marked a difference in the amount of burned&#xD;
      retina and decrease in the implicit time and amplitudes of the waves (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macular Edema: Is recognized as a potential adverse effect of panretinal photocoagulation.&#xD;
      Witch may transitory or permanent decrease the visual acuity of the patient. Approximately&#xD;
      60% of photocoagulated patients show an increase in the foveal thickness. Despite the fact&#xD;
      that it has been said that a change of the self-distribution of blood flow is responsible for&#xD;
      this increase in the thickness, today it is believed that these changes are due to post-laser&#xD;
      inflammation. Despite that it is performed outside of the vascular arches; it is generally&#xD;
      formed by those within.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inflammation factors, in addition to the direct effect that is exercised on intracellular&#xD;
      unions have shown themselves capable of producing a change in the barrier mediated&#xD;
      leukocytes. These factors are produced in the peripheral region to the photocoagulated area.&#xD;
      The laser stimulates the production of adhesion molecules in the area around the shot and in&#xD;
      the non photocoagulated area, which produces bearings and recruitment of leukocytes,&#xD;
      secondary accumulation in the posterior pole and subsequent alteration of the hemato-retinal&#xD;
      barrier (7).&#xD;
