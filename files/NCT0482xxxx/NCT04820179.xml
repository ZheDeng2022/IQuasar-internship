  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in the United States with&#xD;
      limited treatment options, especially for those patients with metastatic disease. Combination&#xD;
      treatment with cabozantinib and atezolizumab, has demonstrated safety for the treatment of&#xD;
      other cancers and has shown promise in preclinical studies utilizing patient derived pancreas&#xD;
      organoids. In this study, patients with refractory, metastatic pancreatic cancer will receive&#xD;
      combination cabozantinib + atezolizumab and the efficacy of this treatment will be assessed&#xD;
      through overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), median overall survival&#xD;
      (mOS), and median progression free survival (mPFS). Safety and tolerability of combination&#xD;
      cabozantinib plus atezolizumab in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients will also be assessed&#xD;
      and immune profiling pre- and post-treatment will be explored.&#xD;

             metastasis) within 2 weeks before first dose of study treatment. Subjects must have&#xD;
             complete wound healing from major surgery or minor surgery before first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment. Subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior surgery&#xD;
             are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt; 500 ms per&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG) within 14 days before first dose of study treatment [add&#xD;
             reference for Fridericia formula].&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: If a single ECG shows a QTcF with an absolute value &gt; 500 ms, two additional&#xD;
             ECGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30 min after the&#xD;
             initial ECG, and the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF will be used&#xD;
             to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             interferon and interleukin 2 [IL-2]) within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug&#xD;
             (whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication (including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and&#xD;
             anti-TNF-alpha agents) within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or&#xD;
             anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during study treatment,&#xD;
             with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients who received acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant medication or a&#xD;
                  one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., 48 hours of&#xD;
                  corticosteroids for a contrast allergy) are eligible for the study after&#xD;
                  Principal Investigator confirmation has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids&#xD;
                  for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or low-dose&#xD;
                  corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are eligible&#xD;
                  for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies&#xD;
             or fusion proteins&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or to any component of&#xD;
             the atezolizumab formulation&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Pregnancy or breastfeeding, or intention of becoming pregnant during study treatment&#xD;
             of within 6 months after the final dose of study treatment. Women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             initiation of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         29. Inability to swallow tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
         30. Previously identified allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the study treatment&#xD;
             formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
         31. Any other active malignancy at time of first dose of study treatment or diagnosis of&#xD;
             another malignancy within 3 years prior to first dose of study treatment that requires&#xD;
             active treatment, except for locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured,&#xD;
             such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma&#xD;
             in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast.&#xD;
