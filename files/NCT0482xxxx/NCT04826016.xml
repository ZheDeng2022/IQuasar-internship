&#xD;
          8. Prior Therapies:&#xD;
&#xD;
             For POL6326 (balixafortide)-eribulin combination&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  phase Ib: At least 1 but no more than 3 prior chemotherapy-based lines of&#xD;

                  treatment for advanced or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline and a taxane, unless&#xD;
             contraindicated based on investigator's criteria. Chemotherapy line given as&#xD;
             (neo)adjuvant treatment will be considered a prior line of therapy if disease&#xD;
             progression occurred within 12-months after completion of prior (neo)adjuvant therapy.&#xD;

             documented by computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  phase 2: patients with HR+ status (ER+ and/or PgR+) must have been treated with&#xD;
                  at least one line of endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors (unless&#xD;
                  contraindicated or not accessible).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. At least 21 days from the completion of any previous cytotoxic chemotherapy or&#xD;
             biological therapy at time of initiation of POL6326 (balixafortide).&#xD;

             excisional biopsy not previously irradiated at the time of the inclusion and at the&#xD;
             time of progression (optional) in order to perform exploratory studies. This enrolment&#xD;
             criterium is optional for the dose-escalation part of the study, but mandatory for the&#xD;
             final dose expansion (MTD/RP2D) cohorts. If this is not feasible (e.g., inaccessible&#xD;
             tumor or subject safety concern), archival metastatic tumor samples might be&#xD;
             acceptable after agreement with the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Willingness and ability to provide blood samples for exploratory studies as per study&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;

             determined by the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
             Events (NCI-CTCAE) v. 5.0 criteria (except for alopecia or other toxicities not&#xD;
             considered a safety risk for the patient at Investigator's discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Adequate hematologic and organ function within 28 days before the first study&#xD;
             treatment on Cycle 1 Day 1, defined by the following:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Hepatic: Serum albumin â‰¥ 3 g/dL; Total bilirubin â‰¤ 1.5 times the upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal (Ã— ULN) (â‰¤ 3 x ULN in the case of Gilbert's disease); aspartate&#xD;
                  transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) â‰¤ 3.0 Ã— ULN (in the case of&#xD;
                  liver metastases â‰¤ 5 Ã— ULN); alkaline phosphatase (ALP) â‰¤ 3.0 Ã— ULN (â‰¤ 5 Ã— ULN in&#xD;
                  the case of liver and/or bone metastases).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
        heterosexual intercourse) or use highly effective contraceptive methods, or two effective&#xD;
        contraceptive methods, as defined in the CSP during the treatment period and for at least&#xD;
        90 days after the last dose of study treatment, whichever is longer, and agreement to&#xD;
        refrain from donating eggs during this same period. Women of childbearing potential must&#xD;
        have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days before study treatment initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet ANY of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Eribulin-based combination: patients have previously received eribulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Peripheral neuropathy &gt; Grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior radiotherapy to only site of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients under concurrent local radiotherapy for pain control or life-threatening&#xD;
             situations (e.g., spinal cord compression).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known active uncontrolled or symptomatic CNS metastases as indicated by clinical&#xD;
             symptoms, cerebral edema, and/or progressive growth. Patients with a history of CNS&#xD;
             metastases are eligible if they have been definitively treated (e.g., radiotherapy,&#xD;
             stereotactic surgery), and are clinically stable at least 4 weeks after completion of&#xD;
             radiation therapy and/or surgery. Stable is defined as absence of new neurological&#xD;
             symptoms, absence of need for dexamethasone or anticonvulsants, and radiographic&#xD;
             confirmation of stable disease (SD). Radiographic confirmation of SD 4 weeks after&#xD;
             completion of radiation therapy is not required unless indicated by neurological exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Presence of carcinomatous meningitis or leptomeningeal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Therapeutic radiation therapy within 14 days (seven days for limited-field palliative&#xD;
             radiotherapy) prior to study enrollment, or patients who have not recovered from&#xD;
             radiotherapy-related toxicities to grade â‰¤ 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of allergic reactions or known hypersensitivity attributed to compounds of&#xD;
             similar chemical or biologic composition to POL6326 (balixafortide), eribulin or&#xD;
             nab-paclitaxel, or to recombinant proteins, or any excipient contained in the drug&#xD;
             formulation for POL6326 (balixafortide), eribulin or nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Breastfeeding or pregnancy as determined by a serum pregnancy test (Î²-HCG) at&#xD;
             screening, prior to the administration of POL6326 (balixafortide) and/or eribulin&#xD;
             and/or nab-paclitaxel. Since Î²-HCG over expression can be also elevated in some tumor&#xD;
             types, a positive result should be confirmed with a validated alternative test (e.g.,&#xD;
             ultrasound).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Postmenopausal women must have been amenorrhoeic for â‰¥ 12 months in order to be&#xD;
             considered &quot;of non-childbearing potential&quot;. This should be documented appropriately in&#xD;
             the patient's medical history. More frequent assessments may be performed if medically&#xD;
             indicated as determined by the study site Investigator, and these evaluations should&#xD;
             be recorded in the CRF (Case Report Form).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Known HIV positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) with corrected QT interval using the Fridericia&#xD;
             formula (QTcF) â‰¥ 480 ms on baseline EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients under treatment with drugs known to potentially prolong the QT interval,&#xD;
             including class Ia and III anti-arrhythmic drugs will be either monitored for&#xD;
             corrected QT (QTc) prolongation or excluded from participation in the trial, at the&#xD;
             discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Aany other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the&#xD;
             Investigator's judgment contraindicate patient participation in the clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Severe concurrent psychiatric illness/social situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Concurrent malignancy or malignancy within five years of study enrollment with the&#xD;
             exception of carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin carcinoma, or stage I&#xD;
             uterine cancer. For other cancers considered to have a low risk of recurrence,&#xD;
             discussion with the Sponsor's Medical Monitor is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Treatment with approved or investigational cancer therapy within 21 days prior to&#xD;
             initiation of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Concurrent participation in other clinical trial, except other translational studies.&#xD;
