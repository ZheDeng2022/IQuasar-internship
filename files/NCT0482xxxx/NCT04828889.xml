  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of anal fissure is mainly surgical. There are complications to this treatment,&#xD;
      including damage to the inner anal sphincter and the appearance of fecal incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anal dilators are devices that allow gradual enlargement of the anus. To date, the use of&#xD;
      these dilators has been in cases of sphincter scarring after a surgical procedure that has&#xD;
      caused emptying difficulties. Only recently has the use of anal dilators been tried as a&#xD;
      treatment for acute anal fissure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designated to examine whether healing of the fissure can be achieved by&#xD;
      conservative treatment with anal extensions and obviating the need for surgical treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open prospective study. The study will include 75 patients (men and women) aged 18-85 years&#xD;
      who are diagnosed with acute anal fissure and candidates for surgery after conservative&#xD;
      treatment failure or recurrence of the problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the waiting period for surgery, which lasted about a month, patients will be divided&#xD;
      into three equal-sized groups at random (research, waiting and surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the start of treatment and at the end of the waiting and surgery period, all patients&#xD;
      will undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anal examination by a proctologist to assess the presence and location of the the&#xD;
           fissure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fill out a clinical questionnaire that examines the sensation of pain, burning, itching&#xD;
           and bleeding during defecation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fill in the Psychometric properties of a questionnaire (HEMO-FISSQoL) to assess the&#xD;
           effect of the fissure on daily functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Fill out a pain assessment questionnaire (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Fill out a quality of life questionnaire. Only patients with evidence of acute anal&#xD;
           fissure in the physical examination will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects in the study group will undergo a series of 4 treatments by 2 certified&#xD;
      physiotherapists for pelvic floor treatment that will include instruction in self-use of anal&#xD;
      dilators once a week for four weeks. The anal dilation will be performed using 'Dilatan'®&#xD;
      anal dilators in varying sizes of 22, 23 and 27 mm. In the first week, a 20 mm dilator will&#xD;
      be inserted twice a day for at least 10 minutes. In the second week, a 23 mm dilator will be&#xD;
      inserted into the anus, twice a day for at least 10 minutes. In the last two weeks, a 27 mm&#xD;
      dilator will be inserted twice a day for at least 10 minutes. To facilitate the insertion of&#xD;
      the dilator, patients will use lubricating cream. At the end of each week, patients will meet&#xD;
      with a pelvic floor physiotherapist to make sure that the insertion is done properly, that&#xD;
      there are no side effects and that it is possible to move on to the next step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects in the waiting group will be able after a month to choose to undergo surgery or&#xD;
      also receive treatment by dilators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects in the surgery group will undergo surgical treatment only. At the end of the&#xD;
      waiting month, a comparison will be made between the indicators of the two groups: research&#xD;
      and waiting, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment in the research group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the surgery group, these indices will be examined one month after the surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The indices to be examined are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Disappearance of the fissure by proctologist's examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Disappearance of pain, burning, itching and bleeding during defecation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improving the level of pain by using a VAS subjective assessment scale from 1-10&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Improving the effect of the fissure on daily functioning by using the HEMO-FISSQoL&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Improving the quality of life of the subjects by using the 36-Item Short Form Survey&#xD;
           (SF-36)- Quality of Life Questionnaire Further assessments of the improvement in the&#xD;
           quality of life of the subjects in the study group will be made three months and 6&#xD;
           months after the end of the experiment.&#xD;

The anal dilation will be performed using Dilatan® anal dilators (Enterprises Sapimed, Alessandria) in varying sizes of 22, 23 and 27 mm. In the first week, a 20 mm dilator will be inserted twice a day for at least 10 minutes. In the second week, a 23 mm extender will be inserted into the anus, twice a day for at least 10 minutes. In the last two weeks, a 27 mm extender will be inserted twice a day for at least 10 minutes. To facilitate the insertion of the extender, patients will use lubricating cream. At the end of each week, patients will meet with a pelvic floor physiotherapist to make sure that the insertion is done properly, that there are no side effects and that it is possible to move on to the next step.</description>
