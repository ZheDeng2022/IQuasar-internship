  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An immersive virtual reality (VR) tour of the operating theater before surgery could reduce&#xD;
      preoperative anxiety. The aims of this study were to analyze whether a preoperative virtual&#xD;
      reality tour shows a reduction in anxiety in children and an increase in parental&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children who will undergo surgery for the first time and their families were randomly&#xD;
      allocated into the control or VR group. The control group received conventional education&#xD;
      regarding the perioperative process of surgery. The VR group watched a 1.5-minute VR video&#xD;
      showing the operating theater and explaining the perioperative process. The main finding was&#xD;
      preoperative anxiety evaluated using the Children's State Anxiety (CSA) before surgery.&#xD;
      Secondary findings included children's postoperative pain ratings using Wong-Baker Faces Pain&#xD;
      Rating Scale and parental satisfaction scores using PedsQL Health Care Satisfaction Scale&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Preoperative anxiety assessed by the Children's State Anxiety (CAM-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>This is measured right before the child goes into operating theatre / separating from his/her parents.</time_frame>
    <description>The CAM-S scale is drawn to resemble a thermometer with a bulb at the bottom and horizontal lines at intervals going up to the top. Children are instructed to &quot;Pretend that all of your worried or nervous feelings are in the bulb or bottom part of the thermometer. If you are a little bit worried or nervous, the feelings might come up in the thermometer just a little bit. If you are very, very worried or nervous, the feelings might go all the way to the top. Put a line on the thermometer showing how much worry or nervousness you feel. Min score : 0 &amp; Max score : 10</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative Pain assessed by the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>This is measured immediately after the surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is used around the world with people ages 3 and older. Min score : 0 &amp; Max score : 5</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parental Satisfaction assessed by PedsQL Health Care Satisfaction Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>This is measured immediately after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Parents answered the following scale questions by indicating how satisfied they are with the services provided to them and their children. Min score : 0 &amp; Max score : 100</description>
