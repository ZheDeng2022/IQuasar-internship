      It will be a two-part study. Part I will be six arms; randomized, double blind, parallel&#xD;
      design, placebo-controlled dose ranging study. Part II will be open-label single dose study&#xD;
      at the highest dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 90 Subjects (Part 1 &amp; Part 2) will be enrolled in the study. The Part 1 group&#xD;
      subjects (80 Subjects) shall be randomly distributed between the six arms, i.e. 20 Subjects&#xD;
      each in IP arms, and 7, 7 and 6 subjects in corresponding placebo arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Part 2 Group subjects (10 Subjects) will be assigned into the cluster where all receive&#xD;

      It will be a two-part study. Part I will be six arms; randomized, double blind, parallel&#xD;
      design, placebo-controlled dose ranging study. Part II will be open-label single dose study&#xD;
      at the highest dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total number of Subjects is N = 90 (Part 1 &amp; Part 2) Part I: six arms Arm A = 300 mg NMN&#xD;
      supplement (n = 20) Arm B = Placebo of 300 mg NMN supplement (n = 07) Arm C = 600 mg NMN&#xD;
      supplement (n = 20) Arm D = Placebo of 600 mg NMN supplement (n = 07) Arm E = 900 mg NMN&#xD;
      supplement (n = 20) Arm F = Placebo of 900 mg NMN supplement (n = 06) Part II 900 mg NMN&#xD;
      supplement (n = 10) Duration of Protocol Therapy = 60 Days Study Population= Middle aged or&#xD;
      older male or female subjects (40-65 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of each subject's participation in the study will be of 60 days. Scheduled study&#xD;
      visits will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1 (Screening, Day -4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2 (Baseline/Randomization visit, Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3 (Day 30).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 4 (End of study, Day 60) A window (± 2 days) will be considered acceptable for&#xD;
           each scheduled visit following the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Visit 1 (Screening), informed consent will be obtained before any study procedures&#xD;
      take place. After subject has consented, medical history will then be documented, including&#xD;
      the concomitant medications (if any). Physical examination and ECG will be carried out for&#xD;
      all subjects. Subjects' vital signs will be recorded along with pulse pressure (PP). Their&#xD;
      laboratory investigations like Hematology, Clinical chemistry and Urinalysis will be done.&#xD;
      They will be symptomatically assessed for COVID-19. They shall undergo the screening&#xD;
      procedure by inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subject's demography data will be collected.&#xD;
      They will be given instructions for the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2 (Day 1, Baseline visit), eligibility confirmation will be done, and each enrolled&#xD;
      subject will be randomly assigned in double-blind fashion, in 1:1 ratio to the test product&#xD;
      or the Placebo or to the maximum dose group (Part 2 subjects). Blinded investigational&#xD;
      product will be dispensed to subjects for Part 1 who meet all the inclusion and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. Part 2 group subjects will be dispensed with maximum dose of NMN (900mg)&#xD;
      without any blinding. Subjects will be instructed to take two to six capsules (depending on&#xD;
      thegroups that the subjects fall under) of the either placebo or NMN once a day with ambient&#xD;
      temperature water before breakfast. They shall be recording the dosing details in subject&#xD;
      diaries. The Investigational Product will be taken by the subject at home right from the&#xD;
      first dose. Subjects will be evaluated through SF-36 questionnaire for their health. They&#xD;
      will be required to answer the list of questions pertaining to their health. (PI, CRC or site&#xD;
      staff will fill SF-36 questionnaire in visit 2, 3 and 4 by asking the subject). All the&#xD;
      baseline assessments for efficacy will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 3 (Day 30) and visit 4 (Day 60), subjects will return to the clinic to review and&#xD;
      collect subjects' diaries, safety data and medication reconciliation. Efficacy and safety&#xD;
      assessments will be done at both the visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to bring their subject diaries and used/unused Investigational Product&#xD;
      every time they visit the site(empty bottles in case of used IP). Enough quantity of&#xD;
      Investigational Product will be dispensed every visit. Subjects' vital signs will be recorded&#xD;
      along with pulse pressure (PP) at all visits. Adverse event assessment and concomitant&#xD;
      assessment will be done at each visit along with compliance with study supplement&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
