    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, interventional, non-pharmacological study on a app for oral anticancer&#xD;
      therapy management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 124 patients will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to one of the following interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. electronic diary B. paper diary The primary aim of the study is to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the electronic diary in improving adherence to oral therapy treatment&#xD;
      compared to the paper diary, in patients with solid and haematological tumors.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, interventional, non-pharmacological study on a app for oral anticancer&#xD;
      therapy management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the electronic diary in&#xD;
      improving adherence to oral therapy treatment compared to the paper diary, in patients with&#xD;
      solid and haematological tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. describe the reasons for non-adherence in each group (eg. forgetfulness, side effects,&#xD;
           misunderstanding of prescription),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. describe the patient's compliance with the instrument and modalities (electronic diary,&#xD;
           paper diary) through a short questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. description of the costs related to therapeutic non-adherence. A total of 124 patients&#xD;
           will be considered: enrollment will take place consecutively until the predetermined&#xD;
           number is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using a balanced procedure a blocks&#xD;
      exchanged to one of the following interventions, stratified by type of therapy (chemotherapy&#xD;
      vs. biological therapy): A. electronic diary B. paper diary The electronic diary consist of&#xD;
      an Android app (for Android version 2.2 and later) for mobile devices, which acts as a diary&#xD;
      for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence will be assessed at each treatment cycle by counting the remaining tablets. For&#xD;
      patients with disease progression within six treatment cycles, the assessment of adherence&#xD;
      and therefore the count of the remaining tablets will end on the date of progression.&#xD;

Adherence will be assessed at each treatment cycle by counting the remaining tablets, and tested using Fisher's exact test. The number of pills counted by the system will be compared with that counted by the physician as residual pills returned by the patient at the hospital visit.</description>

    <description>At the baseline visit, each patient assigned to arm A will be provided with the electronic diary (installed on a smart phone or tablet), the oral medication for the first treatment cycle and the appointment for the next cycle. The patient will be instructed on how to use the electronic diary, and the user manual will also be given. This app allows patients to record parameters related to their health state (e.g. medications, blood pressure, weight, fever, side effects or other symptoms) and through the &quot;alarm&quot; function, it reminds the patient to take the tablets, indicating the exact dosage. In addition, the patient can also indicate the dose reduction or the omission.</description>
