  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and mildly reduced ejection fraction suffer from&#xD;
      reduced functional capacity and fatigue caused by loss of muscle strength and reduced aerobic&#xD;
      capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few studies have shown that structured endurance and resistance training programs were able&#xD;
      to improve walking capacity and limb strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although both concentric and eccentric training programs are beneficial for these patients,&#xD;
      eccentric training is less stressful to the cardiovascular system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine if eccentric-orientated body weight and manual&#xD;
      resistance training in ischemic cardiomyopathy patients will lead to superior results&#xD;
      compared to concentric training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      BACKGROUND: Eccentric resistance training demonstrated positive effects in ischemic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy patients in several studies. These studies were mainly set on device-based&#xD;
      training interventions comparing eccentric-orientated and concentric-orientated training.&#xD;
      Eccentric-orientated training induced comparable positive effects on cardiac and functional&#xD;
      levels and even better effects on muscle strength improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH AIMS: The aim of the study is to determine if eccentric-orientated body weight and&#xD;
      manual resistance training in ischemic cardiomyopathy patients will allow a more significant&#xD;
      improvement in maximum voluntary contraction force of the knee extensors compared to&#xD;
      concentric training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to previous studies, these interventions will be set without use of training&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, changes in the muscle cross section of the quadriceps muscle will be calculated&#xD;
      by skeletal muscle ultrasound. Functional changes and quality of life will be assessed using&#xD;
      one minute sit to stand test, six minutes walking test and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      Questionnaire. Cardiac outcome parameters will be assessed by using body composition and&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters as well as echocardiography, laboratory values and specific biomarkers&#xD;
      for sarcopenia / cachexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: The investigators propose to run a monocentric, prospective, double arm, open,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. Eccentric-orientated training will be delivered to 30 ischemic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients will be randomized into two groups at the beginning, followed by a 6-weeks&#xD;
      observation phase (without intervention for internal quality control of the measurement&#xD;
      parameters). The intervention-phase will consist of six weeks of three times weekly either&#xD;
      eccentric or concentric-oriented training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements will take place after randomization, after 6 weeks of observation as&#xD;
      well as after the intervention phase&#xD;
