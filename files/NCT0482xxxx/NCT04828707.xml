    <textblock>
      Migraine is a common neurologic with attacks of headache and associated symptoms such as&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, phono and photophobia. Migraine can lead to substantial functional&#xD;
      impairment. This study intends to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Nwrivio for&#xD;
      migraine prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, multicenter study,&#xD;
      conducted in three phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening/enrollment visit, followed by a 4-week (28 days)&#xD;
      baseline phase, an 8-week double-blind preventive treatment phase, and a 4-week open-label&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will complete an electronic diary throughout the study; this includes a daily&#xD;
      evening report (completed regardless of whether the patient had a headache) and treatment&#xD;
      feedback during the follow-up pre-emptive phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the mean change in the average of migraine headache days per month&#xD;
      comparing the 4-week baseline phase (weeks 1 through 4) with the last 28 days of the&#xD;
      treatment phase (weeks 9 through 12).&#xD;

      Nerivio is a neuromodulation device approved for the acute treatment of migraine with or&#xD;
      without aura in patients 12 years of age or older. The device utilizes electro stimulation to&#xD;
      achieve conditioned pain modulation (CPM). CPM stimulate endogenous analgesic mechanism.&#xD;
      Treatments are self-administered by the user at the onset of a migraine attack. this study&#xD;
      intends to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Nwrivio for migraine prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, multicenter trial,&#xD;
      conducted in three phases. The ratio between treatment and control groups will be 1:1,&#xD;
      stratified by center and patient type (chronic/non-chronic). The study will consist of a&#xD;
      screening/enrollment visit, followed by a 4-week (28 days) baseline phase. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will enter an 8-week double-blind preventive treatment phase. Following the&#xD;
      preventive treatment phase, patients will be offered to participate in a 4-week open-label&#xD;
      pre-emptive treatment phase or continue their prevention treatment with an active device,&#xD;
      according to their eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will complete an electronic diary throughout the study; this includes a daily&#xD;
      evening report (completed regardless of whether the patient had a headache) and treatment&#xD;
      feedback during the follow up pre-emptive phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I - Baseline - 4 weeks (weeks 1 through 4):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will install the Nerivio app on their smartphones and will be&#xD;
      instructed to record daily their migraine/headaches symptoms and medication use on the&#xD;
      Nerivio app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transition to the treatment phase: Participants who meet the following criteria in the&#xD;
      baseline phase will be eligible to continue to the treatment phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete the diary in at least 22 out of the 28 days during the baseline phase (80%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have between 6 to 24 headache days during the 28-day baseline period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 4 of their headache days during the baseline phase fulfill the ICHD-3 criteria&#xD;
           for migraine (migraine without aura [code 1.1; C and D] or with aura [code 1.2; B and&#xD;
           C], or probable migraine, or headaches requiring the use of migraine-specific&#xD;
           medications including triptans, gepants or ergot derivatives).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II - treatment phase (prevention) - 8 weeks (weeks 5 through 12):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet the baseline phase requirements will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      active and sham groups. Participants will be instructed to complete a daily diary (in the&#xD;
      Nerivio app) about their headaches, associated symptoms, and medication use. They will also&#xD;
      be instructed to conduct a 45-minute treatment with Nerivio every other day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transition to the follow-up phase (open label):&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the treatment phase, participants from both arms (active and sham) may continue&#xD;
      to a follow-up phase in which they will receive an active device that can be used during this&#xD;
      phase. The data of all participants will be used for safety analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of participants from the baseline and treatment phases will be used to assess their&#xD;
      eligibility to participate in the pre-emptive follow-up phase. Participants eligible for the&#xD;
      follow-up phase meet the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between 6-16 headache days during the baseline phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants experience prodrome symptoms within 24 hours prior to the onset of their&#xD;
           migraine headache in at least half of their migraine attacks during the baseline phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants completed the daily questionnaires in at least 70% of the days during the&#xD;
           treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treated every other day in at least 24 and less than 33 days during the 56 days of the&#xD;
           treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III - Follow-up phase (open label) - 4 weeks (weeks 13 through 16):&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive an active Nerivio device to use during the follow-up phase.&#xD;
      Participants who do not meet the above requirements will be able to enter into the safety&#xD;
      follow-up and continue to use Nerivio every other day for the preventive treatment of&#xD;
      migraine. They will be instructed to compete a daily diary as was done in the treatment&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet the above requirements will enter the pre-emptive follow-up phase and&#xD;
      be instructed to conduct a 45-minute device treatment within 60 minutes of prodrome symptom&#xD;
      onset. Participants will be instructed to complete questionnaires regarding their headache,&#xD;
      prodrome symptoms, and medication use at baseline (start of treatment), 2 hours&#xD;
      post-treatment, and 24 hours post-treatment. In addition, participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      continue to report the daily diary, as performed in the other phases of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events will be reported.&#xD;
