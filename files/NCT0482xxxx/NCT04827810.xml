  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, phase I, open-label, non-randomized dose-escalation and&#xD;
      dose-expansion study with the primary objective to determine the safety profile of small&#xD;
      molecule, mitochondrial-targeted Hsp90 inhibitor, gamitrinib, including identification of&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancers. A secondary objective of the study is to determine the recommended dose and&#xD;
      regimen(s) for a phase II study. This study is based on preclinical data demonstrating the&#xD;
      anticancer activity, unique mechanism of action and preliminary safety of gamitrinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose-finding portion of this study, gamitrinib formulated in Lipoid S100Â®-based&#xD;
      formulation will be administered as a 1-hour IV infusion once weekly for four weeks as 28-day&#xD;
      treatment cycles. Up to 36 patients will be enrolled in the dose-escalation component of the&#xD;
      study based on anticipated cohorts. The starting dose will be 10 mg, corresponding to&#xD;
      allometric scaling) from the most sensitive species (rats) in the 29-day GLP toxicology and&#xD;
      toxicokinetic studies with 14-day recovery period of gamitrinib. Dose-escalation will follow&#xD;
      a 3+3 design. Six patients will be enrolled in the dose-expansion component of the study at&#xD;
      MTD for the purpose of exploring pharmacodynamic effects via tumor pre and on-therapy&#xD;
      biopsies.&#xD;

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study&#xD;
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, or in&#xD;
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
