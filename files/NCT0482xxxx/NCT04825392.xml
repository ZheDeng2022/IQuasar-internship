  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HX008 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting PD-1 on the T cell surface, restores T&#xD;
      cell activity, thus enhancing immune response, and has the potential to treat various types&#xD;
      of tumors. In this study, the tolerance and safety of HX008 in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors will be evaluated.&#xD;
