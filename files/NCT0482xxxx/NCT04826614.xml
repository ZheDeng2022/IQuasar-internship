      Comparison of efficacy treatment (respond, remission) between the optimized treatment group&#xD;
      (dose adjustment or early change other drug based on the change of total score HAM-D 17) and&#xD;
      the routine treatment group (start with the lowest effective dose and adjust dose slowly) for&#xD;
      depressed patients in Viet Nam&#xD;

      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common with a lifetime prevalence about 16 %. MDD is&#xD;
      able to be a recurrent and chronic condition. MDD is the second leading cause of disability&#xD;
      worldwide. This disorder can reduce an individual's ability to perform at work or school to&#xD;
      fulfill family responsibilities and to enjoy almost daily activities. Some evidences suggest&#xD;
      that delay in treatment of MDD result in poorer outcome; longer time to remission is&#xD;
      associated with residual symptoms, chronic condition, relapse and poorer recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare effectiveness of the treatment by using measurement base care,&#xD;
      accessing early improvement or lack of improvement to make decisions about regard to dose&#xD;
      alteration, switching another antidepressant with standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the 8 week randomized controlled trial. Raters blind to protocol and 2&#xD;
      treatment group. This study conduct from March 2021 to March 2022 in UMC hospital, Ho Chi&#xD;
      Minh city, Vietnam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to DSM criteria 5, 188 outpatient MDD will be recruited, 18-65 year-old, HAM D 17 ≥&#xD;
      17 score. All patients will have ability to communicate and to provide the written consent.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are psychotics, OCD, bipolar, suicide attempts in the current major&#xD;
      depressive episode, unsuccessful suicide behavior 3 months ago, chronic another medical&#xD;
      conditions (diabetes, hypothyroidism, pregnant, epilepsy, kidney failure, stroke, heart&#xD;
      failure, liver failure, adrenal insufficiency)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studied sample is divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving standard treatment (group A):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are treated with the minimally effective dose of an antidepressant which can be&#xD;
      combined with other classes, for example, low dose antipsychotic medication, mirtazapine,&#xD;
      zopiclone, benzodiazepine if insomnia is associated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are re-examined two times: after 4 weeks and 8 weeks of treatment to re-evaluate&#xD;
      clinical symptoms. The current medication can be adjusted or even changed to another drug if&#xD;
      it is necessary. This is decided by the assessment of the doctor at that moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HAM-D 17 scale is used to access the patient three times: at the start of treatment,&#xD;
      after 4 weeks, and 8 weeks of treatment by an autonomous researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have the right to stop participating in the study at any time and will be admitted&#xD;
      to the hospital for treatment if there is a risk of suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group of patients receiving personalized and optimized treatment (group B):&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAM-D 17 scale is used to assessed patients at the initiation of treatment. Basing on&#xD;
      clinical and severity on the HAMD-17 scale, doctors give the medication with the minimally or&#xD;
      medium effective dose of an antidepressant corresponding to moderate or severe depression.&#xD;
      The treatment can be combined with other groups of drugs such as antipsychotic drugs,&#xD;
      mirtazapine, zopiclone, benzodiazepine if insomnia is included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 1 week of treatment, patients will be re-assessed with the HAM-D 17 scale. If there is&#xD;
      no early improvement (decrease less than 20% of the initial score of HAM-D 17 scales),&#xD;
      medication dose will be increased with a condition that the patient tolerates the drug and&#xD;
      feel comfortable. Patients who cannot tolerate the current drug will be switched to another&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 2 weeks of treatment, patients will be re-assessed with the HAM-D 17 scale. If there is&#xD;
      still no early improvement (decrease less than 20% of the initial score of HAM-D 17 scales),&#xD;
      medication dose will be increased again (to maximum dose) with a condition that the patient&#xD;
      tolerates the drug and feel comfortable. Patients who cannot tolerate the current drug will&#xD;
      be switched to another drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 4 weeks of treatment, patients will be re-assessed with the HAM-D 17 scale. If a&#xD;
      patient does not respond to the ongoing treatment (decrease less than 50% of the initial&#xD;
      score of HAM-D 17 scales) with the maximum dose of the current antidepressant, he/she will be&#xD;
      switch to another antidepressant After 6 weeks of treatment, patients will be re-assessed&#xD;
      with the HAM-D 17 scale. If a patient still does not respond to the current treatment&#xD;
      (decrease less than 50% of the initial score of HAM-D 17 scales), he/she will be switch to&#xD;
      another antidepressant one more time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 8 week of treatment, patients will be re-assessed with the HAM-D 17 scale. Patients who&#xD;
      do not respond to treatment or do not recover will continue to be treated and monitored in&#xD;
      this outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have the right to stop participating in the study at any time and will be admitted&#xD;
      to the hospital for treatment if there is a risk of suicide.&#xD;
