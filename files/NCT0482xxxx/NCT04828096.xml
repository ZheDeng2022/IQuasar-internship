  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of major challenges in orthodontics is to inhibit relapse and ensure stability of&#xD;
      treatment outcomes. Retention is the phase of orthodontic treatment that attempts to keep&#xD;
      teeth in the corrected position after correction with orthodontic braces. Without retention&#xD;
      there is a tendency for the teeth to return to their initial position (1). Retention is&#xD;
      usually necessary to overcome the elastic recoil of the periodontal supporting fibers and to&#xD;
      allow remodeling of the alveolar bone. The bonded orthodontic lingual retainer constructed&#xD;
      from composite and orthodontic wires provides an esthetic and efficient system for maintained&#xD;
      retention and has been shown to be an effective means of retaining aligned anterior teeth in&#xD;
      the post treatment position in the long term. This has been in popular use as a method of&#xD;
      retention since the late 1970s (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional retainers, which are still in use, are multi-strand stainless steel retainers&#xD;
      such as Penta-one® 0.0215 (Masel Orthodontics, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The main problem with&#xD;
      multistrand stainless steel retainers is their high rate of failure. Clinical studies&#xD;
      indicate that 5% to 37% of mandibular retainers fail during retention in some form, either&#xD;
      bond failure or wire breakage (3-5). Reliance Orthodontic Products, Inc. (Itasca, IL, USA)&#xD;
      recently introduced a bonded retainer system (Ortho-Flextech™ chain). This retainer's bonding&#xD;
      is claimed to be quick and easy by reducing chairside time and eliminating laboratory costs&#xD;
      (6). One other recently introduced retainer is Memotain™ (CA-Digital in Mettmann, Germany).&#xD;
      Memotain is a CAD/CAM fabricated lingual retainer made of 0.014 X 0.014-inch rectangular&#xD;
      nickel-titanium. The wire is highly flexible and custom cut to precisely adapt to the&#xD;
      patient's lingual tooth anatomy. According to manufacturer, Memotain offers numerous&#xD;
      perceived advantages to traditional multistranded lingual wires, including no need for wire&#xD;
      measuring or bending, individually optimized placement, greater accuracy of fit, tighter&#xD;
      interproximal adaptation, less tongue irritation, better durability, and resistance to&#xD;
      microbial colonization (6). However, randomized clinical trials are necessary to determine&#xD;
      whether these advantages are substantiated with scientific data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent review by the Cochrane group concluded that to date there is insufficient evidence&#xD;
      to single out any particular retention strategy as the preferred method: it was recommended&#xD;
      that future studies should include true randomization, reporting of dropouts, adequate sample&#xD;
      size calculation, and a minimum follow-up period of 3 months (8). Thus, the aims of this&#xD;
      multicenter, randomised controlled trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare and evaluate the effectiveness and failure rate of Penta-one multistrand,&#xD;
           Ortho-Flextech and Memotain retainers with each other&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the possible complications between the three retainers over time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the cost-effectiveness of the three retainers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effectiveness of sandblasting in the retention of the wires&#xD;

      Trial design This study is a 3-arm parallel-group, randomized controlled trial with a 1:1&#xD;
      allocation ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, eligibility criteria, and setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are to be recruited at the Postgraduate Dental Education Center, Department of&#xD;
      Orthodontics, in Örebro, Henrikson Orthodontics, in Malmö and Universitat Internacional de&#xD;
      Catalunya, Department of Orthodontics, in Barcelona.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following inclusion criteria is to be applied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients requiring mandibular lingual fixed canine-to-canine retainer after undergoing&#xD;
           orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sound enamel on the lingual surface&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculus-free lingual surface in the lower anterior segment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent is obtained, the patients are going to be randomized into three&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Penta-One 0.0215 inch multistranded wire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Ortho-FlexTech stainless steel chain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: Memotain wire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures For all groups the time required for taking impressions and bonding of retainers&#xD;
      is taken by a digital timer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients allocated to Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After taking impressions and when the working models are cast in hard stone, all retainers&#xD;
      (0.0215-inch multistranded Penta-one wire) are going to be contoured by dental technicians at&#xD;
      each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All retainers in the study are to be bonded using the following sequence of construction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fixed appliance is debonded, and the teeth are to be thoroughly cleaned and polished&#xD;
           using oil-free pumice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After adequate moisture control using dental cotton rolls in the anterior segment,&#xD;
           parotis dental rolls in the lateral segments, and saliva ejector, the lingual surfaces&#xD;
           are to be sandblasted in half of the group (according to the randomization list)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lingual surfaces are etched with Ultra-Etch 35% phosphoric acid gel (Ultradent Products&#xD;
           Inc, City, Utah), for 30 seconds and thoroughly rinsed and dried.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A thin layer of primer Ortho Solo® (Ormco, Orange, CA, USA) applies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retainer holds in place with dental floss and the fit is checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate amounts of composite Tetric Evo-Flow (Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein)&#xD;
           is applied to the lingual surfaces of the six anterior teeth over the retainer, ensuring&#xD;
           maximum coverage of the wire surface. The composite pads are light cured, both incisally&#xD;
           and cervically, for 20 seconds per tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients allocated to Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fixed appliance is debonded, and the teeth are to be thoroughly cleaned and polished&#xD;
           using oil-free pumice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After adequate moisture control using dental cotton rolls in the anterior segment,&#xD;
           parotis dental rolls in the lateral segments, and saliva ejector, the lingual surfaces&#xD;
           are to be sandblasted in half of the group (according to the randomization list)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lingual surfaces are etched with Ultra-Etch 35% phosphoric acid gel (Ultradent Products&#xD;
           Inc, City, Utah), for 30 seconds and thoroughly rinsed and dried.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A thin layer of primer Ortho Solo® (Ormco, Orange, CA, USA) applies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small amounts of composite Tetric Evo-Flow (Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein)&#xD;
           were applied to the lingual surfaces of the six anterior teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ortho-FlexTech chain is cut at chairside in desired length and hold in place with dental&#xD;
           floss and the fit is checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small amounts of composite Tetric Evo-Flow (Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) is&#xD;
           applied to the lingual surfaces of the six anterior teeth over the retainer, ensuring&#xD;
           maximum coverage of the wire surface. The composite pads are light cured, both incisally&#xD;
           and cervically, for 20 seconds per tooth. Additional composite applies to cover the&#xD;
           whole mesial-deistal surface of each tooth making sure not to cover the approximal&#xD;
           surfaces. Then light cured for another 20 second per tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients allocated to Group 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After digital scanning of the anterior lower six teeth, the Memotain in ordered online.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fixed appliance is debonded, and the teeth are to be thoroughly cleaned and polished&#xD;
           using oil-free pumice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After adequate moisture control using dental cotton rolls in the anterior segment,&#xD;
           parotis dental rolls in the lateral segments, and saliva ejector, the lingual surfaces&#xD;
           are to be sandblasted in half of the group (according to the randomization list)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lingual surfaces are etched with Ultra-Etch 35% phosphoric acid gel (Ultradent Products&#xD;
           Inc, City, Utah), for 30 seconds and thoroughly rinsed and dried.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A thin layer of primer Ortho Solo® (Ormco, Orange, CA, USA) applies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Memotain puts into placed using the positioning jig to ensure precise placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate amounts of composite Tetric Evo-Flow (Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein)&#xD;
           are applied to the lingual surfaces of the canines initially and after removing the&#xD;
           positioning jig on the remaining four anterior teeth, ensuring maximum coverage of the&#xD;
           wire surface. The composite pads are light cured, both incisally and cervically, for 20&#xD;
           seconds per tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-ups During the visit to the clinics all groups are to take impressions with digital&#xD;
      scanning of the upper and the lower dentition and intraoral photographs from the dentition at&#xD;
      baseline (directly after debond) T0, 6 months after debond (T1), one year (T2) two years (T3)&#xD;
      and five years (T4) after debond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The digital study models will be assessed for identifying possible side effects and deviation&#xD;
      of individual tooth positions. For this purpose Little's Irregularity Index (LII) (9) for&#xD;
      tooth contact displacement will be used. Patients' records will be reviewed to assess the&#xD;
      first debond or breakage of the retainers during the observation periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the cost-effectiveness, the overall cost of the retainers including&#xD;
      manufacturing, time for impressions and bonding will be calculated and compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure of a retainer can occur as a result of debonding, fracture, debonding and fracture,&#xD;
      or retainer loss. Information on the site of failure e.g. single tooth bond failure,&#xD;
      enamel/adhesive failure, or adhesive wire failure is to be recorded in the patients' records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only ﬁrst failures are to be counted and failure location (which tooth) is to be noted. In&#xD;
      addition, multiple failure sites in one retainer are going to be counted as one failure.&#xD;
      Furthermore, failure is considered when there was debonding, fracture, debonding and&#xD;
      fracture, or retainer loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcome is failure rate/breakage of the retainers during the observation&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome include, complications, costs and the effect of micro-etching (sand&#xD;
      blasting) on the failure rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation The calculated sample size for each group is based on a significance&#xD;
      level of 0.05 and 90 per cent power to detect a clinically meaningful difference of 15 per&#xD;
      cent failure rate between the groups. The sample size calculation indicated that 97 patients&#xD;
      would be required in each group. To compensate for dropouts, we decided to include at least&#xD;
      108 patients in each group (an addition of 10 per cent per group) and a total of 324&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
