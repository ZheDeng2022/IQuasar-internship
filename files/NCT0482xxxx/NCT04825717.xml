  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we intend to examine the effectiveness of an indirect calorimetry-guided&#xD;
      nutrition plan, compared to the conventional, RDI-guided nutrition plan in mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated patients, in terms of success rates of prolonged ventilation weaning, and shorter&#xD;
      weaning time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: The rates of chronically ventilated patients weaned off invasive ventilation will&#xD;
      increase by 15% in the intervention group, and the average weaning period in this group will&#xD;
      be reduced by 10 ± 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized controlled intervention trial that will include 200 chronically&#xD;
      ventilated patients, admitted to the &quot;Reuth&quot; Rehabilitation Hospital, who meet the criteria&#xD;
      for weaning from prolonged mechanical ventilation. Patients in the intervention group (n=100)&#xD;
      will undergo precise calorimetric measurements using indirect calorimetry and will be&#xD;
      administered with a nutrition plan in accordance with these measurements. Nutrition plans of&#xD;
      patients in the control group (n=100) will be calculated and administered according to&#xD;
      current RDI conventions (up to 24 Kcal/kg/day). In order to assure blinding, patients in the&#xD;
      control group will undergo the same calorimetric measurements using indirect calorimetry,&#xD;
      however, these results will not be used in any way to determine or influence the nutritional&#xD;
      plan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Background: The number of patients in need of prolonged mechanical ventilation as means of&#xD;
      life support is rapidly growing due to advancements in life-saving medical care for&#xD;
      critically ill patients, an aging population, and the expanding use of aggressive surgical&#xD;
      treatments. Both overfeeding and underfeeding are found to negatively affect the weaning&#xD;
      process from mechanical ventilation. The caloric demands of chronically ventilated patients&#xD;
      are reduced due to immobility and minimal energy requirements. Nowadays, nutrition plans are&#xD;
      determined using the RDI (recommended dietary intake) formula, according to a patient's own&#xD;
      weight and height. The RDI formula does not take into account the negligible activity levels&#xD;
      of chronically ventilated patients or their deteriorating muscle mass, which is severely&#xD;
      reduced due to prolonged periods of inactivity. This, in turn, may lead to increased body fat&#xD;
      mass and fluid retention - which are both deleterious to the patients' health and may hinder&#xD;
      their weaning from prolonged mechanical ventilation. Calorimetry is an accurate tool for&#xD;
      measuring energy expenditures allowing us to assess the actual energy requirements of every&#xD;
      patient. In indirect calorimetry, measurements of gas exchange are used to determine oxygen&#xD;
      consumption versus the production and release of carbon dioxide. The &quot;Reuth&quot; Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Hospital houses 108 chronically ventilated adult patients at a given moment, with turnover&#xD;
      rates of 70-80 patients per year. If possible, these patients eventually undergo ventilation&#xD;
      weaning. The current success rate for ventilation weaning reaches 55%, with a total duration&#xD;
      of approximately two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To increase the success rates of prolonged ventilation weaning, i.e achieve a higher&#xD;
      percentage of patients who successfully undergo mechanical ventilation weaning, with a&#xD;
      shorter overall weaning time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: The rates of chronically ventilated patients weaned off invasive ventilation will&#xD;
      increase to 70% in the intervention group, and the average weaning period will be reduced by&#xD;
      10 ± 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized controlled intervention trial that will include 200 chronically&#xD;
      ventilated patients admitted to the &quot;Reuth&quot; Rehabilitation Hospital, who meet the criteria&#xD;
      for weaning from prolonged mechanical ventilation. Patients in the intervention group (n=100)&#xD;
      will undergo precise calorimetric measurements using indirect calorimetry and will be&#xD;
      administered with a nutrition plan in accordance with these measurements. Nutrition plans of&#xD;
      patients in the control group (n=100) will be calculated and administered according to&#xD;
      current RDI conventions (up to 24 Kcal/kg/day). In order to assure blinding, patients in the&#xD;
      control group will undergo the same calorimetric measurements using indirect calorimetry,&#xD;
      however, these results will not be used in any way to determine or influence the nutritional&#xD;
      plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: In the United States, the use of prolonged mechanical ventilation increases by&#xD;
      5.5% annually, while total admissions rates increase by just 1% per year. According to&#xD;
      estimates, the total number of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation will be&#xD;
      doubled by 2020, reaching 305,898 cases. It is safe to assume that similar trends exist in&#xD;
      Israel, where 635 hospital beds are allocated to the ventilated patients. The total monthly&#xD;
      admission costs for every ventilated patient in Israel are estimated at 14,140 USD, reaching&#xD;
      nine million USD a year. Prolonged mechanical ventilation has a negative impact on both the&#xD;
      patient and his family while caring for ventilated patients imposes a heavy burden on the&#xD;
      health care system. In this study, we strive to increase the success rates of prolonged&#xD;
      ventilation weaning, thereby improving ventilated patients' outcomes and alleviating the&#xD;
      hardships inflicted on the patients, their families, and the health care system as a whole.&#xD;
