      To estimate the prevalence of congenital CMV infection in Vietnamese neonates and relating&#xD;
      morbidity within 2-year follow-up. Along with evaluating the predictive value of the presence&#xD;
      and the level of CMV replication in the first trimester in a highly seropositive population&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital cytomegalovirus infection (cCMV) is the main non-genetic cause of sensorineural&#xD;
      hearing loss (SNHL), and a major cause of neuro-disability. High maternal CMV prevalence&#xD;
      seems to be consistently associated with high prevalence of cCMV infection but the associated&#xD;
      morbidity might be different from one population to another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There exists no serologic marker useful to differentiate non-primary infection from primary&#xD;
      infection. Since the morbidity of cCMV is similar between both primary and non-primary&#xD;
      maternal infection, and to be infected in the first trimester is the major risk factor for&#xD;
      long-term sequelae in neonates. Hence, it is needed to focus on finding markers that predict&#xD;
      cCMV after maternal infection in the first trimester of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the epidemiology of cCMV, the morbidity related to cCMV in Vietnamese population and&#xD;
      the predictive value of Cytomegalovirus Polymerase Chain Reaction (CMV PCR) in maternal blood&#xD;
      and urine in the first trimester remain unknown. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
