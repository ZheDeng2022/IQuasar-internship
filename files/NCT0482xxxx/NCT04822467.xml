      SQ53 is a novel antimicrobial, sporicidal solution that is based on a platform of quaternary&#xD;
      ammonium chloride compounds. It has been tested against a wide range of bacteria, viruses,&#xD;
      spores and fungal pathogens. Extensive laboratory testing has demonstrated the effectiveness&#xD;
      of SQ53 impregnated wipes in cleaning surfaces including catheters over a 24 hour plus time&#xD;
      period. SQ53 also received an in vitro evaluation of the irritancy potential using a tissue&#xD;
      engineered human skin model and was found to have no potential for skin irritation. SQ53 is&#xD;
      available as a sterilized pack with a single wipe inside. The pack is easy to open by tearing&#xD;
      off the top end and presenting the contents to the operator to remove under sterile&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will be a randomized single-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial for&#xD;
      SQ53 wipes intended for catheter cleaning in patients receiving home parenteral nutrition.&#xD;

      Parenteral nutrition (PN) therapy is an essential component of medical management of patients&#xD;
      suffering from intestinal failure. Depending on the underlying etiology and the type of&#xD;
      intestinal failure, the duration of parenteral nutrition therapy could range from several&#xD;
      weeks to several years, although a substantial proportion of these patients also require&#xD;
      lifelong parenteral nutrition support. These patients continue the infusion of PN at their&#xD;
      homes and are managed by the Cleveland Clinic's Home PN support team. These patients require&#xD;
      Central Venous Catheters (CVC) for prolonged period of time for infusion of parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition. The two most commonly used central catheters for TPN infusion are the Peripherally&#xD;
      Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) and Tunneled CVCs. Catheter related blood stream infection&#xD;
      (CRBSI) is a major complication of long-term CVCs. CRBSI is associated with high morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality and healthcare cost. Additionally, CRBSI can also lead to an interruption in&#xD;
      nutrient delivery, loss of work and productivity, premature vascular access device removal,&#xD;
      and poor quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention of CRBSI is an important component of clinical management of patients receiving&#xD;
      home PN therapy. Several strategies have been adopted to reduce the incidence of CRBSI. A&#xD;
      heparin lock solution was used in the past for many years; however, current nutrition society&#xD;
      guidelines recommend normal saline locks instead of heparin locks. Published data has&#xD;
      suggested that heparin locks have not proven to have a substantial effect on CRBSI&#xD;
      prevention, and it paradoxically increases the infection risk due to biofilm production.&#xD;
      Antibiotic locks have also been used, although this practice is largely not preferred due to&#xD;
      increased risk of infections with resistant microorganisms. Taurolidine is another lock&#xD;
      solution which has been studied in the countries outside the United States such as Canada;&#xD;
      however, it has not been approved for the use in the U.S. yet.1&#xD;
