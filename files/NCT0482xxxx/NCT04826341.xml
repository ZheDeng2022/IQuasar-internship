  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small cell lung cancer and PARP inhibitor resistant tumors are aggressive cancers. Current&#xD;
      treatments for people with these tumors yield little benefit. Researchers want to see if a&#xD;
      combination of drugs can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find a safe combination of sacituzumab govitecan and berzosertib and to see if this will&#xD;
      cause small cell lung cancer and PARP inhibitor resistant tumors to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with a solid tumor, small cell lung cancer, or a homologous&#xD;
      recombination-deficient cancer that is resistant to PARP inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard clinical exams and tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      EKG to test the heart&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical documentation to confirm cancer diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get sacituzumab govitecan by vein on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle.&#xD;
      They will get berzosertib by vein on days 2 and 9. Treatment will continue as long as they&#xD;
      can tolerate the drugs and their tumors are either stable or getting better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment and at least once per cycle, participants will have a physical exam and&#xD;
      blood tests. Before treatment and every 2 or 3 cycles, they will have a CT scan. They will&#xD;
      have a contrast agent injected into a vein for the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give blood and hair samples and tumor biopsies for research. Biopsies will&#xD;
      be taken with a small needle under imaging guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After they stop treatment, participants will have a visit 1 month later. They will then be&#xD;
      contacted by phone or email every 3 months for the rest of their lives.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several small molecule poly-(ADP)-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have been approved by&#xD;
      the FDA for multiple cancers with homologous recombination (HR) deficiencies. Despite their&#xD;
      measurable initial benefit, PARPi resistance is a major problem in the clinic. There are no&#xD;
      established standards for care of patients who have disease progression after PARPi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis. Despite being&#xD;
      chemo-sensitive initially, the tumors are invariably chemo-resistant at recurrence. Currently&#xD;
      available therapies for patients who have disease progression after chemotherapy yield&#xD;
      limited benefit, and most patients die within months of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preclinical studies, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibition can&#xD;
      overcome PARPi/chemotherapy-resistance in tumors with restored HR or restored fork&#xD;
      protection. However, combinations of DNA damage response inhibitors and chemotherapy may be&#xD;
      challenging in clinic due to overlapping toxicities, specifically myelosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To mitigate some of the overlapping toxicities relating to myelosuppression, we have proposed&#xD;
      a strategy that incorporates tumor targeted DNA-damaging chemotherapy delivery (using&#xD;
      approaches such as antibody drug conjugates) and dose scheduling of ATR inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sacituzumab govitecan is an antibody-drug conjugate, comprising a topoisomerase-I inhibiting&#xD;
      camptothecin, SN-38, linked to a humanized antibody targeting trophoblastic cell-surface&#xD;
      antigen 2 (Trop-2), and is FDA approved as Trodelvy (Trademark) for triple-negative breast&#xD;
      cancer patients who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Berzosertib is a potent and selective kinase inhibitor of ATR in phase I and II clinical&#xD;
      trials as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy, radiation and other anticancer&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that a combination of berzosertib with sacituzumab govitecan will provide an&#xD;
      effective therapeutic option for patients with PARPi resistant tumors and&#xD;
      chemotherapy-resistant SCLCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sacituzumab govitecan in combination&#xD;
      with berzosertib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II HRD cohort: To assess the efficacy with respect to objective response rate (ORR) of&#xD;
      the combination of sacituzumab govitecan and berzosertib in previously treated participants&#xD;
      with HRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II SCLC cohort: To assess the efficacy with respect to ORR of the combination of&#xD;
      sacituzumab govitecan and berzosertib in previously treated participants with SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All phases: Subjects must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age and have a performance&#xD;
      status (ECOG) less than or equal to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Adult participants with advanced solid tumors with progression on at least one prior&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II HRD cohort: Known HRD cancer and documented evidence of germline or somatic BRCA&#xD;
      mutation or other HRD germline mutation, or tumor is HRD positive; progressive disease while&#xD;
      taking a PARPi as a previous therapy or within 6 months of completing PARPi therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II SCLC cohort: Recurrent SCLC after at least one prior platinum-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I/II, open label clinical trial identifying the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      of sacituzumab govitecan in combination with berzosertib in a phase I trial, and assessing&#xD;
      the efficacy with respect to clinical response rate of a combination of sacituzumab govitecan&#xD;
      and berzosertib as treatment of subjects with recurrent SCLC and HRD positive tumors in a&#xD;
      phase II trial. The accrual ceiling will be set to 70 for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive sacituzumab govitecan on days 1 and 8 and berzosertib on days 2 and&#xD;
      9, administered every 21 days (1 cycle), until disease progression or development of&#xD;
      intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, hair follicles, and tumor will be collected at various time points to support the&#xD;
      exploratory objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase I will follow a 3+3 design: dose will be escalated in cohorts of 3-6 participants&#xD;
      each with the individual dose of berzosertib and sacituzumab govitecan increased in&#xD;
      successive dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase II HRD cohort and phase II SCLC cohort will be conducted using a Simon two-stage&#xD;
      Minimax design in order to rule out an unacceptably low 5% response rate (p0=0.05) for HRD&#xD;
      and 10% (p=0.10) response rate for SCLC in favor of a targeted response rate of 20% (p1=0.20)&#xD;
      and 30% (p1=0.30), respectively.&#xD;

             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because study drugs have the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with study&#xD;

             of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For&#xD;
