  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been a number of randomized controlled studies (RCT) showing the efficacy of the&#xD;
      endovascular treatment with drug-coated balloons (DCB) in the femoropopliteal artery lesions.&#xD;
      However, these studies have been carefully designed, and most of them have excluded&#xD;
      long-length lesions and severely calcified lesions. In addition to being used alone in the&#xD;
      real word, drug-coated balloons (DCB) are also used in combination with stents or debulking&#xD;
      devices, but in these randomized controlled studies (RCT) they are only compared with&#xD;
      standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Therefore, the investigators initiated&#xD;
      this study, which is a prospective, multicenter, observational real-world study of short and&#xD;
      long-term outcome in endovascular treatment of femoropopliteal arterial occlusive lesions&#xD;
      with DCB.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Traditional endovascular approaches to the treatment of atherosclerotic disease in the&#xD;
      femoropopliteal arteries include percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with an uncoated&#xD;
      balloon and implantation of a bare metal stent. Recently, drug-eluting stents (DES) and&#xD;
      drug-coated balloons (DCB) that transfer paclitaxel to the vessel wall during&#xD;
      revascularization have been added to the suite of tools available to interventionists,&#xD;
      helping to prevent restenosis after treatment.&#xD;

      observational real-world study of short and long-term outcome in endovascular treatment of&#xD;
      femoropopliteal arterial occlusive lesions with DCB. It is estimated that 1200 patients with&#xD;
      chronic femoral popliteal artery occlusion were enrolled in the group at 8 centers in China&#xD;
      in two years. The follow-up would be conducted at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 months after&#xD;
      the operation to assess the efficacy and safety of the endovascular treatment with&#xD;
      drug-coated balloons (DCB) in the femoropopliteal artery lesions.&#xD;

    <description>The VascuQol was designed as a questionnaire containing five domains: pain (4 items), symptoms (4 items), activities (8 items), social (2 items), and emotional (7 items) to evaluate Health related quality of life (HRQL). Every item has seven response options, with scores ranging from 1 to 7. A total score is the sum of all 25 item scores divided by 25.And both the total score as well as the domain scores range from 1 (worst HRQL) to 7 (best HRQL).The lower the value, the poorer the quality of life.</description>
