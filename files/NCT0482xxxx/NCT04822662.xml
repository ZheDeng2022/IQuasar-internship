  <brief_summary>

      The aim of the study; to determine the effect of education program given to adolescents&#xD;
      diagnosed with epilepsy and their parents based on Ryan and Sawin's individual and family&#xD;
      self-management theory, on adolescents 'attitudes towards disease, self-efficacy, quality of&#xD;
      life and parents' nurse-parent support levels.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to the expected effects of epilepsy on children, the course of the disease and&#xD;
      the course of the child's life will change as the duration of life with the disease&#xD;
      increases. In epilepsy, it is necessary to develop self-management behaviors in order to&#xD;
      facilitate adaptation to the disease, to encourage seizure control and to increase the&#xD;
      quality of life. Regular repetition of the trainings created within the framework of a&#xD;
      certain plan to improve self-management behaviors is one of the recommended steps to&#xD;
      strengthen the individual with chronic disease in the disease process. This randomized&#xD;
      controlled study including aged 12-18 adolescents with a diagnosis of epilepsy, monotherapy,&#xD;
      mental retardation without cerebral palsy, and no secondary disease and their parents.&#xD;
      However, there isn't enough published research examining the effect of education program&#xD;
      given to adolescents diagnosed with epilepsy and their parents based on Ryan and Sawin's&#xD;
      individual and family self-management theory, on adolescents 'attitudes towards disease,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, quality of life and parents' nurse-parent support levels.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In this study, stratified sampling was employed based on age and sex. Two strata, [12-14 age, girl] and [15-18 age, boy], were generated to ensure even distribution in terms of age and sex in each group. First, thirty-six adolescent were stratified into two groups (A and B), which were then stratified again into two: [12-14 age, girl] and [15-18 age, boy]. A scheme was developed to randomize the age and sex of [12-14, girl] and [15-18 age, boy] into two groups (A and B), resulting in the experimental and control groups stratified by the age and sex and blocked into paired-groups of (2:2/[12-14 age, girl]:[15-18 age, boy]). Permutation was also used to strike a balance between the strata. Block sets were generated for each combination of the prognostic factors (age and sex). The experimental and control groups were then randomized into the strata using a random numbers table.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Child Attitude Toward Illness Scale was developed by Austin (1993) to measure the attitudes of children with chronic diseases towards their disease. The validity and reliability of the 13-item single-dimension scale was conducted by Ersun and Bolisik (2012) with children aged 9-17 years with epilepsy.&#xD;
The average score that can be obtained from the scale varies between 1 and 5. The average score of 1 and 2 indicates negative attitude, 3 indicates neutral attitude, 4 and 5 indicate positive attitude.</description>

It was conducted with children aged 9-18 years with epilepsy and the Cronbach's alpha value of the scale was 0.89.

    <description>The Children's Quality of Life Scale was developed in 2001 by Varni et al. For adolescents aged 13-18. The internal consistency coefficient of the scale varies between 0.80-0.88. The Turkish validity and reliability study of the scale was conducted by Çakın Memik et al. In 2007 and the internal consistency coefficient was found to be 0.82. PedsQL, which is one of the general quality of life scales, is a quality of life scale suitable for use in both healthy and ill adolescents. It is a five-point Likert-type scale consisting of 23 items that determines the health-related quality of life of adolescents aged 13-18.</description>
