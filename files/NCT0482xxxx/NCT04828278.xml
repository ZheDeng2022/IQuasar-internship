  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of nooLVL containing arginine and&#xD;
      inositol supplementation on executive function and memory prior to and following playing&#xD;
      video games.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gaming or &quot;E-Sports&quot; has become a very popular activity particularly among younger&#xD;
      individuals. It requires quick reactions, executive function, memory and fine motor skill. In&#xD;
      E-Sport competitions and tournaments, E-Sport players often play for hours per session over a&#xD;
      series of days. Thus, the ability to maintain cognitive and executive function, concentration&#xD;
      and fine motor skill is paramount. Two recent studies have evaluated the effects of ingesting&#xD;
      bonded arginine silicate (ASI) and ASI with additional inositol on cognitive function. In the&#xD;
      first study, ASI supplementation (1,500 mg/d for 3 days and 14 days) significantly improved&#xD;
      the ability to perform complex cognitive tests requiring mental flexibility, processing speed&#xD;
      and executive functioning. In the second study, adding 100 mg of inositol to the ASI&#xD;
      significantly improved cognitive function in gamers after playing video games for one hour.&#xD;
      This study is designed to assess the effects of bonded arginine silicate and inositol&#xD;
      ingestion on reaction time and cognitive function prior to and following a 1-hour gaming&#xD;
      challenge.&#xD;
