  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Discovered thousands of years ago, coffee is among the most consumed beverages in the world.&#xD;
      The relationship between coffee and cardiovascular risk, more specifically coronary artery&#xD;
      disease, is controversial. Platelet aggregation and its relationship with coffee is also&#xD;
      controversial. The investigators propose this study to evaluate the relationship between&#xD;
      coffee and platelet aggregability in patients with coronary artery disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 patients with coronary artery disease (proven by previous coronary angiography) will be&#xD;
      selected at the Heart Institute (InCor USP) for the study. Patients will be instructed to&#xD;
      abstain from caffeinated beverages during 22 days. After this period, one group will consume&#xD;
      caffeinated coffee during 28 days, followed by decaffeinated coffee during more 28 days and&#xD;
      another group will start with decaffeinated coffee followed by caffeinated. All participants&#xD;
      will receive &quot;Nespresso&quot; coffee maker &quot;Essenza&quot; model. The coffee &quot;Nespresso blend voluto&quot;&#xD;
      will be provided (caffeinated and decaffeinated). The patients will have to take four cups of&#xD;
      espresso per day (three cups a day for patients aged 65 and over). The investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate platelet aggregation by Multiplate® (ASPI, ADP and arachidonic acid) and by optical&#xD;
      aggregometry (ADP and arachidonic acid).&#xD;
