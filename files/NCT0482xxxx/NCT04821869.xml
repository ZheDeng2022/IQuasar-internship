      A pilot study to explore the utilization of the TEVA ProAir Digihaler rescue medication use&#xD;
      and inhalation parameters to identify disease deterioration to help in the management of COPD&#xD;
      patients in clinical practice. The study is designed to follow a small sample size of&#xD;
      patients with COPD, monitor and collect inhalation parameters from the Digihaler dashboard,&#xD;
      and changes in symptom control as measured by the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) to identify&#xD;
      potential inhalation parameter thresholds that could be applied to the management of patients&#xD;
      with COPD in clinical practice.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is an unblinded open label single center study designed to identify trends in Peak&#xD;
      Inspiratory Flow (PIF) rates and Rescue Albuterol Inhaler usage (Inhalations) that associate&#xD;
      with disease deterioration as defined by worsening of symptoms and reduced lung function in&#xD;
      patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a run-in period of approximately 2 weeks, a treatment period of 6&#xD;
      months and a follow-up period of 1 week. Twenty (20) patients with COPD requiring&#xD;
      intermittent short acting beta agonist (SABA) rescue inhaler usage, but not requiring&#xD;
      frequent SABA nebulizer rescue usage, will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing informed consent, patients will undergo a screening evaluation. During the&#xD;
      run-in period, patients will continue on their COPD maintenance treatments, while&#xD;
      discontinuing all previously prescribed periodic use rescue medications. Upon completion of&#xD;
      screening, all patients will be dispensed a ProAir Digihaler to be used exclusively as their&#xD;
      rescue medication throughout the duration of the study. During the run-in period all rescue&#xD;
      inhaler usage will be electronically monitored and patient data from the Digihaler Dashboard&#xD;
      will be downloaded every other business day basis (Monday, Wednesday and Friday).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of at least 2 weeks of run-in (with a minimum of at least 8 rescue inhaler&#xD;
      usages) and with documentation of stable clinical status throughout run-in, the patient will&#xD;
      return for baseline testing; including vital signs, health related quality of life and&#xD;
      Anthonisen Exacerbation questionnaires, pre and post bronchodilator spirometry and 6-minute&#xD;
      walk testing (see table/flow chart). Average Peak Inspiratory Flow (Baseline PIF) and average&#xD;
      Number of Rescue Inhalations per day (Baseline Inhalations) will be determined from the&#xD;
      Digihaler Dashboard Data downloads during run-in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that the patient does not meet number of rescue inhaler usages or does not have&#xD;
      a stable clinical status during run-in, an additional 2 weeks of run-in may be obtained. If&#xD;
      at the end of the extended run-in period so that Baseline PIF and Baseline Inhalations cannot&#xD;
      be determined or the patient continues to be clinically unstable, the patient will be&#xD;
      discontinued from the study. If the patient has an upper respiratory tract infection or COPD&#xD;
      exacerbation during run-in, they will also be discontinued from the study. Patients may be&#xD;
      re-screened one time at a later date, when stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once run-in and baseline testing are complete, all patients will continue on their&#xD;
      maintenance COPD medications and use the ProAir Digihaler rescue SABA exclusively for the&#xD;
      next 6 months. Patients will be provided with paper forms of the CAT, BCSS and Anthonisen&#xD;
      Exacerbation criteria, to be completed at home on a weekly basis and mailed to the research&#xD;
      center upon completion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the treatment period, all rescue inhaler usage will be electronically transmitted&#xD;
      to, monitored at and downloaded from the Digihaler Dashboard by the research center on every&#xD;
      other business day basis (Monday, Wednesday and Friday). At the completion of each Digihaler&#xD;
      Dashboard Data Download, comparisons of Daily PIF (average PIF of all rescue inhalations in a&#xD;
      day) and Daily Inhalations (number of rescue inhalations in a day) to Baseline PIF and&#xD;
      Baseline Inhalations will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with Daily Inhalations exceeding Baseline Inhalations by ≥4 Inhalations per day&#xD;
      and/or with a Daily PIF ≤80% of Baseline PIF for 2 consecutive days will be DEFINED as &quot;at&#xD;
      risk&quot;. For each &quot;at risk&quot; event, the patient will be contacted, their health status reviewed,&#xD;
      and CAT and Anthonisen Exacerbation questionnaires will be administered. Based on symptoms,&#xD;
      patients may also be advised to seek additional medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be contacted on a monthly basis, irrespective of &quot;risk&quot; findings and seen&#xD;
      in person every 3 months. All medication usage (including ProAir Digihaler medication usage),&#xD;
      changes in medical care, healthcare contacts and usage, and any adverse events will be&#xD;
      recorded. All office records for the intervening time period will be reviewed and Information&#xD;
      for any non-office healthcare contacts and usage will be requested to provide detailed&#xD;
      clinical information for comparison to Digihaler usage records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At months 3 and 6 on treatment, all subjects will return to the research center, where vital&#xD;
      signs, Anthonisen Exacerbation and CAT questionnaires, and post bronchodilator spirometry&#xD;
      will be assessed. All medication usage (including ProAir Digihaler medication usage), changes&#xD;
      in medical care, healthcare contacts and usage, and any adverse events will be recorded. All&#xD;
      office records for the intervening time period will be reviewed and Information for any&#xD;
      non-office healthcare contacts and usage will be requested to provide detailed clinical&#xD;
      information for comparison to Digihaler usage records. Three (3) new ProAir Digihalers will&#xD;
      be dispensed at month 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the treatment period, all rescue inhaler usage will be electronically monitored&#xD;
      and downloaded from the Digihaler Dashboard by the research center on an every other business&#xD;
      day basis (Monday, Wednesday and Friday). At the completion of each Digihaler Dashboard Data&#xD;
      Download, comparisons of Daily PIF (average PIF of all rescue inhalations in a day) and Daily&#xD;
      Inhalations (number of rescue inhalations in a day) to Baseline PIF and Baseline Inhalations&#xD;
      will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with Daily Inhalations exceeding Baseline Inhalations by ≥4 Inhalations per day&#xD;
      and/or with a Daily PIF ≤80% of Baseline PIF for 2 consecutive days will be DEFINED as &quot;at&#xD;
      risk&quot;. For each &quot;at risk&quot; event, the patient will be contacted, their health status reviewed,&#xD;
      and CAT and Anthonisen Exacerbation questionnaires will be administered. Based on symptoms,&#xD;
      patients may also be advised to seek additional medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the 6-month treatment period the patients will return to the research&#xD;
      center for a final visit, returning all study medication not previously returned. The patient&#xD;
      will be advised to resume usage of their prior rescue inhaler medication at that time. A&#xD;
      telephone call will be made to the patient 1 week after their final in-person visit, to&#xD;
      assess vital status and any adverse events that may have occurred subsequent to discontinuing&#xD;
      the ProAir Digihaler.&#xD;
