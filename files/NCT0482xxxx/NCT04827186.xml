      Although the notions that kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease and that simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplant is the only&#xD;
      treatment able to restore euglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes and selected patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes, are now consolidated, rates of transplantation remain low among&#xD;
      potential candidates with high levels of preformed anti-HLA antibodies. Most of the data&#xD;
      comes from the experience in kidney transplant but can be easily translated to pancreas&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 30% of patients on the transplant waiting list have evidence of sensitization&#xD;
      in the form of alloantibodies, generated from exposure to previous transplants, blood&#xD;
      transfusions, pregnancy, or other events. The presence of a panel-reactive antibody level of&#xD;
      at least 80% (i.e. a high level of sensitization) creates difficulty in finding matched&#xD;
      kidneys from compatible donors, leading to lower rates of transplantation in highly&#xD;
      sensitized candidates compared to non-sensitized; the longer waiting times translates in an&#xD;
      increased mortality rate. Despite the development of desensitization strategies and the&#xD;
      advancement in immunosuppression protocols, it is apparent that transplanting these patients&#xD;
      carries an increased risk of acute antibody mediated rejection; 25%-50% of transplants will&#xD;
      have an early acute antibody mediated rejection . Most of these rejections can be&#xD;
      successfully treated, but a high rate of transplant glomerulopathy and chronic antibody&#xD;
      mediated rejection (AMR) leading to accelerated allograft failure is common.&#xD;

&#xD;
      This protocol has been designed to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of spleen&#xD;
      transplant as a desensitization strategy for highly sensitized patients, potential candidates&#xD;
      of kidney or simultaneous kidney pancreas transplant with (positive cross-match by flow&#xD;
      cytometry (T or B) or B positive standard cross-match). After obtaining surgical and research&#xD;
      consent at a pre-transplant clinic visit, patients will be receiving spleen transplant&#xD;
      followed by spleen removal and kidney or simultaneous kidney pancreas transplant. Duration of&#xD;
      the subject participation will begin upon consent and will last for one year after the&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of treated acute rejection (humoral or cellulo-mediated) within the first year&#xD;
      (defined as biopsy proven or clinically indicated) will be determined. Graft and patient&#xD;
      survival will be monitored and compared with a cohort of highly sensitized patients with&#xD;
      similar immunological characteristics, treated with our standard protocol. DSA levels and&#xD;
      post-transplant cross-match will be determined.&#xD;

Graft and patient survival will be monitored and compared with an historical cohort of highly sensitized patient which received kidney or simultaneous kidney pancreas transplant alone without spleen.</intervention_model_description>
