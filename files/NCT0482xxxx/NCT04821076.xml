  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is designed as a randomized controlled intervention trial in which 60 young&#xD;
      trained (n = 30) (Population A) and recreationally active (n = 30) women (Population B) with&#xD;
      regular menstruation are divided into four groups. Population A will receive a low-calorie&#xD;
      diet + exercise or an energy balanced diet + exercise over 10 days. Population B will receive&#xD;
      a low-calorie diet without exercise, or an energy balanced diet over 10 days. The&#xD;
      participants are matched in pairs based on training history and randomized. Before the diet&#xD;
      period, the groups will undergo a 6-day control period, during which all participants must&#xD;
      take an energy-balanced diet (± training). After the 10 days of the diet intervention period,&#xD;
      the groups will receive an energy-balanced diet for 2 days. Before, during, and after the&#xD;
      trial period, participants will perform performance tests. In addition, 3 muscle biopsies, 2&#xD;
      adipose biopsies, blood samples, urine samples will be taken during the period, as well as&#xD;
      resting metabolic rate, electrocardiogram, flow-mediated vasodilation, and body composition&#xD;
      over the trial period. Muscle protein synthesis rate will be measured over the period using&#xD;
      stable isotope technique, which includes ingestion of heavy water (D2O) and collection of&#xD;
      saliva samples daily (days 0 to 16). The primary measurement parameter is changes in muscle&#xD;
      protein synthesis rate.&#xD;
