  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) osteoarthritis (OA) is common, seen frequently in middle-aged and&#xD;
      elderly women. While a variety of surgical treatments have been described with none superior&#xD;
      to any other, there is no consensus on the optimal duration of postoperative immobilization.&#xD;
      Immobilization following surgery is critical for wound healing, pain control, and aid with&#xD;
      activities of daily living in the early recovery period, though the duration of this must be&#xD;
      weighed against the negative impacts of immobilization, such as stiffness, contracture, and&#xD;
      delay in return to full function. The information gained in this study may allow hand&#xD;
      surgeons to use an evidence-based postoperative rehabilitation protocol. Thus, our goal is to&#xD;
      compare varying durations of postoperative immobilization after thumb CMC arthroplasty in a&#xD;
      randomized trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to treatment with non-removable thumb spica plaster postoperative&#xD;
      splint immobilization for 2 weeks or non-removable thumb spica plaster splint transitioned to&#xD;
      cast for a total of 6 weeks immobilization following base of thumb arthroplasty.&#xD;
      Patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) and objective metrics will be tracked in the&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Thumb CMC OA is common, with radiographic prevalence ranging from 7% to 35% in the&#xD;
      literature, with symptomatic OA affecting 2% to 6% of the population. There is predilection&#xD;
      for involvement of the non-dominant hand, and thumb CMC OA is the leading cause of hand pain&#xD;
      due to degenerative changes. Gender-specific differences in thumb CMC OA prevalence have also&#xD;
      been described in the literature. Retrospective review of 615 patients revealed a 6-fold&#xD;
      higher prevalence of thumb basilar joint OA for females in nearly every age group, noting the&#xD;
      presence of radiographic OA at younger ages in females, and quicker progression to end-stage&#xD;
      degenerative changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While conservative treatment, such as injections, therapy, splinting, and pharmacotherapy,&#xD;
      may palliate symptoms, operative intervention is recommended if symptoms are persistent.&#xD;
      Trapeziectomy with or without suspensionplasty is most commonly performed for advanced&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, and studies have shown that trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and&#xD;
      tendon interposition (LRTI) is the most frequently performed procedure. Because of the&#xD;
      extensive nature of this surgery with dissection and removal of the trapezium as a common&#xD;
      central procedure, immobilization of the thumb and wrist has been a standard part of&#xD;
      postoperative protocols to improve postoperative pain, function, and aid with return to daily&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Across many studies of operative technique and post-surgical care, there is no high-level&#xD;
      evidence on the optimal duration of postoperative immobilization. With no consensus on the&#xD;
      duration during which patients should restrict range of motion after thumb CMC joint surgery,&#xD;
      there is a gap in knowledge on this topic. Immobilization following surgery is critical for&#xD;
      wound healing, pain control, and aid with activities of daily living in the early recovery&#xD;
      period, though the duration of this must be weighed against the negative impacts of&#xD;
      immobilization, such as stiffness, contracture, and delay in return to full function. The&#xD;
      information gained in this study may allow hand surgeons to use an evidence-based&#xD;
      postoperative rehabilitation protocol. Thus, our goal is to compare varying durations of&#xD;
      postoperative immobilization after thumb CMC arthroplasty in a randomized trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will prospectively evaluate varied duration of postoperative immobilization&#xD;
      in patients older than 40 years, undergoing base of thumb arthroplasty at an academic,&#xD;
      tertiary referral center. Patients will be randomized to either 2 or 6 weeks of immediate&#xD;
      postoperative immobilization in a plaster thumb spica splint or cast. Functional outcome&#xD;
      measures, including quickDASH (Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand), PROMIS UE (Patient&#xD;
      Reported Outcome Measures Information System Upper Extremity) form, and VAS (Visual Analog&#xD;
      Scale) pain scale will be captured at short-term, intermediate-term, and final follow-up&#xD;
      periods. Additionally, exploratory objective metrics, such as strength, range of motion&#xD;
      (ROM), return to work, and occupational therapy (OT) utilization will be monitored at all&#xD;
      time periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization into two cohorts of postoperative rehabilitation will occur via sealed envelope&#xD;
      at the time of surgery. Patients will be consented through a formal written process detailing&#xD;
      the purpose, risks, and benefits. Randomization will occur in a 1:1 ratio into 2-week versus&#xD;
      6-week immobilization groups. Opaque envelopes will be sealed and only opened at the time of&#xD;
      randomization, immediately after completion of the surgical procedure, in the post-anesthesia&#xD;
      care unit (PACU). Every patient will be immobilized postoperatively in a nonremovable thumb&#xD;
      spica plaster splint to allow for swelling. At the 2 week (+/- 3 days) postoperative visit,&#xD;
      patients will be placed into either a cast for 4 additional weeks of immobilization (6-week&#xD;
      immobilization group) or be provided a removable thermoplastic thumb spica splint (2-week&#xD;
      immobilization group) and specifically instructed to use it for comfort &quot;as needed&quot; with&#xD;
      removal at their discretion. A similarly fashioned thermoplastic thumb spica splint will be&#xD;
      provided to the 6-week group after the duration of their immobilization, again with&#xD;
      instructions for &quot;as needed&quot; use. At the conclusion of each group's respective immobilization&#xD;
      period, the same standardized hand therapy rehabilitation regimen will be initiated.&#xD;
