  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 2 study is to evaluate the effect and the safety of the combination&#xD;
      of Baricitinib in combination with phototherapy in adult participants with non-segmental&#xD;
      progressive vitiligo.&#xD;

      Treatment Strategy: Multicentric, parallel double blind randomized phase 2 prospective study&#xD;
      comparing baricitinib (4mg/day) + narrowband UVB TL01 versus placebo + narrowband UVB TL01&#xD;
      Follow-up of the study: patients included in this study will start Baricitinib 3 months&#xD;
      before starting narrowband UVB TL01. Phototherapy will be performed twice a week during 6&#xD;
      months. Follow-up visit will be done at week 12, 24, 36 and 48.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, non-comparative, phase II proof-of-concept trial involved patients with progressive vitiligo and uses one of the most common regimens in this phase of study. Assessment of the experimental treatment efficacy will be estimated only on the results obtained in the experimental treatment arm (baricitinib 4 mg/day + narrowband UVB TL01 arm).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>This is a double-blind study. To preserve the blinding of the study, a minimum number of sponsor personnel will see the randomization table and treatment assignments before the study is complete.&#xD;
All study assessments will be performed by study personnel who are blinded to the patient's treatment group.&#xD;
Except in clinical circumstances where unblinding is required, the patients, investigators, sponsor study team, and any personnel interacting directly with patients or investigative sites will remain blinded to baricitinib and placebo assignment until after completion of the Double-Blinded Treatment Period.</masking_description>

    <description>The VASI Score is used to assess the severity and extent of Vitilgo. VASI is calculated using a formula that includes contributions from all body regions (possible range, 0-100). The body is divided into 6 separate and mutually exclusive sites (head/neck, hands, upper extremities [excluding hands], trunk, lower extremities [excluding feet], and feet), with percentage of vitiligo involvement estimated in hand units by the same investigator throughout the study.</description>

             patient's participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have evidence of active TB or latent TB:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. have evidence of active TB, defined in this study as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Documented by a positive PPD test (≥5 mm induration between approximately 48&#xD;
                       and 72 hours after application, regardless of vaccination history), medical&#xD;
                       history, clinical features, and abnormal chest x-ray at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test or T-SPOT®.TB test (as available and if&#xD;
                       compliant with local TB guidelines) may be used instead of the PPD test.&#xD;
                       Patients are excluded from the study if the test is not negative and there&#xD;
                       is clinical evidence of active TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exception: Patients with a history of active TB who have documented evidence of appropriate&#xD;
        treatment, have no history of re-exposure since their treatment was completed, and have a&#xD;
        screening chest x-ray with no evidence of active TB may be enrolled if other entry criteria&#xD;
        are met. Such patients would not be required to undergo the protocol-specific TB testing&#xD;
        for PPD, QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test, or T-SPOT® TB test but must have a chest x-ray at&#xD;
        screening.&#xD;
