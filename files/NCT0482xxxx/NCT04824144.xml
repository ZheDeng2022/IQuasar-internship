      The goal of this multi-centre phase I/II open-label, single-arm study is to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility, optimal dose, and preliminary efficacy of dexmedetomidine to manage agitated&#xD;
      delirium among patients near the end of life followed by a palliative care provider in a&#xD;
      non-monitored setting. Fifty patients will receive dexmedetomidine (0.2 mcg/kg/hour, titrated&#xD;
      up to 0.7 mcg/kg/hour) subcutaneously. Feasibility (recruitment rate, cost), safety (rate of&#xD;
      adverse events), dosing, and preliminary efficacy (agitation, delirium severity) will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a common and challenging complication to manage at the end of life. An estimated&#xD;
      75% (range 58-88%) of patients experience delirium during a palliative inpatient admission in&#xD;
      the weeks prior to death. Delirium is classified on the basis of psychomotor activity into&#xD;
      hypoactive, hyperactive, and mixed subtypes. Agitation is a feature of both the hyperactive&#xD;
      and mixed subtypes and, when present, the episode of delirium is conventionally referred to&#xD;
      as agitated delirium. Agitated delirium is characterized by increased agitation, verbal or&#xD;
      physical aggression, and perceptual disturbance. Furthermore, these episodes can cause the&#xD;
      patient, their families, and the care team significant distress by decreasing a patient's&#xD;
      ability to communicate with loved ones and the care team. Studies of patients who recall&#xD;
      their delirium experience during an inpatient hospital admission report high levels of&#xD;
      distress, and that this distress is exacerbated by being aware of their inability to&#xD;
      communicate with family and the healthcare team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, studies demonstrate distress associated with delirium is greater among family&#xD;
      members compared to that experienced by patients. In the context of palliative care, agitated&#xD;
      delirium in the dying phase is particularly devastating for family members - the inability to&#xD;
      meaningfully communicate with a loved one during final interactions with them, and to witness&#xD;
      the visible distress that characterizes agitated delirium, can cause significant anguish.&#xD;
      Several studies demonstrate severe levels of distress among a majority of caregivers who have&#xD;
      cared for a loved one with delirium. Family members of patients with terminal delirium report&#xD;
      negative physical and psychological burden associated with delirium, including family member&#xD;
      feelings of distress, anxiety, and helplessness, exhaustion, and difficulty coping.&#xD;
      Additionally, caregiver-perceived delirium in the last 6 months of life has been found to be&#xD;
      associated with significantly increased risk - up to 12x - of symptoms of generalized anxiety&#xD;
      among family caregivers. In particular, patient symptoms characteristic of agitated delirium,&#xD;
      such as restlessness and agitation, psychotic symptoms, cognitive impairment, and&#xD;
      communication difficulties, are associated with greater levels of psychological and emotional&#xD;
      distress among family members. Bereaved family members express experiencing anger and sadness&#xD;
      that they could not have meaningful interactions with their loved one at the end of life, and&#xD;
      felt delirium robbed them prematurely of these interactions before death and hindered their&#xD;
      opportunity to say goodbye. Family members have further described this phenomenon as distress&#xD;
      related to premature loss of the caregiver-patient relationship and the loss of a familiar&#xD;
      person becoming a stranger. Family members also report distress related to decision-making&#xD;
      that balances their desire for meaningful communication at the end of life with reducing&#xD;
      patient suffering. Most commonly, this dilemma is manifested in family member decisions&#xD;
      around the use of sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agitated delirium also has a marked impact on nursing staff and their ability to assess&#xD;
      patient needs. Qualitative investigations of palliative care nurses' experiences caring for&#xD;
      patients with delirium found nurses had difficulty managing patient delirium in a way they&#xD;
      felt maintained patients' dignity and &quot;minimized chaos&quot;, and reported delirium and related&#xD;
      symptoms were highly distressing for them. Specifically, delirium-related distress&#xD;
      experienced by nurses has been shown to be significantly associated with patient delirium&#xD;
      severity and the presence and severity of perceptual disturbances. Clinical professionals&#xD;
      have also expressed negative effects of delirium on their interactions with family members,&#xD;
      with disagreements and tension arising from different understandings of patient needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited evidence to support the use of pharmacological interventions for the&#xD;
      management of delirium symptoms in palliative care patients, and no medication currently&#xD;
      approved in Canada for the indication of delirium. However, published guidelines do recognize&#xD;
      a limited role for the use of medications (such as low doses of antipsychotics and/or&#xD;
      benzodiazepines) in distressed delirious patients or if there are safety concerns. Among&#xD;
      imminently dying patients, pharmacological sedation (e.g., with midazolam, methotrimeprazine,&#xD;
      or phenobarbital) is often used to manage agitated delirium; however, use of these&#xD;
      medications to manage delirium in the dying phase is based on case series and expert opinion.&#xD;
      More broadly, clinical guidelines and systematic reviews of palliative pharmacological&#xD;
      sedation conclude that evidence for the efficacy of sedation for symptom control using these&#xD;
      medications is insufficient. Additionally, sedation to treat agitated delirium is limited in&#xD;
      that it generally eliminates patients' ability to be alert and interact with others, a&#xD;
      limitation that, as outlined above, is often contrary to patients' goals of care and the&#xD;
      well-being of family members. There is a need for alternative interventions that better align&#xD;
      with patients' goals of care and support patients, family members, and clinical staff through&#xD;
      meaningful communication at the end of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increasing number of small case series and reviews suggest dexmedetomidine may be an&#xD;
      effective and safe option for managing agitated delirium in palliative care. Dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      is a centrally active alpha-2 receptor agonist that has mild sedative and opioid co-analgesic&#xD;
      effects without suppressing respiratory drive. In most acute care hospital settings,&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine is restricted for use in the intensive care unit and by anesthesia for short&#xD;
      term sedation. Delirium treatment and prevention has commonly been studied as a secondary&#xD;
      endpoint in clinical trials of sedation for critically ill patients, largely demonstrating&#xD;
      the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine for delirium management over currently used medications&#xD;
      in palliative care, including haloperidol, midazolam, and propofol. Given dexmedetomidine is&#xD;
      currently the only agent recommended for treatment of agitated delirium in critically ill&#xD;
      patients, pilot data reports have emerged regarding its use in other settings where agitated&#xD;
      delirium is highly prevalent, namely palliative care. The largest and most recent case series&#xD;
      (n=6) of dexmedetomidine to manage agitated delirium reported improved patient agitation and&#xD;
      distress in all cases while maintaining a rousable, conscious state, providing patients the&#xD;
      opportunity to interact with others at the end of life. Similarly, additional case studies of&#xD;
      agitated delirium in palliative care (total n=4) have all reported successful resolution&#xD;
      and/or symptom control of patients' agitated delirium at the end of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to other medications commonly used to manage agitated delirium, dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      provides rousable sedation, better supporting communication needs and goals of care at the&#xD;
      end of life. Dexmedetomidine is now off-patent, reducing previous cost barriers to use. In&#xD;
      addition, while dexmedetomidine is administered intravenously in critical care, advance&#xD;
      preparation for subcutaneous administration is more conducive to use in palliative care. To&#xD;
      facilitate this, our team recently completed stability testing and demonstrated &gt;90%&#xD;
      retention of dexmedetomidine 20mcg/ml in 0.9% sodium chloride in polyvinylchloride bags after&#xD;
      9 days of storage at both room temperature (25°C ± 2°C) and refrigeration (4°C ± 2°C )&#xD;
      (accepted for publication). Furthermore, evidence demonstrates subcutaneous administration of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine results in a relative bioavailability of about 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine for the management of agitated delirium in palliative care. There are&#xD;
      currently no approved therapies for agitated delirium in palliative care, but evidence from&#xD;
      critical care, reduced medication costs, and published case series in palliative care suggest&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine may be effective to treat this challenging condition. A therapy that might&#xD;
      treat delirium without causing excess sedation, allowing patients to continue interactions&#xD;
      with their loved ones and care team, would be a &quot;game changer&quot; in palliative care. There is&#xD;
      the potential to improve end-of-life care for patients and their families in a manner that is&#xD;
      more consistent with their goals of care and provides necessary symptom management while&#xD;
      reducing the distress experienced by family and healthcare team members.&#xD;
