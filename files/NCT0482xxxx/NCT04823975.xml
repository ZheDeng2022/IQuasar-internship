      This is a test of an existing health insurance education program (HIEP) in the Utah Hispanic&#xD;
      community (aged 18-64). The study will evaluate whether the HIEP delivered by Utah Health&#xD;
      Policy Project (UHPP) staff improves participants' health insurance and cost-related&#xD;
      literacy. Participants will complete a brief baseline survey, be guided through the HIEP by&#xD;
      UHPP staff, and complete a brief survey/interview after completing the sessions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to refine and pilot test an existing health insurance education&#xD;
      program (HIEP) to improve health insurance and cost-related literacy among the Hispanic&#xD;
      community in Utah. This study will be conducted in conjunction with the Utah Health Policy&#xD;
      Project, which has long been active in the Hispanic community and has been instrumental in&#xD;
      reducing the number of uninsured adults and children in Utah. Initially, community and&#xD;
      key-informant feedback on how to best adapt this intervention to the Hispanic community,&#xD;
      including what topics are most important, and how the intervention should be delivered, will&#xD;
      be obtained. After the HIEP is adapted accordingly, it will be investigated to see if it&#xD;
      improves participants' health insurance and cost-related literacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrollment, participants will fill out a survey containing questions about their current&#xD;
      health insurance, employment, demographics, acculturation, preferred language and health&#xD;
      insurance knowledge. Participants will then receive 4 educational sessions surrounding health&#xD;
      insurance use and laws (four sessions total occurring approximately every two weeks). These&#xD;
      educational sessions will be conducted, in person, over video conference calls, or over the&#xD;
      telephone, and will cover:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overview of health insurance options and understanding of insurance and costs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learning about types of insurance coverage and how to select/access coverage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Navigating one's coverage plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Managing care costs&#xD;
&#xD;
      These sessions will be 30 minutes, with one session done each week over a four week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the HIEP participants will be given a second survey including similar&#xD;
      questions to those in the first survey. After the post survey is complete, participants will&#xD;
      also be given brief open-ended interview questions to obtain feedback on the acceptability of&#xD;
      the content and potential implementation issue areas, as well as any discordance in cultural&#xD;
      values, beliefs, or feelings about health insurance.&#xD;
