    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the usefulness of an app-based headache diary in episodic&#xD;
      migraine patients. For this the investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial with a&#xD;
      crossover design, using the app-based diary and a traditional paper-based headache diary. The&#xD;
      patients will use each diary for 13 weeks. The investigators will evaluate diary adhesion&#xD;
      after each 13-week period, and also evaluate headache burden and prophylactic medication&#xD;
      compliance at the beginning, at the crossover point, and at the end of the study, and acute&#xD;
      headache medication use through diary records. The investigators will also evaluate user&#xD;
      preference through a questionnaire at the end of the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Headache is one of the main reasons for seeking primary health care and an important cause of&#xD;
      absenteeism at work and decreased quality of life in the population, being the major&#xD;
      neurological cause of disability in young adults and middle-aged adults. Although the&#xD;
      subjectivity of the complaints and the great intra and inter-individual variability of&#xD;
      clinical presentations hinder its epidemiological study, it is estimated that the overall&#xD;
      prevalence of headache throughout life is 66% (46-78% in tension-type headache; 14-16% for&#xD;
      migraine and 0.1-0.3% for cluster headache). Migraine, in particular, is a primary headache&#xD;
      with an estimated prevalence of 11 to 14% in adult women and 4 to 9% in adult men. In&#xD;
      addition, it is assumed that up to 20% of absences from work can be attributed to headaches,&#xD;
      with the inherent socio-economic impacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Headache is a very frequent complaint in the primary care setting. However, the differential&#xD;
      diagnosis can be complicated at this level. Primary headache diagnosis is made almost&#xD;
      exclusively through clinical history taking, for this purpose clinicians use the criteria in&#xD;
      the International Classification of Headache Disorders, currently on its 3rd version.&#xD;
      However, its application is often challenging and time-consuming, especially in a primary&#xD;
      care setting, where physicians are very limited on time. Nonetheless, a correct diagnosis is&#xD;
      essential, as treatment varies among the primary headaches and also within the same headache&#xD;
      type according to its frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The episodic nature of headaches increases the risk of memory bias towards more severe or&#xD;
      more recent crises. To avoid this, patients nowadays use a paper calendar. This calendar&#xD;
      makes it possible to monitor, more reliably, the response to therapy and to identify the need&#xD;
      for any adjustments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the paper calendar has many limitations, such as the possibility of filling in&#xD;
      immediately before consultations instead of non-biased daily records. In addition, the paper&#xD;
      or card used can be lost, is more easily forgotten, and cannot be consulted remotely by the&#xD;
      attending physician. In the current digital landscape, we have seen a transition in&#xD;
      registration methods for semi-automated electronic platforms, considered more practical and&#xD;
      appealing to users. However, most in-app headache diaries are not validated and are mainly&#xD;
      written in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having these ideas in mind the investigators decided to develop an app-based electronic&#xD;
      headache diary that would not only permit a better adhesion to follow-up but also remote&#xD;
      monitoring of headache patients. To study the applicability and the usefulness of this idea&#xD;
      the investigators designed a randomized clinical trial with a crossover design where episodic&#xD;
      migraine patients would be randomized to the use of the app or of a paper headache diary.&#xD;
      Each patient would use the app and the paper diary for a period of 13 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the paper and electronic diary patients will record headache days, headache type (migraine&#xD;
      or tension-type headache), headache intensity with a scale from 0 to 10, intake of acute&#xD;
      headache medication, missing work days due to headache, and recurrence to the emergency&#xD;
      department due to headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also measure headache burden with the portuguese versions of HIT-6,&#xD;
      MSQ v2.1 and MiDAS scales and quality of life with the WHOQOL-BREF at the beginning, at the&#xD;
      crossover point, and at the end of the study. Also, the study will evaluate prophylactic&#xD;
      medication compliance at the beginning, at the crossover point, and at the end of the study&#xD;
      through a questionnaire. User preference will be measured through a questionnaire, using a&#xD;
      Likert type scale, at the end of the study.&#xD;
