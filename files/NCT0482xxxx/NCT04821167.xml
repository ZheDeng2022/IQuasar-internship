  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Undescended testes (UDTs) are a relatively common finding in pediatrics with prevalence about&#xD;
      1-2% in newborns. Upon discovering a non-intrascrotal testis, it is important to determine&#xD;
      whether the testis is palpable or non-palpable (1). A canalicular or 'emergent' testis may be&#xD;
      impalpable initially and may be appear when it is 'milked' out of the inguinal canal (where&#xD;
      it is concealed from detection) indicating that 15 to 40% of cryptorchidism are viable&#xD;
      peeping/canalicular testis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laparoscopic approach for treating canalicular undescended testes offers many advantages&#xD;
      over open inguinal orchiopexy. The laparoscopic technique maintains the integrity of the&#xD;
      inguinal canal anatomy and eliminating the need to divide the epigastric vessels during&#xD;
      dissection. The ability to dissect the testicular vessels at a higher extent would increase&#xD;
      the vessel length available to lower the testis without strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a prospective study will be conducted at Department of Pediatric Surgery, MCH&#xD;
           hospital, Bisha, Saudia Arabia and Pediatric surgery Department , Al-Azhar University&#xD;
           hospitals, Cairo, Egypt, from January 2019 to October 2020 to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
           efficiency of laparoscopic orchiopexy of intracanalicular testis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' age and laterality will be reported. Evaluation will be done for the operative&#xD;
           difficulties, intraoperative complications, operative time and early postoperative&#xD;
           complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testicular site, size and vascularity will be evaluated by ultrasonography at 6th month post&#xD;
      operatively. Also, cosmetic results will be evaluated by obtaining the parent's questioners&#xD;
      at post-operative OPD clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Laparoscopic orchiopexy for management of inguinal canalicular undescended testes is a&#xD;
      safe, effective, and less invasive, without disturbance of inguinal canal anatomy, with&#xD;
      better cosmetic results.&#xD;

      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herein, the study aims to evaluate the laparoscopic procedure for management of canalicular&#xD;
      testis regarding operative safety, efficacy and post-operative outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief review of literature:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Different management modalities for intra-canalicular (emergent) testes in male children&#xD;
           (open surgery, Laparoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advantages of laparoscopic orchiopexy for intra-canalicular (emergent) testes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study, will be conducted out at pediatric surgery tertiary centers&#xD;
      (Maternity &amp; Children's Hospital in Bisha, KSA and Al-Azhar University hospitals in Cairo,&#xD;
      Egypt) on pediatric patients presenting at the pediatric surgery OPD clinic by&#xD;
      intra-canalicular (emergent/peeping) testes in the period from January 2019 to October 2020.&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be managed by laparoscopic orchiopexy. All patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      study will give a written informed consent. The study will be approved by the Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board and ethics committee of the hospitals. The main objective is to assess safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of laparoscopic orchiopexy for intra-canalicular (emergent/peeping) testes in&#xD;
      male patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institutes of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter study at Pediatric Surgery Departments, Maternity &amp; Children's hospital in&#xD;
      Bisha, KSA and Al-Azhar University hospitals in Cairo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of cases: Sixty two male children. Time frame: period of 1.10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will be discussed and approved for clinical study by the Ethical Research&#xD;
      Committee at MCH at Bisha, KSA, and other participating hospitals. The procedures and the aim&#xD;
      of the study will be clearly explained to the patient and the family. A written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained before enrollment of the patients into the study. The family refusal&#xD;
      to give consent for laparoscopic management is respected but does not deprive the patient&#xD;
      from getting open orchiopexy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper examination done for patients using flat and frog leg position with gentile squeezing&#xD;
      of testis down, proved by preoperative inguinoscrotal ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be reviewed at the OPD clinic. Patients who could not attend the clinic will be&#xD;
      contacted by phone. Postoperative Doppler ultrasonography will be done to assess testicular&#xD;
      size and vascularity. Questionnaire will be obtained from the parents to assess their&#xD;
      cosmetic satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be performed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0. Armonk, NY: IBM&#xD;
      Corp. Data will be presented as mean, standard deviation, number &amp; percentage, using&#xD;
      Chi-squared test (X2) for qualitative data. The significance level will be set at P &gt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Discussion will focus on laparoscopic management of intra-canalicular (emergent) testes.&#xD;
      The results obtained from this study will be compared with each other and with that reported&#xD;
      in the literature. The discussion will focus on operative details, operative time, results, &amp;&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will compare results of this study with the results of others. Discussion will determine&#xD;
      the most accurate management modality for intra-canalicular (emergent) testes in male&#xD;
      children which offers the best outcome and least morbidity.&#xD;
