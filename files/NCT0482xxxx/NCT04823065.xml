    <textblock>
      This project is about exploring a novel method to detect ovarian and uterine cancers earlier&#xD;
      and better. More precisely, a high-performance radioactive estrogen analog will be used to&#xD;
      visualize hormone-sensitive uterine and ovarian tumors using PET imaging. Not only this&#xD;
      imaging methodology could improve the whole-body assessment of those diseases, but will also&#xD;
      hint clinicians about the optimal course of therapy to undertake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lead investigator's team designed in the past years an innovative radioactive estrogen&#xD;
      derivative tracer (4FMFES) for the medical imaging modality termed Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography (PET). The compound was first shown to be safe for human use. Recently, a clinical&#xD;
      trial demonstrated that 4FMFES-PET is superior to any existing comparable tracer for&#xD;
      detection of hormone-sensitive breast cancer patients. 4FMFES is particularly useful to&#xD;
      pinpoint unsuspected metastases early, which allowed better breast cancer patient management&#xD;
      and staging. 4FMFES and standard FDG PET imaging were shown to be complementary in breast&#xD;
      cancer, the use of both techniques together providing a detection rate nearing 100%. Since&#xD;
      ovarian and uterine cancers are about as likely to be targeted by 4FMFES as breast cancer,&#xD;
      the use of this novel precision imaging method will be adapted to those other indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, the sooner a cancer is diagnosed and treated, the better the outcome of a patient&#xD;
      will be. Gynecological cancers lack precise screening and detection tools. In particular,&#xD;
      while a majority of uterine cancers are relatively well managed, patients burdened with&#xD;
      metastatic burden have a much worse prognosis, and precise and early detection of those&#xD;
      lesions will greatly help clinicians to better treat those complicated cases. As for ovarian&#xD;
      cancers, they are usually devoid of clinical symptoms until late onset, which partly explain&#xD;
      the high mortality rate of this disease. Hence, for both diseases, a precision, whole-body&#xD;
      imaging technique will allow earlier assessment, followed by earlier intervention, resulting&#xD;
      in improved survival rate and better quality of life for patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knowledge of estrogen receptor (ER) status is of paramount importance for breast cancer&#xD;
      management. Mounting evidence supports an equally important role of ER status for uterine and&#xD;
      ovarian cancers. Indeed, this prognostic factor was shown to stratify survival and&#xD;
      progression-free rates, and to predict efficacy of ER-targeting adjuvant hormone therapy in&#xD;
      those cancers. Between 70 and 80% of gynecological cancers expresses ER, akin to what is&#xD;
      found in breast cancer. However, ER status is assessed by biopsy and hence is limited to&#xD;
      primary lesions and to known, accessible metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commonly used diagnostic tools for gynecological cancers includes anatomical imaging&#xD;
      modalities, such as echography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI), with an increased role for metabolic [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (FDG-PET) imaging, all yielding suboptimal tumor detection rate and poor&#xD;
      specificity. Studies explored combination of FDG-PET/CT with [18F]-16α-fluoroestradiol (FES)&#xD;
      PET/CT imaging to obtain whole-body assessment of ER status of both uterine and ovarian&#xD;
      cancers, with FDG/FES uptake ratio correlating with grade and stage of disease. However, FES&#xD;
      has many shortcomings, including rapid hepatic metabolism and binding to plasma globulins,&#xD;
      resulting in a strong blood pool and in high nonspecific uptake, both detrimental to tumor&#xD;
      detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's research center have designed a novel ER-targeting PET tracer,&#xD;
      4-fluoro-11β-methoxy-16α-[18F] fluoroestradiol (4FMFES) that addresses those flaws; 4FMFES is&#xD;
      2.5-fold more resistant to metabolism and does not bind to globulins. A phase II study&#xD;
      comparing FES with 4FMFES-PET in breast cancer patients showed significantly reduced&#xD;
      background with 4FMFES, resulting in improved tumor contrast and in an increased tumor&#xD;
      detection rate. Preliminary results showed that addition of 4FMFES-PET to the standard&#xD;
      FDG-PET allowed upstaging of ~20% of the breast cancer patients studied so far. Those breast&#xD;
      cancer derived data forebode the potential of combined FDG- and 4FMFES-PET for whole-body&#xD;
      diagnosis and ER status assessment for uterine and ovarian cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Launch a phase I/II clinical trial evaluating the use of FDG and 4FMFES PET in ER+&#xD;
      uterine and ovarian cancer patients to enhance diagnostic confidence and accuracy, and to&#xD;
      assess whole-body ER status non-invasively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Optimize imaging protocol for abdomen 4FMFES imaging: 4FMFES is eliminated by&#xD;
           hepatobiliary excretion and as such generates strong signals in the intestinal tract,&#xD;
           which could induce strong background and even false positives. Appropriate timing&#xD;
           between 4FMFES injection and scan would allow optimal tumor uptake and minimal unwanted&#xD;
           signal in the peritoneal area. Separately, pre-treatment with cholecystokinine (to&#xD;
           pre-empty the gallbladder) or with opioids (to prevent intestinal peristalsis) will be&#xD;
           explored as alternate ways of optimizing the protocol. A cohort of patients will be&#xD;
           constituted in order to explore the best strategy to undertake for the rest of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the use of combined FDG and 4FMFES-PET for diagnosis and staging of ER+ uterine&#xD;
           and ovarian cancers: Two cohorts of both uterine and ovarian cancer patients will be&#xD;
           monitored by FDG and 4FMFES-PET/CT in sequence. Tumor uptake for each tracer will be&#xD;
           compared. Number of detected lesion per patient using this protocol will be compared to&#xD;
           whatever findings CT, or FDG alone would have found, and % of upstaged patients will be&#xD;
           reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Correlate FDG and 4FMFES-PET tumor uptake with biopsy-derived grade and status: Every&#xD;
           known, accessible lesion will be biopsied, and tumor grade and receptor status will be&#xD;
           assessed. Correlation between pathological characteristics, and FDG and 4FMFES&#xD;
           PET-derived tumor uptake will be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of sensitive and accurate imaging tools for uterine and ovarian cancer means that&#xD;
      diagnosis is too often achieved at late onset of those diseases. Not only the validation of&#xD;
      4FMFES-PET combined with standard FDG-PET should yield more precise, whole-body diagnostic&#xD;
      and staging, but also could predict prognosis and targeted therapy efficacy.&#xD;
