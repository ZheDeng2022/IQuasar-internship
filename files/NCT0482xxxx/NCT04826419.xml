    <textblock>
      Functionality in patients with SSc? Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic connective tissue&#xD;
      disease characterized by microvascular involvement, immunological dysfunction, extracellular&#xD;
      matrix deposition in the skin and internal organ involvement. Vascular disease has an&#xD;
      important role in the pathogenesis of SSc. Especially as a result of involvement of&#xD;
      micro-vessel and digital arteries, digital ulcer (DU) formation may be seen. DUs are&#xD;
      responsible for pain, poor quality of life, impairment of life activities and morbidity in&#xD;
      patients with SSc. , they are correlated to disease severity and outcome. Approximately half&#xD;
      of SSc patients have DU during the course of the disease. Recurrent DU is observed in 10% of&#xD;
      the patients. In 75% of these patients, DU occurs 5 years after diagnosis. Patients with&#xD;
      anti-SCL 70+ develop DU 5 years earlier than those with anti-centromere positive. The&#xD;
      development of DU may take a long time to heal if there is underlying calcinosis. In a study,&#xD;
      it was seen that the recovery of DU was 93.6 days if there is underlying calcinosis, and 76.2&#xD;
      days if not. DUs can be infected and thus complicated by osteomyelitis. In a retrospective&#xD;
      study, it was reported that 42% of infected DUs were associated with osteomyelitis. DU&#xD;
      management is a great challenge for the clinician and requires a multidisciplinary approach.&#xD;
      Ozone has a place in medical use since the 19th century, as it is an oxidant and&#xD;
      disinfectant. In recent studies, it has been reported to be antiviral and bactericidal.&#xD;
      Therefore, it has indications such as coronary artery disease, chronic hepatitis and chronic&#xD;
      low back pain. It has also been shown to have a positive role in trophic ulcer, ischemic&#xD;
      ulcer and diabetic ulcer healing. The mechanism by which ozone therapy provides wound healing&#xD;
      is not fully understood. In addition, it improves microcirculation in the capillary vessels&#xD;
      by improving flexibility and stability of the cell membrane and limiting the aggregation and&#xD;
      adhesion of platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, it was stated in a study that ozone therapy was effective for the&#xD;
      treatment of DU in SSc patients. In our study, we aimed to investigate the effect of ozone&#xD;
      therapy on patients who are resistant to medical treatment and who have impaired quality of&#xD;
      life for a long time.&#xD;

      Material-Method 34 SSc patients who were followed up in Pamukkale University Rheumatology due&#xD;
      to DU are going to be included in the study. SSc is diagnosed and based on the American&#xD;
      College of Rheumatology/ European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) Criteria for the&#xD;
      classification of SSc. Skin thickness will be evaluated with the Modified Rodnan Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DUs will be graded according to a scale developed by Amanzi et al. In 2010. Written informed&#xD;
      consents were obtained from all patients before entry into the study, according to the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki and guidelines of the local ethics committee. The study was approved&#xD;
      by Pamukkale University ethics committee. Among the patients included in the study, those&#xD;
      with gangrenous ulcers, calcinosis-free ulcers, traumatic ulcers, vasculitis, active&#xD;
      osteomyelitis, hyperthyroidism, pregnancy, and allergies to ozone therapy will be excluded&#xD;
      from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation The demographic profile of SSc patients, therapy, scleroderma type, the&#xD;
      onset of reynoud phenomenon (RF) RF disease duration, RFI time with the number of daily&#xD;
      attacks, active and inactive digital ulcers count, ulcer size, pain, number of pitting,&#xD;
      laboratory findings, and functional scales will recorded. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA),&#xD;
      anti-centromere antibodies (ACA) and anti-topoisomerase antibodies (Scl70) will be studied&#xD;
      from laboratory findings. An indirect immunofluorescent assay, for semi quantitative&#xD;
      determination of anti-nuclear IgG antibodies (ANA) in patients' serum NOVA LITE™ IFA HEp-2&#xD;
      ANA Complete Kit was used. Antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens ACA and Scl70 are going&#xD;
      to be determined by a commercial clinical enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional parameters such as health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS) and Modified Hand Mobility in Scleroderma Test (HAMISm) will be evaluated before&#xD;
      treatment and on the 30th day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventıon Group The treatment or clinical status of the SSc patients followed up with DU&#xD;
      was reached by a blinded health professional by phone. Those who wanted to participate&#xD;
      actively in the study formed the ozone group, but those who did not want to participate due&#xD;
      to the pandemic constituted the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ozone Group The treatment session of oxygen-ozone was 80 mg/mL ozone (total volume: 60-100&#xD;
      mL) in a special bag using the ozone generator device (Humazon Promedic, German).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment group Similar demographic results and treatment protocols area with treatment group&#xD;
      consisted of SSc patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Primary outcomes Ulcer healing was our primary outcome, which was assessed depending&#xD;
      on Zhang andcolleagues ulcers grading where they graded ulcers into four levels, Grade 0 (no&#xD;
      change), Grade 1 (wound size decreased less than ½); Grade 2 (wound size decreased more than&#xD;
      ½) and Grade 3 (wound healing) (31). Ozone treatment were considered efficient if patients&#xD;
      reached grade 1 to 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes For our secondary outcomes both group were subjected to the following&#xD;
      after two weeks and four weeks of intervention: they were reassessed for number of Raynaud's&#xD;
      attacks/day, duration of Raynaud's attack, ulcer size in mm, ulcer pain was assessed by VAS&#xD;
      and functional status evaluated by HAQ and HAMISm.&#xD;
