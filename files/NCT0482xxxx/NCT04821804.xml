      A total of 24 healthy non-smoker patients requiring FGG recruited for the study. Subjects&#xD;
      were equally and randomly assigned into two groups. Test group, local application of HYADENT&#xD;
      BG on both donor and recipient sites. Control group, application of normal saline on both&#xD;
      sites as placebo. The FGG dimensions were evaluated at 1, 3- and 6-month recall using digital&#xD;
      photographs. Post-operative pain was evaluated for 14 days. Color matching and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction were evaluated at 6 months.&#xD;

      The study was approved in the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Jordan University for&#xD;
      Science and Technology and Jordanian Food and Drug Administration. This clinical trial was a&#xD;
      single-centre, parallel-group, prospective, randomized, subject-blind placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study of Hyaluronic Acid (HYADENT BG), and placebo in patients undergoing FGG who met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. The study was performed in accordance with the International Conference&#xD;
      on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice and CONSORT guidelines.For all patients included in&#xD;
      the study, phase I periodontal therapy was completed 4 weeks pre-surgically. All Patients&#xD;
      were instructed to gargle with anti-microbial chlorohexidine mouth 0.2% for one minute&#xD;
      pre-surgically to eliminate any source of infection. local anesthesia injection by 2%&#xD;
      lidocaine with 1:100 000 epinephrine was given into the depth of the vestibule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the recipient site, coronal incision was made horizontally at the level of MGJ on the&#xD;
      teeth to be treated and passing the midpoint of the adjacent teeth, at right angle 90 degree&#xD;
      to the Mesio-angle and Disto-angle to the papilla to create &quot;Butt joint&quot; margin. The&#xD;
      recipient sites had even thickness of the flap, then the flap was repositioned apically On&#xD;
      the palatal donor site, custom tinfoil template was placed over the palatal mucosa to outline&#xD;
      the dimensions of the graft according to the recipient bed. The area that chosen to harvest&#xD;
      the graft was between first premolar and first molar and located 2 mm distant from the&#xD;
      gingival margins of the corresponding teeth. After harvesting the FGG, Photograph was taken&#xD;
      immediately to measure the graft area at the baseline. Connective tissue surface was&#xD;
      carefully inspected for irregularities or adipose tissue after graft separation to minimize&#xD;
      dead space between the graft and the recipient bed and enable quick revascularization of the&#xD;
      graft. Graft thickness was immediately confirmed with a digital caliber at 5 points (four&#xD;
      corners and center of the graft) and, if necessary, the graft was prepared (thinned) while&#xD;
      holding it on sterile tongue depressor to obtain a graft approximately 1 to 1.3 mm thick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For donor site closure, in the test group, application of HYADENT BG on the donor site and&#xD;
      injection of HYADENT BG in collagen sponge that was placed over the site, then figure X&#xD;
      sutures to close the area using (4-0 polyglycolic acid/ reverse cutting/ 12 mm) resorbable&#xD;
      sutures. On the other hand, control group donor sites were washed with normal saline and&#xD;
      placing the collagen sponge that soaked in normal Saline on the donor site. For both donor&#xD;
      tested and control sites, a collagen sponge and figure X -0 resorbable sutures were placed.&#xD;
      Finally, covering the donor areas in both groups with Septo-pack gingival dressing&#xD;
      (Septodont, Saint Maur-des-fosses, France) then X suture over the pack to prevent the&#xD;
      displacement of pack (Figure 1a,b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the graft stabilization, in the study group, application of HYADENT BG on the surgical&#xD;
      site and the borders also was established. On the other hand, control group recipient bed was&#xD;
      washed with normal saline before the graft placement. Minimal and fixed number of sutures was&#xD;
      used for stabilization of the FGG as described previously by (Sullivan, 1968). 11&#xD;
      Magnification using Dental magnification loupe (3.5X- 420mm) was used to obtain the graft&#xD;
      stabilization by sutures. Graft stabilized in both groups using (6-0 polyglycolic acid/&#xD;
      reverse cutting/ 12 mm suture) with two simple interrupted sutures in the coronal portion of&#xD;
      the two Apico-coronal edges, and one suture in the mid-point of the coronal border using&#xD;
      simple interrupted method. One Periosteal Oschenbein suture (4-0 polyglycolic acid/ reverse&#xD;
      cutting/ 12 mm suture) to fix the graft on its place. In the study group, the operator&#xD;
      topically applied the HYADENT BG on the borders of the graft after stabilization. On the&#xD;
      other hand, in control group, operator topically applied normal saline on the bed before&#xD;
      stabilization of the graft as placebo. Finally, after stabilization, gentle pressure was&#xD;
      applied to the graft for five minutes in both groups to stabilize the clot under the graft&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical photographs Clinical photographs were used to measure the surface area of the graft&#xD;
      in all follow up periods, and to assess the color matching between the grafted area and the&#xD;
      adjacent tissue at the end of the final follow-up visit on 6-month period. All intra oral&#xD;
      photographs were taken with the same professional camera (Nikon D3400) with same intraoral&#xD;
      photographs setting (Aperture 32, Shutter speed 1/160, ISO 100), professional macro lens&#xD;
      (Sigma 105mm f/2.8 EX DG OS HSM Macro Lens), ring flash (Godox Macro Ring Flash ML-150) with&#xD;
      Â½ light exposure. Fixed distance between the chin of the patient and the ring flash was&#xD;
      considered to take the photograph was 30 cm. Lip retractor was used to allow uniform lighting&#xD;
      of the area, and using Michigan &quot;O&quot; periodontal probe parallel with adjacent teeth as a&#xD;
      reference (known distance between two fixed points) for measuring the graft area using the&#xD;
      digital software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative protocol The post-operative care aimed at maintaining wound stability.&#xD;
      Post-operative instructions included ceasing tooth brushing and flossing around the surgical&#xD;
      sites until the day of periodontal sutures removal (day 14). However, Patients were directed&#xD;
      to start brushing their teeth expect the experimental area (canine to canine) after one week&#xD;
      and to eat only soft foods during the first week and to avoid any mechanical or thermal&#xD;
      trauma. No antibiotics nor analgesics were prescribed. Patients were followed professionally&#xD;
      by the same periodontist (S.K), scheduled to be seen on month 1, 3, and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters Visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the pain for two weeks&#xD;
      postsurgical period. A two separates 10 cm VAS with 'no pain' at the left and 'unbearable&#xD;
      pain' at the right end as verbal end points. Two forms for each day, one for the recipient&#xD;
      site and one for the donor site. Forms were given to subjects after completion of the&#xD;
      operation and they asked to mark the pain value they feel at the end of each day. Forms were&#xD;
      collected on the day of suture removal (day 14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The color matching between the graft and the adjacent tissue was determined and compared by&#xD;
      using professional evaluation at the end of the final post-operative follow up visit (6&#xD;
      months). Two blinded examiners through Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Actually, VAS is a scale&#xD;
      for measurement of subjective features, which are difficult to measure. The test and control&#xD;
      areas were assessed for color matching of the grafted tissue with the adjacent keratinized&#xD;
      gingiva between canines area. The results were esthetically graded in three groups of Poor&#xD;
      [1-3], Moderate [4-6] and Good [7-9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's Satisfaction was measured by scale from 0 to 10 was filled by each patient where 0&#xD;
      is not satisfied, Little satisfied [1-3], Average satisfied [4-6] and highly satisfied [7-10]&#xD;
      is fully satisfied by the outcome, this reading was recorded only at the end of the study 6&#xD;
      months post-surgically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      graft area measurement was performed with Java-based analyse programme (ImageJ, National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). For evaluation of the graft area, graft&#xD;
      borders were drawn after inserting the known distance between two fixed points on periodontal&#xD;
      probe (10 mm) by the number of pixels between these two points. All evaluations were repeated&#xD;
      twice, and the average value of these two measurements was calculated at 1-, 3-, and 6- month&#xD;
      follow-ups.&#xD;
