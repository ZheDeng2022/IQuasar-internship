    <measure>Change From Baseline in Urticaria Activity Score Over 7 Days (UAS7) at Week 8.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The UAS7 is the sum of the Hives Severity Score Over 7 Days (HSS7) and Itch Severity Score Over 7 Days (ISS7). The possible range of the UAS7 is 0 to 42. A well-controlled urticaria response is defined as a UAS7 ≤ 6. Higher scores indicate high disease activity in hives and itch.&#xD;
Hives Severity Score (HSS) is defined as the number of hives recorded twice daily by the participant on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). HSS7 is derived by adding together the daily average scores over a consecutive 7-day period.&#xD;
The severity of itch will be recorded twice daily by the participant using a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). ISS7 is derived by adding together the daily average scores over a consecutive 7-day period.</description>

    <description>Hives Severity Score (HSS) is defined as the number of hives recorded twice daily by the participant on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). HSS7 is derived by adding together the daily average scores over a consecutive 7-day period. The range of weekly scores is 0 to 21. Higher scores indicate increase severity in hives.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Angioedema Activity Score Over 7 Days (AAS7) at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Angioedema Activity Score (AAS) assesses the occurrence of episodes of angioedema. The AAS will be recorded by the participant once daily. A weekly score (AAS7) is derived by adding together the daily scores over a consecutive 7-day period. The range of weekly scores is 0 to 105, with a higher score corresponding to greater severity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-Q2oL) Measurement at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CU-Q2oL is a 23-item questionnaire. Domains in the questionnaire include urticaria- and angioedema-specific symptoms, discomfort, sleep, mood and activities of daily living. Each response is scored from 1 (no symptoms) to 5 (severe symptoms). Individual responses are summed to produce the overall CU-Q2oL score, which is then converted to a 0 to 100-point scale. A higher score indicates greater impairment in quality of life.</description>
