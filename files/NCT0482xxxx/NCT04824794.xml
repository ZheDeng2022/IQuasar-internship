  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is an open-label, safety trial of GEN3014 (HexaBody®-CD38). The trial consists of&#xD;
      two parts: a dose escalation part phase 1, first-in-human (FIH), and an expansion part phase&#xD;
      2a.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the escalation part of the trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), as well as to establish the safety profile of&#xD;
      GEN3014 (HexaBody®-CD38) in Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma and Other Hematologic&#xD;
      Malignancies&#xD;
