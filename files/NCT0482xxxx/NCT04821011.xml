  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prematurity birth lead to an early breaking link with the in utero environment. A special&#xD;
      attention is brought in the neonatal intensive care units to reduce noise and lighting&#xD;
      surrounding aiming to protect the newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the uterine life fetus benefits previously of several auditory stimulations by the&#xD;
      maternal voice, the mother's heartbeat. After birth the auditory environment is dramatically&#xD;
      modified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study is to submit to the newborn an audio recording of his mother's heart beat&#xD;
      to analyze the comfort, stress and autonomic response. Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis&#xD;
      is a non-invasive tool able to consider autonomic nervous system activity. Previous studies&#xD;
      have shown that pleasant feelings are associated with an increase of high frequencies&#xD;
      variations index (HFnu index) reflecting a prevalence of parasympathetic activity in the&#xD;
      sympathetic-parasympathetic balance. This one can be simply assess by a monitor named NIPΣ&#xD;
      and can provide a comfort index by quantifying the parasympathetic tone.&#xD;
