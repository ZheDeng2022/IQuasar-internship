  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is identified as one of the most important modifiable risk factors for&#xD;
      chronic diseases, functional loss and disability and reliable assessment tools of physical&#xD;
      activity are crucial in both research and clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, physical activity and sedentary behavior have been primarily assessed with&#xD;
      questionnaires. Recently, accelerometers have been widely used to measure physical activity,&#xD;
      sedentary behavior and sleep patterns in ageing. Still, the diversity of brands and models,&#xD;
      various assessment protocols (e.g. anatomic locations, sampling frequency), data processing&#xD;
      and outcome measures have posed challenges to the interpretation and comparability of results&#xD;
      across studies. Therefore, despite some limitations, questionnaires are still considered an&#xD;
      important assessment method, especially in large-scale studies. In order to bridge the&#xD;
      differences in the interpretation of data from questionnaires to accelerometers among older&#xD;
      adults, there is a need to validate existing physical activity and sedentary behavior&#xD;
      questionnaires with energy expenditure in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Energy expenditure has been used to &quot;translate&quot; accelerometer output into physiological&#xD;
      outcomes. Nevertheless, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) limited calibration&#xD;
      studies focusing on older adults; (2) resting metabolic rate and maximum physiological&#xD;
      capacity typically decrease with aging, which makes daily activities &quot;more intense&quot; for an&#xD;
      older person compared to a younger person; and (3) the same accelerometer metric measured at&#xD;
      different body positions may be linked to completely different physiological outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such diverse physiological impact according to the anatomical placement of accelerometers&#xD;
      requires a rigorous harmonization of metrics from the accelerometers with energy expenditure&#xD;
      during representative activities at different intensities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this methodological study focusing on 80+ year-olds are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. develop cut-points from accelerometers at different anatomical positions for different&#xD;
           intensities of physical activity based on energy expenditure during semi-standardized&#xD;
           daily tasks in the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. validate accelerometer at different anatomical positions against energy expenditure&#xD;
           measured by double-labelled water (DLW) in free-living conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. validate existing physical activity and sedentary behavior questionnaires against DLW in&#xD;
           free-living conditions.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical inactivity has been estimated to cause 5.3 million deaths per year globally and is&#xD;
      identified as one of the most important modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases,&#xD;
      functional loss and disability. To correctly identify and study physical inactivity in old&#xD;
      age, reliable assessment tools are crucial in both research and clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent technological advancements in wearable activity monitors have led to a growing number&#xD;
      of large, population-based studies using accelerometers to measure physical activity,&#xD;
      sedentary behavior (in terms of overall volume, intensity and pattern), and sleep among older&#xD;
      adults. However, the wide use of accelerometers also brings challenges when comparing the&#xD;
      results across different studies that use different brands and models, various assessment&#xD;
      protocols (e.g. anatomic locations, sampling frequency), data processing procedures and&#xD;
      report different outcomes. Different accelerometer set-ups (i.e. brand, model, body position,&#xD;
      initialization protocol, etc.) may challenge the interpretation of health-enhancing effect of&#xD;
      physical activity and detrimental effect of sedentary behavior simply because of&#xD;
      methodological issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accelerometers measure acceleration, defined as the change in velocity over time (Δv/t),&#xD;
      which quantifies the volume and intensity of movement. In addition, acceleration is a vector&#xD;
      quantity with components of magnitude and direction, which can be used to identify the&#xD;
      position of accelerometer in relation to gravity. Therefore, accelerometer could also be used&#xD;
      to distinguish posture (e.g. sitting, standing, lying down) depending on the site of&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since raw acceleration signals are difficult to interpret, they are typically &quot;translated&quot; by&#xD;
      calibration studies to physiological outcomes (e.g. energy expenditure, oxygen consumption)&#xD;
      or behavioral categories (e.g. sitting, walking, running). Through regression modelling,&#xD;
      calibration studies often produce point estimates of energy expenditure from accelerometer&#xD;
      counts or establish a range of accelerometer counts for different physical activity intensity&#xD;
      levels. This range of accelerometer counts is referred to as &quot;cut-points&quot; for different&#xD;
      intensities of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the use of accelerometers, physical activity and sedentary behavior has been primarily&#xD;
      assessed with questionnaires. Even as the scale of accelerometer studies are growing rapidly,&#xD;
      questionnaires are still considered an important assessment method when assessing physical&#xD;
      activity and sedentary behavior in large-scale studies. Some accelerometers and&#xD;
      questionnaires have been validated by objectively measured energy expenditure. But for&#xD;
      physical activity questionnaires, the validity against objective methods (e.g. accelerometry,&#xD;
      heart rate monitor and double-labelled water) were found to be moderate at best and very few&#xD;
      validation studies focused on older adults. In order to bridge and interpret data from&#xD;
      questionnaires to accelerometers among older adults, there is a need to validate existing&#xD;
      physical activity and sedentary behavior questionnaires with energy expenditure in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Energy expenditure has earlier been used to validate accelerometers and physical activity&#xD;
      questionnaires metrics. Nevertheless, several issues remain unsolved: (1) despite the&#xD;
      correlation between these methods has been reported to be high in few studies, the agreement&#xD;
      is generally low especially in populations with altered metabolic states such as obese and&#xD;
      overweight individuals; (2) while the total volume of physical activity is a clear metric&#xD;
      which is presumably positively correlated with total daily energy expenditure, intensity of&#xD;
      physical activity in older adults may be affected by a number of physiological determinants&#xD;
      such as cardiovascular and neuromuscular function, inflammation status and malnutrition.&#xD;
      Resting metabolic rate (RMR) and maximum physiological capacity (e.g. maximum oxygen update&#xD;
      (VO2 max) typically decrease with age, which may be particular important as the same daily&#xD;
      activities would likely be &quot;more intense&quot; to an older person compared to a younger person;&#xD;
      (3) despite that numerous activity monitors provide similar metrics (e.g. counts/minutes),&#xD;
      the physiological implication can be highly different depending on what such metrics stand&#xD;
      for. For example, despite the output from accelerometers placed on wrist and on the hip may&#xD;
      be identical (counts/minutes), the different magnitude of acceleration may have a completely&#xD;
      different physiological relationship when assessed by physiological metrics (e.g. energy,&#xD;
      oxygen uptake). Such diverse physiological impact according to the anatomical placement of&#xD;
      accelerometers requires a rigorous harmonization of metrics from the accelerometers coupled&#xD;
      with energy expenditure in representative activities at different intensities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, validation studies with accelerometers worn on multiple body positions are scarce&#xD;
      and not all studies uses energy expenditure as the reference. One way to disentangle the&#xD;
      physiological meaning of physical activity and sedentary behavior is to anchor accelerometer&#xD;
      output to objective measurements of physiological capacity such as VO2 max, oxygen uptake&#xD;
      during semi-standardized activities performed at self-selected pace and overall energy&#xD;
      expenditure during free-living conditions collected over a representative period of time.&#xD;
      This will contribute to a deeper understanding and accurate interpretation of the&#xD;
      accelerometer data among community-dwelling older adults and to provide more specific&#xD;
      accelerometry-based recommendations for physical activity, especially for the oldest&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this methodological study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. develop hip-, wrist-, thigh-, and low back- worn accelerometer cut-points for different&#xD;
           intensities of physical activity based on energy expenditure during semi-standardized&#xD;
           daily tasks for the 80+ year-olds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. validate accelerometry at the wrist, hip, thigh, and low back for estimating energy&#xD;
           expenditure in free-living conditions, measured by the gold standard of energy&#xD;
           expenditure, double-labelled water (DLW).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. validate existing physical activity and sedentary behavior questionnaires against gold&#xD;
           standard of energy expenditure (DLW) in free-living conditions in the 80+ year-olds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and data collection procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a cross-sectional study with two modes of data collection: 1)&#xD;
      in the laboratory; and 2) in the field. Participants will be recruited through two pathways:&#xD;
      1)(Pathway A) invited personally during the routine preventive home-visits performed by the&#xD;
      Municipality of Odense ; (Pathway B)or 2) invited through a letter to community-dwelling&#xD;
      older citizens who lives in the Municipality of Odense. Those who show interest to&#xD;
      participate will then receive detailed written information about the project and will be&#xD;
      invited to a medical screening after signing an informed consent. The entire testing&#xD;
      procedure will span across 14 days as urine samples for DLW method is needed on Day 1 and Day&#xD;
      14. In between, participants will be invited to attend one for lab test for measuring energy&#xD;
      expenditure during semi-standardized functional tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations and data management A detailed data management plan will be&#xD;
      followed in the collection, entering, and analysis of data. In the laboratory examination&#xD;
      day, all measurement devices will be synchronized before the measurement begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Assuming that different accelerometers can capture same physical activity&#xD;
      behaviour, in a test for agreement between two raters using the Kappa statistic, a sample&#xD;
      size of 95 subjects achieves 80% power to detect a true Kappa value of 0.70 when there are 3&#xD;
      categories with frequencies equal to 0.01, 0.20, and 0.79. (representing estimated percentage&#xD;
      of time spent in moderate-to-vigorous activity, light activity, and sedentary behavior in&#xD;
      this population). This power calculation is based on an alpha of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creation of a research biobank&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research biobank (blood, urine, and saliva samples) will be created for the described&#xD;
      project. The blood samples will be destroyed no later than 5 years after the project is&#xD;
      ending. Blood samples will be taking at the facilities of the University (SDU). An authorized&#xD;
      nurse or biomedical laboratory scientist will be in charge of obtaining blood samples from&#xD;
      the participants. The biobank will be stored at SDU. In total, 8 urine samples will be&#xD;
      obtained from each participant during the entire project period. Urine samples will be frozen&#xD;
      and sent to USA for analysis. The urine samples will be anonymized and stored in the research&#xD;
      biobank until the end of the project, when the samples will be destroyed. A trained project&#xD;
      personnel will be in charge of collecting urine samples from the subjects. In this protocol,&#xD;
      University of Southern Denmark acts as the controller of the biological materials collected&#xD;
      (urine samples). Data processing agreements will be made between SDU and the University of&#xD;
      Wisconsin, USA; and between SDU and University of California, Berkeley. The US processor&#xD;
      shall comply with Danish law governing protection of personal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research activities of this study will be carried out in accordance with the Declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki. All subjects will receive the pamphlets from The National Committee on Health&#xD;
      Research Ethics regarding personal rights when participating in a health research project and&#xD;
      aspects to consider before deciding to participate. This study will involve older adults, who&#xD;
      are considered vulnerable individuals. It is important to acknowledge and respect&#xD;
      participants' autonomy, i.e., they have to be able to decide by themselves their&#xD;
      participation in the study with the right to withdraw at any stage. Moreover, a communication&#xD;
      strategy suitable for this population will be applied to prevent any risk of enhancing&#xD;
      vulnerability and stigmatization of the older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will generate valuable and novel knowledge about how do objectively measure&#xD;
      physical activity measured by different accelerometers on the same individual correlate with&#xD;
      energy expenditure among in +80-year-old community-dwelling citizens; and whether these&#xD;
      patterns differ according to protein level. These knowledges that can be used to optimize and&#xD;
      target the preventive and treatment strategies for malnourished older adults hence offer a&#xD;
      benefit for the individual older adult and for the health care sector. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigators believe that the benefits from the study is greater than the limited&#xD;
      discomforts that may follow participation. Subjects are covered by the Danish Patient&#xD;
      Insurance Association and can thus receive insurance of financial compensation in case any&#xD;
      damage occurs while participating in the research project. This information will be given to&#xD;
      participants both verbally and written (in the pamphlets from The National Committee on&#xD;
      Health Research Ethics) during recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All personal data will become anonymized and handled with full confidentiality in compliance&#xD;
      with the Personal Data Processing Act. The procedure of personal data processing will be&#xD;
      reported to the Danish Data Protection Agency in University of Southern Denmark. In this&#xD;
      study protocol, only the anonymized urine and saliva samples will be sent abroad for analysis&#xD;
      (details described earlier) with no linkage to any other personal data (e.g. CPR number,&#xD;
      address, telephone number etc..).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not receive any compensation for their participation in the study.&#xD;
