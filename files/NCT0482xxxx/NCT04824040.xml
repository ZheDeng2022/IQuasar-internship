&#xD;
        -  To assess average blood cytokine levels in subjects with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy&#xD;
           (type R2) in various regions of the Russian Federation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess average blood cytokine levels in healthy subjects from various regions of the&#xD;
           RF;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze the relationship between blood cytokine levels and the presence of a mutation&#xD;
           in the dysferlin gene;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the expression (immunohistochemistry and western-blotting) and distribution of&#xD;
           dysferlin in impaired muscles of subjects with LGMDR2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study includes the stages as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subject enrollment - 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
