        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject must meet all of the following applicable inclusion criteria to participate in this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health&#xD;
             information must be obtained either from the subject or their representative. See&#xD;
             3.1.12. NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or obtained&#xD;
             separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically proven locally advanced, metastatic, or unresectable hepatocellular&#xD;
             carcinoma that has not received prior systemic therapy. Note: if no prior histologic&#xD;
             diagnosis exists, fresh biopsy will be requested if it is both safe and feasible. If&#xD;
             fresh biopsy is not safe and feasible, imaging criteria may be used for diagnosis as&#xD;
             per AASLD criteria in cirrhotic patients (please see www.aasld.org for up to date&#xD;
             guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child Pugh Class B7 liver dysfunction or cirrhosis (please see Appendix 3). Note:&#xD;
             patients with clinically meaningful ascites or encephalopathy are ineligible (please&#xD;
             see protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 1 untreated measurable lesion according to RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to undergo fresh tumor biopsy at baseline if safe and feasible. Note:&#xD;
             archival tissue may be used at baseline provided histologic diagnosis was made and&#xD;
             sufficient tissue is available for NGS analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NGS analysis must be requested from archival tissue or fresh biopsy (if applicable) as&#xD;
             per standard of care. Foundation One CDX is the preferred platform. Prior NGS&#xD;
             sequencing results (including from another platform) will be accepted if both&#xD;
             histologic diagnosis and NGS sequencing were previously obtained (please see&#xD;
             protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrate adequate bone marrow and organ function as defined in the table in the&#xD;
             protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per&#xD;
             year during the treatment period and for at least 5 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             atezolizumab, or 6 months after the last dose of bevacizumab. See also the protocol&#xD;
             for definition of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;
             effective contraceptive measures. Men with female partners of childbearing potential&#xD;
             must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that&#xD;
             together result in a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for&#xD;
             6 months after the last dose of bevacizumab. With pregnant female partners, men must&#xD;
             remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 6 months after&#xD;
             the last dose of bevacizumab to avoid exposing the embryo. See also the protocol for&#xD;
             additional information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the subject&#xD;
             to understand a written informed consent document, and ability and willingness to&#xD;

               -  A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No requirement for concurrent concurrent antibiotics or antifungal agents for the&#xD;
                  prevention of opportunistic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A CD4 count above 250 cells/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  An undetectable HIV viral load on standard PCR-based testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness (e.g., including but not limited to&#xD;
             uncontrolled HTN [systolic BP ≥ 150, diastolic BP ≥ 100 despite optimal medical&#xD;
             management or history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy],&#xD;
             symptomatic congestive heart failure [CHF], uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or other&#xD;
             within 3 months prior to start of study treatment or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations or other conditions that would limit compliance with study requirements or&#xD;
             substantially increase risk of incurring AEs in the opinion of the treating&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known concurrent malignancy that is expected to require active treatment&#xD;
             within two years or may interfere with the interpretation of the efficacy and safety&#xD;
             outcomes of this study in the opinion of the treating investigator. Note: Superficial&#xD;
             bladder cancer, nonmelanoma skin cancers, and low-grade prostate cancer not requiring&#xD;
             cytotoxic therapy should not exclude participation in this trial. Patients with CLL&#xD;
             may be enrolled if they do not require active chemotherapy and their hematologic,&#xD;
             renal and hepatic function meets criteria previously mentioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical&#xD;
             laboratory finding that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect&#xD;
             the interpretation of the results, or may render the patient at high risk from&#xD;
             treatment complications in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies&#xD;
             or fusion proteins or know hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or&#xD;
             to any component of the atezolizumab or bevacizumab infusion.&#xD;
