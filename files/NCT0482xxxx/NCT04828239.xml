  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) results from the entrapment neuropathy of median nerve at the&#xD;
      wrist, and most cases are idiopathic. So far, there are many treatments were developed&#xD;
      (Surgical decompression, local injection of steroids, Wrist splints) but they are not fully&#xD;
      satisfactory, other treatment modalities need to be further evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both Acupuncture and laser acupuncture treatments for CTS have been reported. However, those&#xD;
      studies still lack associated evidence to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture and laser&#xD;
      acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The object of the study is to investigate the efficacy of acupuncture compared with laser&#xD;
      acupuncture in patients with mild-to-moderate carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Nerve conduction&#xD;
      studies (NCS) and global symptom score (GSS) assessment will apply to measure objective&#xD;
      changes in this randomized, controlled study.&#xD;

      Both manual acupuncture and laser acupuncture treatments for CTS have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser acupuncture (LA) is defined as the stimulation of traditional acupuncture points by&#xD;
      using low-level intensity. Its a noninvasive treatment than acupuncture for those patients&#xD;
      had the potential risk for infection or people involving pain or fear of needles. So far,&#xD;
      previous studies still lack associated evidence about comparisons between laser acupuncture&#xD;
      and manual acupuncture to evaluate their efficacy. So the investigators would like to compare&#xD;
      the efficacy of acupuncture treatment with laser acupuncture (LA) treatment in patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic, mild-to-moderate carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        CTS diagnosis was based on the presence of at least one of the following symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. numbness, tingling pain, or paresthesia in the median nerve distribution&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. precipitation of these symptoms by repetitive hand activities, which could be relieved&#xD;
             by resting, rubbing, and shaking the hand&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. nocturnal awakening by such sensory symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The diagnosis was often supported by a positive Tinel sign Confirmed by the presence&#xD;
             of one or more of the following standard electrophysiologic criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        (1) prolonged distal motor latency (DML) to the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) (abnormal&#xD;
        Z4.7 ms, stimulation over the wrist, 8 cm proximal to the active electrode) (2) prolonged&#xD;
        antidromic distal sensory latency (DSL) to the second digit (abnormal Z3.1 ms;stimulation&#xD;
        over the wrist, 14 cm proximal to the active electrode) (3) prolonged antidromic wrist-palm&#xD;
        sensory nerve conduction velocity (W-P SNCV) at a distance of 8 cm (W-P SNCV, abnormal &lt;45&#xD;
        m/s).9-&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Symptoms occurring less than 3 months before the study (to exclude patients who might&#xD;
             have spontaneous resolution of symptoms)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. severe CTS that had progressed to visible muscle atrophy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. clinical or electrophysiologic evidence of accompanying conditions that could mimic&#xD;
             CTS or interfere with its evaluation, such as cervical radiculopathy, proximal median&#xD;
             neuropathy, or significant polyneuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. evidence of obvious underlying etiologic factors of CTS such as diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
             rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism (acromegaly), pregnancy, alcohol abuse or drug&#xD;
             usage (steroids or drugs acting through the central nervous system), and suspected&#xD;
             malignancy or inflammation or autoimmune disease documented as underlying causes of&#xD;
             CTS&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. cognitive impairment interfering with the subject's ability to follow instructions and&#xD;
             describe symptoms&#xD;
