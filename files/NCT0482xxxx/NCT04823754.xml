  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      atients with cancer face difficult choices that require balancing competing priorities such&#xD;
      as survival, functional capacity and symptom relief. Most patients with advanced cancer&#xD;
      (&gt;80%) expect their sensitive discussions with physicians about prognosis and treatment&#xD;
      choices, in order to be involved in the decision making process. Nevertheless, this kind of&#xD;
      discussion is frequently lacking. Consequently, patients often have a biased view of their&#xD;
      own prognosis such as an underestimation of disease severity, or unrealistic expectations for&#xD;
      cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may be treated with systemic therapies&#xD;
      which may prolong survival, but are not curative. Patients with advanced HCC often report&#xD;
      expectations for survival and treatment-related side-effects that differ from their treating&#xD;
      physician. Accordingly, communication on prognostic and treatment choices is essential to&#xD;
      obtain an accurate understanding of the disease that allows patients to make informed&#xD;
      decisions. To the best of our knowledge, a thorough evaluation of the physician-patient&#xD;
      communication quality has never been performed in advanced HCC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study, is to assess the perception of the expected prognosis, the treatment&#xD;
      side-effects; by the patient and by his investigator during the first consultation before the&#xD;
      initiation&#xD;
