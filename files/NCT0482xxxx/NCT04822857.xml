      Introduction: The average age of menopause in the Polish population is around 50 years. After&#xD;
      the occurrence of the last menstruation in the woman's body there are series of hormonal&#xD;
      changes that may result in the emergence of new diseases, i.e. osteoporosis or ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease. Hypertension is the most important cardiovascular risk factor affecting morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality due to cardiovascular disease. It is estimated that there are as many as 34% of&#xD;
      adult Poles. The incidence of hypertension increases with age in both women and men, and&#xD;
      significantly greater increases are observed in perimenopausal women. An equally important&#xD;
      and growing health and economic problem in Poland is heart failure. It is estimated that up&#xD;
      to 700,000 patients in our country are struggling with this disease, and the proportion of&#xD;
      women in this group is constantly growing. This is the third reason for the death of women in&#xD;
      Poland, causing more deaths than cancer. The influence of menopause on the occurrence of&#xD;
      heart failure in a group of women with controlled hypertension remains unclear and is the&#xD;
      subject of ongoing research. Similarly, there is still no convincing data on the increased&#xD;
      risk of organ complications of arterial hypertension in the group of postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the effect of menopause on myocardial function indexes,&#xD;
      haemodynamic parameters and body mass composition in women aged&gt; 40 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material: about 100 women hospitalized in the Department of Cardiology and Congenital Heart&#xD;
      Diseases of Adults &gt; 40 years of age will be enrolled in the study. with controlled&#xD;
      hypertension. The population will be divided into two groups: I: 50 women before the onset of&#xD;
      menopause and II group: 50 women â‰¥ 1 year after the onset of menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Basic laboratory tests and concentrations of ADMA, NT-proBNP, neprilysin, estradiol&#xD;
      and FSH will be performed in patients. The other planned examinations are: full clinical&#xD;
      examination with BMI assessment, resting ECG test, full echocardiography using tissue&#xD;
      doppler, volume and function of the left atrium and vascular stiffness index assessed using&#xD;
      the sphygmocor device. In addition, it is planned to analyze the composition of body mass&#xD;
      using electrical bioimpedance, intima-media complex measurement and spiroergometric study.&#xD;
      One year after the inclusion in the study, a telephone interview will be carried out with the&#xD;
      patients, with particular attention to the diagnosed diseases / onset of intervention: heart&#xD;
      failure, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, the need for coronary angiography or&#xD;
      rehospitalisation. The collected data will be statistically processed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New values: Studies carried out as part of this work will supplement the current knowledge on&#xD;
      the impact of menopause in the population of women with hypertension on the risk of heart&#xD;
      failure and complications of organ hypertension. Thanks to the observed relationships, it&#xD;
      will be possible to early start the appropriate diagnostic procedure, the selection of&#xD;
      personalized treatment and the development of a model of cardiac care for women in the&#xD;
      perimenopausal period, and thus improve quality and extend their life.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The average age of menopause in the Polish population is around 50 years. After the last&#xD;
      menstruation a number of hormonal changes occur in the female body: estrogen, ovarian&#xD;
      androgens (testosterone, androstenedione) and adrenal ones (DHEA, DHEAS), progesterone,&#xD;
      growth hormone and insulin-like growth factors decrease. The concentration of gonadotropins&#xD;
      gradually increases. These hormonal changes may result in the appearance of osteoporosis,&#xD;
      climacteric syndrome, depression, changes in the structure of the skin or stress urinary&#xD;
      incontinence in women. It has been documented that the risk of ischemic heart disease&#xD;
      increases significantly after the onset of menopause which is reflected in the lowering of&#xD;
      estrogen levels. These hormones are responsible for changes both in the lipid profile and in&#xD;
      the vascular wall which significantly increases the likelihood of atherosclerotic plaque&#xD;
      formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension is the most important cardiovascular risk factor affecting morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality due to cardiovascular disease. It is estimated that there are as many as 34% of&#xD;
      adult Poles. The incidence of hypertension increases with age in both women and men and&#xD;
      significantly greater increases are observed in perimenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An equally important and growing health and economic problem in Poland is heart failure. It&#xD;
      is estimated that up to 700,000 patients in our country are struggling with this disease and&#xD;
      the proportion of women in this group is constantly growing. This is the third reason for the&#xD;
      death of women in Poland causing more deaths than cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of menopause on the occurrence of heart failure in a group of women with&#xD;
      controlled hypertension remains unclear and is the subject of ongoing research. Similarly,&#xD;
      there is still no convincing data on the increased risk of organ complications of arterial&#xD;
      hypertension in the group of postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research carried out as part of this work will supplement the current knowledge on the impact&#xD;
      of menopause in the population of women with hypertension on the risk of heart failure and&#xD;
      complications of organ hypertension. Thanks to the observed relationships, it will be&#xD;
      possible to early start the appropriate diagnostic procedure, the selection of personalized&#xD;
      treatment and the development of a model of cardiac care for women in the perimenopausal&#xD;
      period and thus, improve quality and extend their life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: assessment of the influence of menopause on the ratios of myocardial&#xD;
      efficiency, hemodynamic parameters and body composition in women aged &gt; 40 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the influence of menopause on the body weight of the subjects assessed by the electrical&#xD;
           bioimpedance method (BIA - BioelectricalImpedance Analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  influence of menopause on early echocardiographic indices of heart failure and exercise&#xD;
           capacity assessed objectively in spiroergometric study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  influence of menopause on endothelial function and central pressure assessed with the&#xD;
           sphygmocor device (Atcor, Australia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  influence of menopause on the concentration of biomarkers: asymmetric dimethylarginine&#xD;
           (ADMA), NT-proBNP and neprilysin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  influence of menopause on the thickness of the intima-media complex&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject and physical examination (BMI, waist measurement) and analysis of medical&#xD;
           records&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting 12-lead electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transthoracic Echocardiography: a study will be performed on all patients using the GE&#xD;
           Vivid E95 device according to current guidelines. The measurements of heart cavities,&#xD;
           left ventricular volume and left ventricle ejection fraction calculated on the basis of&#xD;
           Simpson's two-plane method will be evaluated. The mass of the left ventricle will be&#xD;
           calculated using the Devereux formula. Evaluation of the left atrium with volume&#xD;
           measurement will be performed. In addition, the assessment of cardiac output, mitral&#xD;
           inflow with evaluation of the isovolumetric diastole time, speed of fast filling wave E,&#xD;
           inflow wave velocity associated with left atrial contraction A, E / A ratio, rapid wave&#xD;
           filling deceleration (E) of the mitral inflow, left atrial inflow with assessment of the&#xD;
           maximal retrograde flow velocity in the lung veins, myocardial velocity in the study&#xD;
           tissue Doppler technique with evaluation of the mitral ring velocity in the early stage&#xD;
           of diastole E 'and late phase diastole A', systolic speed of the mitral annulus S ', E'&#xD;
           / A 'ratio, E / E ratio and measurements of regional myocardial strain including global&#xD;
           peak indices early and late diastolic deformities as well as echocardiographic vascular&#xD;
           stiffness indexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biomarker Concentrations: blood taken from a vein by a vacuum (butterfly) system will be&#xD;
           collected 10 ml of blood for the determination of selected biomarkers. Blood for the&#xD;
           determination of biomarker concentration will be taken after inclusion into the study&#xD;
           (the serum for determinations will be stored at -70 Â° C and the assays will be performed&#xD;
           using dedicated enzyme immunoassays after the first thawing of the samples, after&#xD;
           collecting the entire pool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition analysis using electrical bioimpedance (BIA). It is a method of&#xD;
           analyzing fat, muscle and bones with the use of electricity. Particular tissues of the&#xD;
           body contain a diversified amount of water, and therefore differ in the degree of&#xD;
           electrical conduction. During the test, the amount of muscle, fat, visceral (abdominal)&#xD;
           tissue, total water content in the body, bone mass, daily energy demand, metabolic age&#xD;
           and, of course, body weight are measured. Methodology: the patient stands on a scale&#xD;
           that contains electrodes. Then he sends weak current pulses to the organism (intensity&#xD;
           0.8-1mA, which is virtually imperceptible by human). The impedance or resistance of the&#xD;
           body's tissues to the current is measured. A special computer program analyzes the&#xD;
           individual bioelectrical impedance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-invasive assessment of haemodynamic parameters using the sphygmocor device (Atcor,&#xD;
           Australia) with the assessment of vascular stiffness parameters such as: PWV (Pulse Wave&#xD;
           Velocity), PWA (Pulse Wave Analysis), Alx (augmentation index) and central pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of the intima-media complex All patients will be tested using the GE Vivid&#xD;
           E95 device&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A spirometric stress test with the MetaLyzer 3B device is used to assess physical&#xD;
           performance which translates into a clinical assessment of the patient's condition. The&#xD;
           exercise test is carried out on a treadmill or a cycloergometer. During the effort, the&#xD;
           respiratory gases are measured. One of the most important parameters being evaluated is&#xD;
           the maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max). While in patients with cardiac diseases due to&#xD;
           the difficulty in achieving their VO2max, the peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) is&#xD;
           usually assessed. Other parameters assessed are: oxygen consumption (VO2), elimination&#xD;
           of carbon dioxide (VCO2), oxygen consumption at the anaerobic threshold (VO2AT) and&#xD;
           ventilation volume (VE). A spirometric stress test allows you to set an anaerobic&#xD;
           threshold (AT). This is the intensity of the effort at which energy begins to be&#xD;
           delivered as a result of anaerobic transitions. The anaerobic threshold can be&#xD;
           determined by a non-invasive method using exhaust gas analysis. For this purpose, the&#xD;
           V-slope method is used, in which the dependence of oxygen consumption (VO2) on the&#xD;
           elimination of carbon dioxide (VCO2) is analyzed. The anaerobic threshold is the point&#xD;
           at which the increase in VCO2 production exceeds the increase in O2 consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis. Statistical calculations will be made using statistical packages&#xD;
           STATISTICA PL 10, SPSS 21, R-project 3.0.1 (packages: rms and predictAbel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Spearman rank correlation coefficients will be used to assess the dependencies between&#xD;
      variables measured on an ordinal scale. Significant variables in the one-dimensional analysis&#xD;
      (at the p &lt;0.10 significance level) will be used to build multivariate logistic regression&#xD;
      models. The quality of individual models and the usefulness of subsequent markers will be&#xD;
      assessed using ROC curves [with the optimal cut-off points for which sensitivity, specificity&#xD;
      and negative predictive power will be determined, also odds ratios OR with 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval (95% CI) ], reclassification tables, NRI and IDI meters. Analysis of the endpoints&#xD;
      will be performed using Kaplan-Meier curves.&#xD;
