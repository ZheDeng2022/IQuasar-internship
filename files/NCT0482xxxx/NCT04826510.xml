  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder, a type of mood disorder that occurs in various forms, such as depression,&#xD;
      mania, hypomania or irregularity.According to the World Health Organization mental health&#xD;
      survey, the lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder is 2.4%; the 12-month prevalence was&#xD;
      1.5%. The lifetime incidence in Shenzhen was 1.5%, and the 12-month incidence was 1.1%. In&#xD;
      another study in Hong Kong, the 12-month prevalence of bipolar I, II, and &quot;soft&quot; II was 1.4%,&#xD;
      0.5%, and 1.8%, respectively. Due to endocrine effects, bipolar disorder is more common in&#xD;
      women than men, and mainly occurs in late adolescence and early adulthood, with an early&#xD;
      trend. An investigation involving 23 countries around the world found that the average age of&#xD;
      onset of bipolar disorder was 25 years old, and the low age group (17.24±3.20 years old)&#xD;
      accounted for 41.7%. Another study in the United States showed that the average age of onset&#xD;
      of bipolar disorder was 20 years old, and the low age group (14.5±4.9 years old) accounted&#xD;
      for 63%. With the improvement of medical level, the diagnosis rate of bipolar disorder is&#xD;
      getting closer to the true prevalence rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without active treatment, the symptoms of bipolar disorder, especially depression, will&#xD;
      accompany the patients for a long time. The quality of life of patients is seriously&#xD;
      affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of piperopilon hydrochloride has been widely recognized from pre-market clinical&#xD;
      research to post-market clinical practice. A total of a clinical study involving 1191&#xD;
      patients showed that the incidence of side effects from long-term use of piperopilone was&#xD;
      21.3%, and the main side effects were mild in the nervous and digestive systems. In addition,&#xD;
      it has been reported that piperopirone is also safe and effective for adolescents.Therefore,&#xD;
      the investigators designed this study to explore the atypical antipsychotic drug piperopirone&#xD;
      as a monotherapy or in combination with mood stabilizer.Clinical efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      lithium acid in the treatment of depressive episodes in adolescents with bipolar disorder,&#xD;
      and its improvement in cognitive function were assessed.The goal is to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of piperopilone hydrochloride tablets in the treatment of bipolar depressive&#xD;
      episode in adolescents.&#xD;

      obtaining the corresponding random number according to the order of inclusion. According to&#xD;
