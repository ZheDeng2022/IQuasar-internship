  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a small sample (N=46) 16-week clinical trial with a follow-up after&#xD;
      24-weeks among sedentary office-working adults &gt;60 y with a BMI &gt;25 kg/m2 to tests the impact&#xD;
      of a hybrid artificial intelligence behavior change system (Companion) on physical activity.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to a control and intervention group. All participants will&#xD;
      engage in a proven supervised exercise program from week 1 to 16. Only the intervention group&#xD;
      will receive Companion from week 1 to 16.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site randomized clinical trial to test if if Companion improves and sustains&#xD;
      free-living physical activity and sedentary behaviors in adults &gt;60 y and improves health&#xD;
      outcomes. Forty-six sedentary office-working adults &gt;60 y with a BMI &gt;25 kg/m2 will be&#xD;
      randomized to a control and intervention group. Both groups will undergo a 16-week supervised&#xD;
      training program involving supervised training sessions 45-60 min, twice a week. The&#xD;
      intervention group will additionally receive the two-way communication-based Companion meta&#xD;
      intervention. Two-way communication during weeks 1 to 4, will focus on gathering information&#xD;
      on the adult's motivations, preferences, habits, contexts, and usual behavior patterns to&#xD;
      build typical individual behavior models. The model will be used to develop an adaptive&#xD;
      physical active and sedentary behavior intervention prescription. Primary outcomes from Aim 1&#xD;
      and exploratory outcomes from Aim 2 will be measured at baseline and then after 16 and 24&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Companion integrates wearable sensing with the smartphone to develop a behavior-aware, virtual system that uses a &quot;human-in-the-loop&quot; approach to enable meaningful two-way communication. Companion builds rich models of typical behavior using sensors and context sensitive ecological momentary assessment to deliver intervention components and behavior change strategies using socially engaging, contextually salient, and tailored text-message conversations in near-real-time.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 60 years and above- This intervention study focusses on this population&#xD;
             demographic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Employed in a seated desk job- We focus on the pre-retirement sub-population because:&#xD;
             (i) it is particularly vulnerable to inactivity and the pre-retirement period is an&#xD;
             opportune time to support the adoption of a healthy lifestyle that can be carried into&#xD;
             old age and (ii) it facilitates the feasibility of deploying a prototype technology in&#xD;
             a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants have a body mass index greater than 25 kg/m2- This threshold for BMI is&#xD;
             used to classify an adult as overweight or obese&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No conditions preventing participation in physical activity lasting 10 to 30 min- Such&#xD;
             conditions will limit prescription of physical activity/exercise components of the&#xD;
             training program and that promoted using Companion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a smart phone- The absence of a smart phone will limit the ability of remote&#xD;
             communication with the study participant using the Companion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Engage in structured physical activity for more than 2 days/week lasting 30&#xD;
             min/session- Physically active participants will not be representative of typical&#xD;
             adults &gt;60 y. Being active prior to study participation may mask the effects of the&#xD;
             intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regularly use any assistive device for walking- Use of an assistive device would limit&#xD;
             the ability to engage in prescribed physical activity. Future work can be tailored for&#xD;
             sub-groups in the demographic being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Likely to alter medications pertaining to cardiovascular or metabolic health- Altering&#xD;
             medications during the study will influence change in selected outcome measures.&#xD;
