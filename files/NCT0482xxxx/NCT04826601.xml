      Background: Stress is the critical method for survive of reacting to a condition including a&#xD;
      threat, challenge or physical and psychological challenge. Stress either physiological or&#xD;
      biological is an organism's response to a stressor such as an environmental condition.&#xD;
      Stimuli that alter an organism's environment are responded to by multiple systems in the&#xD;
      body. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system are major&#xD;
      systems which the body reacts to the stress. It has been reported that cancer patients&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy perceived a lot of stress. It has been believed and well known that&#xD;
      stress-related illness is one of the reasons contributing to the increase in long-term sick&#xD;
      leave during the last decade in many countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The aims of this study are to evaluate the effects of aromatherapy on cancer patient&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy: 1) for physical effects by meridian electrical conductance, heart&#xD;
      rate variability (HRV), vital sign, visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain; 2) for psychologic&#xD;
      effects by State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: This is a prospective, pre post comparison study. A total of 40 cancer&#xD;
      patients receiving chemotherapy will be recruited as participants in this study. The&#xD;
      characteristics data will be collected in all participants. Blood orange and rosewood will be&#xD;
      chosen as the essential oils for aromatherapy in this study. Essential oils will be applied&#xD;
      to all participants by inhalation for 30 minutes. Meridian electrical conductance, HRV, vital&#xD;
      sign, VAS for pain, and STAI were evaluated and compared before and after aromatherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes: It is expected to understand more about the effects of aromatherapy on the&#xD;
      meridian system, HRV and emotional status by undertaking 30 minutes session aromatherapy&#xD;
      intervention for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. The results may suggest aromatherapy&#xD;
      as one of the affiliated programs of chemotherapy.&#xD;
