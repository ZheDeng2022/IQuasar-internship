  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer related lymphedema (BCRL) is the most common complication after breast cancer&#xD;
      surgery, which brings a heavy psychological and spiritual burden to patients. For a long&#xD;
      time, the diagnosis and treatment of lymphedema has been a difficult point in domestic and&#xD;
      foreign research. To a large extent, it is because most of the patients who come to see a&#xD;
      doctor have already developed obvious lymphedema, and the internal lymphatic vessels have&#xD;
      undergone pathological remodeling[1] Therefore, it is particularly important to detect early&#xD;
      lymphedema and intervene in time through the use of sensitive screening tools. Indocyanine&#xD;
      green (ICG) lymphangiography is a relatively new method, which can display superficial lymph&#xD;
      flow in real time and quickly, and will not be affected by radioactivity [7]. In 2007,&#xD;
      indocyanine green lymphography was used for the first time to evaluate the function of&#xD;
      superficial lymphatic vessels. In 2011, Japanese scholars found skin reflux signs based on&#xD;
      ICG lymphography data of 20 patients with lymphedema after breast cancer surgery, and they&#xD;
      were roughly divided into three types according to their severity: splash, star cluster, and&#xD;
      diffuse (Figure 1) [8]. Later, in 2016, a prospective study involving 196 people affirmed the&#xD;
      value of ICG lymphography in the early diagnosis of lymphedema, and made the images of ICG&#xD;
      lymphography more specific stages 0-5 [9], but The staging is still based on the three types&#xD;
      of skin reflux symptoms found in a small sample clinical study in 2011, which is not&#xD;
      completely applicable in actual clinical applications. In addition, when abnormal skin reflux&#xD;
      symptoms appear on ICG lymphangiography, the pathophysiological changes that occur in the&#xD;
      body lack research and exploration. Therefore, this research hopes to refine the image&#xD;
      features of ICG lymphography through machine learning (deep learning), and establish a PKUPH&#xD;
      model for diagnosing early lymphedema by staging the image features.&#xD;
