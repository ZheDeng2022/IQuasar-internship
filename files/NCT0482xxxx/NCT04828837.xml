    <textblock>
      The morbidity rate of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is increasing year by&#xD;
      year. It is predicted to be the third leading cause of death worldwide in 2030. People with&#xD;
      COPD have a high risk of needing a ventilator due to the decline of lung function, the&#xD;
      increase of secretions, the dysfunction of airway clearance, and the obstruction and loss of&#xD;
      alveolar elasticity.&#xD;

      This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of cough and sputum assessment and respiratory&#xD;
      physiological indicators after training with the Bubble positive expiratory pressure (Bubble&#xD;
      PEP) inpatients with COPD. This is a randomization control trial design survey using&#xD;
      convenient sampling and will be to select 94 inpatients with COPD in the division of chest&#xD;
      ward of two teaching hospital in New Taipei City. The subjects who meet the conditions for&#xD;
      admission are explained, and they need to sign a consent form confirming that they understand&#xD;
      the risks. More, they are randomly divided into the experimental group (experimental group&#xD;
      n=47) and the control group (control group n=47). The experimental group receives the Bubble&#xD;
      PEP training; the control group receives the division of chest ward routine care. The study&#xD;
      employs a structured questionnaire including a basic demography, COPD domain, COPD assessment&#xD;
      test (CAT), cough and sputum assessment test, and check the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)&#xD;
      using it for data collection. The study needs to be approve by the Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board. The two groups agreed to participate in the study, after completing the subject&#xD;
      consent form before the intervention, they also received the pre-test as a benchmark for the&#xD;
      intervention effect. After completing the 7-day and 30-day intervention, the post-test was&#xD;
      performed immediately to understand the intervention immediate effect.&#xD;

    <description>I hope the breathing exercise can to improving the COPDAE in-patients pulmonary function. I would like to use two kinds of questionnaires and a total of 43 questions, and PEFR to monitor pulmonary function, which includes the efficacy of cough improvement, sputum clearance, and airway obstruction symptoms. Furthermore, I will follow up to study one day, the 7th, and the 30th day.</description>

    <description>I hope the breathing exercise can reduce the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease acute exacerbation in-patients the re-hospitalization risk. Therefore, I will follow the patient every week between discharge till the 30th day.</description>
