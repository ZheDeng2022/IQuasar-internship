  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is characterized by attacks of throbbing, moderate or severe headache, associated&#xD;
      with nausea, vomiting, and/or sensitivity to light and sound. The main objective of the study&#xD;
      is to evaluate how safe and effective the atogepant is in preventing chronic migraine in&#xD;
      adult Chinese participants who completed study 3101-303-002. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atogepant is an investigational drug being developed to prevent chronic migraine. All&#xD;
      participants will receive the same treatment. Approximately 120 adult participants who&#xD;
      completed study 3101-303-002 will be enrolled at approximately 25 centers in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive atogepant oral tablet once daily for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their&#xD;
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or&#xD;
      clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests,&#xD;
      checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity.</description>

Suicidal ideation is classified on a 5-item scale: 1 being wish to be dead and 5 being active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent. Suicidal behavior is classified on a 5-item scale: 0 being no suicidal behavior and 4 being actual attempt.</description>

             Scale (C-SSRS), or of harm to others (investigator opinion); participants who report&#xD;
