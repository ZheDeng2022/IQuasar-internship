  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective single center analysis which includes all the fresh, IOC&#xD;
      (insemination of in vitro matured oocytes) and frozen embryo transfer (ET) performed between&#xD;
      January 2000 and December 2019 at Humanitas Fertility Center after IVF-ICSI (In Vitro&#xD;
      Fertilization - Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection) cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the impact of the biologist performing the embryo&#xD;
      transfer on the pregnancy probability, in terms of ongoing pregnancy rate (OPR), defined as&#xD;
      the number of viable pregnancies that had completed at least 12 weeks of gestation on the&#xD;
      total number of ET performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end point is to evaluate whether the biologists improve their performances as their&#xD;
      experience increases, allowing the drawing of an ET learning curve in term of pregnancies for&#xD;
      the different biologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biologist's experience was assessed in terms of number of previous interventions&#xD;
      performed prior to the day of ET. A total of 28 operators were eligible to participate in the&#xD;
      study. Any biologists who performed less than 100 ETs was excluded from the analysis.&#xD;
