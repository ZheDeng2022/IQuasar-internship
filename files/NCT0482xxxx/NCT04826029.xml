  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After well-conducted treatment of ovarian, tubal and primary peritoneum cancer by maximum&#xD;
      tumor reduction surgery and chemotherapy including platinum salt and paclitaxel, the clinical&#xD;
      remission rate is over 50%. However, 75-80% of patients with ovarian, tube or primary&#xD;
      peritoneum cancer recur within 2 years of the end of treatment. In the latest INCa&#xD;
      recommendations for 2018, systematic imaging (thoraco-abdomino-pelvic scanner (CT), MRI, PET&#xD;
      CT) is not recommended based on the literature because of its low added value compared to CA&#xD;
      125 dosage (sensitivity ranging from 67% to 95%, and specificity of 87% to 93%), its&#xD;
      irradiating character (CT) and its cost. However, the recommendations are based on imaging&#xD;
      studies dating back at least a decade. Since these studies, technological advances have&#xD;
      improved the diagnostic performance of imaging: sensitivity is 78% for whole-body CT scans&#xD;
      and 98% for full-body MRI for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer recurrence. Furthermore,&#xD;
      previous randomized studies showed no survival benefit with early treatment of relapse on the&#xD;
      basis of a high concentration of CA125 alone, so the value of routine CA125 measurement in&#xD;
      the follow-up of ovarian cancer patients may be limited. These recent studies lead to&#xD;
      heterogeneity in surveillance protocols for ovarian cancer patients despite recommendations.&#xD;
      In addition, treatments for recurrences have evolved as well as maintenance treatments to&#xD;
      become chronic treatments, with the emergence of the maintenance new treatments detecting&#xD;
      early recurrence is particularly important (notably through the development of new molecules&#xD;
      given in maintenance treatment). But early detection have to be balanced with the quality of&#xD;
      life of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In usual care, imaging surveillance is often carried out despite the absence of&#xD;
      recommendations or data from the literature of high level of evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question arises as to whether radiological monitoring could make an impact on patient&#xD;
      survival without being a source of excessive false positives, patient stress and&#xD;
      non-productive costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALOV trial is a multicenter randomized study for patients in remission after treatment of&#xD;
      advanced stage serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneum cancer (stage&#xD;
      III and beyond).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess the effectiveness of systematic imaging for patients followed&#xD;
      after advanced stage serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneum cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized multi-center study. Randomization will be stratified on two major&#xD;
      prognostic factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The BRCA mutation (germline or somatic)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the serous high or low grade histological subtype of histological se topical (defined&#xD;
           according to morphological-well-differentiated criteria, low to moderate atypia, &lt;3-4&#xD;
           mitoses/10 fields-and immunohistochemical-RO - strong p16/p53 low) At J0, after&#xD;
           obtaining informed consent or within 7 days, patients will be randomized in one of the&#xD;
           two arms (intervention group/standard group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention arm, patients will perform a ca125 dosing ,/he4 dosage, a thoraco&#xD;
      abdomino pelvic CT scan after contrast product injection and a full-body MRI (T2, DW and T1&#xD;
      sequences after fat saturation before and after gadolinium injection) with a maximum of 15&#xD;
      days between the two examinations, and will complete the HAD and EQ5D self-tests. A senior&#xD;
      radiologist from each center will perform a prospective reading of each of the imaging. For&#xD;
      any suspicious anomaly identified, the following criteria will be analyzed: Size, location,&#xD;
      number, scalability, contrast taking after injection, MRI signal (T2, Diffusion, Dynamic&#xD;
      Enhancement Curve). The RECIST criteria (version 1.1) will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the standard arm, patients will perform a dosage of CA 125 (HE4 dosage), complete the HAD&#xD;
      and EQ5D self-questionnaires, and the patient will be managed according to the INCa 2018&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of clinical abnormality (symptoms such as pain, transit changes, increased&#xD;
      abdominal volume; or abnormality in clinical examination such as palpation of a mass,&#xD;
      carcinosis nodule or suspicious adenopathy), marker elevation (CA125 &gt;2N and/or 70 IU/L, HE4&#xD;
      &gt; 140 pmol/L) and/or imaging (read by a senior at the center), the patient will be referred&#xD;
      to the Multidisciplinary Consultation Meeting (PCR) for management according to the INCa 2018&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of a biopsy or surgery recommendation, it will be performed within a maximum of 2&#xD;
      months (according to the recommendations of good practice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In common practice, the diagnosis of recurrence is often based on obvious imaging elements&#xD;
      (RECIST criteria) without histological evidence. It is only in uncertain cases that a biopsy&#xD;
      will be performed or a diagnostic surgery, so in this study it will be placed as in current&#xD;
      practice without adding procedures that are not performed in common practice to start a new&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of the management of recidivism, this is the most complex element because it is&#xD;
      difficult to homogenize all attitudes. Indeed, many studies are still underway to define the&#xD;
      best ways to manage recurrences with contradictory results (such as DESKTOP III in favour of&#xD;
      new complete secondary surgery and the study by Coleman et al published in the NEJM in&#xD;
      11/2019 which does not find this advantage). The purpose of this study is not to be not to&#xD;
      define (or impose) optimal support (which has yet to be defined). In addition, this study is&#xD;
      in real life and the modalities of care can change over the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will therefore follow the main standard principles of the management of recidivism based&#xD;
      on the characterization of platinosensitivity according to recurrence at less than 6 months,&#xD;
      6 to 12 months or more than 12 months of recidivism. Surgery will be considered if it is a&#xD;
      localized recurrence, accessible for complete resection and less than 6 months delay compared&#xD;
      to the last platinum chemotherapy (use of the AGO score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-utility analysis and AIB The economic assessment will be conducted in accordance with&#xD;
      the recommendations of the HAS (updated) and the CHEERS collaboration, by measuring&#xD;
      prospectively on the population study population the costs and outcomes at 24 months and&#xD;
      extrapolating them over a lifetime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will carry out a cost utility study, based on the measurement of survival and quality of&#xD;
      life from the EQ 5D. We will estimate a cost-utility incremental ratio and conduct a&#xD;
      probabilistic sensitivity analysis to locate the systematic imaging surveillance strategy at&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the economic assessment, we selected two perspectives, the collective perspective and the&#xD;
      perspective of Medicare. The measurement of route efficiency will be based on an analysis of&#xD;
      the different costs from a community perspective and an analysis of clinical effectiveness in&#xD;
      real life and will be supplemented by a budgetary impact analysis from the perspective of&#xD;
      Medicare. The time horizon for the main study ranges from inclusion to 2 years with secondary&#xD;
      modelling over the whole life, with an annual discount of costs and benefits at 4% for the&#xD;
      first 30 years, 1.5% then according to the latest recommendations of the HAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed for all patients included in the study, based on the principle of&#xD;
      the intention-to-treat analysis. We plan to perform sub-analyses based on BRCA (germinal or&#xD;
      somatic) stratification and histological serous subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reference intervention is the usual management of patients with a dosage of CA 125 (OR/-&#xD;
      dosage of HE4) and management according to the INCa 2018 recommendations according to the&#xD;
      results. The procedure studied is also a dosage of CA125 (HE4 dosage), followed by a thoraco&#xD;
      abdominopelvic CT scan after contrast product injection and a whole body MRI. Management will&#xD;
      be decided on the basis of the results of the examinations&#xD;
