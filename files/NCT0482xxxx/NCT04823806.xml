  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, the autophagy inducing caloric restriction mimic spermidine became available.&#xD;
      Autophagy is essential for energy and cellular homeostasis through protein catabolism and&#xD;
      dysregulation results in compromised proteostasis, stress-coping behavior, and in excessive&#xD;
      secretion of signaling molecules and inflammatory cytokines. Antidepressants for example&#xD;
      effect autophagy dependent pathways to exert their beneficial effects. It can therefore be&#xD;
      hypothesized that autophagy induction through spermidine supplementation also shows&#xD;
      beneficial clinical effect, particularly in the field of psychiatric conditions. It would be&#xD;
      safe, low cost and easy to implement in relay to psychotropic medication in the treatment of&#xD;
      psychiatric patients.Therefore, the aim of the project is to analyze clinical effects of&#xD;
      spermidine supplementation in correlation to the underlying, multi-level molecular profiling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, the autophagy inducing caloric restriction mimic spermidine-rich wheat germ extract&#xD;
      (spermidineLIFE ®, from here onwards: spermidine) was approved by the European Food Safety&#xD;
      Authority (EFSA) and became commercially available for use. Spermidine is safe, well&#xD;
      tolerated and as caloric restriction mimetic an easy alternative if fasting is too&#xD;
      challenging, e.g. for psychiatric patients. Research on spermidine in animal models is&#xD;
      limited, but a study with mice overexpressing spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT)&#xD;
      an enzyme of spermidine catabolism, suggests that these mice may be more prone to stress. An&#xD;
      association between spermidine supplementation and improved memory performance as well as&#xD;
      reduced mortality has been shown in an epidemiological correlation. So far laboratory and&#xD;
      molecular assessments are missing. It is therefore of great interest to perform broad&#xD;
      multidisciplinary studies of behavioral changes with plasma spermidine levels, the&#xD;
      quantification of autophagic flux, and protein acetylation levels as well as molecular&#xD;
      signaling in a longitudinal fashion to establish an epidemiological triangulation between&#xD;
      spermidine, autophagy and (mental) health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a monocentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which a&#xD;
      3-week spermidine-based nutritional supplementation (6 mg/d; target intervention) will be&#xD;
      compared to 3-weeks of placebo administration (control intervention). Recruitment of 40&#xD;
      healthy individuals and 40 individuals with diagnosed depressive disorder is planned, who&#xD;
      will be allocated to one of the two study arms (n = 20 per intervention). At different time&#xD;
      points (baseline, intervention day 7, 14 and 21, as well as one week follow up after the last&#xD;
      intervention day) serval psychometrical questionnaires will be gathered and blood will be&#xD;
      collected. Sleep quality will be additionally assessed by actigraphy. At selected days blood&#xD;
      will be collected. Following, autophagy activity will be assessed by Western Blot analysis,&#xD;
      and mass spectrometry based proteomics, phosphoproteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics will&#xD;
      be performed. Bioinformatic analysis, statistical evaluation, quality control, and in silico&#xD;
      pathway analyses will then specifically identify factors and cascades of relevance.&#xD;
      Furthermore it is of great interest, whether epigenetic changes take place during spermidine&#xD;
      supplementation and whether these are stable throughout the follow up analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to analyze clinical effects of spermidine supplementation in&#xD;
      correlation to the underlying, multi-level molecular profiling. Longitudinal multi-omic&#xD;
      profiling including proteome, metabolome, lipidome, and epigenetic changes will reveal&#xD;
      time-series analysis of thousands of molecular changes and an orchestrated composition of&#xD;
      autophagy depended signaling. The resulting findings will advance the role of autophagy in&#xD;
      the development of psychiatric disorders, investigate alternative treatment options on a&#xD;
      molecular level, and finally contribute to a better clinical outcome.&#xD;
