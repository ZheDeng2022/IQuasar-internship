  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim at testing the efficacy of an app to measure sentence intelligibility&#xD;
      in noise in speakers with Parkinson's disease and in healthy controls.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Close to 90% of people with Parkinson's disease develop voice problems during the course of&#xD;
      the disease. These problems lead to reduced intelligibility, which entails a subsequent&#xD;
      reduction in social participation and overall quality of life. The current study will focus&#xD;
      on developing and pilot-testing an app to measure the intelligibility of people with PD and&#xD;
      of healthy controls. In order to test the app's efficacy, speakers will read a set of 50&#xD;
      sentences that will be embedded in noise for measurement purposes. A group of listeners will&#xD;
      also transcribe the spoken sentences to correlate their performance to that of the app. The&#xD;
      ultimate purpose of this investigation is to improve self-monitoring and self-sufficiency in&#xD;
      people with PD. The study is expected to last 12 months.&#xD;
