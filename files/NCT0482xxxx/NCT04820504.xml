  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Augmented Infant Resuscitator (AIR) is an inexpensive add-on, compatible with nearly every&#xD;
      existing bag-valve mask and many types of ventilation equipment. AIR monitors ventilation&#xD;
      quality and provides real-time objective feedback and actionable cues to clinicians to both&#xD;
      shorten training times and improve resuscitation quality, adoption, retention, and&#xD;
      confidence.&#xD;

      Longitudinal, randomized control trial that examined the effectiveness of AIR among 270&#xD;
      participants, with 1,080 recorded ventilation scenarios, and across 20 sites in Uganda and&#xD;
      the U.S. Birth attendants - including a mix of midwives, nurses, respiratory therapists,&#xD;
      pediatricians, and neonatologists - with recent HBB and/or NRP training were recruited to&#xD;
      participate in this randomized control trial. Participants ventilated training mannequins for&#xD;
      a fixed duration of time. Participants were randomized to receive visual feedback from AIR&#xD;
      (intervention) or have the AIR feedback covered (control). They were then requested to&#xD;
      administer effective ventilation and verbally assess the mannequin condition. All mannequins&#xD;
      appeared to be identical, but each session's mannequin was randomly selected with an upper&#xD;
      airway that was normal, partially leaking, or partially obstructed.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of effective bag-mask ventilation by clinician during a 2-minute trial. [This will be a cumulative duration of the two minutes. This is measured internally from the AIR device. &quot;Effective ventilation&quot; is defined as having all three of the following conditions simultaneously: (1) Correct rate (30-60 breaths per minute); (2) Absence of significant leak (compliance &gt;4.0mL/cm H2O); and (3) Absence of a significant airway blockage (defined as compliance &lt;0.10 mL/cm H2O or resistance &gt;90 cmH2O/L/s). These measurements are determined by sensors in the AIR device for both arms of the study. Their accuracy for manikin use was determined to be 100% in the following trial: Bennett el al. Anesth Analgesia. 2018 Mar;126(3):947-955. doi: 10.1213/ANE.0000000000002432.]</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to effective bag-mask ventilation</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>How long it takes for clinician to achieve effective ventilation during 2-minute trial. [This is time from when the mask first touches the face of the manikin until all three icons are green. This is measured by a Research Assistant using a stop-watch. Again, &quot;Effective ventilation&quot; is defined as having all three of the following conditions simultaneously and is indicated to the RA by all three icons on the AIR device turning green: (1) Correct rate (30-60 breaths per minute); (2) Absence of significant leak (compliance &gt;4.0mL/cm H2O); and (3) Absence of a significant airway blockage (defined as compliance &lt;0.10 mL/cm H2O or resistance &gt;90 cmH2O/L/s). These measurements are determined by sensors in the AIR device for both arms of the study. Their accuracy for manikin use was determined to be 100% in the following trial: Bennett et al. Anesth Analgesia 2018 Mar;126(3):947-955. doi: 10.1213/ANE.0000000000002432.]</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinician's correct assessment of mannequin airway issues</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Ability of clinician to correctly assess three different manikin airway issues: normal, air leak, or obstruction. [Manikin &quot;conditions&quot; are blinded to the participants and were either normal (as supplied by the manufacturer, had a &quot;leak&quot; insert (introduced compliance &gt;4mL/cm H2O), or had an &quot;obstruction&quot; insert (introduced a reduction in compliance &lt;0.10mL/cm H2O and resistance &gt;90 cm H2O/L/s. As per the parameters in the following paper: Bennett et al. Anesth Analgesia. 2018 Mar;126(3):947-955. doi: 10.1213/ANE.0000000000002432.]</description>
