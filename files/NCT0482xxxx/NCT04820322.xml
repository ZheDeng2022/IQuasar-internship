  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FibersymÂ® is a RS4-type resistant modified wheat starch in which over 85% of the total starch&#xD;
      is resistant starch as measured by AOAC method 991.43. It is meant to be consumed on a&#xD;
      regular basis and doses up to 33g/day can be tolerated. The effect of a Fibersym-containing&#xD;
      meal on postprandial glucose and insulin levels when compared to a control meal, where both&#xD;
      meals contain the same amount of available carbohydrate, is not known. This study therefore&#xD;
      investigated the acute effect of a Fibersym cookie and a control cookie matched for available&#xD;
      carbohydrate after a 3-day habituation period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study used a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Participants willing to be considered were invited to come to the research centre to&#xD;
      have the study procedures explained to them and be given a copy of the consent form which&#xD;
      they may either sign then, take away to sign at a later date, or decline to participate.&#xD;
      Participants were encouraged to ask any questions they may have and not to sign the consent&#xD;
      form until all of their questions have been answered to their satisfaction. Those who&#xD;
      consented to participate came to the research centre for a pre-selection visit when subject&#xD;
      eligibility will be determined. A number of parameters were assessed including blood&#xD;
      pressure, weight, height, BMI, and brief medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2-3: Eligible subjects were randomized using an online randomization calculator.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects were studied on 2 separate days over a period of 6 weeks or less. Prior to&#xD;
      each test meal, they were provided with enough cookies to consume 3 times/day over 3 days and&#xD;
      instructed to start consuming the cookies 3 days before their visit. They were also provided&#xD;
      with a calorie appropriate, standard frozen dinner to be consumed on the evening before their&#xD;
      test meal. The interval between successive tests was no less than 6 days and no more than 4&#xD;
      weeks. On each test day, participants came to GI Labs in the morning after a 10-12 h&#xD;
      overnight fast (except for water). Participants were asked to maintain stable dietary and&#xD;
      activity habits throughout their participation and to refrain from drinking alcohol and from&#xD;
      unusual levels of food intake or physical activity for 24 h before each test. Before the&#xD;
      start of the test meal, subjects were asked whether they consumed the provided cookies over&#xD;
      the last 3 days as instructed and the standard dinner the evening before. Subjects were asked&#xD;
      to complete a 3- day record of supplement consumption and whether they consumed the standard&#xD;
      evening meal, in addition to a 3-day symptom diary before each test visit. If any subject was&#xD;
      not feeling well or had not complied with the preceding experimental conditions, the test was&#xD;
      not carried out and was rescheduled for another day. On each test day, two fasting&#xD;
      fingerprick blood samples were collected at -5 min and 0 min. Each sample consisted of 2&#xD;
      vials, one for glucose analysis and one for insulin analysis (4-8 drops of blood each).&#xD;
      Questionnaires to record satiety and GI symptoms were administered. Participants were then&#xD;
      given the test food together with 250 ml of water and instructed to consume them over 15&#xD;
      minutes. Additional blood samples were collected 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after the&#xD;
      start of the test meal. Satiety questionnaires were administered at the same time intervals.&#xD;
      GI symptom questionnaires were filled out at 2 h in addition to fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Foods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sugar snap cookie formula (Control) was obtained from the American Institute of Baking&#xD;
      (AIB) International (Manhattan, KS). Fibersym RW (Appendix 1) was added as an extra portion&#xD;
      to the Control Cookie recipe, amounts were adjusted so that both the control and Fibersym&#xD;
      cookie portions contained the same amount of available carbohydrate (ingredients are listed&#xD;
      in appendix 1). Both cookies were baked at the facilities of AIB. The macronutrient&#xD;
      composition of baked cookies was determined by an independent laboratory and the final&#xD;
      weights of the cookies fed were adjusted accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the test breakfasts during the postprandial visit, the subject consumed approximately 3&#xD;
      cookies containing 40 g available carbohydrates, the weight of Control Cookies per meal was&#xD;
      78.1g whereas the weight of Fibersym Cookies per meal was 97.8 g (delivering 21 g of fiber&#xD;
      from Fibersym and 2.1g from the flour) (Table 1). Both test meals were consumed with 250 ml&#xD;
      of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 3-day pre-feeding period, subjects consumed 108.9g cookies (approx. 3.5) of&#xD;
      Control Cookies per day and 136.2 g of Fibersym Cookies (approx. 4) per day (delivering 29 g&#xD;
      fiber from Fibersym/day). The cookies were consumed during the 3 meals (breakfast, lunch and&#xD;
      dinner). Both the control and Fibersym cookies contributed 50g available carbohydrate per&#xD;
      day. The product was re-packaged by a GI Labs staff member not involved in the clinical&#xD;
      trial. Product label displayed the subject number, subject initials, product ID, ingredients&#xD;
      statement, GIL repacked date, expiration date, researcher name and telephone number,&#xD;
      investigational use statement, and allergy warnings (if needed). Study Product Intake Logs&#xD;
      were completed upon dispensation of study product to each subject. After the data had been&#xD;
      entered, checked for errors and the database locked, the code was broken, #149 corresponded&#xD;
      to the control cookie while 394 corresponded to the Fibersym cookie.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects were asked to consume a standard evening meal provided by GI Labs and consisted&#xD;
      of a frozen dinner.&#xD;

Satiety is the mean of 4 measures, hunger, fullness, desire to eat and prospective consumption (how much do you think you can eat) each measured using visual analogue scales (VAS) at intervals over the postprandial period. A VAS is a 100mm line anchored at the left end with phrase indicating a high in tensity of the feeling (eg. as hungry as I have ever felt) and at the other end with a phrase indicating a low intensity of feeling (eg. not hungry at all). A lower score means that the subject is more satiated.</description>
