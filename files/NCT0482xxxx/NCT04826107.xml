      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase II study of DP303c injection in patients with&#xD;
      HER2-positive advanced or metastatic gastric cancer with two parts. In part 1, patients will&#xD;
      be treated with DP303c injection at three dose levels (2.0 mg/kg，2.5 mg/kg or 3.0 mg/kg)&#xD;
      every 3 weeks to determine the recommended dose . Once the recommended dose has been&#xD;
      established in part 1, patients will be enrolled into 4 cohorts in part 2.&#xD;
