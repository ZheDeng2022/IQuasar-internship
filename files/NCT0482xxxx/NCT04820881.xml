      This grant award entitled, &quot;Cerebrovascular Reactivity and Oxygen Metabolism as Markers for&#xD;
      Neurodegeneration after Traumatic Brain Injury&quot; (hereafter, &quot;Neurovascular Study&quot;), aims to&#xD;
      determine if neurovascular contributors to neurodegeneration can serve as markers of the&#xD;
      emergence or progression of degenerative processes after traumatic brain injury in&#xD;
      middle-aged and older adults. Primary outcomes are cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), as&#xD;
      measured by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD)&#xD;
      and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) as assessed by the novel MRI sequence called,&#xD;
      &quot;T-2 Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging&quot; (TRUST). After the baseline primary endpoints are&#xD;
      acquired, a single dose of sildenafil 50mg will be given to assess for the effects of a&#xD;
      hypercapnia task on CVR and CMRO2. Other outcomes measured include additional imaging&#xD;
      sequences (diffusion, ASL), volumetric analysis, and neuropsychological tests.&#xD;

             and/or diastolic pressure &gt; 110 mmHg), or hypotension (systolic pressure &lt; 110 and/or&#xD;
             diastolic pressure &lt; 65 mmHg). Hypertension controlled with a single anti-&#xD;
             hypertensive medication is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The grant that funds this study requires that de-identified data be submitted annually to the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research (FITBIR) Informatics System, of which the Department of Veterans Affairs is part. The FITBIR database, maintained by the National Institutes of Health, allows other researchers studying traumatic brain injury to apply for approval to utilize this previously collected, de-identified data for qualified research projects. Only de-identified data, which does not include anything that might directly identify participants, will be shared with FITBIR users who have been approved for research use.</ipd_description>
