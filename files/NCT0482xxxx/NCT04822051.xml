  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of the psychoeducation program based on&#xD;
      the Uncertainty in Illness Theory on intolerance to uncertainty, psychological well-being and&#xD;
      coping styles of caregivers of schizophrenia patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample was 54 (experimental group:27; control group: 27) caregivers. Experimental group&#xD;
      received psychoeducation program (5 sessions) based on Mishel's Reconceptualized Uncertainty&#xD;
      in Illness Theory while control group did not receive any intervention. Data were collected 2&#xD;
      times: pre test, post test.&#xD;

      It was determined that schizophrenia was seen in 19.78 million people in 2017 and constituted&#xD;
      0.51% of &quot;disability adjusted life years&quot; due to all causes. It has been determined that&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia have care needs in many areas related to daily care such as&#xD;
      self-care, relationships and coping even in the early period after discharge. This situation&#xD;
      shows that they need support to continue their daily life independently. In this context,&#xD;
      families are the closest accessible support elements to the patients. Living with&#xD;
      schizophrenia is a difficult situation to deal with for the family as well as for the&#xD;
      patient. Caregivers in schizophrenia are dealing with an uncertain future accompanied by&#xD;
      hope, fear, or both during the illness process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theorist Merle H. Mishel's Uncertainty in Illness Theory (UIT) emerged within the framework&#xD;
      of the concept of &quot;uncertainty in illness&quot;. The Reconceptualized Uncertainty in Illness&#xD;
      Theory (RUIT) was developed to explain chronic conditions that cause individuals to&#xD;
      experience uncertainty. &quot;Uncertainty in illness&quot; arises when disease-related processes have&#xD;
      characteristics such as complexity, inconsistency, unpredictability, and lack of knowledge.&#xD;
      RUIT provides a framework for nurses to develop interventions to improve psychological and&#xD;
      behavioral outcomes that occur under uncertainty.Interventions for managing uncertainty help&#xD;
      individuals gain knowledge, solve problems, see their health conditions manageable, and&#xD;
      improve communication and coping skills. When RUIT based interventions are applied to cancer&#xD;
      patients, many positive results have been reported in psychosocial aspects, especially in&#xD;
      managing uncertainty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study that randomized controlled single blinded experimental nature, was conducted&#xD;
      between April 2019 and August 2020 at psychiatry clinic with hospitalized schizophrenia&#xD;
      patients caregivers, total of 54 including 27 interventions and 27 control groups. The data&#xD;
      were collected by &quot;Caregiver Information Form, Visual Analogue Scale, Intolerance to&#xD;
      Uncertainty Scale, Psychological Well-being Scale, Stress Coping Styles Scale&quot;. The&#xD;
      Uncertainty Management Psychoeducation Program, consisting of a total of five sessions was&#xD;
      applied to the intervention group. No intervention was applied to the caregivers in the&#xD;
      control group. The psychoeducational intervention, which was individually designed consisting&#xD;
      of one session per day for each caregiver and five sessions with a gap of at least two days&#xD;
      between sessions, was completed within two weeks. Pre-test and post-test measurements were&#xD;
      also carried out during this period, and scales were applied for the pre-test at the&#xD;
      beginning of the first session and for the post-test at the end of the last session.&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests were used for hypotheses.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intolerance to uncertainty</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Intolerance to Uncertainty Scale, consisting of 12 items. Intolerance to uncertainty is defined as &quot;the tendency to react negatively to uncertain events and situations in cognitive, affective and behavioral terms Higher scores indicate a high level of intolerance to uncertainty. The highest score that can be obtained from the scale is 60 and the lowest score is 12.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived uncertainty</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analogue scale (VAS) is a scale used to convert some values that cannot be measured numerically into numerical ones. The two end definitions of the parameter to be evaluated are written on both ends of a 100 mm line in the scale and one is asked to indicate where his condition is appropriate on this line. In the evaluation of the test, the values obtained for the individuals are averaged.&#xD;
VAS, was used to measure the level of uncertainty perceived by the individuals in this study. It is arranged in such a way that the level of uncertainty perceived by the caregiver can be marked on a ten-centimeter ruler with &quot;no uncertainty&quot; at the left end and &quot;a high level of uncertainty&quot; at the right. The lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 0, the highest score is 10. 10 points indicates that the perceived level of uncertainty is too high.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychological well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Psychological Well-being Scale The scale has a single dimension and consists of 8 items. The items of the Psychological Well-Being Scale are answered between 1 and 7 as strongly disagree (1) and strongly agree (7). All items in the scale are expressed positively. Scores range from 8 (if all items are answered &quot;strongly disagree&quot;) to 56 (if all items are answered &quot;strongly agree&quot;). A high score indicates that the person has psychological resources and strength.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Coping styles</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Ways of Coping Questionnaire Scale measures two main styles of coping with stress. These are &quot;Problem-oriented / active&quot; and &quot;Emotional / passive&quot; styles. Higher scores obtained from self-confident, optimistic, and social support-seeking approaches mean that the person uses effective or active coping strategies, and higher scores from helpless and submissive approach scores mean that ineffective passive coping strategies are used. The scale is a 4-point Likert type consisting of 30 items and 5 separate subscales. Each item - totally unsuitable 0 points - unsuitable 1 point - suitable 2 points - totally appropriate 3 points. In the scale, the scores of each subscale are calculated separately and the total score for that subscale is obtained. 0-21 points for Self-Confident Approach, 0-24 points for Optimistic Approach, 0-15 points for the Social Support Seeking Approach, 0-12 points for Insecure Approach, 0-18 points for Submissive Approach.</description>
