  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary protein is digested in the stomach and intestines to smaller peptides and 20&#xD;
      individual amino acids which, when absorbed by the gut into circulation and taken up by&#xD;
      skeletal muscle, help stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS). Amino acids also provide the&#xD;
      building blocks for muscle proteins that contribute to lean mass gains and increased strength&#xD;
      following resistance exercise. Therefore, strategies to efficiently maximize amino acid&#xD;
      exposure without overconsumption are warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral enzyme supplementation is a candidate approach to optimize amino acid absorption from&#xD;
      dietary protein and protein supplements. Microbial proteases, approved for dietary supplement&#xD;
      use, can theoretically speed up the conversion of protein and peptides to amino acids.&#xD;
      Protease supplements have been marketed to promote muscle strength by optimizing amino acid&#xD;
      absorption, however the clinical evidence is limited. This work will support that ingestion&#xD;
      of protease supplements with a meal can allow individuals to more efficiently increase amino&#xD;
      acid levels from a given amount of dietary protein.&#xD;
