    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease that mainly affects the joint&#xD;
      synovium. Rheumatoid arthritis patients define pain as their major symptom and the most&#xD;
      important reason for applying to a healthcare institution. Approximately 70% of rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis patients state that improvement in their pain compared to other symptoms of the&#xD;
      disease is their priority. Pain in rheumatoid arthritis patients is also important as the&#xD;
      disease affects approximately 0.5-1% of patients worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although pain in rheumatoid arthritis patients can be persistent or intermittent, localized&#xD;
      or widespread, it has often been associated with fatigue and psychosocial stress. Although&#xD;
      nociceptive pain,defined as 'gnawing' or 'aching', is frequently observed in rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis patients, typical neuropathic pain,such as 'burning' or 'itching', can be observed&#xD;
      in some RA patients. It is thought that neuropathic pain may occur as a result of lesions or&#xD;
      disease affecting the somatosensorial nervous system. Neuropathic pain can occur with little&#xD;
      or no stimulus, and its symptoms are abnormal sensations such as hyperalgesia and allodynia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis and treatment of neuropathic pain in rheumatoid arthritis patients is important&#xD;
      because neuropathic pain does not decrease with traditional disease-modifying&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs used in rheumatoid arthritis and causes a decrease in quality of&#xD;
      life. In order to distinguish neuropathic pain from chronic pain, methods based on defining&#xD;
      the quality of pain are often used. Some of these methods are; The McGill Pain Questionnaire,&#xD;
      PainDETECT, RAPS (Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain Scale), VAS (visual analog scale), AIMS&#xD;
      (Arthritis Impact Scale), EQ-5D (European Quality of Life Assessment and Pain Assessment&#xD;
      Questionnaire).&#xD;

      Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease that mainly affects the joint&#xD;
      synovium. Rheumatoid arthritis patients define pain as their major symptom and the most&#xD;
      important reason for applying to a healthcare institution. Approximately 70% of rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis patients state that improvement in their pain compared to other symptoms of the&#xD;
      disease is their priority. Pain in rheumatoid arthritis patients is also important as the&#xD;
      disease affects approximately 0.5-1% of patients worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synovial inflammation, which can lead to joint deformity by causing cartilage and bone&#xD;
      destruction, is the main pathophysiological mechanism in rheumatoid arthritis, and therefore&#xD;
      the main cause of pain in rheumatoid arthritis patients is thought to be nociceptive.&#xD;
      Although pain in rheumatoid arthritis was previously associated with tissue damage and&#xD;
      inflammatory processes in the joints, accumulated knowledge shows that peripheral&#xD;
      inflammation, disease progression, structural and neurochemical changes in the joints and&#xD;
      sensorial system, and central pain process mechanisms may also play a role in these&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although pain in rheumatoid arthritis patients can be persistent or intermittent, localized&#xD;
      or widespread, it has often been associated with fatigue and psychosocial stress. Although&#xD;
      nociceptive pain, defined as 'gnawing' or 'aching', is frequently observed in rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis patients, typical neuropathic pain, such as 'burning' or 'itching', can be observed&#xD;
      in some RA patients. It is thought that neuropathic pain may occur as a result of lesions or&#xD;
      disease affecting the somatosensorial nervous system. Neuropathic pain can occur with little&#xD;
      or no stimulus, and its symptoms are abnormal sensations such as hyperalgesia and allodynia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the frequency of neuropathic pain in rheumatoid arthritis patients varies in various&#xD;
      clinical studies, it is approximately 20.7-30%. The diagnosis and treatment of neuropathic&#xD;
      pain in rheumatoid arthritis patients is important because neuropathic pain does not decrease&#xD;
      with traditional disease-modifying anti-inflammatory drugs used in rheumatoid arthritis and&#xD;
      causes a decrease in quality of life. To distinguish neuropathic pain from chronic pain,&#xD;
      methods based on defining the quality of pain are often used. Some of these methods are; The&#xD;
      McGill Pain Questionnaire, PainDETECT, RAPS (Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain Scale), VAS (visual&#xD;
      analogue scale), AIMS (Arthritis Impact Scale), EQ-5D (European Quality of Life Assessment&#xD;
      and Pain Assessment Questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) are used for pain in rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis, it is not suitable for long-term disease control. It is important to start the use&#xD;
      of disease-modifying agents (DMARDs) in the early period in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analgesic agents such as NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and opioids are used for pain in rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis patients. However, some side effects of these drugs frequently limit their usage.&#xD;
      Long-term opioid use in pain treatment is not recommended due to its side effects such as&#xD;
      constipation, nausea and vomiting, and should be used with careful monitoring when necessary.&#xD;
      Other drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants and topical capsaicin have been used in&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials for pain management in RA with limited success.&#xD;
