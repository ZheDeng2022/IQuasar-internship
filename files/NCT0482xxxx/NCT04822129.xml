    <textblock>
      This is a research study, designed to test and create new ideas that other people can use.&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate two ways of helping people learn to keep&#xD;
      their brain healthy. Research has shown that things like exercise, diet, and computer-based&#xD;
      cognitive training (doing things that make you think and remember on a computer or tablet)&#xD;
      may help older persons maintain their mental functioning as they get older. We want to look&#xD;
      at two ways for people to a develop brain healthy lifestyle that they can use and even enjoy.&#xD;
      If we find that one of the ways of developing a brain healthy lifestyle is better than the&#xD;
      other, other older persons may be able to use it, too. When we say &quot;brain healthy lifestyle,&quot;&#xD;
      we mean doing things that help to keep you healthy, like exercising and following a good&#xD;
      diet. We also mean doing things that may help you think better and maintain your thinking and&#xD;
      reasoning as you get older.&#xD;

      Overview: Participants will complete a baseline battery of self-report and cognitive measures&#xD;
      before and after 12 weeks of weekly videoconferences and diaries of brain health-related&#xD;
      activities completed during weeks 1, 6, and 12. They will be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      groups: (1) treatment as usual (TAU), in which they will receive basic information about a&#xD;
      brain healthy lifestyle (topics such as diet, exercise, computer-based cognitive training,&#xD;
      meditation as well as others) and encouraged to develop a brain-health lifestyle or (2) an&#xD;
      intervention based on the Cogtrastim model combined with behavior change support. This model&#xD;
      posits that brain healthy lifestyle should encompass activities focused on one of three basic&#xD;
      mechanisms related to brain health. Model-based activity choices will be integrated with an&#xD;
      intensive behavior change intervention focused on realistic goal setting, self-monitoring,&#xD;
      problem solving barriers to behavior change, and developing strategies for behavior&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for TAU: The intervention to be used in the treatment as usual group is a&#xD;
      reasonable representation of what many older persons face in finding out about the importance&#xD;
      of brain health, selecting from the broad range of potential brain health activities, and&#xD;
      changing their health-related behaviors. A great deal of information is available online and&#xD;
      in books. Many models of programs for brain health recommend multiple activities or&#xD;
      interventions with little guidance on selection or prioritizing them. The TAU intervention&#xD;
      will mirror this situation, providing participants with multiple resources from which to&#xD;
      choose activities and methods of behavior change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment: After completion of the informed consent interview and the participants&#xD;
      have given consent to be involved in study procedures, the researchers will complete an&#xD;
      interview with participants focused on medication use, health status, and demographic&#xD;
      information. They will then be given links to self-report questionnaires on RedCap and sent&#xD;
      an invitation e-mail to complete a cognitive assessment on the Cognifit website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures will include the Memory Self-Efficacy Scale, Alzheimer Disease Risk Inventory&#xD;
      (ADRI), Perceived Stress Scale, Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale, risk subscale, PROMIS&#xD;
      Cognitive Function, Self-Report Measure of Cognitive Abilities, Technology Use Questionnaire,&#xD;
      and the NIH Toolbox General Life Satisfaction Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognifit assessment: This is a commercially-available product previously used in studies of&#xD;
      computer-based cognitive training in older adults. The Cognitive Assessment Battery for&#xD;
      People Over 55 (CAB-AG) requires 20 to 30 minutes and measures various mental abilities as&#xD;
      well as briefly assessing mental well-being. It is a standard commercially-available product.&#xD;
      It provides a general score as well as subscores in domains of reasoning, memory, attention,&#xD;
      coordination, and perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention for TAU group: Actual participation in the intervention will begin with the&#xD;
      first videoconference. The general format for each conference will be a brief presentation&#xD;
      (10-15 minutes) by a researcher on a specific topic related to brain health, with the&#xD;
      remainder of the time spent in discussion of the topic's importance and in answering&#xD;
      participants' questions about the topic or about any other concerns they have related to&#xD;
      developing a brain healthy lifestyle. The first videoconference will also provide&#xD;
      participants with an overview of the daily log form, instructions for completing it and&#xD;
      entering results every week in RedCap, and a reminder on the process of compensation for&#xD;
      completion of the logs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention for Cogtrastim group: The study intervention for this group will include a&#xD;
      review of the Cogtrastim model and explicit discussion of the possible mechanisms of action&#xD;
      of various activities that have been shown to be associated with better health in general&#xD;
      and, where supported by evidence, better mental functioning in older persons. Persons in this&#xD;
      group will be encouraged to select brain health activities based on the model. Early&#xD;
      videoconference sessions will also focus on strategies for behavior change, including&#xD;
      realistic goal setting, problem solving about possible difficulties, and assistance in&#xD;
      formulating a written plan to improve brain health. Participants will be encouraged to&#xD;
      develop a written program for brain health and to also develop self-monitoring habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be given access to the study website at www.sfbrainhealth.com which&#xD;
      will serve as a compendium of links to relevant and reviewed brain health resources (e.g.,&#xD;
      links to material on older adults and exercise on the websites of the Centers for Disease&#xD;
      Control and the National Institute on Aging).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to complete a baseline assessment (RedCap questionnaires and&#xD;
      Cognifit cognitive assessment) prior to participating in any other study procedures. They&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a daily study diary of their training activities for seven days in&#xD;
      weeks one, six, and 12 of the study. They will be given access to the Cognifit training&#xD;
      activities after completion of the baseline assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognifit training program: The Cognifit training program is based on an automated algorithm&#xD;
      that selects a variety of activities based on the participant's strengths and weaknesses as&#xD;
      well as their training history. At a summary level, Cognifit identifies which cognitive&#xD;
      abilities (of those covered in the applied training) are most in need of improvement, and how&#xD;
      long it has been since a cognitive ability has been trained. When, based on a series of&#xD;
      weightings of these variables, it is decided which cognitive capacity is to be trained, the&#xD;
      system checks which activities best train these cognitive capacities and how long it has been&#xD;
      since they were trained. In this way, the system ensures that training focuses heavily on the&#xD;
      cognitive abilities (and consequently on the tasks) that the user needs to train the most,&#xD;
      but without forgetting to continue training the cognitive abilities that the user has in good&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will be given access to weekly videoconferences brain health&#xD;
      topics and encouraged to develop a plan to improve their brain health during the 12 weeks of&#xD;
      the study. At the conclusion of this period, participants will be asked to complete the same&#xD;
      battery of measures they had completed at the beginning with the addition of a questionnaire&#xD;
      asking for ratings of the study interventions. They will be scheduled for an exit interview&#xD;
      during which a semi-structured interview outline will be used to assess participants'&#xD;
      reactions to the study and elicit their suggestions for improving future versions.&#xD;
