  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will assess the efficacy of sacral never stimulation (SNS) for the treatment&#xD;
      of adult patients with active, mild-to-moderate rheumatoid arthritis or those with refractory&#xD;
      disease. The study will enroll 60 subjects in a single center. All eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into two groups at a ratio of 1:1. Half of the subjects will receive SNS&#xD;
      (treatment) and the other half will receive sham stimulation (control). Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed up for 2-4 weeks, according to their response to the treatment. Disease activity&#xD;
      score, patient report outcomes and serum inflammatory cytokines will be observed before and&#xD;
      after treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may exert an anti-inflammatory effect&#xD;
      through mechanisms like cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP). This anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      function of VNS has been verified in collagen induced arthritis (CIA) rats, RA patients, and&#xD;
      animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In recent years, it was reported that&#xD;
      sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is a safer way to exert a similar anti-inflammatory effect as&#xD;
      VNS. Therefore, this study aims to explore the therapeutic effect of SNS on RA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled clinical trial which will enroll 60 eligible RA patients.&#xD;
      These subjects will be divided into two groups at a ratio of 1:1, the treatment group (Group&#xD;
      1) who will receive SNS and the control group (Group 2) who will receive sham stimulation.&#xD;
      The patients will lie in prone position. In Group 1, a senior acupuncture doctor will pierce&#xD;
      filiform needles through the sacral foramen into the S3 and S4 sacral nerves. These sites&#xD;
      correspond to the Zhongliao and Xialiao acupoints in Traditional Chinese Medicine. In Group&#xD;
      2, shallow acupuncture stimulation will be performed at sites 8-10cm away from the acupoints&#xD;
      in Group 1. In both groups, electrodes will be clamped on the filiform needles and an&#xD;
      electrical current of 0.5 mA will be delivered. The stimulation will last for 60 minutes&#xD;
      every time, once a day for 2 weeks. If the subjects respond to the treatment well, SNS&#xD;
      treatment will be continued for 2 weeks. The following parameters will be measured before and&#xD;
      2-4 weeks after treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Disease activity-related indexes of RA: swelling joint number (SJC), tender joint number&#xD;
           (TJC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, etc;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient report outcomes: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain score, Health Assessment&#xD;
           Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Indexes of autonomic nervous function: serum level of norepinephrine (NE), heart rate&#xD;
           variability (HRV).&#xD;
