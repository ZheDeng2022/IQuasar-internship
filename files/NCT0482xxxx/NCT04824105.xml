  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to find out if a device that temporarily alters brain activity (repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation, rTMS) might be used to change how people with anxiety or&#xD;
      related concerns cope with feared or anxiety-producing situations. The study is recruiting&#xD;
      people who recently started treatment for anxiety or a related concern. The study involves 3&#xD;
      visits to the Medical University of South Carolina. At the first visit, participants do&#xD;
      interviews and surveys asking about anxiety and related concerns, and they also do tasks&#xD;
      where they see and react to emotional pictures while their brain activation is measured. At&#xD;
      the next two visits, participants receive rTMS, which works by rapidly turning a focused&#xD;
      magnetic field on and off repeatedly over the head in a way that passes directly through the&#xD;
      hair, scalp, and skull and onto the brain and can temporarily increase brain activity under&#xD;
      the magnetic field. After rTMS, participants do two tasks where they see and react to&#xD;
      emotional situations while wearing sensors on their hand, arms, face, and head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each visit in this study is expected to last between 2 - 4 hours. This is not a treatment&#xD;
      study, but the study is being conducted with the hope that it will help improve treatment in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Task-Related Perceived Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately Pre-Stimulation and Immediately Post-Stimulation (Approx. 30 minutes between assessments)</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived control over aversive stimuli is queried after an experimental task in which participants prepare to avoid, escape, or simply be exposed to aversive pictures. Perceived control for each condition is queried using self-report Likert-type scales for each condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Difficulty of Avoiding Task-Based Aversive Exposure</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately Pre-Stimulation and Immediately Post-Stimulation (Approx. 30 minutes between assessments)</time_frame>
    <description>Difficulty of avoiding exposure to aversive stimulation is queried after each trial during a task in which participants can win money but also must evade a slow, moderate, or fast virtual predator. Avoidance difficulty is queried using a Likert-type scale delivered after each trial. The scale ranges from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater perceived difficulty of avoiding capture by the virtual predator.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in State Anxiety During Session</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately Pre-Stimulation and Immediately Post-Stimulation (Approx. 30 minutes between assessments)</time_frame>
    <description>State-level anxiety is measured throughout the experimental session using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State Form. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State Form uses 20 items querying anxiety symptom experience in the present moment to measure how anxiety fluctuates across the experimental session. The scale ranges from 20 to 80, with higher scores indicating higher state anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Task-Related Brain Activation</measure>
    <time_frame>During Session (Approx. 45 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood flow in the brain will be measured during completion of two experimental tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Blood flow in the brain can be used to measure what brain areas are being activated during the performance of a task.</description>

    <description>On one study day, participants will complete experimental tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging. On two other study days, participants will complete tasks before and after receiving repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). All participants will receive rTMS to ventromedial prefrontal cortex on one study day, and to pre-supplementary motor area on another study day.&#xD;
Two stimulation procedures will be used, one for ventromedial prefrontal cortex and one for pre-supplementary motor area. For both targets, 3 sessions of 600 pulses at 110% of resting motor threshold will be presented over 30 minutes. For ventromedial cortex, a session will involve intermittent theta burst triplets at 50 Hz for 2 seconds and repeated every 10 seconds for a total of 190 seconds. For pre-supplementary motor area, a session will involve continuous theta burst presented in 3-pulse bursts with 15 pulses/ sec.</description>
