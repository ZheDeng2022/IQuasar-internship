      Ninety (90) woman patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia according to the American College of&#xD;
      Rheumatology 2010 diagnostic criteria and 90 healthy volunteers were included. The&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) is used to assess the patient's functionality and&#xD;
      determine the severity of the disease. The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) assessed the level&#xD;
      and severity of fatigue. The short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire&#xD;
      (IPAQ-SF) used to asess physical activity levels.The kinesiophobia level was assessed by&#xD;
      using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia.&#xD;

      Our study consists of 180 female participants aged between 18 and 65 years who applied to the&#xD;
      physical therapy and rehabilitation outpatient clinic between April 2021 and August 2021.&#xD;
      This case-control study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants&#xD;
      gave written voluntary consent and enrolled in this case-control study.&#xD;

      Ninety (90) woman patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia according to the American College of&#xD;
      Rheumatology 2010 diagnostic criteria and 90 healthy volunteers were included. Fibromyalgia&#xD;
      Impact Questionnaire, Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale and The short form of&#xD;
      İnternational Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF) were completed. All scales were&#xD;
      filled in face to face for the participants. In addition, demographic data (age, gender,&#xD;
      height, weight, marital status, education level) and duration of fibromyalgia diagnosis were&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria for both groups; The presence of health problems that affect the level of&#xD;
      physical activity ( Cardiac or pulmonary insufficiency, limb amputation, recent surgery&#xD;
      history) and cognitive impairment that prevents answer questions&#xD;

    <description>The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) is used to assess the patient's functionality and determine the severity of the disease. The scale consists of 10 items and each item is 10 points. Therefore, the total maximum score is 100 points. Increasing scores indicate higher disease activity and lower functional status</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 day)</time_frame>
    <description>The kinesiophobia level was assessed by using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK). The TSK includes 17 item and assesses the subjective rating of kinesiophobia..Each item is scored by using a 4-point Likert-type scale, (1 point is reporting complete disagreement and 4 points is reporting complete agreement).The total points ranges between 17 and 68. Higher scores refer higher severity of kinesiophobia. Scores higher than 37 points mean high levels of kinesiophobia and scores less than or equal to 37 mean low levels of kinesiophobia</description>

    <description>The short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF) contains 7 questions that provide information about sitting, walking, and moderate to vigorous intensity activities. The total score includes the duration (minutes) and frequency (days) of intense activity. The sitting score (sedentary behavior level) is calculated separately. Each activity needs to be done for at least 10 minutes at a time</description>
