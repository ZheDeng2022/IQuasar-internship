    <textblock>
      Introduction. The thickening fibrotic of the skin in systemic sclerosis (SSc) could reduce&#xD;
      endogenous availability of Vitamin D by sun exposition. Vitamin D hypovitaminosis have been&#xD;
      described in high prevalence in autoimmune disease as SSc. The cholecalciferol contributes to&#xD;
      improve the balance TH1/Th2/Treg in favor anti-inflammation and anti-fibrotic profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim. to analyze the effect(s) of short-term cholecalciferol supplementation on cytokine&#xD;
      profile in Th1, Th2, and Treg cells subpopulations in SSc patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method. Randomized clinical trial conduct in patients with SSc (ACR-EULAR 2015) who signed&#xD;
      informed consent. General characteristics, severity of organ involvement scored by Medsger&#xD;
      disease severity scale (MsDSS) and cytokine Th1, Th2 and Treg will be determinate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be analyzed using SPSS software. It will be used parametric statistics for&#xD;
      normally distributed variables and nonparametric statistics for free distribution.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be carried out with prior authorization from the Local Research and Ethics&#xD;
      Committee. Patients entitled to our healthcare services and complying with screening criteria&#xD;
      will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with scleroderma included in our database will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      study through a telephone call. Patients complying with the screening criteria and accepting&#xD;
      to participate in the study will be given a date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the interview, they will be given the informed consent form. Once it has been&#xD;
      signed, they will be asked to complete clinical recorder and serum samples were collected for&#xD;
      biochemical determinations including Vitamin D status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patients have completed the initial evaluations, another visit will be scheduled two&#xD;
      weeks later. Patients with hypovitaminosis D result will be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      groups: Group 1. Vitamin D3 supplementation and Group 2. Dietary recommendations. Two groups&#xD;
      given instructions to follow dietary recommendations or to receive vitamin D3 supplementation&#xD;
      and complete the medical measurements. Additionally, the investigators included SSc patients&#xD;
      with vitamin D sufficiency and another one with healthy donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the second visit (four weeks later), clinical data and the following parameters will be&#xD;
      recorded: calcium, phosforus, parathyroid hormone by quimioluniscencia 25-hydroxyvitamin D&#xD;
      serum status by ELISA, intracellular cytokine (IL-2, INF-γ, IL-4 and IL-10) production from&#xD;
      Th1, Th2 and Treg lymphocytes by flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1. Daily oral dosages of 5,000 UI vitamin D3 during 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2. Dietary recommendations according to the recommendations for normal daily intake of&#xD;
      vitamin D in food during 4 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And additionally, the investigators are including SSc group with vitamin D sufficiency and&#xD;
      healthy donors both as comparators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group will be given written instructions regarding the drug use. At the end of the&#xD;
      supplementations another visit will be scheduled to check for treatment compliance (remaining&#xD;
      capsules will be counted) and patients will complete the second clinical evaluations and&#xD;
      calcium, phosforus, parathyroid hormone by quimioluniscencia 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum status&#xD;
      by ELISA, intracellular cytokine (IL-2, INF-γ, IL-4 and IL-10) production from Th1, Th2 and&#xD;
      Treg lymphocytes by flow cytometry. At the end the statistical analysis will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be asked to complete a form recording symptoms and potential adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphocyte Separation Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density&#xD;
      gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Hypaque; Sigma-Aldrich) from freshly drawn venous blood.&#xD;
      Intracellular cytokine production in PBMCs (1x106 cells/tube) were stimulated at 37ºC for 4h&#xD;
      with Ionomicyn calcium salt from Streptomyces conglobates (1μg/ 1 x106 cells, Sigma-Aldrich),&#xD;
      Brefeldin A (10μg/ 1 x106 cells, Cayman chemical company) and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate&#xD;
      (PMA-25ng/1 x106 cells, Sigma-Aldrich).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell Surface and Intracellular Staining of T Cells PBMCs were resuspended with (PBS)&#xD;
      phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stained with monoclonal&#xD;
      conjugated antibodies with either fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC), peridinin chlorophyll&#xD;
      protein complex (PerCP), phyco-erythrin (PE) or allophycocyanin (APC) and directed to CD69&#xD;
      (L/78), CD25, CD3, CD4 (BD PharmigenTM and BD Bioscience) for 20 min. For intracellular&#xD;
      staining of IL-4 (BD PharmigenTM), IL-2, INF-γ (BD Fast Immune), FoxP3 (Affymetrix) and IL10&#xD;
      (eBioscinence), cells previously were fixed using fixation buffer (BioLegend) for 20 min at&#xD;
      room temperature followed by a washing step with permeabilization buffer (Perm/Wash Buffer BD&#xD;
      Pharmigen TM) according to the manufacture's protocols, then staining cells were incubated&#xD;
      with monoclonal antibody for 20 min at room temperature and resuspended in PBS buffer.&#xD;
      Evaluation of Th1, Th2 and Treg subpopulations by flow cytometry were determinate as IL-2+&#xD;
      and INF-γ+ percentages expression for Th1 lymphocytes, IL-4+ for Th2, and CD25+FoxP3+IL-10+&#xD;
      for Treg within the CD3+CD4+ gate. Data were acquired and analyzed using a four-parameter&#xD;
      flow cytometer FACS Calibur using ProCellQuest software (Beckman Coulter; BD Biosciences) and&#xD;
      Flowing Software (Version 2.5.1) Cell Imaging Core .&#xD;
