    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, non-randomized, prospective single arm study of adult subjects&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes utilizing 670G insulin pump therapy with Continuous Glucose Monitoring&#xD;
      (CGM). These subjects will be using 4 DUO Extended sets that will serve as an exploratory&#xD;
      pilot study to assess the 7-day survival of the Duo Extended set.&#xD;

      Up to 20 adult subjects will be enrolled at the research center. Atlanta Diabetes Associates&#xD;
      (ADA), with at least 15 subjects meeting the eligibility criteria. Eligibility criteria will&#xD;
      be assessed at the screening visit and confirmed prior to Visit 2. At Visit 2, subjects will&#xD;
      be provided supplies, including the DUO device, and will be trained on insertion. Each&#xD;
      subject will wear their own MiniMed 670G insulin system including Guardian sensor (new sensor&#xD;
      with transmitter will be provided for the study) and a DUO Extended set. The infusion set in&#xD;
      the DUO Extended will be used for insulin infusion and the sensor in the DUO Extended will be&#xD;
      blinded with a specific recorder connected to each sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guardian Sensor (3) and the SMBG measurements will be used for making therapy decisions as&#xD;
      approved for the 670G system. Subjects will upload their pump, Contour meter and GS3 sensor&#xD;
      data each week, which will be reviewed by an investigator. Subjects will wear the DUO device&#xD;
      for a total of four weeks. At Visit 6, subjects will come to the site to have devices&#xD;
      uploaded, to return the investigational devices, to have a skin assessment and for labs to be&#xD;
      drawn.&#xD;
