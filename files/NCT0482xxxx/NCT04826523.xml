  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is an aggressive and rare cancer of myeloid cells (a white blood&#xD;
      cell responsible for fighting infections). This study will assess how safe and effective oral&#xD;
      venetoclax is in participants with AML . Adverse events and change in disease activity will&#xD;
      be monitored under routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax is an approved drug for treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Around 600&#xD;
      participants of age 19 years and above will be enrolled in the study in multiple medical&#xD;
      institutions across South Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive oral venetoclax tablets as prescribed by their physician in the&#xD;
      routine clinical practice. Participants will be observed for 7 cycles ( each cycle is 28&#xD;
      days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their&#xD;
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or&#xD;
      clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests,&#xD;
      checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Reported Serious Adverse Event/Drug Reaction</measure>
    <time_frame>32 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent adverse events/treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity on or after the first dose of study drug.</description>
