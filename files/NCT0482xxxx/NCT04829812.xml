      Real-life practice survey of vascular specialist in France caring for patients with a leg&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The leg ulcer is a frequent and recurrent chronic disease of the lower limb, causing an&#xD;
      impairment in the quality of life of patients and at a significant cost to society. Medical&#xD;
      compression is essential for the healing of a leg ulcer. However, the leg ulcer is often&#xD;
      associated with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), the prevalence of which in this population&#xD;
      varies depending on the detection method used and the stage of arterial disease. The&#xD;
      association of a leg ulcer with PAD can occur two problems: the indication for compression&#xD;
      and the validity of vascular explorations to detect arterial involvement and assess its&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first issue concerns the use of compression in the presence of an PAD, which is the&#xD;
      subject of controversy. Indeed, compression can improve tissue perfusion by reducing edema,&#xD;
      but it carries a potential risk of ischemia and worsening of the ulcer, which probably&#xD;
      increases with the progressive stage of PAD. Thus, medical compression is sometimes&#xD;
      contraindicated, but the PAD severity threshold setting the contraindication varies from one&#xD;
      recommendation to another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second problem concerns the validity of the detection and quantification methods of the&#xD;
      PAD. Arterial involvement is probably underestimated by the clinic alone, in these patients&#xD;
      whose mobility is sometimes reduced or who have trophic disorders of mixed origin, and the&#xD;
      use of additional examinations (Doppler ultrasound, ankle or toe systolic pressures, TcPO2 or&#xD;
      other vascular explorations) is necessary. There is no specific studies in the context of leg&#xD;
      ulcers nevertheless hemodynamic measurements remain important to guide the indication (and&#xD;
      the contraindication) for compression and the choice of the type of compression, suitable for&#xD;
      each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems important to evaluate this management charge by a practice investigation, in real&#xD;
      life. Thus, the aim of this study is an observation of the real-life survey type of vasculars&#xD;
      specialists in France caring for patients with a leg ulcer for which compression treatment&#xD;
      would be indicated and arterial disease of the lower limbs. This is a prospective cohort with&#xD;
      inclusion of consecutive or pseudo-consecutive patients by vascular specialist. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed to ulcer development and tolerance of compression during 6 months.&#xD;
