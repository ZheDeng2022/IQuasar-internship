  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Good development of executive functions at school has been related to a better adaptation of&#xD;
      children in different areas of their daily life and, especially, with adequate academic&#xD;
      performance. Taking into account the importance of play in childhood, some interventions&#xD;
      aimed at training these cognitive processes have been based on the use of playful elements,&#xD;
      such as modern board games. Although it is still an unexplored field of research, some&#xD;
      studies with older elementary school children and with ADHD children have found significant&#xD;
      improvements in executive functions after training that had the board game as a key&#xD;
      intervention element. However, we still do not have studies that have explored the possible&#xD;
      cognitive benefits of its use throughout the primary stage with the general population. For&#xD;
      this reason, the main objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of a cognitive&#xD;
      training program based on modern board games in primary education children (6 to 12 years&#xD;
      old).&#xD;

      As hypotheses, it is established that: i) the experimental group will present a significantly&#xD;
      greater improvement in the neuropsychological tasks that measure executive functions and&#xD;
      associated cognitive processes compared to the passive control group after the intervention;&#xD;
      ii) the experimental group will present a significantly greater improvement in the tests&#xD;
      evaluated by their parents after the intervention compared to the passive control group. All&#xD;
      hypotheses will be controlled for age, estimate of IQ and socioeconomic status, as well as&#xD;
      previous experience in board games and other cognitive activities.&#xD;

    <description>adapted from &quot;Parent Survey of Typical Child Time Spent in Less-structured Activities&quot; (Barker et al., 2014) In this survey, parents are asked (with the help of their children) about the time their children dedicate to less-structured and recreational activities using a using a 7-point scale (from lowest to highest frequency). High scores on each item mean a higher frequency in that activity. The sum of all the scores on each item (where 1= 'Never' and 7 = 'Daily') results in a typical less-structured activity score.</description>

    <description>&quot;The Parent Play Beliefs Scale (PPBS)&quot; (Fogle &amp; Mendez, 2006) It consists of 30 items with 5 response options ranging from 1 (Disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree). Two subscales have been considered: a) Play support; b) Acedemic focus.&#xD;
The Play Support subscale refers to parents' positive beliefs about the relevance of play for children's development and about their participation in play with children. High scores on this subscale indicate that parents enjoy play, prioritize play, and view it as a means of teaching.&#xD;
The Academic focus subscale is made up of elements about the parents' emphasis on academic skills and the belief that play can promote their development. The Academic focus subscale is made up of elements about the parents' emphasis on academic skills and the belief that play can promote their development. High scores on this subscale would indicate that parents see the academic role of play as important.</description>

    <description>The program consisted of 12 one-hour intervention sessions. The sessions were biweekly with a total duration of 6 weeks. The modern board and card games used in the program were Bee Alert (Knizia, 2012), Monster Match (Gruhl &amp; Weir, 2018), Sherlock Express (Kermarrec, 2019), Streams (Itsubaki, 2011) and Blurble (Bernard, 2013). The play sessions were carried out in groups of between 2 and 4 boys and girls of similar ages (same school stage) formed according to the availability of the participants. In the sessions, the physical games were projected on the videoconference tool by the researcher and the participating boys and girls carried out their actions using their voice and the platform tools. The program was gamified though a narrative about a space travel to different planets in discovering new games and get different mission badges and super team badges in their logbook.</description>
