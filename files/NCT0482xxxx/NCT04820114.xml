  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Distal radius fracture is the most common upper extremity fracture with peak incidence among&#xD;
      older women after the fifth decade of life. Proprioception is one constituent of a complex&#xD;
      Sensory motor control process. Proprioception requires the reception and central integration&#xD;
      of incoming afferent signals. Although various sensory and motor deficits have been&#xD;
      correlated with significant functional impairment after wrist trauma, limited research exists&#xD;
      on the effects of proprioception and multi sensory training after distal radius fracture.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled, single-center, double-blind, clinical trial, with 1:1 allocation&#xD;
      ratio, will be carried out involving patients diagnosis of distal radius fracture (aged 18&#xD;
      years and above). Both assessor and statistician will remained blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard rehabilitation program for distal radius fracture treatments will received for both&#xD;
      the control and experimental groups for a period of 12 weeks. The experimental group, in&#xD;
      addition, will received a proprioceptive training program during the same intervention&#xD;
      period, which will be conducted twice weekly (24 sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of pain with activity will be measured according to the visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS). PRWE questionnaire will be used to measure upper extremity function. Patient's&#xD;
      occupational performance will be measured with the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure&#xD;
      (COPM) and proprioception with Joint position sense (JPS) and force sense (FS) testing. All&#xD;
      outcome measures will be collected at baseline, immediately following the intervention at 3&#xD;
      weeks and at 12 weeks following the end of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will be voluntary and patients will be included if they satisfied&#xD;
      specific inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures will be follow in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible&#xD;
      committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration. All participants will sign a written informed consent in accordance with&#xD;
      guidelines approved by the local ethics committee.&#xD;

    <measure>Joint position Sense (JPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Proprioception using active joint position sense (JPS) has been utilized in studies to establish a correlation between therapy intervention and proprioception. Joint angle will be measured using a standard clear plastic goniometer.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Force sense (FS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline- 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle strength (MS) is one of the most important factors affecting human performance. Force sense (FS) is also known as sense of effort / heaviness / tension or the force matching sense. It is the ability to reproduce (or match) a desired level of force one or more times.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-3 months</time_frame>
    <description>VAS has been shown to be a reliable and valid instrument for pain assessment which is used frequently for clinical and research purposes. It consists of a 10-cm line anchored at each end. The left-hand anchor reads 'no pain' and the right-hand anchor reads 'worst possible pain'; the patients marked a line to represent their pain level.</description>

    <description>Patient's occupational performance will be measured with the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM). The COPM enables subjects to identify goals for hand therapy and engage in a subject-specific therapeutic process.</description>
