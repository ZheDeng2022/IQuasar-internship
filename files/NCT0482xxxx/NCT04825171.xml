  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bryophyllum pinnatum (BP) is a succulent perennial plant from the family Crassulacea (for&#xD;
      reviews see Fürer 2016 and Hamburger 2017). Leaf extracts from BP have been used in&#xD;
      traditional medicine to treat wounds and ulcers, skin diseases, infections, inflammations,&#xD;
      pain, diabetes, hypertension, and cancer. In Europe, BP started to be used at the beginning&#xD;
      of the 20th century in Anthroposophic medicine, a form of holistic medicine with an&#xD;
      integrative approach. Almost a hundred years later, BP preparations are still often&#xD;
      prescribed in Anthroposophic medicine, where it is used in the treatment of a broad spectrum&#xD;
      of diagnoses, most often of mental and behavioural disorders (ICD-10 F00-F99), including&#xD;
      anxiety, depressive, and sleep disorders (Simões-Wüst 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Switzerland, during the last decade, BP (50 % tablets) started to be used in conventional&#xD;
      settings mainly in the treatment of preterm labour (Simões-Wüst 2018, Plangger 2006),&#xD;
      overactive bladder (Betschart 2013), sleep disorders (Simões-Wüst 2015), and restless legs&#xD;
      syndrome (Von Manitius 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas the good effectiveness of BP preparations in the treatment of preterm contractions&#xD;
      and overactive bladder is well supported by data obtained using a variety of in vitro models&#xD;
      (see e.g. Santos 2018, Bachmann 2017, Simões-Wüst 2010), less is known about possible&#xD;
      mechanisms of action that would support their use in the treatment of mental and behavioural&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the observed improvements of sleep disorders are corroborated by animal&#xD;
      experiments showing that different fractions of the leaf extract of BP can prolong the&#xD;
      pentobarbitone-induced sleeping time (Yemitan 2005 and Pal 1999), indicating a CNS depressant&#xD;
      action. Some of the bufadienolides present in Bryophyllum species are thought to be&#xD;
      responsible for the sedative effects (Wagner 1986).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to find out if patients suffering from anxiety symptoms&#xD;
      perceive improvements of these symptoms during treatment with Bryophyllum 50% tablets. Since&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms are often related to depression, reduced sleep quality, stress, reduced&#xD;
      health-related quality of life and the feeling of not being able to control owns life&#xD;
      (internal coherence), these aspects will be assessed as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present IIT (Investigator-Initiated Trial) study is a prospective, single-group, pre-post&#xD;
      study (phase IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A past study showed that among Anthroposophical physicians the most frequent diagnosis group&#xD;
      where BP preparations are prescribed are mental and behavioural disorders such as anxiety and&#xD;
      sleep disorders. In the present study, we, therefore, want to investigate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of Bryophyllum tablets in patients with anxiety symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be recruited among the patients on the waiting list of the Department&#xD;
      of Psychiatry and Psychosomatics at the Clinic Arlesheim.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant recruitment will continue until 60 patients have concluded the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment period will probably last 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of the drug administration is 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill in a questionnaire three times. At baseline, after two and after three&#xD;
      weeks of Bryophyllum intake.&#xD;

    <description>Assessed with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI, Beckler 2010) score between before treatment and after 2 weeks of treatment. BAI is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory that is used for measuring the severity of anxiety in children and adults. The questions ask about common symptoms of anxiety that the subject has had during the past week (including the day you take it) (such as numbness and tingling, sweating not due to heat, and fear of the worst happening). Each answer to a BAI-question is scored on a scale value of 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely). Higher total scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms. The standardized cut-offs are: 0-7, minimal anxiety; 8-15, mild anxiety; 16-25, moderate anxiety; 26-63, severe anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Change of anxiety symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>2 and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7, Williams 2014) questionnaire. GAD-7 is used to measure symptoms and severity of anxiety; scores range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. Total scores classify symptoms as normal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), and severe (15-21). A total score≥8 is indicative of clinically significant anxiety symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change of depression symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>2 and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the nine-question depression scale (PHQ-9, Spitzer 1999). PHQ-9 is used to assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms; scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. Total scores classify depression symptoms as normal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), moderate-severe (15-19) and severe (20-27). A total score ≥10 is indicative of clinically significant symptoms of depression and of a DSM-IV diagnosis of depression.</description>

    <measure>Change of stress symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>2 and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS, Klein 2016). Individual scores on the PSS can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>2 and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI, Buysse 1989). The PSQI contains 19 self-rated questions and are combined to form seven &quot;component&quot; scores, each of which has a range of 0-3 points. In all cases, a score o &quot;0&quot; indicates no difficulty, while a score of &quot;3&quot; indicates severe difficulty. The seven component scores are then added to yield one &quot;global&quot; score, with a range of 0-21 points, &quot;0&quot; indicating no difficulty and &quot;21&quot; indicating severe difficulties in all areas.</description>

    <time_frame>2 and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the Health-related Quality of Life questionnaire (SF-12, Morfeld 2011). The 12 items allow the calculation of two health summary measures, namely physical health summary and mental health summary scales. The scores range from 0 to 60 with higher scores indicating higher degree of difficulty in life.</description>
