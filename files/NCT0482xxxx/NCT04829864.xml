    <description>The program is offered by two facilitators to groups of three to seven women, in-person or online. The program is divided in three phases entitles &quot;Becoming a mother&quot;; &quot;A look at my own history&quot; and &quot;Looking ahead&quot;. The first phase aims to explore and normalize the emotions experienced by the participants in the course of their pregnancy and to support the use of healthy emotion regulation strategies. The second phase aims to support mentalization of trauma, by discussing the nature of trauma and its impact; by validating participants' feelings as understandable responses to trauma; by supporting a reflection on positive and harsh experiences with significant others and the ways both types of experiences influenced participants' mental states; and identifying how participants coped with trauma. In the last phase, discussions focus on participants' needs and strengths, on available resources to support resilience and envision positive and challenging moments with the child.</description>
