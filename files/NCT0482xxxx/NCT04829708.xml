  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open,multicenter, randomized controlled phase III clinical trial. In&#xD;
      patients with LS-SCLC who achieve remission after first-line chemoradiotherapy, the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of PCI or MRI surveillance is evaluated and analyzed. PCI is performed in hopes of&#xD;
      preventing spread of cancer into the brain. The use of brain MRI alone may reduce side&#xD;
      effects of receiving PCI and prolong patients' lifespan. MRI surveillance alone (delaying&#xD;
      radiation until the actual brain metastasis) may be not inferior to PCI.&#xD;
