      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and performance of the Omega™ LAA (Left&#xD;
      Atrial Appendage) Occluder and Omega™ Delivery System in LAA (Left Atrial Appendage) closure&#xD;
      for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and high bleeding risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Omega™ LAA (Left Atrial Appendage) Occluder used in combination with the indicated Omega™&#xD;
      Delivery System is a permanent implant to the left atrial appendage for percutaneous&#xD;
      insertion. LLA (Left Atrial Appendage) occlusion appears to be a feasible option for stroke&#xD;
      reduction in AF patients at high risk for stroke, who are contraindicated for anticoagulation&#xD;
      or who suffered a stroke despite OC. This study will evaluate safety and performance, using a&#xD;
      study design which is based on inputs from pre-clinical testing, the risk analysis and data&#xD;
      available from other LAA (Left Atrial Appendage) devices.&#xD;
