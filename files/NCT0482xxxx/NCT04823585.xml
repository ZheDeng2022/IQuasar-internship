      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      to investigate the efficacy of Mepolizumab 100 milligram (mg) every month compared to placebo&#xD;
      in reducing validated Sinonasal Outcome Test -22 score and on reducing endoscopic Nasal Polyp&#xD;
      Score. The participants have a triad of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP),&#xD;
      asthma and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD). The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate whether mepolizumab reduces the need for increased drug dosage&#xD;
      (topical corticosteroid or bronchodilator dosage) and improves lung and nasal function more&#xD;
      effectively than placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This first visit ensures the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the subject. If necessary,&#xD;
      NERD will be verified by an ASA challenge test at a second additional visit. Participants&#xD;
      have also 6 visits, on four of which subcutaneous injection of the study product is&#xD;
      administered. During visits, a clinical examination, airway function tests, and nasal, blood,&#xD;
      urine, and stool samples are also taken to elucidate predictive biomarkers of severely&#xD;
      symptomatic NERD patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline at Week 16 in endoscopic Nasal polyp score of nasal cavity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal polyp score is graded based on polyp size from 0 = no polyps to 4 = large polyps causing complete obstruction of inferior nasal cavity. The score ranges between 0 and 110. A higher score means worse outcome.The Nasal polyp score FEV1% is measured by spirometry. A higher value means better lung function = better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline at Week 16 in relative Forced expiatory volume in 1 second (FEV1 %) without bronchodilator.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1% is measured by spirometry. It is the volume of air (in liters) exhaled in the first second during forced exhalation after maximal inspiration, in relation to the validated national reference value of subjects with similar age, gender and height.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exacerbation of respiratory symptoms by acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or another NSAID.&#xD;
             (NERD will be verified by another visit if necessary).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  chronic rhinosinusitis with bilateral polyps. Endoscopic bilateral nasal polyp score&#xD;
             of at least 5 (out of 8), with a minimum score of 2 in each nasal cavity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lund Mackay score ≥12 (maximum 24) of sinus computed tomography (CT) or cone beam&#xD;
             (CBCT) scans. The new sinus CT/CBCT scans are needed if the previous sinus CT/CBCT&#xD;
             scans have been performed over 36 months before recruitment visit or if there is a&#xD;
             suspicion of complication of CRS (f.ex. mucocele, invasive fungal rhinosinusitis).&#xD;
             Pregnant and breast-feeding subject will be excluded. Females of Reproductive&#xD;
             Potential (FRPs) who are not pregnant or breast-feeding may be enrolled. FRPs need to&#xD;
             perform pregnancy test prior to the CT/CBCT scans. If subject is already on&#xD;
             contraception prior to the study this should be continued. The data of previous sinus&#xD;
             CT/CBCT scans will be used if previous sinus CT/CBCT scans have been performed ≤36&#xD;
             months prior to recruitment visit. The clinical information of sinus CT/CBCT scans is&#xD;
             critical to enrolling appropriate subjects for the research and cannot readily be&#xD;
             obtained another way. The radiation dose of sinus CT/CBCT scans is less than 0.1 mSv,&#xD;
             which corresponds to less than 10 days of natural background radiation in Finland.&#xD;
             This dose has not been shown to increase the cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥1 previous CRS-surgery. Note that the last CRS-surgery must have been performed at&#xD;
             least 6 months before 1st visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SNOT-22 ≥25&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one other symptom, such as partial loss of smell (hyposmia), nasal&#xD;
             obstruction, total loss of smell (anosmia), or anterior or posterior rhinorrhea&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patient should have a history of at least one exacerbation during the past two years&#xD;
             e.g. at least one criterion must be fulfilled of the following list during the past&#xD;
             two years ≥1 oral corticosteroids; ≥3 antibiotic courses; ≥1 CRS-operation; ≥ 1 asthma&#xD;
             hospitalization. In patients with contraindications of previously listed treatment or&#xD;
             continuous oral steroids, additional criteria are not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Asthma diagnosis (patient has the National Social Insurance Institution´s&#xD;
             reimbursement right for asthma medication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peripheral blood eosinophils (PBEos) &gt;300 cells/ul at visit 1 OR (PBEos &gt;150 cells/ul&#xD;
             at visit 1 AND a history of PBEos &gt;300 cells/ul during the past 12 months). A history&#xD;
             of Nasal polyp tissue eosinophilia (NPeos) ≥30% during the past 12 months is a&#xD;
             supportive criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 70 years&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  pregnancy/ breastfeeding. FRPs need to perform pregnancy test prior to the CT/CBCT&#xD;
             scans. If subject is already on contraception prior to the study this should be&#xD;
             continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  complication of CRS (f.ex. mucocele, invasive fungal rhinosinusitis). Take sinus&#xD;
             CT/CBCT scans, if needed!&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  acute rhinosinusitis/respiratory infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  severe disease related to airways/ immunology: cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary&#xD;

             syndrome;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  other severe disease such as active cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received biologic therapy/systemic immunosuppressant/ASA desensitization&#xD;
             therapy/experimental monoclonal antibody treatment to treat inflammatory or autoimmune&#xD;

             patient is allowed to use ASA dose &lt;100 mg/day due to cardiovascular reasons after ASA&#xD;
             desensitization.&#xD;
