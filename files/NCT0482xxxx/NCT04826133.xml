  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore the effects of acute pre-treatment with&#xD;
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol), as compared to placebo on the behavioral (e.g.,&#xD;
      attempts to self-administer and ultimate number of infusions/boluses of cocaine&#xD;
      self-administered), neurocognitive (e.g., performance on computerized tests of reward related&#xD;
      learning such as the probabilistic selection task or PST and probabilistic reward task or&#xD;
      PRT), and subjective effects (e.g, computerized visual analog scale [VAS] ratings of&#xD;
      euphoria/, craving, etc.) of cocaine in experienced, non-treatment seeking users of the drug.&#xD;

    <measure>Probabilistic Selection Task (PST)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Probabilistic Selection Task (PST) is a computerized task that assesses the tendency to learn from positive versus negative outcomes. PST will be analyzed using linear mixed models with treatment and time included as a within subjects variable.</description>

    <measure>Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT) is a computerized task that uses an asymmetric reinforcement schedule to produce a response bias towards the more frequently rewarded of two possible stimuli. PRT will be analyzed using linear mixed models with treatment and time included as a within subjects variable.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Effects of Cocaine / Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>150 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>During cocaine sessions, subjects will complete a series of self rated subjective effects measuring how they feel on cocaine, using a scale of 0 (not at all) to 10 (most ever). VAS ratings will focus on euphoria (&quot;high&quot;) as a primary outcome, however, other positive, negative, psychomotor, and drug-craving ratings (e.g. good, bad, stimulated, paranoid, hungry, etc.) will be collected as well. Ratings are implemented on a touch-screen laptop computer and presented every 5 minutes, throughout the session</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive an oral administration of calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) 1.5 μg (three capsules of 0.5 μg each) at 9 pm, night before each cocaine session, and at 8 am, morning of each cocaine session. This dose of calcitriol is lower than doses safely administered in other human studies and for a duration of time shorter than doses safely administered in other trials. In addition, this dose has been already tested by our group, subject of a different grant application, and should be effective at enhancing stimulant's induced dopamine release, in comparison to placebo.</description>
