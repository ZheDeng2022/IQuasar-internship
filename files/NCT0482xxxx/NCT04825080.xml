      There is debate on the natural history of asymptomatic severe carotid artery stenosis.&#xD;
      Previous studies conducted more than 20 years ago revealed the benefit of carotid&#xD;
      endarterectomy compared with medical therapy only on the stroke prevention. However, today it&#xD;
      seems that the current medical regimen can reduce the cerebral ischemic event rate in&#xD;
      patients with asymptomatic severe carotid artery stenosis to less than 1% per year, making it&#xD;
      questionable to choose the surgical treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Primary end point is to evaluate the rate of cerebral ischemic events (stroke or&#xD;
      transient ischemic attack) in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis &gt; 60%&#xD;
      (Nascet criteria) in a 5-year follow-up period. It is a prospective observational study&#xD;
      conducted on patients enrolled from January 2019 to March 2020 and with the end of follow-up&#xD;
      scheduled in 2025.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical therapy recommended includes antihypertensive drugs to maintain good blood&#xD;
      pressure control, statin therapy and antiplatelet administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points are the evaluation of plaque progression, the identification of&#xD;
      comorbidities or plaque characteristics associated with a higher risk for cerebral ischemic&#xD;
      events and the patient adherence to the best medical therapy in a real world scenario. The&#xD;
      global survival and the factors influencing survival will be investigated as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Separate analyses are performed for patients with total carotid occlusion or carotid artery&#xD;
      re-stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's cohort: with the hypothesis of 3 neurologic (transient ischemic attack or stroke)&#xD;
      events per 100 patients/year during a 5 years follow-up period and consequently a number of&#xD;
      40-50 events (primary outcome), the study cohort with a native asymptomatic carotid artery&#xD;
      stenosis will include at least 300 patients. Patients with carotid occlusion or restenosis&#xD;
      are evaluated separately for a secondary analysis only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are prospectively identified and enrolled in a single center vascular surgery&#xD;
      ambulatory and a duplex ultrasonography (DUS) laboratory. Carotid artery stenosis are&#xD;
      identified and the degree of stenosis &gt;60% (NASCET criteria) is evaluated according to the&#xD;
      current guidelines for stenosis identification through blood flow velocities. Patients&#xD;
      enrollment goes from January 2019 to March 2020. The investigators prospectively complete the&#xD;
      dedicated database including clinical characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, medical&#xD;
      therapy in use, features of the carotid plaque and contralateral carotid status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical characteristics included in the database: age, sex, hypertension (systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure ≥140 or/and diastolic ≥90 mmHg, or specific therapy), dyslipidemia (total&#xD;
      cholesterol ≥200 mg/dl or low density lipoprotein ≥120 mg/dl or specific therapy), diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (pre-diagnosed, in therapy with oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin), current&#xD;
      smoking, coronary artery disease (defined as a history of angina pectoris, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction or coronary revascularization), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (defined as&#xD;
      chronic bronchitis or emphysema), chronic kidney disease (glomerular filtration rate &lt;60&#xD;
      ml/min), contralateral carotid occlusion, stenosis and atrial fibrillation (paroxysmal or&#xD;
      permanent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical therapy: antiplatelet types, anticoagulant therapy, statin therapy, anti hypertensive&#xD;
      medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotid plaque characteristics for the analysis: degree of stenosis (flow measurement&#xD;
      analysis), plaque ulcerations and echoluncency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up consists of a telephone interview any six months and an annual clinical and&#xD;
      duplex examination until a 5-years follow-up is reached or the patient withdraws from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that will be enrolled will sign specific consents. Sensitive patient information&#xD;
      will not be available during data analysis. The clinical study will be carried out according&#xD;
      to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and following the active regulations&#xD;
      on observational studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who underwent a transient ischemic attach or a stroke within the 6-months before the&#xD;
      enrollment are excluded from the study. Any neurological symptom occurred during the&#xD;
      follow-up needs to be certified by an in hospital neurologist physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Continuous variables were described with mean and standard deviation.&#xD;
      Continuous variables were compared by unpaired Student' t test in case of normal&#xD;
      distribution, otherwise by Mann-Whitney's test. The differences between percentages were&#xD;
      assessed using Fisher's test or Chi-square test, when appropriate. Univariate analysis will&#xD;
      be performed by Kaplan Meier analysis (log-rank test) and single factor Cox analysis .&#xD;
      Multivariate analyses with Cox analysis will be performed including factors considered&#xD;
      statistical significant (P value ≤ .05) at the univariate analyses. Risk factors were&#xD;
      reported as hazard ratio (HR) and 95% of confidence interval (CI). A value of p ≤ .05&#xD;
      (two-tailed) was considered to be significant. The statistical tests were performed using&#xD;
      SPSS® 21.0 for Windows® (SPSS, Chicago, Il, USA).&#xD;
