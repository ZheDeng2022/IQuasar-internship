        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must voluntarily participate in this clinical study. Be willing written&#xD;
             informed consent form (ICF) prior to any study activity.&#xD;

          3. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Surgically or medically castrated, with serum testosterone levels of ≤50 ng/dL (≤1.73&#xD;
             nmol/L). If the patient is being treated with LHRH agonists/antagonists (patient who&#xD;
             have not undergone orchiectomy), this therapy must be continued throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients have adequate organ functions, as indicated by the following laboratory&#xD;
             values (had not received blood transfusion, apheresis infusion, erythropoietin,&#xD;
             granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and other relevant medical support&#xD;
             within 14 days before the administration of study drug).&#xD;

          2. Prior treatment with a polyadenosine 5'diphosphoribose polymerisation (PARP)&#xD;
             inhibitor, including Senaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to Senaparib or any of the component of&#xD;
             Senaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Initiating bisphosphonate/denosumab therapy or adjusting bisphosphonate/denosumab&#xD;
             dose/regimen within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Patients on a&#xD;
             stable bisphosphonate/denosumab regimen are eligible and may continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who have received strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 which cannot be&#xD;
             discontinued 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug and withheld throughout the&#xD;
             study drug treatment. Patients received phenobarbital/enzalutamide will require a&#xD;
             5-week washout prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with MDS or AML, or with clinical features suggestive of MDS or AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with serious acute or chronic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients who have received a live virus or bacterial or RNA vaccination within 28 days&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients are unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully&#xD;
             with the investigator or designee.&#xD;
