    <textblock>
      Most symptomatic pathologies of the ankle and hindfoot are determined by biomechanical&#xD;
      alterations of this anatomical region. Surgical treatment of these pathologies is therefore&#xD;
      aimed at improving the inferior biomechanical condition, and it can be expected that an&#xD;
      improvement of the biomechanical parameters grossly parallels the targeted clinical&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3D Multisegment Foot Models have been developed and validated to determine the clinical&#xD;
      outcome. Such a validated 3D Multisegment Foot Model is now standard available in the gaitlab&#xD;
      of UZ Leuven making it possible to study a huge amount of biomechanical parameters within the&#xD;
      foot &amp; ankle region itself.&#xD;

      Most symptomatic pathologies of the ankle and hindfoot are determined by biomechanical&#xD;
      alterations of this anatomical region. Surgical treatment of these pathologies is therefore&#xD;
      aimed at improving the inferior biomechanical condition, and it can be expected that an&#xD;
      improvement of the biomechanical parameters grossly parallels the targeted clinical&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, in the past, biomechanical examination of the lower limb and foot consisted of&#xD;
      two distinct study protocols: gaitlab and plantar pressure measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, these two study protocols were acquired completely independently. Therefore, it proved&#xD;
      to be very hard to compare the results and get insight in the way altered biomechanics caused&#xD;
      or continued to cause abnormal plantar pressure distributions. However, recently it was&#xD;
      possible to integrate these two modalities, especially concerning the timing of the events,&#xD;
      what makes it possible to reliably link the observed findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, virtually all gaitlab models considered the foot &amp; ankle region as one single&#xD;
      segment, making it impossible to evaluate any biomechanical parameter within the targeted&#xD;
      region. 3D Multisegment Foot Models have been developed and validated since the beginning of&#xD;
      this century. Such a validated 3D Multisegment Foot Model is now standard available in the&#xD;
      gaitlab of UZ Leuven making it possible to study a huge amount of biomechanical parameters&#xD;
      within the foot &amp; ankle region itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, only a paucity of information is available if the observed clinical changes are&#xD;
      indeed paralleled by an equally directed biomechanical change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, all patients at the Foot &amp; Ankle unit of UZ Leuven performed a pre- and 1 year&#xD;
      post-operative plantar pressure measurement to get better insight in their clinical&#xD;
      condition. As stated before, the usefulness of this single testing method was limited.&#xD;
      Recently the Advanced Clinical Examination Platform that integrates both plantar pressure&#xD;
      measurement and full 3D MFM-gaitlab has been implemented in the Movement Analysis Laboratory&#xD;
      of our institution. Currently a transition to routinely perform such an examination is&#xD;
      finished. Therefore a completely new era of research concerning the biomechanical evaluation&#xD;
      itself and clinical results of the reconstructive procedures of ankle and hindfoot has&#xD;
      started.&#xD;
