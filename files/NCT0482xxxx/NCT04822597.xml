    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness four different pain treatments for&#xD;
      the injection of radioactive tracer that women with breast cancer receive for sentinel lymph&#xD;
      node biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and who will be&#xD;
      undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy with a standard injection of radioactive tracer before&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A participant's active participation will take place on two separate occasions. In the first&#xD;
      occasion, a participant will complete a brief pain assessment on the day of enrollment. The&#xD;
      rest of a participant's active participation will take place on one day (the day of surgery)&#xD;
      and last approximately 20 minutes, after which active participation will end.&#xD;

      Primary Objective: To test the effectiveness of four alternative approaches to topical&#xD;
      anesthesia on pain associated with radiotracer injection for women diagnosed with breast&#xD;
      cancer undergoing sentinel lymph node mapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess patient satisfaction with pain control modality for radiotracer injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify barriers to implementation of the different pain control interventions.&#xD;
