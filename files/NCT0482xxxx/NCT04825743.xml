  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2B prospective, blinded, randomized, placebo controlled, international&#xD;
      multicenter study. Subjects with STEMI will be enrolled in the ambulance if they meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. These subjects will be evaluated by highly trained paramedics who&#xD;
      transport the subjects to the participating hospitals in the Netherlands and the Czech&#xD;
      Republic. Hospitals and ambulance services with experience in ambulance studies will be&#xD;
      selected. Each subject will receive a single subcutaneous injection containing either RUC-4&#xD;
      Dose 1 (0.110 mg/kg) or RUC-4 Dose 2 (0.130 mg/kg) or placebo&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be screened in the ambulance based on the information available; those&#xD;
      fulfilling the eligibility criteria who have provided verbal witnessed/short written informed&#xD;
      consent will be randomized and enrolled in the study. Following a single weight-based dose of&#xD;
      subcutaneous study drug by the ambulance staff, the patient will be transferred to the&#xD;
      clinical site PCI center for angiography and intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular standard of care is performed from the provision of informed consent through the last&#xD;
      study mandated subject visit. Concomitant medications will be recorded. Treatment with IV&#xD;
      P2Y12 antagonists or other αIIbβ3 receptor before PCI/angiography is prohibited.&#xD;
      Demographics, concomitant medications, vital signs, and medical history will be collected in&#xD;
      the CRF. Adverse events, bleeding events and injection site reactions will be collected.&#xD;
      Angiography and PCI details will be recorded. Full written informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
      Additional blood samples for safety will be collected at 1, 6, 24 and 72 hours (or hospital&#xD;
      discharge) post-PCI/angiography. Blood samples for high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (upon&#xD;
      arrival and 24 hours post PCI/angiography) and NT-ProBNP (24 hours post PCI/angiography) will&#xD;
      be assessed by central laboratory. Follow up phone contacts will occur at 1 month to report&#xD;
      AEs, bleeding events, and injection site reactions, and 12-months to record mortality, and&#xD;
      hospitalizations for heart failure or atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiography/PCI data and ECGs will be evaluated at independent Core Laboratories. An&#xD;
      independent, blinded Clinical Events Committee will provide central adjudication of all&#xD;
      clinical endpoint events. A DSMB will examine the safety data in an ongoing manner and to&#xD;
      alert the Steering Committee in case of clinically concerning safety issues that should lead&#xD;
      to consideration of altering the trial, and can recommend modification of the study protocol&#xD;
      based on pre-specified rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of participation for each subject will be 12 months (± 1 month), including&#xD;
      enrollment, study drug administration, hospitalization, and phone contact follow-up at 1 and&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;
