    <description>After the shadowing program is completed, both groups of medical students (those who participated in the shadowing program and those who did not), have to fill a questionnaire that assesses their wellbeing and level of anxiety regarding their first official night shifts. Our primary outcome is to evaluate the impact of the shadowing program on medical students well-being and their level of anxiety.</description>
