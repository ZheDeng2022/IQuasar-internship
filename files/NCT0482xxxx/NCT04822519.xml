      Gallbladder disease is a significant health burden in the developed world and its prevalence&#xD;
      has risen by more than 20% in the past three decades In the United States, 20-25 million&#xD;
      individuals are affected by gallbladder disease, resulting in an average annual treatment&#xD;
      cost of $6.2 billion Obesity, diet, rapid weight loss, metabolic syndrome, and conditions&#xD;
      such as cirrhosis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and gallbladder stasis increase&#xD;
      the risk of gallstone formation Surgical removal of the gallbladder, cholecystectomy, is the&#xD;
      most recommended treatment for gallbladder disease; however, the procedure increases the risk&#xD;
      of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis and metabolic effects&#xD;

      Gallbladder disease is a significant health burden in the developed world and its prevalence&#xD;
      has risen by more than 20% in the past three decades .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the United States, 20-25 million individuals are affected by gallbladder disease,&#xD;
      resulting in an average annual treatment cost of $6.2 billion Obesity, diet, rapid weight&#xD;
      loss, metabolic syndrome, and conditions such as cirrhosis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome, and gallbladder stasis increase the risk of gallstone formation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical removal of the gallbladder, cholecystectomy, is the most recommended treatment for&#xD;
      gallbladder disease; however, the procedure increases the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver&#xD;
      disease, cirrhosis and metabolic effects .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral dissolution therapy using ursodeoxycholic acid is currently one of the leading&#xD;
      non-invasive alternative treatments for gallstones. Ursodeoxycholic acid dissolves small&#xD;
      cholesterol gallstones by decreasing hepatic secretion of cholesterol and lowering the&#xD;
      chances of unsaturated gallbladder bile formation Although oral dissolution therapy has&#xD;
      proven to be a safe alternative to cholecystectomy, it has a gallstone recurrence rate of&#xD;
      50%-70% at 12 years post-treatment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high incidence rate and treatment cost associated with gallbladder disease have&#xD;
      encouraged the search for preventative strategies. In approximately 75% of cases, impaired&#xD;
      gallbladder motility results from the accumulation of cholesterol gallstones. Therefore,&#xD;
      agents that reduce lipid concentrations or improve gallbladder motility may reduce the need&#xD;
      for surgical interventions and/or the use of potentially harmful pharmaceutical products .&#xD;
