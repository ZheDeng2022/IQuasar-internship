      The purpose of the study is to describe the clinical outcomes (severity of depression,&#xD;
      severity of suicidality &amp; frequency of suicidal thinking, suicide events) and quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL) of participants with symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) that have current&#xD;
      suicidal ideation with intent.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Severity of Depression as Assessed by the Montgomery-asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>MADRS is a clinician-rated scale designed to measure changes in depression severity due to antidepressant treatment. The MADRS consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms) for a total possible score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition. The Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS (SIGMA) will be used for the administration of the MADRS assessment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Severity of Suicidality as Assessed by Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Suicidality Revised (CGI-SS-R) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-SS-R is derived from the Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI-S), a global rating scale that gives an overall measure of the severity of a participant's illness. The CGI-SS-R rating is scored on a 7-point scale from 0 (normal, not at all suicidal) to 6 (among the most extremely suicidal participants). A higher score indicates a more severe condition and a reduction in score indicates improvement (that is, lower severity of suicidality).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool (SIBAT) Module 7 (Clinician-rated Frequency of Suicidal Thinking [FoST]) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>SIBAT is assessment tool that captures suicidal ideation, behavior, and risk. It permits assessment of change in suicidal ideation and behavior and documents clinician assessment of severity of suicidality and suicide risk. SIBAT has 8 modules divided into 2 major divisions: patient-reported section (Modules 1-5) and clinician-rated section (Modules 6-8). Clinician-rated section has modules for semi-structured interview, clinical global impressions of current severity of suicidality and imminent suicide risk, clinical global impression of long-term suicide risk, and clinical judgment of optimal suicide management. The score anchor point as in participant report frequency of suicidal thinking that is, response options from never to all the time. Module 7-FoST score ranges from 0-5; higher score indicates more severe condition. Negative change in score indicates improvement.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life (EuroQol) 5-Dimension 5-Level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a generic measure of health status. It is a 5-item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression plus a visual analog scale rating &quot;health today&quot; with anchors ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Inpatient and Outpatient Care Across Specific Settings and Consultation With Different Healthcare Professionals (HCPs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with Inpatient and outpatient care across specific settings and consultation with different healthcare professionals (HCPs) will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Resources Used to Reduce the Risk for Suicide</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Number of Resources (hospitalization, close surveillance, crisis team support etc.) used to reduce the risk for suicide will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants who Used Psychopharmacological and Non-pharmacological Drug Therapies</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who psychopharmacological drug therapies and non-pharmacological therapies including psychological therapies and electroconvulsive therapy will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Care Burden as Assessed by EQ-5D-5L Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a generic measure of health status. It is a 5-item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression plus a visual analog scale rating &quot;health today&quot; with anchors ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Care Burden as Assessed Work productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI consist of four types of scores: absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on-the-job effectiveness), work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism) and activity impairment. Outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity that is worse outcomes.</description>
