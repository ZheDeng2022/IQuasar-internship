      For patients with locally advanced cholangiocarcinoma with resectable margins, patients who&#xD;
      meet the selection criteria are randomly divided into two groups A and B. Group A:&#xD;
      neoadjuvant PDT therapy combined with radical surgery; Group B: radical surgery. This study&#xD;
      aims to explore the clinical effectiveness and safety of neoadjuvant photodynamic therapy for&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma, as well as its role in destroying local tumors and enhancing systemic&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The average 5-year survival rate of patients with cholangiocarcinoma is about 5-10%. Only&#xD;
      30%-40% of patients have the opportunity to obtain radical surgery. Surgical resection is&#xD;
      limited by the extent of tumor spread along the bile duct branches and segments, and the&#xD;
      degree of involvement of the portal vein and (or) hepatic artery branches. Complete resection&#xD;
      with negative margins (R0) is the only possible radical treatment. Only 60%-78% of radical&#xD;
      surgery for cholangiocarcinoma are considered to achieve true R0 resection, and the&#xD;
      tumor-free margin is often very short. Even after R0 resection, the recurrence rate is as&#xD;
      high as 50%-76%. Photodynamic therapy is a tumor specific ablation method with small side&#xD;
      effects and repeated treatments will not produce drug resistance. It provides a new prospect&#xD;
      for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. For the current patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma, neoadjuvant photodynamic therapy is used to make them resectable.&#xD;
      Demotion and subsequent resection may potentially improve their results. Similarly, patients&#xD;
      with resectable margins can benefit from tumor downgrading by increasing their chances of&#xD;
      undergoing R0 resection. In order to increase the negative rate of resection margins, and to&#xD;
      ensure sufficient tumor-free margins of the bile duct stumps, the research is still blank.&#xD;
      For patients with locally advanced cholangiocarcinoma with resectable margins, patients who&#xD;
      meet the selection criteria are randomly divided into two groups A and B. Group A:&#xD;
      neoadjuvant PDT therapy combined with radical surgery; Group B: radical surgery. This study&#xD;
      aims to explore the clinical effectiveness and safety of neoadjuvant photodynamic therapy, as&#xD;
      well as its role in destroying local tumors and enhancing systemic inflammation.This study&#xD;
      plans to enroll 50 patients. It is planned to complete the enrollment operation within 2&#xD;
      years, and the follow-up observation will be continued for 5 years after the operation. All&#xD;
      patients are expected to complete neoadjuvant PDT treatment and radical surgery within 2&#xD;
      years, survival period (5 years survival rate), R0 resection rate and local recurrence rate&#xD;
      are the main observation indicators, and the bilirubin level, the number of intraoperative&#xD;
      freezing, the length of the tumor-free margin of the tumor tissue, and the incidence of&#xD;
      complications (biliary leakage, cholangitis, phototoxicity) are the secondary observation&#xD;
      indicators.&#xD;
