  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2018, the main societies of anesthesia (European Society Anaesthesiology, European Society&#xD;
      Pediatric Anesthesia, and Association des Anesthésistes Réanimateurs Pédiatriques&#xD;
      d'Expression Française) changed the current recommendations for preoperative fasting time in&#xD;
      children, reducing the time to last intake of clear liquids from two to one hour before&#xD;
      anesthetic induction. Prolonged fasting may have a deleterious impact on blood glucose&#xD;
      homeostasis. The consequences of intraoperative hypoglycemia in children can be serious in&#xD;
      the short term, but also in the long term. The objective of multicenter prospective,&#xD;
      observational cohort study is to investigate- in children younger than 24 months of age&#xD;
      undergoing scheduled conventional inpatient surgery- a correlation between the duration of&#xD;
      preoperative fasting, glycemic intraoperative homeostasis and the criteria of enhanced&#xD;
      recovery after surgery, which are the hospital length of stay (main outcome), postoperative&#xD;
      pain and postoperative nausea-vomiting (secondary outcomes). By identifying non-adherence to&#xD;
      fasting rules as one of the causes of prolonged hospitalization, this study will highlight&#xD;
      the need to develop effective strategies to promote adherence to fasting rules in pediatric&#xD;
      surgery and minimize the potential deleterious impact on intraoperative glycemic control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative fasting instructions (6 hours for solids and formula, 4 hours for breast milk,&#xD;
      and 1 hour for clear liquids) will be explained to parents orally during the preoperative&#xD;
      anesthesia consultation and a written document, reminding them of these instructions, will be&#xD;
      given to them afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival in the operating room, the anesthesiologist will record on a standardized&#xD;
      collection sheet the time of fasting as well as the premedication received (time of&#xD;
      paracetamol and/or ibuprofen, β2-mimetic aerosols, preoperative antibiotic therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After anesthetic induction, once airway management and securing of the peripheral venous line&#xD;
      have been completed and before surgical setup, a capillary blood sample will be taken from&#xD;
      the earlobe or fingertip to measure blood glucose and ketone levels using a blood glucose and&#xD;
      ketone meter (FREESTYLE OPTIUM NEO H, ketone and blood sugar meter, calibration performed&#xD;
      prior to the study by the pharmacology department). A ketonemia will be considered abnormally&#xD;
      high if the ketone level is higher than 0.6 mmol/L (0.11g/L). Hypoglycemia will be defined as&#xD;
      a capillary blood glucose level less than &lt;3.5 mmol/L (0.63 g/L)9. In case of hypoglycemia or&#xD;
      high ketonemia, a second capillary sample should be taken, taking care to change the sampling&#xD;
      area (ear or finger) and then an average of the two results should be taken. Capillary blood&#xD;
      glucose and ketone measurements are part of routine care in pediatric anesthesia. Therefore,&#xD;
      there will be no additional cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative monitoring for all children will include a 3-lead ECG, pneumocardiograph,&#xD;
      non-invasive blood pressure measurement, pulse oximetry (SpO2), esophageal or rectal&#xD;
      temperature measurement, and capnography. A forced-air heating blanket will be used to warm&#xD;
      the patient during the procedure. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) will be documented after&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia, and hypotension will be defined as MAP &lt; 45 mmHg7. Intraoperatively,&#xD;
      data will be collected from the patient's blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperatively, the following data will be recorded on the standardized collection sheet:&#xD;
      anesthetic agents used (hypnotics and morphinics), intraoperative analgesics, anti-nausea&#xD;
      agents (dexamethasone, ondansetron), infusion fluids used (nature of the fluid, rate of&#xD;
      infusion), catecholamine (ephedrine), drugs that may interfere with blood sugar regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recovery room, postoperative pain will be evaluated using the EVENDOL scale and by the&#xD;
      consumption of analgesics (total dose of paracetamol, ibuprofen, nalbuphine). The treatment&#xD;
      of postoperative nausea and vomiting, left to the discretion of the anaesthetist, will also&#xD;
      be recorded (total dose of ondansetron, droperidol, others).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After return to the department, the duration of hospitalization will be recorded. It will be&#xD;
      defined as the number of days between arrival in the operating room and departure from the&#xD;
      hospital. A clinically significant difference in length of stay will be considered a&#xD;
      difference of at least 4 hours of hospital stay.&#xD;
