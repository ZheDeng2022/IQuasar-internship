      The purpose of this Cohort Treatment Plan is to allow access to 177Lu-PSMA-617 for eligible&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The&#xD;
      patient's treating physician should follow the suggested treatment guidelines and comply with&#xD;
      all local health authority regulations.&#xD;

      PSMA-11 will be provided in certain cases where it may be required as a diagnostic imaging&#xD;
      agent. PSMA-11 is used to confirm the presence of PSMA positive lesions in patients, which&#xD;
      then makes them eligible for treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must be ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have progressive mCRPC. Documented progressive mCRPC will be based on at&#xD;
             least 1 of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Rising PSA according to PCWG3 criteria (2 rising values above a baseline at a&#xD;
                  minimum of 1-week intervals) and PSA ≥2.0 ng/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Soft-tissue progression defined as per prostate cancer working group 3&#xD;
                  (PCWG3)-modified RECIST v1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progression of bone disease as per PCWG3 criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have mCRPC with histological, pathological, and/or cytological&#xD;
             confirmation of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have ≥ 1 metastatic lesion that is present on baseline CT, MRI, or bone&#xD;
             scan imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)- positive prostate&#xD;
             cancer, as determined by PSMA-targeted PET / CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have a castrate level of serum/plasma testosterone (&lt; 50 ng/dL or &lt; 1.7&#xD;
             nmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have received at least one NAAD (such as enzalutamide and/or&#xD;
             abiraterone).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have been previously treated with at least 1, but no more than 2&#xD;
             previous taxane regimens. A taxane regimen is defined as a minimum exposure of 2&#xD;
             cycles of a taxane. If a patient has received only 1 taxane regimen, the patient is&#xD;
             eligible if:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. The patient's physician deems him unsuitable to receive a second taxane regimen&#xD;
             (e.g. frailty assessed by geriatric or health status evaluation, intolerance, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must have recovered to ≤ Grade 2 from all clinically significant toxicities&#xD;
             related to prior therapies (i.e. prior chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients must have adequate organ function:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Bone marrow reserve:&#xD;

                    -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3.0 ×&#xD;
                       ULN OR ≤ 5.0 × ULN for patients with liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Renal:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Serum/plasma creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min.&#xD;

             investigational therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Transfusion for the sole purpose of making a subject eligible for study inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a history of central nervous system (CNS) metastases must have received&#xD;
             therapy (surgery, radiotherapy, gamma knife) and be neurologically stable,&#xD;
             asymptomatic, and not receiving corticosteroids for the purposes of maintaining&#xD;
             neurologic integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with epidural disease, canal disease and prior cord involvement are eligible&#xD;
             if those areas have been treated, are stable, and not neurologically impaired. For&#xD;
             patients with parenchymal CNS metastasis (or a history of CNS metastasis), baseline&#xD;
             and subsequent radiological imaging must include evaluation of the brain (MRI&#xD;
             preferred or CT with contrast).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any pre-existing symptoms, or concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions&#xD;
