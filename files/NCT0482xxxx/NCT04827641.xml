    <description>Systematic documentation of all unexpected events was carried out by designated team members during daily routine team conferences. Briefly, on-call team members and all other staff reported on any unexpected event that had occurred within the previous 24 hours, after weekends during the past 72 hours. Events included those that had occurred in inpatients, outpatients and in the pediatric emergency department. Data concerning each event included patient demographics, diagnoses, treatments/operations and types of events.</description>
