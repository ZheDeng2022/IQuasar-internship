  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is a major problem for cancer patients, and one that can persist long after treatment&#xD;
      ends. Recent work has demonstrated that light therapy may mitigate or reduce fatigue levels&#xD;
      in both cancer patients and cancer survivors. This protocol seeks to assess how lighting&#xD;
      interventions distributed through a mobile app affect fatigue, sleep, and quality of life&#xD;
      across three populations of cancer patients: breast cancer and prostate cancer, and patients&#xD;
      who have undergone autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to either the interventional SYNC app or to a control app.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>Blocked randomization will be used to limit bias and achieve an equal distribution of participants to the intervention and control arms of the study (69 control, 69 intervention; with 23 from each cancer population in each arm). This approach will recruit participants in small blocks to ensure that half of the participants within each block will be allocated to the treatment and the other half to the control.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in fatigue assessed with Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Short Form (SF) Fatigue 4a</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, weekly to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in PROMIS 4-item Fatigue scores will enable the investigators to quantify the effects of the light interventions delivered by SYNC on patient fatigue. The final fatigue score is represented by the T-score, a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 points. The average change in PROMIS fatigue T scores will be calculated for each arm. A negative change (lower scores) represents improvement in symptoms; a positive change (higher scores) represents worsening of symptoms. The study will have power of 0.80, assuming a two-sided Type I error rate of 0.05, to detect an effect size of half the standard deviation between the intervention and control arms if the accrual goal is reached.</description>
