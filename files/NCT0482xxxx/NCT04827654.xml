  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in maximizing the consumption of fruits and vegetables (F&amp;V)&#xD;
      in elementary school children by increasing the access to F&amp;V by providing them in the home&#xD;
      environment via direct delivery (F&amp;V bag &amp; recipes) and a gift card to purchase preferred&#xD;
      choices. This also decreases barriers to trying F&amp;V and switching to a more F&amp;V-focused diet,&#xD;
      e.g., access, cost, knowledge of what to do with fruits and vegetables by their families in&#xD;
      household diet, and a period of time to try and get used to more F&amp;V in the diet without&#xD;
      worrying about access and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that at the end of 4 weeks, children in families that were given access to a&#xD;
      F&amp;V produce box with associated recipes, a gift card to purchase preferred choices, and a&#xD;
      cooking incentive kit, consumed significantly better diets as measured with a diet composite&#xD;
      score compared with children in families who did not receive increased F&amp;V access.&#xD;
