  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an academic evaluation of a program being implemented by the Ambuja Cement Foundation&#xD;
      (ACF). The aim of the evaluation is to determine the effect of the ACF noncommunicable&#xD;
      disease (NCD) program on (1) fasting blood glucose (a biomarker of diabetes), (2) systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure, (3) diastolic blood pressure, and (4) body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACF will be implementing a program on NCD management. Due to resource constraints, the&#xD;
      program will be implemented stepwise (e.g. foure villages in the first 6 months then an&#xD;
      additional four villages added every 6 months over the next 12 months). In order to improve&#xD;
      the interpretation of the evaluation data, we will randomize the order in which the program&#xD;
      is implemented in the 12 villages. The design is therefore a stepped wedge randomized cluster&#xD;
      trial. This design is ideal for (1) minimizing the practical, logistical, and financial&#xD;
      constraints associated with large-scale project implementation, (2) control for the effect of&#xD;
      time, and (3) ensure that all villages in the project are eventually offered the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation visits will be conducted at the participant's home. At baseline, the ACF field&#xD;
      team will first administer a screening CRF to all adults in the household to confirm&#xD;
      eligibility. For those adults who meet all eligibility criteria, trained enumerators will (1)&#xD;
      complete two brief surveys, (2) measure their waist circumference and body weight, and (3)&#xD;
      measure their blood pressure using an automatic digital blood pressure machine. The surveys&#xD;
      will cover demographics, family history of disease, tobacco and alcohol use, physical&#xD;
      activity, and standard clinical symptoms. The field team will then schedule a follow-up visit&#xD;
      within the next week to measure fasting blood glucose using a point-of-care device. For those&#xD;
      adults who meet criteria for being high-risk for diabetes and hypertension (criteria defined&#xD;
      further in the next section), trained enumerators will also administer an additional survey&#xD;
      on this second day that covers dietary intake and clinical history including medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For high-risk adults, after the baseline visit, three additional follow-up visits will be&#xD;
      completed every 6 months for a total duration of 18 months. Each follow-up visit will&#xD;
      include: two brief surveys covering the same content summarized above for baseline, as well&#xD;
      as measurements of waist circumference, body weight, blood pressure, and fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose. We will schedule these visits such that participants are fasting on the day of the&#xD;
      visit, thus allowing all visit activities to be completed in 1 day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surveys will be completed via interviews by trained field enumerators who will enter&#xD;
      participant responses into password-protected tablets (Qualtrics offline mobile app).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total population of these 12 villages is 60,701 according to the 2011 Census. We will&#xD;
      enroll all adults ≥30 years old meeting eligibility criteria, which we estimate will be ~40%&#xD;
      of the total population or ~24,280 people. Based on ACF's current programming in 2 other&#xD;
      villages in this district, we expect that 40% of those screened (Group 1 participants) will&#xD;
      be high-risk (Group 2 participants) or ~9,720 people (~810 per village).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For fasting blood glucose, a sample of 12 clusters in a complete stepped-wedge&#xD;
      cluster-randomized design with 4 time periods (including the baseline), 3 steps, 4 clusters&#xD;
      switching from control to treatment at each step, and an average of 500 participants per&#xD;
      cluster with an average of 125 participants per cluster per time period (for a total sample&#xD;
      size of 6000 subjects) achieves 90% power to detect a difference between means of 0.32 mmol/L&#xD;
      (4% of anticipated mean baseline level). The test statistic used is the two-sided Wald&#xD;
      Z-Test. The ICC is 0.010, and the significance level of the test is 0.050. Given that we&#xD;
      expect to enroll near to 9000 subjects, we are exceptionally well powered to detect&#xD;
      significant effects in this evaluation even if there is loss to follow up.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study design is stepped wedge randomized cluster trial (4 villages in the first 6 months; additional 4 villages added every 6 months over the next 12 months) - randomized implementation.&#xD;
Staff will visit 10 target villages to screen participants for high NCD risk using CBAC scoring. For adults meeting eligibility criteria, trained enumerators will (1) complete 2 brief surveys (2) measure waist circumference (3) measure blood pressure. The team will schedule a follow-up visit to measure fasting blood glucose. For adults who meet criteria for high-risk for diabetes and hypertension, team will conduct an additional survey on the 2nd day that covers dietary intake &amp; clinical history. Following this, 3 additional follow-up visits will be completed every 6 months for 18 months. Each visit will include: 2 surveys like baseline, measurements of waist circumference, blood pressure, &amp; fasting blood glucose.&#xD;
All participants identified as high risk will be referred to a public hospital.</intervention_model_description>
