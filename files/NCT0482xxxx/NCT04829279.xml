  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to verify the effectiveness of the connected network for EMS comprehensive&#xD;
      technical-support using artificial intelligence (CONNECT-AI) system through demonstration in&#xD;
      the local community. The study was designed as a prospective non-random cross-intervention&#xD;
      study design in two preselected communities. The subjects of the study are patients&#xD;
      transferred to the local emergency department(ED) through an ambulance of a fire department&#xD;
      in the selected community. If the storage and transmission of information collected by an&#xD;
      ambulance fails or the information of the transferred patient cannot be verified in the&#xD;
      transferred ED, it is excluded from the study. In this study, the developed CONNECT-AI system&#xD;
      was installed in all emergency vehicles and EDs in two regional cohorts, and the&#xD;
      effectiveness was measured by operating an intersection for the same period. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is the transfer time spent in the pre-hospital stage, and the secondary outcome is&#xD;
      whether the optimal transfer hospital is selected.&#xD;

    <description>A. During the Intervention period, paramedics wear equipment for multi-faceted data acquisition and press the start button of the system.&#xD;
B. During the Intervention period, inside the ambulance, a application that implements a function that automatically evaluates the patient's severity, displays a list of optimal transfer hospitals based on this, and shares real-time information of the hospitals, is installed so that paramedics can refer to the work.&#xD;
C. ED's medical staff will receive through ER-kiosk pre-hospital patient information collected and analyzed through the CONNECT AI system before arrival.</description>
