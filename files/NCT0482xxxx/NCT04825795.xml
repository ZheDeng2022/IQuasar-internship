  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aim is to evaluate whether DPP4-inhibitor could reduce coronary atherosclerosis&#xD;
      assessed by CT scan in patients receiving insulin for diabetes mellitus. In this&#xD;
      retrospective study, change in coronary calcium burden between two coronary CT scan will be&#xD;
      compared in patients with and without receiving DPP4-inhibitor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective study using medical records in two hospitals affiliated to the&#xD;
      Catholic University of Korea. Patients with diabetes mellitus who received insulin are&#xD;
      retrospectively enrolled. Among those, only patients who underwent coronary CT scan for more&#xD;
      than two times will be included. Included patients will be classified into DPP4-inhibitor&#xD;
      group and no DPP4-inhibitor group according to the prescribed medication. Mean change in&#xD;
      coronary calcium score per one year will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
