    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to determine the effect of progressive relaxation exercises with&#xD;
      music therapy on sleep quality and pain severity of patients hospitalized in the surgical&#xD;
      departments of a university hospital.This single-blind, pre-test-post-test with control group&#xD;
      design quasi-experimental study was carried out between March-July 2019. 31 patients who were&#xD;
      hospitalized in surgical departments for at least one week and regularly performed relaxation&#xD;
      exercises consisted of experimental group, and 31 patients who were hospitalized for at least&#xD;
      one week but did not do relaxation exercises consisted of control group. The study data were&#xD;
      collected by using &quot;Descriptive Characteristics Form&quot;, pain severity of patients was measured&#xD;
      using &quot;Visual Analogue Scale&quot;, and sleep quality of patients was measured using &quot;Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Sleep Scale&quot;. The patients were asked to perform the exercises with music an average&#xD;
      of 30 min before sleeping every day for a week. The observation of the nurse working in&#xD;
      department and the patient's statement were used for control. The ethical permission and the&#xD;
      approval of hospital management were obtained for the study. In the statistical analysis of&#xD;
      the data, independent sample t test, one-way anova and paired sample t test were used.&#xD;
      Statistical significance level was taken as p&lt;.05.&#xD;

Relaxing music for sleep, prepared by the Turkish Psychological Association, is uploaded to patients' mobile phones. Patients were asked to perform relaxation exercises for a week at bedtime, lasting an average of 30 minutes, and with music every day, taking advantage of nurse observation at the clinic with the patient's declaration in check. Students who took part in the practice served as reminders of patients' compliance with the exercises.</description>
