  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study whether a digital health tool called Actigraph can be used to collect information on&#xD;
      gait and physical activity in healthy children aged 3-17. The study will be conducted at the&#xD;
      Pfizer Innovation Research Laboratory (PfIRe Lab) in Cambridge MA. In the lab at the first&#xD;
      visit, we will ask participants to do activities such as walking on different surfaces as&#xD;
      well as to roll a dice and move between different activity stations. Children will wear 2&#xD;
      Actigraph devices, one as a watch and one as a belt. They will then go home and do usual&#xD;
      daily activities while answering a brief daily activity diary for approximately 2 weeks. The&#xD;
      conclusion of the study will be over the telephone and include questions on the comfort and&#xD;
      wearability of the device. The analysis of gait and physical activity as well as adherence&#xD;
      and wearability will be looked across three different age groups 3-5, 6-11, and 12-17.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait metrics collected using ActiGraph devices</measure>
    <time_frame>Maximum of 3 hours undertaking a semi-structured movement protocol</time_frame>
    <description>To compare gait quality metrics collected using ActiGraph devices, APDM devices and GAITRiteÂ® walkway, during in-lab sessions. Accuracy of the sensor-derived metrics will be determined by computing the mean absolute percent error between the sensor-derived and reference standard metrics and assess the bias using Bland Altman plots and 95% limits of agreement. The agreement between sensor derived and reference standard metrics will be assessed using ICC and its 95% lower and upper confidence limits.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wear compliance of ActiGraph devices at home</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 days</time_frame>
    <description>Number of hours per day wearing the device and number of days with more than 10 hours of wearing for each participant will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate wearability of device in the lab setting and at home</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants or their parent/guardian will be asked to rate their assessment of how comfortable the devices were both at the end of the in lab session and after the at home monitoring period. The same questionnaire will be administered twice. The participant or the parent/guardian are requested to choose a statement on a five-point Likert Scale. The statements are:&#xD;
Strongly disagree Disagree Neutral Agree Strongly agree&#xD;
Participants or their parent/guardians will select the most appropriate statement which they felt reflected how comfortable they found the devices to put on, wear, and take off.</description>
