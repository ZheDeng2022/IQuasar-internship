  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, 56-week, outpatient, open-label (OL) study to evaluate the&#xD;
      long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of KarXT in de novo subjects with Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual-Fifth Edition (DSM-5) schizophrenia. In this OL study, all subjects will&#xD;
      receive KarXT (a fixed combination of xanomeline 125 mg and trospium chloride 30 mg twice&#xD;
      daily [BID]) for up to 52 weeks. The primary objective of the study is to assess the&#xD;
      long-term safety and tolerability of KarXT in subjects with a DSM-5 diagnosis of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. The secondary objective of this study is to assess the long-term efficacy and&#xD;
      characterize the pharmacokinetics of xanomeline and trospium after administration of KarXT.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of participants with schizophrenia. The PANSS rating form contains 7 positive symptom scales, 7 negative system scales, and 16 general psychopathology symptom scales. Participants are rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale. The total score is the sum of all scales with a minimum score of 30 and a maximum score of 210. A decrease in PANSS total score correlates with an improvement in schizophrenia symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in PANSS Positive Score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>For positive symptoms in schizophrenia, participants are rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale, with a minimum score of 7 and a maximum score of 49. A decrease in PANSS total score correlates with an improvement in schizophrenia symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in PANSS Negative Score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>For negative symptoms in schizophrenia, participants are rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale, with a minimum score of 7 and a maximum score of 49. A decrease in PANSS total score correlates with an improvement in schizophrenia symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in PANSS Negative Marder Factor Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Negative Marder Factor score is derived from the PANSS and consists of the sum of 5 negative scales (N) and 2 general scales (G) (N1. Blunted affect; N2. Emotional withdrawal; N3. Poor rapport; N4. Passive/apathetic social withdrawal; N6. Lack of spontaneity; G7. Motor retardation; and G16. Active social avoidance), with a minimum score of 7 and a maximum score of 49.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) Score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S modified asked the clinician 1 question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience, how mentally ill is the participant at this time?&quot; The clinician's answer rated on the following 7-point scale: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; 7 = among the most extremely ill participants.</description>

The dose is increased to xanomeline 125 mg/trospium 30 mg BID on days 8-364 unless the subject is experiencing adverse events from the xanomeline 100 mg/ trospium 20 mg dose. Subjects who were increased to xanomeline 125 mg/trospium 30 mg will have the option to return to xanomeline 100 mg/ trospium 20 mg depending on clinical response and tolerability. Re-escalation to 125/30 BID or re-titration in cases in which the subject has been off KarXT for a longer period of time (at least a week) is allowed and will require a discussion between the principal investigator and the medical monitor.</description>
