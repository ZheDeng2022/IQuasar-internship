  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is ranked as the number fifth cause of death and a main cause of disability in the&#xD;
      United States. It affects the arteries which supply blood to and within the brain. If the&#xD;
      blood supply to the brain is disrupted, it will not be able to receive oxygen and the&#xD;
      nutrients which are transported by those arteries. This leads to the death of brain cells&#xD;
      having a magnificent effect on the function of that part.&#xD;

      This study was quasi-experimental trial, to compare the effectiveness of Progressive&#xD;
      Resistive Strength Exercises and Balance Exercises in subjects with Stroke. Subjects with&#xD;
      Stroke meeting the predetermined inclusion &amp; exclusion criteria were divided into two groups&#xD;
      using lottery method. Pre assessment was done using Berg Balance Scale, Fugl Meyer Assessment&#xD;
      - Lower Extremity and Step Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in one group were treated with Progressive Resistive Strength Training and other&#xD;
      group was treated with Balance training. Each subject received 12 treatment sessions, with 03&#xD;
      treatment sessions per week. Results were recorded at the end of 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th&#xD;
      treatment sessions. Recorded values were analysed using SPSS.&#xD;
