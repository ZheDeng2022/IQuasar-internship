  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capsule Endoscopy (CE) is a safe, patient friendly and easy procedure performed for the&#xD;
      evaluation of gastrointestinal tract unable to be explored via conventional endoscopy. The&#xD;
      most common indication to perform SBCE is represented by Suspected Small Bowel Bleeding&#xD;
      (SSBB). According to the widest meta-analysis available in literature, SBCE shows a&#xD;
      diagnostic yield in SSBB of about 60%, and angiodysplasias are the most relevant findings,&#xD;
      accounting for 50% of patients undergoing SBCE for SSBB. Accordingly, it represents the first&#xD;
      line examination in SSBB investigation for determining the source of bleeding, if primary&#xD;
      endoscopy results negative. Despite its high clinical feasibility, the evaluation of&#xD;
      CE-video-captures is one of the main drawbacks since it is time consuming and requests the&#xD;
      reader to concentrate to not miss any lesion. In order to reduce reading time, several&#xD;
      software have been developed with the aim to cut similar images and select relevant images.&#xD;
      For example, automated fast reading software have demonstrated to significantly reduce&#xD;
      reading time without impacting the miss rate in pathological conditions affecting diffusely&#xD;
      the mucosa (as IBD lesions do). Not the same assumption can be taken for isolated lesions&#xD;
      since several studies reported an unacceptable miss rate for such a detection modality. New&#xD;
      advancements such as artificial intelligence made their appearance in recent years. Deep&#xD;
      convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated to recognize specific images among a&#xD;
      large variety up to exceed human performance in visual tasks. A Deep Learning model has been&#xD;
      recently validated in the field of Small Bowel CE by Ding et al. According to their data&#xD;
      collected on 5000 patients, the CNN-based auxiliary model identify abnormalities with 99.88%&#xD;
      sensitivity in the per patient analysis and 99.90% sensitivity in the per-lesion analysis.&#xD;
      With this perspective, it is believable that AI applied to SBCE can significantly shorten the&#xD;
      reading time and support physicians to detect available lesions without losing significant&#xD;
      lesions, further improving the diagnostic yield of the procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, multinational, blinded prospective trial, involving a consecutive&#xD;
      series of patients recruited by 12 European centers based on the indication of OGIB:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after negative upper and lower endoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  France: after negative pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hb cut-off male: &lt;13, female: &lt;12 Capsule endoscopy will be performed in each site&#xD;
           according to local rules and requirements, and the study protocol will concern only the&#xD;
           post-procedure analysis on reading modalities for each patient, as specified below.1.&#xD;
           Regimen of preparation AI depends on the possibility of the software to &quot;see&quot; images. An&#xD;
           inadequate cleansing level precludes a proper visualization and the impact of&#xD;
           technology. In order to have homogenous results, a standard regimen of preparation is&#xD;
           advisable. The regimen includes a split dose of PEG-based solution (PlenVu, Moviprep) as&#xD;
           recommended by ESGE guideline - technical report. Dose 1 will be administered at 7 pm of&#xD;
           the day before and dose 2 in the morning of the procedure in order to be completed at&#xD;
           least 1 hour before capsule ingestion. On the day before patients can have breakfast and&#xD;
           a light meal. After lunch they should be fasting. Two and 4 hours after capsule&#xD;
           ingestion patient are allowed to drink clear liquids and a light meal, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2. Standard reading Each center will review the images collected according to the&#xD;
           &quot;normal reading&quot; as recommended by ESGE guidelines. To compare reading time correctly,&#xD;
           readers must read the video without including annotation of images. All lesions should&#xD;
           be considered independently of their relevance. Findings are not marked on every image&#xD;
           if they appear repeatedly on every consecutive image, but if they appear repeatedly with&#xD;
           normal images in between. Annotations should be done after the reading, each lesion&#xD;
           shall be labelled if it belongs to P1/2 category according to the Saurin Classification.&#xD;
           Definition of P1, P2: red spots on the intestinal mucosa or small or isolated erosions&#xD;
           or angioectasia, ulcers, tumors or varices or any other bleeding abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. AI-assisted reading Each center will receive from another center anonymized patient&#xD;
           videos that have been uploaded on an encrypted USB key. Indeed, expert&#xD;
           gastroenterologists from each center will proceed with AI-assisted video reading without&#xD;
           knowing which center the video comes from nor the results of the normal reading. Reading&#xD;
           conditions are the same as for standard reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. Consensus reading Results from both normal and AI-assisted reading will be compared.&#xD;
           In the case of significant disagreement between the results from conventional capsule&#xD;
           endoscopy reading and AI-assisted reading (e.g. missed lesions), a consensus review for&#xD;
           each center will be done. Any lesion shall be considered.&#xD;
