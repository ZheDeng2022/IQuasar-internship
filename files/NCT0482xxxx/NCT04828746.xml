      The standard way to identify landmarks in the spine before inserting a needle for a lumbar&#xD;
      puncture is to feel by touch. The purpose of this research is to determine if doing an&#xD;
      ultrasound to identify landmarks before performing a lumbar puncture will improve the&#xD;
      first-time success rate of the needle insertion in pediatric patients.&#xD;

      Subjects will be identified for the study after meeting inclusion &amp; exclusion criteria. Part&#xD;
      of said criteria is that the patient will medically require a lumbar puncture (LP) to be&#xD;
      completed for their medical care and the patient is currently located in the CRMH Pediatric&#xD;
      Emergency Department, Pediatric Ward, Or Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. After the study team&#xD;
      member identifies a patient who meets the criteria and obtains the necessary&#xD;
      consent/assent(s) these paper documents will then be kept under lock and key in a box located&#xD;
      in the Pediatric ED or the Pediatric ICU and then daily will be collected and stored in a&#xD;
      locked file cabinet in a locked office in the Pediatric ICU. The practitioner will then load&#xD;
      the preset procedure note (see attached document) into EPIC. In this procedure note, there&#xD;
      will be a link to RedCap (a secure data collection tool) where the study team member will&#xD;
      enter the patient's medical record number and date of birth. The patient will then be&#xD;
      randomized to either the standard of care/ control group (palpation only lumbar puncture) or&#xD;
      the experimental group (lumbar puncture after ultrasound-guided (US) skin marking) via&#xD;
      RedCap. RedCap will be set to randomize patients via block randomization to the desired N of&#xD;
      60 (30 in each control and experiential groups), and no study team member/ practitioner will&#xD;
      have access to the set block randomization parameters in RedCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding sedation versus analgesia (performed for standard of care reasons and not affected&#xD;
      by the research study), the decision on what is best and needed for the patients will be up&#xD;
      to the performing practitioner in both groups. This ranges from superficial skin numbing&#xD;
      cream and sucrose gel (for neonates) to lidocaine injections to oral or IV medications for&#xD;
      pain/anxiety to full procedural sedation; or a combination of any of these methods. This will&#xD;
      be entirely up to the performing practitioner as the methods used can vary greatly from&#xD;
      patient to patient based on a multitude of factors. If procedural sedation is required then&#xD;
      often another attending physician must be present in order to administer the sedating&#xD;
      medications but this individual is not part of the study and will obtain their own consent&#xD;
      for sedation as applicable as per Carilion Clinic policy. The agent(s) of choice will be&#xD;
      clearly documented in the procedure note so this information can be taken into consideration&#xD;
      when performing data analysis. All sedation v analgesia will take place prior to beginning&#xD;
      the procedure. Once the practitioner is ready to begin they will start a timer to properly&#xD;
      keep time as to the duration of the entire procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practitioner performing the lumbar puncture procedure will either be a study team member&#xD;
      or another practitioner who is under the direct supervision of a study team member (ie&#xD;
      advanced care practitioner under an attending, a junior resident under a senior resident).&#xD;
      The study team member will supervise/perform the procedure as indicated to not only ensure&#xD;
      the safety of patients but to make sure proper protocol is followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After analgesia v sedation is administered, if the patient is in the standard of care group,&#xD;
      the practitioner will then position the patient in the best position they believe is needed&#xD;
      to obtain the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) sample. This is typically sitting upright or having&#xD;
      the patient lying down on their side (with the latter being more common). The practitioner&#xD;
      will then palpate the area they feel is the best to insert the spinal needle to collect the&#xD;
      sample. The gap that is being palpated is typically between the 3rd and 4th or the 4th and&#xD;
      5th lumbar vertebrae. Following this, the practitioner will then don sterile gloves, and&#xD;
      clean the patient's back with betadine or chlorhexidine as per their discretion. The spinal&#xD;
      needle will then be inserted into the spinal interspace, the stylet from the needle will be&#xD;
      removed, and the fluid will be collected. The amount of fluid that will be collected varied&#xD;
      based on the patient's age as well as the testing that is deemed clinically necessary.&#xD;
      Typically 1-3 milliliters of CSF will be collected in each of the 3-4 tubes that are provided&#xD;
      in the LP kit that is used for the procedure. After the fluid is collected, the needle will&#xD;
      then be removed and pressure will be held on the insertion site to ensure no bleeding or CSF&#xD;
      leakage. When bleeding or fluid leakage has halted the procedure is then completed and the&#xD;
      timer is stopped. The time it takes to perform this procedure varies greatly with different&#xD;
      practitioners and patients but is typically completed within 15-60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After analgesia v sedation is administered, if the patient is in the experimental group (use&#xD;
      of ultrasound- see attachment in submission), the practitioner will then position the patient&#xD;
      in the best position they believe is needed to obtain the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) sample.&#xD;
      This is typically sitting upright or having the patient lying down on their side (with the&#xD;
      latter being more common). The practitioner will then use a portable, point-of-care US&#xD;
      machine in order to identify the best interspace to obtain the sample. This involves using a&#xD;
      small amount of US gel (a non-toxic, water-based substance used to improve sound waves and&#xD;
      therefore picture quality when performing the US) and the actual US probe on the patient's&#xD;
      back. After the desired space is identified in the sagittal and transverse planes with the US&#xD;
      machine, a small mark will be placed on the patient using a surgical pen (a marker similar to&#xD;
      a &quot;sharpie&quot; but is safe for use on human skin and will wash off in 1-2 days). The desired&#xD;
      space that is being identified is typically between the 3rd and 4th or the 4th and 5th lumbar&#xD;
      vertebrae. Following this, the practitioner will then wipe the US gel off the patient's back,&#xD;
      don sterile gloves, and clean the patient's back with betadine or chlorhexidine as per their&#xD;
      discretion. The spinal needle will then be inserted into the spinal interspace that was&#xD;
      identified and marked as noted previously, the stylet from the needle will be removed, and&#xD;
      the fluid will be collected. The amount of fluid that will be collected varies based on the&#xD;
      patient's age as well as the testing that is deemed clinically necessary. Typically 1-3&#xD;
      milliliters of CSF will be collected in each of the 3-4 tubes that are provided in the LP kit&#xD;
      that is used for the procedure. After the fluid is collected, the needle will then be removed&#xD;
      and pressure will be held on the insertion site to ensure no bleeding or CSF leakage. When&#xD;
      bleeding or fluid leakage has halted the procedure is then completed and the timer is&#xD;
      stopped. The time it takes to perform this procedure varies greatly with different&#xD;
      practitioners and patients but we anticipate it taking between 25-70 minutes. The extra time&#xD;
      allotted is due to the use of the US, but how much time exactly it will take is not fully&#xD;
      known, and in fact, it may not add time as compared to the control population but this will&#xD;
      need to be investigated further during data analysis. There is potential for a patient to be&#xD;
      under sedation (as discussed above) for a longer time if using US rather than the standard of&#xD;
      care palpation only, but this is currently unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSF will be sent to the lab and analyzed with the tests that are deemed needed by the&#xD;
      practitioner. In general, it is commonplace for a &quot;CSF Cell Count &amp; Differential&quot; to be&#xD;
      ordered on all CSF samples as this is a baseline test of the sample. The data provided from&#xD;
      this test will be analyzed by research team members via EPIC but the actual sample itself or&#xD;
      what additional tests are ordered will in no way be impacted by the research. Specifically,&#xD;
      this test tells the study team member how many red blood cells are present in the CSF. With&#xD;
      some exceptions, the fewer red blood cells that are present in the CSF fluid is indicative of&#xD;
      a procedure that was able to be performed smoothly, efficiently, and without multiple&#xD;
      attempts. The CSF from the first tube will be used for the &quot;CSF Cell Count &amp; Differential&quot;,&#xD;
      which again is commonplace. In some, uncommon instances (for various reasons including&#xD;
      dehydration, failed LP attempt) only a small amount of CSF can be obtained. Should this be&#xD;
      the case, the practitioner will decide what tests are needed on the small CSF sample. Data&#xD;
      from the procedure (excluding the &quot;CSF Cell Count &amp; Differential&quot; if there was not enough&#xD;
      sample to run this test) may still be used in data analysis so the patient will still be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. An instance in which this may occur is on a dehydrated child where&#xD;
      there are suspicions of meningitis. In this case, the most crucial test to run on the CSF is&#xD;
      a bacteria or viral culture. Again the cell count and differential are still very helpful and&#xD;
      standard to order on these samples but the first priority goes to the culture if there was&#xD;
      only a small sample that was able to be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of time needed to access the patient's medical record by a study team member after&#xD;
      the procedure and lab test completion is approximately 30 minutes per patient. Please refer&#xD;
      to the attached spreadsheet to see exactly what data will be extracted in a de-identified&#xD;
      manner but in general, the patient's age, weight, height, the results of the &quot;CSF Cell Count&#xD;
      &amp; Differential&quot; lab testing, the level of the practitioner but not their identity (ie&#xD;
      resident v attending), and procedure notes will be specifically accessed for collection and&#xD;
      analyzing. This will be done in a HIPAA compliant manner (ie private, secure,&#xD;
      password-protected computers, internet access, and databases). At least weekly a member of&#xD;
      the study team will be accessing patient charts (with the HIPAA data provided by RedCap) in&#xD;
      order to extract the de-identified data required and place in it a secure spreadsheet. After&#xD;
      the de-identified data is collected, the patient's medical chart, as well as PHI, will not&#xD;
      need to be accessed again. No follow-up will be needed for the purposes of this study.&#xD;
