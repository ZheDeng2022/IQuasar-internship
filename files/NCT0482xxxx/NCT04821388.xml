      The Rontis Drug Coated - Peripheral Balloon Catheter is intended for PTA procedure on&#xD;
      atherosclerotically stenotic or obstructed vessels and for the treatment of obstructive&#xD;
      lesions of native or synthetic arteriovenous dialysis fistulae in order to improve the&#xD;
      perfusion and decrease the incidence of restenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it is intended to use Rontis DCB for treatment of lesions in the&#xD;
      femoropopliteal arteries.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is an increasingly common and serious cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      attributable to substantial morbidity, mortality, and health status impairment. The condition&#xD;
      describes a syndrome of atherosclerotic or thromboembolic arterial obstruction resulting in&#xD;
      symptoms of malperfusion of the upper or lower extremities [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) practice&#xD;
      guidelines, patients with PAD fit clinically into one of four categories depending on their&#xD;
      symptoms: asymptomatic, intermittent claudication (IC), chronic limb ischaemia (CLI), or&#xD;
      acute limb ischaemia (ALI). Asymptomatic PAD represents over 50% of patients with PAD. The&#xD;
      classic PAD patient is one who experiences IC: aching pain typically in the calves and/or&#xD;
      buttocks brought on by activity and relieved by rest. This affects around half as many&#xD;
      patients as does asymptomatic PAD. Chronic limb ischaemia is defined as pain at rest or&#xD;
      ulceration with or without tissue necrosis. These patients frequently require amputation,&#xD;
      especially those with an ABI &lt; 0.5. Finally, ALI is typified by rapid onset of limb ischaemia&#xD;
      threatening limb viability. It manifests as increasing claudication and typically progresses&#xD;
      quickly to pain at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral artery disease is estimated to be present in 3% of people in the age range of&#xD;
      40-59 years and in 20% of people over 70 years of age. The femoropopliteal artery is the most&#xD;
      commonly diseased artery in the peripheral circulation and is the site of a larger percentage&#xD;
      of lower limb interventions. Lesions in this territory initially respond well to&#xD;
      recanalization procedures by the endovascular approach; however, the rate of restenosis is&#xD;
      high. Restenosis is caused by neointimal hyperplasia, a hyperproliferative response to the&#xD;
      vessel injury caused by angioplasty and the foreign body reaction and abnormal vessel&#xD;
      geometry caused by stent implantation. The optimal endovascular therapy for peripheral artery&#xD;
      disease (PAD) has evolved over the last decade. Previous research has demonstrated that the&#xD;
      long-term outcome is poor for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) alone in the&#xD;
      infrainguinal region, with restenosis rates exceeding 40% within 1 year. Further studies have&#xD;
      suggested that self-expanding stents may provide higher patency rates when compared to&#xD;
      balloon angioplasty. However, observations indicate higher than anticipated rates of stent&#xD;
      fractures and in-stent restenosis (ISR), leaving room for an alternative strategy.&#xD;
      Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) have emerged as a mechanism to deliver pharmacotherapies to the&#xD;
      arterial wall, while leaving no foreign material behind. Drug-coated balloons are important&#xD;
      innovations in the treatment of PAD. DCBs, like stents, offer potential greater treatment&#xD;
      efficacy over standard PTA, but with the advantage of not leaving an implanted device (i.e.,&#xD;
      stent) in the artery. This provides number of potential advantages including preserving&#xD;
      options for subsequent surgical bypass, should it be necessary, and improving the ease of&#xD;
      percutaneous re-treatment, should initial treatment fail. Furthermore, DCBs allow for greater&#xD;
      opportunity for percutaneous treatment strategies in areas where stents may be less&#xD;
      desirable, such as the popliteal artery. Several manufacturers have developed balloons coated&#xD;
      with paclitaxel for the treatment of infrainguinal PAD. Employed as a chemotherapeutic agent,&#xD;
      paclitaxel irreversibly binds to microtubules of the endothelial cells on the vessel wall and&#xD;
      inhibits cell division, thus hindering neointimal proliferation and the resulting restenosis.&#xD;
      DCBs utilize an excipient or carrier substance to hold the drug on the balloon surface during&#xD;
      transit to the target lesion. The excipient can also assist in delivery of the drug to the&#xD;
      artery wall during balloon inflation. A paclitaxel-coated balloon using a urea excipient&#xD;
      (Lutonix-Bard) was the first to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for&#xD;
      the treatment of superficial femoral artery (SFA) and popliteal lesions in October 2014.&#xD;
      Another iteration (IN.PACT, Medtronic) from a different manufacturer uses polysorbate and&#xD;
      sorbitol excipients and was subsequently approved for the same lesion substrate in December&#xD;
      2014; an indication for in-stent restenosis (ISR) was granted 2 years later (September 2016).&#xD;
      Most recently, a third DCB (Stellarex, Spectranetics) was approved by FDA, and several others&#xD;
      are currently undergoing evaluation in investigational device exemption (IDE) trials. In the&#xD;
      European Union a gradually increasing list of DCBs has gained CE mark and is available in the&#xD;
      market. DCBs coated with drugs other than paclitaxel, including zotarolimus, sirolimus, and&#xD;
      everolimus, have been studied in animal models, but have not been used clinically in humans&#xD;
      for peripheral interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general and independent from study participation, doctors are free to decide on the best&#xD;
      therapy approach for their patients, e.g. they can decide on the basis of their knowledge and&#xD;
      experience whether the lesion would benefit from DCB usage or standard uncoated balloon or&#xD;
      stenting. They are free to decide whether or not to use the study; only subjects who are&#xD;
      treated with the Rontis DCB will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will first test the safety of the RontisDCB and then test the efficacy of Rontis&#xD;
      DCB compared to historical data derived from standard PTA alone or use of uncoated balloons.&#xD;
      Further information on the Rontis DCB can be found in the Investigator's Brochure (IB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will gain safety and efficacy information on subjects with lesions in the&#xD;
      femoropopliteal artery of 3-15 cm length who receive the Rontis DCB following traditional&#xD;
      predilatation with an uncoated angioplasty balloon prior to inflation of the DCB.&#xD;
