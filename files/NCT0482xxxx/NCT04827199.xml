    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation is designed as an interventional, prospective, non-randomized,&#xD;
      open-label, single arm, multicentric and international study for obtaining CE marking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be the first performed with the ARTUS MONO AUS medical device aiming to assess&#xD;
      safety and performance and will be composed of three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pilot phase (with safety analysis on the 10 first included subjects in 3 investigational&#xD;
           sites),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pivotal phase (in up to 7 investigational sites with a follow-up until the 12-month&#xD;
           post-device activation visit, including an interim analysis at 3-month post-device&#xD;
           activation visit on performance and safety),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  long-term phase (with a long-term follow-up until 10 years post implantation in up to 7&#xD;
           investigational sites).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives is to assess safety and clinical performance of the ARTUS MONO AUS for the&#xD;
      treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence at short and long-term.&#xD;

As there is no comparator, there is no randomization and no blinding in the study.&#xD;
Clinical performance outcomes will be measured for each subject at baseline (before implantation) and post-implantation.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).&#xD;
The descriptive system comprises five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) of 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.&#xD;
The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.</description>

    <description>The MSHQ is a 25-item self-administered questionnaire. It encompasses 3 scales: Erection scale (3 items), Ejaculation scale (7 items), Satisfaction scale (6 items), and 9 additional items addressing sexual activity, time since last sexual encounter, level and changes in sexual activity, and bother associated with sexual dysfunction. Response options consist of dichotomous (Yes/No) scales, as well as 5 and 6- point likert scales.&#xD;
Scores by dimension:&#xD;
Erection scale: 0-15 (higher score =higher sexual functioning)&#xD;
Ejaculation scale: 1-35 (higher score =higher sexual functioning)&#xD;
Satisfaction scale: 6-30 (higher score =higher level of satisfaction)</description>
