  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrence rate after curative treatment for locally advanced Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)&#xD;
      is reported varying from 15% to 30% of cases, while approximately 5-11% of patients present&#xD;
      with de novo metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In NPC, the immunogenicity of the cancer cell is derived from accumulated somatic mutations,&#xD;
      but also from genomic and proteomic differences between host and Epstein Barr Virus (EBV).&#xD;
      However, anti-cancer immune response tends to be feeble. This impaired anti-cancer immunity&#xD;
      could be attributed to multiple factors including strategies to escape anti-cancer immunity.&#xD;
      One of this is switch to immunosuppressive microenvironment, as well as aberrant negative&#xD;
      co-stimulatory signals like PD-L1, that is over expressed in NPC. In 2017, the landmark&#xD;
      KEYNOTE-028 trial firstly reported promising antitumor activities and safety profiles of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in previously treated RM-NPC Overall, after the treatment of PD-1 inhibitors,&#xD;
      about 25% and 60% of the recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients achieved&#xD;
      ORR and DCR, respectively, with a profile of toxicities in line with the use of immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors in other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it was found that some non-BRCA-mutated tumors often harbor other alterations in HR&#xD;
      genes except for germline BRCA deleterious mutations, thus making these tumors could benefit&#xD;
      from PARPi treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARP could contribute to resistance to chemotherapy induced DNA damage, NPC cell platinum&#xD;
      resistant could use PARP to repair and escape apoptosis. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma PARP1 is&#xD;
      overexpressed in comparison with normal nasopharyngeal cells, LMP1 (latent membrane protein&#xD;
      one) activates PARP1 and increases Poly(ADP-ribos)ylation (PARylation) through PARP1. A&#xD;
      preclinical study demonstrates that LMP1+ cells are more sensitive to PARP1 inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving PARPi treatment, accumulated chromosome rearrangements generate plenty of&#xD;
      neoantigens and elevate the immunogenicity of tumor, PARPi-mediated acute inflammation&#xD;
      remodels tumor immune microenvironment and drives a systemic Th1-skewing immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the POINT trial will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously (IV) on Day 1 of&#xD;
      every 3-week dosing cycle (Q3W) and olaparib 300 mg capsules twice a day (BID) every day&#xD;
      starting from Day 1 of Cycle 1. Treatment with protocol therapy will continue until objective&#xD;
      disease progression, any prohibitive toxicity or until a maximum of 35 treatment cycles (up&#xD;
      to 2 years).&#xD;

      Before any study specific procedure is performed the patient will sign an informed consent&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every effort should be done to obtain a new tumor biopsy from relapsed-metastatic disease,&#xD;
      but a new biopsy is not necessary to participate to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo radiologic staging investigations according to guidelines, including&#xD;
      pre-treatment head and neck MRI and whole body FDG-PET (or thorax and abdomen CT scan) and&#xD;
      clinical evaluation with fiberendoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously (IV) on Day 1 of every 3-week dosing&#xD;
      cycle (Q3W) and olaparib 300 mg capsules twice a day (BID) every day starting from Day 1 of&#xD;
      Cycle 1. Treatment with protocol therapy will continue until objective disease progression,&#xD;
      any prohibitive toxicity or until a maximum of 35 treatment cycles (up to 2 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who must discontinue one of the two drugs in the combination due to adverse events&#xD;
      may continue the study with the other combination drug. Once patients have been discontinued&#xD;
      from study treatment, other treatment options will be at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose reductions will be allowed according to protocol-specified rules. Tumor response will be&#xD;
      evaluated by clinical/endoscopic evaluation every 3 weeks and by radiological imaging every 9&#xD;
      weeks (Â±7 days) since treatment start. After the first year, the radiological imaging&#xD;
      frequency can be modified as clinically indicated. Radiologic response will be assessed by&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for plasmatic EBV-DNA analysis will be performed at baseline, and, if positive,&#xD;
      at week 3, week 9 and then every 9 weeks since treatment start (however in concomitance with&#xD;
      the radiological imagining) and at every follow up visit (in case of EBER-positive tumor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for treatment safety at each clinical visit by means of clinical&#xD;
      and laboratory exams. All adverse events will be recorded by Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0; the investigator will assess whether those events are&#xD;
      drug related or not. All enrolled patients will be included in overall safety analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in the Quality-of-Life (QoL) since baseline using the European Organization for&#xD;
      Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck Module (EORTC&#xD;
      QLQ-HN43) will be evaluated at first visit, every 9 weeks during treatment and at the follow&#xD;
      up visit.&#xD;
