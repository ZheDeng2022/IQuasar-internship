  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due the uncertainty of the pandemic wave and government restrictions that may affect health&#xD;
      care services and behaviour, alternative mhealth strategies should be explored to identify&#xD;
      breastfeeding support or problems early to prevent subsequent cessation that may affect&#xD;
      mother and child health. It is also important to understand the feasibility of a WhatsApp&#xD;
      online group on breastfeeding by peer counsellors during postnatal period and the&#xD;
      acceptability of such intervention. Therefore this study will provide preliminary information&#xD;
      necessary for implementation of a full RCT of mhealth intervention in the future. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of a WhatsApp online peer support&#xD;
      group program in improving breastfeeding practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been no published studies that have examined the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      a Whatsapp online group on breastfeeding for postnatal women in Hong Kong. Given the&#xD;
      significant pandemic problem that may affect health services and health behavior of pregnant&#xD;
      women, the proposed study will contribute substantial new information about the feasibility&#xD;
      and potential implications for future care pathways for postnatal women. Such information&#xD;
      will be invaluable to public health professional working to breastfeeding promotion and to&#xD;
      health policy makers in setting institutional policies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Mobile health (mhealth) refers to delivering health care and health promotion through mobile&#xD;
      devices [1]. Advances of mobile technologies have led to increased use of mhealth&#xD;
      interventions for effective healthy infant feeding practices and breastfeeding promotion. A&#xD;
      meta-analysis reviewed that mhealth significantly improved exclusive breastfeeding&#xD;
      initiation, breastfeeding attitude and knowledge [2]. Whether more interactive and adaptive&#xD;
      mHealth platforms, including smartphone apps and social networking tools, could further&#xD;
      improve breastfeeding outcomes remains understudied. Smartphones have become new channels and&#xD;
      tools for information acquisition and exchange and have been well adopted by the general&#xD;
      public. In 2019, the number of smartphone users in Hong Kong was estimated to reach 6.5&#xD;
      million. By the year 2025, it is predicted that 93% of the population in Hong Kong will use a&#xD;
      smartphone [3]. Among instant messaging apps for smartphones, WhatsApp is regarded as one of&#xD;
      the largest social network platforms used in Hong Kong. WhatsApp is a free all in one&#xD;
      communications app widely used for sending text and voice messages, video calls. Online&#xD;
      discussion platforms have been used, acceptable, affordable and accessible in previous years&#xD;
      for promoting physical activity [4], a healthy diet [5], smoking cessation [6] and reducing&#xD;
      alcohol use [7]. Interventions using these communication tools tend to have high uptake due&#xD;
      to personalized intervention and instant response without having time and location&#xD;
      limitations. Whether WhatsApp can be used as a communication tool to positively change&#xD;
      selected behaviours has yet to be assessed its effects on breastfeeding outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the current pandemic and social distancing measures, this study offers insight on the&#xD;
      practicality and feasibility of supporting Chinese mothers who are housebound due to Chinese&#xD;
      traditional cultural &quot;doing the month&quot; in which Chinese mothers are housebound during the&#xD;
      first month post-birth. In addition, due to the pandemic, there is limited face to face&#xD;
      antenatal and postnatal support from the health services. Unresolved problems and inadequate&#xD;
      support with infant feeding may result in a decision to stop exclusively breastfeeding. Our&#xD;
      previous qualitative study suggested that WhatsApp messaging might be a viable way of&#xD;
      promoting breastfeeding (unpublished data). Therefore, a pilot study is developed to address&#xD;
      an important service gap in Hong Kong to promote and sustain exclusive breastfeeding.&#xD;
      However, there might be potential barriers to successful implementation and to evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the innovation intervention. This is the first WhatsApp breastfeeding&#xD;
      support programme provided by peer supporters in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, the most recent&#xD;
      breastfeeding survey showed that the exclusive breastfeeding rate at 6 months was 26.3% in&#xD;
      Hong Kong [8]. Furthermore, more than 88% of mothers initiated breastfeeding but half of&#xD;
      breastfeeding mothers never exclusively breastfed their babies [8]. Despite the importance of&#xD;
      exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months postpartum, the maintenance of exclusive&#xD;
      breastfeeding is a major public health issue particularly in Hong Kong where the rate on&#xD;
      exclusive breastfeeding duration indicated that it tailed off during the first 2 months [8].&#xD;
      This indicates novel approaches are needed to engage hard to reach mothers who encounter&#xD;
      breastfeeding problems or support during the first 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing services mainly target mothers in clinical or primary care settings delivered by&#xD;
      health professionals for promoting breastfeeding. Hong Kong has an extensive smartphone&#xD;
      penetration rate (78% in 2020). Therefore, before proceeding with a full scale randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT), a feasibility and pilot study is needed to identify if a WhatsApp&#xD;
      online group on breastfeeding by peer counsellors, delivered through instant/video messaging&#xD;
      support, designed to improve breastfeeding outcomes is feasible and acceptable. The main&#xD;
      objective of the study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a WhatsApp online group&#xD;
      on breastfeeding by peer counsellors over a six-month period in postpartum Chinese women in&#xD;
      Hong Kong.&#xD;
