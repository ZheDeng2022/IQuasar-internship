      The genetic background for cancer treatment may also be different among different areas and&#xD;
      races. There is lack of Taiwanese data of genetic alterations in cancer patients. To&#xD;
      understand the landscape of genetic aberrations of cancer in Taiwan, large scale survey of&#xD;
      the cancer patients is indicated. In this pilot study, the investigators want to evaluate the&#xD;
      landscape of genetic aberrations in cancer patients via oncopaenl test and collect the&#xD;
      clinical data of the patients. The result of the oncopanel test will be returned to patient&#xD;
      and their attending physician for reference of their further treatment. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators want to correlate the clinical outcome with the genetic aberrations of the&#xD;
      cancer patients in Taiwan. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a rare cancer compared&#xD;
      with the other solid tumors. C-KIT or PDGFRA mutation is found in approximately 85-90% of&#xD;
      GISTs. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting c-KIT, has been used to treat advanced&#xD;
      GIST successfully since 2000. However, resistance to imatinib may develop either via&#xD;
      secondary mutation of c-KIT or primary resistance to those with wild type c-KIT and PDGFRA.&#xD;
      Although sunitinib and regorafenib have been approved as second and third line of treatment&#xD;
      for advanced GIST, the progression free survival were only 6.8 and 4.8 months, respectively.&#xD;
      The genetic landscape of GIST with wild type c-KIT and PDGFRA was less studied. In the&#xD;
      current study, the investigators want to focus on the GISTs with wild type c-KIT and PDGFRA&#xD;
      to perform the NGS oncopanel for these patients. Then the investigators can understand the&#xD;
      genetic aberrations of these patients (wild type GIST) and help for searching the potential&#xD;
      treatment targets to them.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cancer is the most common cause of death in Taiwan since 1982. The incidence of cancer is&#xD;
      increasing worldwide, including Taiwan. Cancers in early stage can usually treated with&#xD;
      surgery with a good prognosis. However, the prognosis for recurrent, locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic cancers are poor with a shorter survival. Systemic treatments are usually&#xD;
      indicated for these patients. Chemotherapy is the main stay for advanced cancer patients.&#xD;
      However, the advances in the understanding of cancer biology and identification of targeted&#xD;
      therapeutics not only increase the treatment strategies of cancer but also improves the&#xD;
      survival and quality of life of the cancer patients. There are more and more molecularly&#xD;
      targeted therapy developed and approved for the treatment of advanced cancer patients&#xD;
      currently, which makes the beginning of precision cancer medicine. There are more and more&#xD;
      treatments can be used based on the genetic aberrations of the cancers. Because one cancer&#xD;
      type may habor various genetic aberrations, it is not enough to check only one or a few genes&#xD;
      for a patient to choose the adequate treatment. Because the advance in multiplex genomic&#xD;
      test, several NGS-based cancer-associated genetic panel test (oncopanel) have been developed&#xD;
      and used to identify the genetic alterations in each patient, particularly the actionable&#xD;
      genes. Large scale checks of oncopanel have been executed in US. The study showed the genetic&#xD;
      alterations in various cancer types and 11% of the patients had further molecular targeted&#xD;
      therapy based on the result of the oncopanel test. The similar program was done in Japan.&#xD;
      Moreover, the oncopanel test have been implicated in their clinical practice and the cost was&#xD;
      reimbursed by the government in Japan and Korea recently. The precision medicine and such&#xD;
      personalized treatment is the trend for cancer treatment. The trend of such treatment&#xD;
      patterns is also observed in Taiwan. The genetic background for cancer treatment may also be&#xD;
      different among different areas and races. There is lack of Taiwanese data of genetic&#xD;
      alterations in cancer patients. To understand the landscape of genetic aberrations of cancer&#xD;
      in Taiwan, large scale survey of the cancer patients is indicated. In this pilot study, the&#xD;
      investigators want to evaluate the landscape of genetic aberrations in cancer patients via&#xD;
      oncopaenl test and collect the clinical data of the patients. The result of the oncopanel&#xD;
      test will be returned to patient and their attending physician for reference of their further&#xD;
      treatment. In addition, the investigators want to correlate the clinical outcome with the&#xD;
      genetic aberrations of the cancer patients in Taiwan. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)&#xD;
      is a rare cancer compared with the other solid tumors. C-KIT or PDGFRA mutation is found in&#xD;
      approximately 85-90% of GISTs. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting c-KIT, has&#xD;
      been used to treat advanced GIST successfully since 2000. However, resistance to imatinib may&#xD;
      develop either via secondary mutation of c-KIT or primary resistance to those with wild type&#xD;
      c-KIT and PDGFRA. Although sunitinib and regorafenib have been approved as second and third&#xD;

      studied. In the current study, wthe investigators want to focus on the GISTs with wild type&#xD;
