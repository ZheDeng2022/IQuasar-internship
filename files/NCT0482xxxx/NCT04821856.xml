    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, double-blind, parallel group, randomized, placebo-controlled study of&#xD;
      140 participants comparing oral purified cannabidiol isolate (CBD) with placebo in reducing&#xD;
      Severe Behavioral Problems (SBP) at 8 week in children aged 6 - 18 years with Intellectual&#xD;
      Disability (ID). Eligible participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either CBD or&#xD;

    <description>The starting dose of cannabidiol (CBD) will be 5 mg/kg/day and will be administered orally twice daily in doses of 2.5 mg/kg (up titration phase from day 1 to 7). After one week, the dose of CBD will be increased to 10 mg/kg/day in two daily doses of 5mg/kg (8-week maintenance phase from day 8 to 63). On completion of the maintenance phase the dose of CBD will be decreased to 5mg/kg/day for one week (day 64 to 70), after which the CBD administration will cease.&#xD;
A ceiling dose of 1000mg/day will be administered to all participants weighing 100kg or greater. These participants will receive a dose of 500mg/day during up- and down-titration.&#xD;
Doses will be rounded to the nearest 10mg (0.1mL).</description>

    <ipd_description>The de-identified data set collected for this analysis of the RCT of CBD in children and adolescents with ID will be available six months after publication of the primary outcome. The study protocol and analysis plan will also be available. The data must be obtained from the Murdoch Children's Research Institute. Prior to releasing any data the following are required: a data access agreement must be signed between relevant parties, the 'RCT of CBD in children and adolescents with ID' Trial Steering Committee must see and approve the data analysis plan describing how the data will be analysed, there must be an agreement around appropriate acknowledgment and any additional costs involved must be covered. Should the Trial Steering Committee be unavailable, this role is delegated to the Murdoch Children's Research Institute. Data will only be shared with a recognized research organisation which has approved the proposed analysis plan.</ipd_description>
