  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate if the addition of a 12-week program of&#xD;
      home-based high intensity interval training to a standard educational program aiming at&#xD;
      preventing hypoglycemia episodes will restore hypoglycemia awareness in people living with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes and impaired awareness of hypoglycemia to a further extent than a standard&#xD;
      educational program alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized for 12 weeks to the standard educational program with or&#xD;
      without high intensity interval training. The Gold method will be used to identify people&#xD;
      with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The educational program will consist of two education sessions on avoidance of hypoglycemia,&#xD;
      causes of hypoglycemia, treatment (e.g. glucagon) of hypoglycemia, how to better recognize&#xD;
      hypoglycemia symptoms, understand how to use a CGM/Flash-GM and understand CGM/Flash-GM&#xD;
      reports to adjust insulin doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the training program will be asked to train three times per week&#xD;
      for 12 weeks following the home-based program that will be provided to them. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to perform at least 2 training sessions per week (ideally all 3 sessions) with&#xD;
      the exercise specialist on a virtual platform.&#xD;

Each study participant will be asked to train 3 times per week following the home-based program that will be provided to them. Participants will be asked to perform at least 2 training sessions per week with the exercise specialist on a virtual platform. The training session will consist of a 3 to 5-minute low-intensity warm-up followed by 6 to 12 1-minute bouts of high-intensity exercise interspersed with 1-minute bouts of low-intensity exercise. Each session will end with a 3-minutes cool-down period.</description>
