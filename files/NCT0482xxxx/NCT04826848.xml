  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no clear consensus on the use of pneumonia severity index (PSI) developed for&#xD;
      community-acquired pneumonia in hospital-acquired pneumonia cases. In another aspect, PSI is&#xD;
      a relatively difficult scoring system that includes many parameters. This study evaluated&#xD;
      whether lactate clearance could be used as a mortality marker instead of PSI in&#xD;
      hospital-acquired pneumonia. As a result, lactate clearance was lower in the mortal group and&#xD;
      when the diagnostic statistics were evaluated, it was seen that the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity rates were significantly higher. In conclusion, lactate clearance has been&#xD;
      evaluated as a strong predictor of mortality in hospital-acquired pneumonia.&#xD;
