  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a Fitbit charge&#xD;
      to monitor and promote physical activity in a diverse population of Hispanic women with&#xD;
      chronic neurological disorders. Hispanic women will also receive behavioral coaching using a&#xD;
      Lifestyle Redesign approach to enhance physical activity in their daily lives. The secondary&#xD;
      goal of this proposal is to investigate whether changes in physical activity are associated&#xD;
      with (i) quality of life including perception of health and well- being and (ii) frequency of&#xD;
      hospital and county clinic visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will provide feasibility on use of wearable technology for tracking and&#xD;
      self-monitoring physical activity (PA) as well as preliminary data to support our overall&#xD;
      approach for promoting PA and improving disease status in a Hispanic women population. A&#xD;
      larger application will be submitted to the NIH, DoD, or other federal agency focused on&#xD;
      investigating the impact of PA on chronic neurological diseases in a diverse and inclusive&#xD;
      Hispanic population in LA County.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.1 Specific Aim 1 establishes feasibility of this approach by measuring adherence and&#xD;
      change in PA using a Fitbit alta HR activity monitor in Hispanic women with chronic&#xD;
      neurological diseases. Adherence will be determined through: (i) the average hours/day of&#xD;
      use; and (ii) the length of time (percent of total study days) of usage throughout the&#xD;
      16-week study. Adherence defined as (i) 5 or more days/week of use and (ii) 10 or more hours&#xD;
      of use during the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.2 Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that an increase in physical activity will be&#xD;
      correlated with a decrease in LA County (LAC) Facilities health care use (hospital and clinic&#xD;
      visits). Physical activity will be assessed by change in either: (i) the average number of&#xD;
      steps/week; and (ii) average time spent in sedentary, light, or moderate to vigorous&#xD;
      intensity based on MET (metabolic expenditure) of physical activity/week. Methods: Changes in&#xD;
      PA outcome metrics over the 16-week period will be correlated with the total number of&#xD;
      hospital/outpatient clinic visits. Total hospital use will be determined through the LAC/DHS&#xD;
      (Department of Human Services) electronic medical records and will include outpatient&#xD;
      provider visits, emergency room and urgent care visits, total hospitalizations, and days&#xD;
      spent in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.3 Specific Aim 3a tests the hypothesis that increase in physical activity is associated&#xD;
      with an increase in the quality of life (QOL). Physical activity will be measured through:&#xD;
      (i) the average number of steps/week; and (ii) average intensity of physical activity/week.&#xD;
      QOL will be determined through measures of self-rated health and well-being. These Spanish&#xD;
      validated surveys will include illness perception questionnaire and health and well-being&#xD;
      questionnaire&#xD;

    <measure>Spanish Physical Activity Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>This self-administered questionnaire determines total physical activity (MET-h week-1 ) and total number of hours sitting down across a week to evaluate the levels of participants' physical activity and sedentary lifestyle. The number of METs (metabolic equivalents) corresponding to each activity are calculated using the Compendium of Physical Activities as the ratio of energy expended during a physical activity to the metabolic rate. Afterwards, the number of METs in each activity is multiplied by the weekly participation in that activity. The estimated number of MET-h week -1 is weighted according to the number of months dedicated to each activity. Recreational physical activity is quantified by summing the MET-h week -1 dedicated to all activities performed during leisure time. Total physical activity (MET-h week -1) is calculated by adding leisure-time physical activity to work physical activity.</description>

    <measure>FitBit Wear Technology Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of this questionnaire is to ascertain participants' opinions on the usability of the Fitbit phone application, Fitbit activity monitor, and combination of the Fitbit and Fitbit Application. Participants score questions pertaining to usability on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). These scores are averaged and expressed as a percentage of 100, with higher scores indicating greater usability.</description>

    <description>Participants will be provided a Fitbit Alta HR and wall charger. Each participant will be assigned a unique ID# at baseline and used to set-up the data acquisition. The Fitbit app will be set up on their smartphone to allow self-monitoring of activity. The Fitbit device includes both an accelerometer and heart rate monitor, capable of continuous measuring and storing data up to 5 days. Fitbit data will be passively downloaded through smartphone connection to Fitabase, a research friendly application and data management program. The Fitbit will be worn on the wrist every day during the course of the 16-week study, with instructions on self- monitoring, usage and maintenance. Participants will be monitored for Fitbit compliance by weekly phone calls; and monitoring of passively downloaded Fitbit data through Fitabase. Follow-up phone call at 3-months post-study will assess continued use of the Fitbit activity monitor.</description>

    <intervention_name>Lifestyle Redesign Coaching</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will receive individualized goal setting and a guide to increase exercise at baseline and at week four visit. The Occupational therapist (OT) will administer a well published approach for promoting PA called Lifestyle Redesign which addresses physical, psychosocial and environmental barriers to health and incorporate self-care strategies and goal setting. Coaching will be administered by a bilingual OT and in Spanish. Based on studies examining PA and brain health, the OT will guide the participant through a goal setting process for moderate to vigorous intensity of physical activity including a specific guide plan to achieve these goals of 10,000 steps per day and/or 150 minutes/week of moderate to vigorous activity. Participants will also receive weekly calls from the study coordinator (overseen by OT) to review PA and goal setting for each week over the course of the 16-week study.</description>
