  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with poor surgical outcome and complications. The literature does not&#xD;
      provide a comprehensive view on the effect of body mass index (BMI) on perioperative outcomes&#xD;
      in orthopedic surgeries. Therefore, we aim to determine the effect of BMI on 30-day&#xD;
      perioperative outcomes in patients undergoing the first 25 most commonly performed orthopedic&#xD;
      surgeries using a retrospective cohort study design. The knowledge of the effect of BMI on&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeries will improve the knowledge of surgeons about the expected morbidities.&#xD;

      Obesity is associated with poor surgical outcome and complications. The literature does not&#xD;
      provide a comprehensive view on the effect of body mass index (BMI) on perioperative outcomes&#xD;
      in orthopedic surgeries. Therefore, we aim to determine the procedure specific,&#xD;
      independent-effect of BMI on 30-day perioperative outcomes in patients undergoing the first&#xD;
      25 most commonly performed orthopedic surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a retrospective cohort study. The subjects will be the individuals undergoing&#xD;
      one of first 25 most commonly performed orthopedic surgeries, whose information is derived&#xD;
      form the de-identified patients' data collected through the American College of Surgeons&#xD;
      National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database. The primary outcome will&#xD;
      be composite post-operative morbidity. Specific morbidities will also be evaluated including&#xD;
      cardiovascular, vascular and renal complications, length-of-stay (LOS), and the need for&#xD;
      re-intervention and readmission, as well as 30-day mortality. Descriptive statistics and&#xD;
      multivariable regression models will assess the independent-effect of BMI on outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge of the effect of BMI on orthopedic surgeries will improve the knowledge of&#xD;
      surgeons about the expected morbidities. The surgeon will be able to better counsel obese&#xD;
      patients and devise a better surgical plan to prevent or deal with the expected outcomes.&#xD;
