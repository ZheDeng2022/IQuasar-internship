  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to gain information concerning the acute and longer-term&#xD;
      morphological changes within the uterus following endometrial ablation. Hysteroscopic&#xD;
      evaluation of the uterine cavity will be used to determine if physical access and the ability&#xD;
      to systematically assess the post-ablation uterine cavity were preserved. The presence,&#xD;
      location and severity of intrauterine adhesions will be documented in participants who are 3,&#xD;
      6 and 12 months from their standard of care endometrial ablation.&#xD;

      Prospective single center observational study. Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled (up to 10&#xD;
      subjects per time point). Patients who sign the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved&#xD;
      consent form who have undergone endometrial ablation within the prior 14 months from time of&#xD;
      consent will be asked to participate in this study. Patients meeting all eligibility criteria&#xD;
      will undergo either a 3, 6 or 12 month diagnostic second look hysteroscopy (SLH) as assigned&#xD;
      by the Investigator depending on the duration of time between the ablation and the signature&#xD;
      date of the informed consent (up to 10 subjects for each time point). A diagnostic SLH will&#xD;
      be performed for scoring of intrauterine adhesions by the investigator and an independent&#xD;
      reviewer. The ability to access the uterine cavity (or not) will be documented.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Premenopausal female patients â‰¥ 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has undergone endometrial ablation within the prior 14 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There were no contraindications for endometrial ablation as specified in Ablation&#xD;
             System labeling&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient agrees to undergo an SLH either at 3, 6 or 12 months post-ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient abstained from any form of hormonal contraception including an IUD after the&#xD;
             ablation and through the period that the SLH is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has signed the IRB approved informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additional intrauterine procedures performed between time of endometrial ablation and&#xD;
             the SLH; e.g., endometrial and/or myometrial resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IUD in situ&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant (positive urine pregnancy test) or lactating&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active sexually transmitted infection or genital infection, or other clinically&#xD;
             significant active and/or systemic infection per clinical or laboratory examinations&#xD;
             at the time of endometrial ablation procedure or second look hysteroscopy (e.g.,&#xD;
             cervicitis, vaginitis, endometritis, or salpingitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic steroid within 1 week of endometrial ablation&#xD;

          -  Previous adhesiolysis procedure or diagnosis of Asherman's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No noted clinically significant uterine anomalies at the time of the ablation (e.g.,&#xD;
             septate uterus or other anomalies that distorts the uterine cavity)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator could represent an&#xD;
             increased risk for the subject, affect the primary outcomes of this study and/or&#xD;
             impact the subject's ability to comply with protocol requirements.&#xD;
