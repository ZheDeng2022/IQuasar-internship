  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a new mode of mechanical ventilation that&#xD;
      delivers ventilatory assist in proportion to neural effort. The investigators hope to compare&#xD;
      the hemodynamic and pulmonary effect in children after surgical repair of congenital heart&#xD;
      disease with right ventricular hypertrophic ventilated with Pressure control ventilation&#xD;
      (PCV), Pressure support ventilation (PSV), and NAVA by a crossover study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the patients suffered from congenital heart disease with right ventricular hypertrophy,&#xD;
      the preload of the heart will be influenced by the variation of the intrathoracic pressure.&#xD;
      The cardiopulmonary interaction during mechanical ventilation will be an important influence&#xD;
      factor on hemodynamics after surgical repair for these patients. As a new mode of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, NAVA delivers ventilatory assist in proportion to patients' neural effort&#xD;
      avoiding over ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed a crossover study to evaluate the cardiopulmonary effect in&#xD;
      patients with congenital heart disease with right ventricular hypertrophy when ventilated&#xD;
      with NAVA postoperatively, compared with the conventional mode of pressure control&#xD;
      ventilation and pressure support ventilation. Each patient will undergo three 60-min trials&#xD;
      during the study period in randomized order. The cardiac output and volume status will be&#xD;
      evaluated by a transpulmonary thermodilution device through a pulse contour cardiac output&#xD;
      (PiCCO) catheter at the last 10min of each trial. At the mean while an arterial blood gas and&#xD;
      echocardiography will perform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Datas from the three registrations will be&#xD;
      compared using a repeated-measures ANOVA. The comparison of each mode will be assessed by the&#xD;
      SNK methods post hoc test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.&#xD;
