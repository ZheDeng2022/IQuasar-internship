  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pupil diameter is affected by both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, and its&#xD;
      latency and response amplitude mainly reflect the functional status of the parasympathetic&#xD;
      nerve. Clinically, the diagnosis of neurological diseases can often be made based on changes&#xD;
      in pupils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An appropriate depth of anesthesia can cause minimal damage to the body after surgery,&#xD;
      thereby reducing the impact on brain function and cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of postoperative delirium will have adverse effects on the prognosis of&#xD;
      patients, such as prolonging the hospital stay, increasing the mortality of patients after&#xD;
      surgery, and increasing early postoperative cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
