  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of HIV vaccines. A vaccine is a medical product given to prevent certain&#xD;
      diseases. The vaccine may educate the body to form a defensive response to try to prevent the&#xD;
      disease from the beginning, or preventing it from taking hold of the body. This defensive&#xD;
      response is called the immune response. The experimental vaccines in this study are Env-C&#xD;
      Plasmid DNA and HIV Env gp145 C690 protein, given with different adjuvants. An adjuvant is a&#xD;
      substance added to vaccines that can help make the vaccine more effective by improving the&#xD;
      immune response, or by causing the immune response to last longer than it would without the&#xD;
      adjuvant. The adjuvants are mixed with the vaccines and injected into muscle or placed on top&#xD;
      of the skin. The HIV vaccines contain a piece of genetic material or a protein copied drom&#xD;
      the HIV virus cover (Env), but they do not contain the virus itself. The vaccines cannot&#xD;
      cause HIV infection or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the study vaccines with adjuvants cause side&#xD;
      effects and are tolerable, whether humans respond (develop immune responses) to the vaccines,&#xD;
      and how ling the effects of the study vaccines last. The study will also compare the effects&#xD;
      of the study vaccines with adjuvants and adjuvant patch to those of placebo injections and&#xD;
      placebo patch. The placebo will consist of saline (sterile saltwater) and will look like&#xD;
      study vaccines, be given in the same way, but will have no active vaccine or adjuvant in it.&#xD;
      A total of 126 participants will take part in the study and each will have up to 26 clinic&#xD;
      visits and will be followed-up for a total of 108 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antibodies are the most commonly recognized correlate of vaccine protection from infection;&#xD;
      however the possible protective HIV antibody levels, which were induced by the modestly&#xD;
      protective RV144 vaccine regimen with alum, rapidly decayed. Potentially, a novel, highly&#xD;
      selective adjuvant combined with the correctly sequenced HIV antigen could slow antibody&#xD;
      decay, increase antibody magnitude and induce antibodies of appropriate functional response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RV460 is an exploratory study that will assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity&#xD;
      of a vaccine regimen consisting of priming with an Env-C Plasmid DNA vaccine (with or without&#xD;
      novel adjuvants) when given with or without adjuvanted HIV Env gp145 C.6980 protein vaccine&#xD;
      and boosting with adjuvanted gp145 C.6980 protein with or without the gp120 DNA vaccine. The&#xD;
      study will be carried out in Kericho, Kenya. 126 healthy adults will ben enrolled.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into one of seven groups which have 15/3 vaccine/placebo&#xD;
      recipients per group. Each participant will receive six injections (prim at week 0, 4, 12;&#xD;
      boost at week 20, 32 and 56) and will be followed-up for a total of 108 weeks.&#xD;
