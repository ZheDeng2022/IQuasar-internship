  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is conducted to assess the long-term safety of &quot;jointstem&quot; in patients&#xD;
      with degenerative knee arthritis who participated in the previous BS-JS-IIT1 investigator&#xD;
      initiated trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      JOINTSTEM is injectables for an OA treatment that uses autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells. As it does not use allogenic tissues and is cultured without additional genetic&#xD;
      modification, it is classified as 'autologous cell therapy' and is completely free of&#xD;
      immunologic rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is planned to follow-up the long-term safety of &quot;jointstem&quot; in patients&#xD;
      with degenerative knee arthritis who participated in the previous BS-JS-IIT1 investigator&#xD;
      initiated trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who participate in the BS-JS-IIT1 study and agree to this extension test in writing&#xD;
      will be assessed for safety by conducting laboratory tests, vital signs, physical&#xD;
      examinations and adverse events every 12 months after Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, after unblinding of the BS-JS-IIT1 investigator initiated trial, subjects in the&#xD;
      control group (placebo administration) will terminate the follow-up of this extended clinical&#xD;
      trial and conduct routine treatment for degenerative knee arthritis at the discretion of the&#xD;
      researcher. Appropriate measures and follow-up observations shall be implemented for abnormal&#xD;
      reactions occurred during this extended test period until they are terminated (such as the&#xD;
      loss of the relevant adverse event or inability to conduct follow-up investigations).&#xD;
