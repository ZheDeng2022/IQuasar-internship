  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is assessing the efficacy of MBG-453, a humanized monoclonal antibody, in&#xD;
      treating myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name of the study drug involved in this study is MBG453.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive two-stage phase II clinical trial to assess the activity of the&#xD;
      anti-TIM-3, (T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain) antibody, MBG453, in patients&#xD;
      with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), not eligible for or progressing on frontline&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved MBG453 for myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndromes (MDS), but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug (MBG453) may interact with TIM-3 (an antibody which is a protein that attaches&#xD;
      to foreign infectious/invading cells and signals the immune system) which might aid the&#xD;
      immune system's response by helping immune cells recognize, find, and destroy cancer cells in&#xD;
      the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment,&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment for as long as they and their doctor believe they&#xD;
      are benefiting from the study drug. Participants will then be followed for 12 months after&#xD;
      their last dose of the study drug or until they withdraw their consent to be contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients with MDS with isolated del(5q) (&quot;5q- syndrome&quot;) must have progressed on&#xD;
                  or not tolerated lenalidomide&#xD;

                  criteria are eligible; responses will be assessed using MDS criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of MGB453 in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study,&#xD;
             but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.&#xD;

             function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be&#xD;
             eligible for this trial, participants should be class 2B or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents; a washout of 14 days&#xD;
             or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, is required. The washout period for biologic&#xD;
             agents should be 28 days since the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior exposure to a TIM-3 inhibitor.&#xD;

             Inactive or controlled autoimmune disease is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior solid organ transplant is exclusionary. Patients with prior hematopoietic cell&#xD;
             transplant are eligible if they are over 6 months from transplant and not on any&#xD;
             related immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  carcinoma in situ of the breast, monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, or monoclonal&#xD;
                  gammopathy of undetermined significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormonal therapy is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of other malignancy is allowed if not requiring active management.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other malignancies that were treated with curative intent at least 1 year prior&#xD;
                  to study screening and without evidence of active disease will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or&#xD;
                  treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy&#xD;
                  assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial pending&#xD;
                  discussion with the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not have clinically active HBV or HCV; testing is not required&#xD;

             with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female contraception is required. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because&#xD;
             MBG453 is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with MBG453, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued. Women of child-bearing potential should use highly effective methods of&#xD;
             contraception during treatment and for 150 days after the last dose of MBG453.&#xD;
