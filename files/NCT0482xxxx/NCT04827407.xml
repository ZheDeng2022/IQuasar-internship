  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a global healthcare burden sepsis, it reaches 20-30 million cases annually (WHO&#xD;
      data). Numerous studies have shown that extracorporeal hemoperfusion therapies that eliminate&#xD;
      endotoxin and\or excess of cytokines improve treatment outcomes in patients with septic&#xD;
      shock. The main purpose of the study is to obtain new data on the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      Efferon LPS device in extracorporeal therapy in patients with abdominal sepsis complicated by&#xD;
      septic shock.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a global healthcare burden sepsis, it reaches 20-30 million cases annually (WHO&#xD;
      data). A two-stage trial by Rudnov et al. using one-day data from 62 centres in 29 subjects&#xD;
      of the Russian Federation showed that one third of the patients admitted to the ICU were&#xD;
      patients with infection, one fifth of them developed septic shock, the proportion of hospital&#xD;
      sepsis was 46.6%, and fatal outcome occurred in 30.4% of patients with infection. Despite&#xD;
      apparent advances in intensive care, the prognosis of patients with endotoxaemia and septic&#xD;
      shock remains poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracorporeal removal of toxic substances from the bloodstream by adsorbing them onto a&#xD;
      porous material may provide clear clinical benefits. Extracorporeal blood adsorption method&#xD;
      can be a good complement or substitute for the classical methods of haemofiltration and&#xD;
      haemodialysis if the diffusion or convection of toxic substances through the membrane is not&#xD;
      efficient enough. Since the method was first proposed by Muirhead and Reid in 1948, it has&#xD;
      developed considerably.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), one of the most potent mediators of sepsis, is found in high&#xD;
      concentrations in about 50% of patients with septic shock. The use of extracorporeal sorption&#xD;
      techniques that eliminate endotoxin has been shown in numerous trials to improve outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efferon LPS (Efferon JSC, Moscow, Russia) is a single-use therapeutic device for&#xD;
      extracorporeal blood purification using direct hemoperfusion. Detoxification is carried out&#xD;
      by selective adsorption of lipopolysaccharides (bacterial endotoxins) and non-selective&#xD;
      removal of cytokines by internal porous structure. It is a cylindrical polycarbonate casing&#xD;
      filled with spherical granules of LPS-selective polymeric adsorbent mesoporous beads and&#xD;
      isotonic sodium chloride solution. The device is registered in Russia as a medical device RZN&#xD;
      2019/8886.&#xD;
