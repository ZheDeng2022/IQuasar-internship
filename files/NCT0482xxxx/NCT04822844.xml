      This is a quality improvement project that aims to assess the effect of nurse-driven&#xD;
      administration of essential oil aromatherapy on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in&#xD;
      patients while in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) after general anesthesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this three-month quality improvement project, nurse-driven aromatherapy will be offered to&#xD;
      all patients in the main PACU setting at the Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) Houston&#xD;
      Healthcare Southeast Hospital after they have undergone surgical procedures with general&#xD;
      anesthesia, with the exception of patients who report allergies or sensitivity to ginger or&#xD;
      lavender essential oils (EO) and patients who wish to be excluded from the project.&#xD;

    <description>Within 5 minutes of arrival at the PACU, the PACU nurse will proactively offer the patient a 2x2 gauze with two drops of essential oil (patient's choice of ginger or lavender essential oil) for all patients who have opted to participate, regardless of their nausea and vomiting status. Participating patients will continue to use the essential oil during their stay in the PACU, which is typically 45-60 minutes.</description>
