  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravitreal injections (IVI) are the mainstay of treatment modality in many ophthalmologic&#xD;
      diseases including neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
      and retinal vascular occlusions. Patients endure monthly IVI for several years. Although&#xD;
      standardized topical anesthesia protocols are being carried out, many still suffer from pain&#xD;
      during and after the procedure. Previous studies at the investigators clinic have&#xD;
      demonstrated that alpha-agonist eye drops and cool eye compresses can be successfully used in&#xD;
      order to reduce pain levels when administered prior to IVI. In the current research, the&#xD;
      investigators wish to study whether cooled anesthetic eye drops and antiseptics can be&#xD;
      utilized as well to reduce the pain and subconjunctival hemorrhage caused by bevacizumab IVI.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant's discomfort after intravitreal injection (IVI) as assessed by the visual analog scale (VAS) and pain sensitivity questionnaire (PSQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>Minute 1</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS will be used to measure participant's discomfort, itching, burning, and pain (the VAS scale ranges from 0-10, '0' being no pain at all and '10' being the most severe pain). For each participant, tolerability score will be calculated by averaging the participant's discomfort, itching, burning, and pain. To estimate the participant's baseline pain scores, a self-reported pain sensitivity questionnaire, the PSQ, will be used prior to IVI. This is a validated 17-item questionnaire designed to assess an individual's baseline pain sensitivity.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a standardized topical anesthesia protocol of oxybuprocaine hydrogen chloride (HCl) 0.4% and lidocaine HCl 2% eye drops. Each drop will be instilled 3 times (one drop): At 10 minutes, 5 minutes, and just before the injection. Before the injection patients will receive cul-de-sac 5% povidone-iodine (3 drops) and the peri-ocular skin will be disinfected using a 10% povidone-iodine. A standard intravitreal injection of bevacizumab, 1.25 mg/0.05 ml will be performed through the pars plana with a 30-gauge needle, 3.5 mm from the corneal limbus, at the superior-temporal quadrant. Following the injection, a cotton swab absorbed with 5% povidone-iodine will be applied to the injection site.</description>
