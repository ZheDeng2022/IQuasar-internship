  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemoradiotherapy（CRT） is the main treatment for esophageal cancer patients with recurrent&#xD;
      desease，and checkpoint blockade (PD-1) have been shown to be effective in advanced esophageal&#xD;
      cancer. Therefore, PD-1 combined with chemoradiotherapy （CRT）may further improve the efficacy&#xD;
      and become a new method for the treatment of esophageal cancer.This study intends to conduct&#xD;
      a single-arm, prospective clinical study, aiming to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PD-1&#xD;
      combined with chemoradiotherapy(CRT) in patients with oligometastatic esophageal squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma.&#xD;

    <description>The arm received chemoradiotherapy, 50-60Gy (BED) was given (1.8-2 Gy or 3-4Gy once daily , 5 days a week) to recurrent sites combined with chemotherapy（Cisplatin 75 mg/m2/day 1, and albumin paclitaxel 150 mg/m2/day 1 , every 3 weeks, 2 cycles ).PD-1 antibody (Tislelizumab) was performed simultaneously with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (Triprizumab 200mg，d1，every 3 weeks，2 cycles). After completion of chemoradiotherapy, PD-1 antibody was given continuously with 2-4 cycles of chemotherapy (the same regimen with concurrent chemotherapy) until 1 year or desease progression.</description>
