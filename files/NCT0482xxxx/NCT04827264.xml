  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies report that as few as 44% of athletes undergoing ACL reconstruction were able&#xD;
      to return to their prior level of competitive level of sports. Early return may predispose an&#xD;
      individual to re-injury including graft re-tear, meniscal tears, chondral injuries, and&#xD;
      contralateral knee injuries. Criteria governing clearance to return to sports after ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction has been traditionally defined using time from surgery and one or two&#xD;
      objective criteria, often solely isokinetic quad/hamstring strength. Several studies have&#xD;
      suggested that historical criteria used to assess readiness to return to play (RTP) are&#xD;
      insufficient in identifying individuals at risk of a re-injury. They advocate for additional&#xD;
      functional and dynamic testing, which may better reflect the complex kinematics required in&#xD;
      high level athletic competition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We previously developed a &quot;Safe Return to Play Following ACL Reconstruction Checklist&quot; based&#xD;
      on a systematic review of the literature and expert survey. Seven objective measures were&#xD;
      developed as part of the checklist. The checklist is performed by a certified physical&#xD;
      therapist trained in these performance tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to validate the utility of our &quot;Return to Play Checklist&quot; by&#xD;
      evaluating our patients prospectively for return to play following ACL reconstruction by&#xD;
      comparing a cohort of patient undergoing testing with the checklist versus &quot;clinical&#xD;
      judgement.&quot;&#xD;
