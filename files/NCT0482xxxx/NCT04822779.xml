  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff tendinitis (RCT) has a prevalence between 2.7 and 22%, and predominantly affects&#xD;
      middle-aged women. The pathophysiology has not been fully elucidated to date. RCT is&#xD;
      characterized by hydroxyapatite crystal deposition in the rotator cuff tendons. Approximately&#xD;
      half of the patients with RCT have pain with acute or chronic shoulder mobility limitation.&#xD;
      In some patients, RCT shows a tendency for spontaneous and rapid regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic ultrasound (D-US) is a non-invasive, non-ionizing, and relatively inexpensive&#xD;
      diagnostic imaging method that is safe and reliable in assessing rotator cuff pathology. It&#xD;
      is very sensitive in the identification of calcifications that are shown in grayscale&#xD;
      (B-mode) as hyperechoic structures with or without acoustic shadow. Based on ultrasound&#xD;
      findings, Chiou HJ et al. have classified calcifications into 4 types: type I are arcuate,&#xD;
      type II are fragmented or punctiform, type III are nodular, and type IV are cystic.&#xD;
      Spontaneous resorption may occur with type III and IV calcifications. A positive Doppler&#xD;
      signal (PD) surrounding the calcification is highly correlated with pain intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the European Union of Medical Specialists-Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine&#xD;
      (UEMS-PRM) guidelines, the basis of RCT therapy is individual medical gymnastics (IMG). It&#xD;
      includes exercises aimed to restore full shoulder mobility, and improve rotator cuff and&#xD;
      scapular stabilizer muscles strength. Other passive procedures are elective in the choice of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound therapy is often used in the treatment of musculoskeletal shoulder pathology due&#xD;
      to its thermal and non-thermal effects. It is considered that tissue heating stimulates&#xD;
      healing (vasodilation, acceleration of the metabolism, and improvement of the viscoelastic&#xD;
      properties of the connective tissue). The frequency of ultrasound therapy is selected&#xD;
      depending on the desired depth of action (3 MHz for surface structures up to 2.5 cm depth,&#xD;
      and 1 MHz for deeper structures, up to 5 cm depth). Pulse mode is commonly used in acute,&#xD;
      while continuous in chronic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, only a few studies have evaluated the reduction in calcification size after&#xD;
      ultrasound therapy. Although ultrasound therapy is routinely used in the treatment of painful&#xD;
      shoulder, reviewing the results of research published so far, we can say that current&#xD;
      knowledge about the effectiveness of ultrasound therapy in RCT is inconsistent (only several&#xD;
      studies with a small number of subjects, different parameters of applied ultrasound therapy&#xD;
      in terms of penetration depth, applied energy and duration of treatment). This indicates the&#xD;
      need for further research.&#xD;

      The research will be conducted in the Clinic for Rheumatic Diseases and Rehabilitation,&#xD;
      University Hospital Center Zagreb. The research will be a double-blind randomized control&#xD;
      prospective study. Randomization of patients will be performed before the intervention in the&#xD;
      R software package and the results of the randomization will be known only to the therapist&#xD;
      who will be involved in the treatment. The respondent and the examiner (doctor) will not be&#xD;
      aware of in which group the patient is enrolled. All respondents will sign an informed&#xD;
      consent before the study begins. Research has been approved by the Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      Clinical Hospital Center Zagreb and the Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine,&#xD;
      University of Zagreb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimum sample size of a total of 42 subjects (21 in each group) was estimated according&#xD;
      to the following characteristics: type 1 error (α = 0.05), power (1-β = 0.8) and effect size&#xD;
      [(effect size) 0.2], with the expected use of two - way analysis of variance with two&#xD;
      independent groups and two repeated measurements (2x2 ANOVA) with an estimated minimum&#xD;
      correlation between repeated measurements r = 0.6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are symptomatic RCT (VAS pain ≥ 4 + limited shoulder mobility) with D-US&#xD;
      calcification size ≥ 5 mm, calcification type I and II according to Chiou HJ et al., and&#xD;
      disease duration ≥ 2 months. Exclusion criteria are asymptomatic RCT or RCT with mild&#xD;
      symptoms (VAS pain ≤ 3+ normal shoulder mobility), calcification size &lt;5 mm, type III and IV&#xD;
      calcification according to Chiou HJ et al., duration symptoms less than 2 months, rotator&#xD;
      cuff tendon rupture, adhesive capsulitis, application of corticosteroids in the examined&#xD;
      shoulder in the previous 3 months, glucocorticoid therapy, physical shoulder therapy in the&#xD;
      previous 6 months, shock wave therapy in the previous 12 months, prior percutaneous&#xD;
      calcification irrigation, current cervical or cervicobrachial pain syndrome, inflammatory&#xD;
      rheumatic disease, scapular dyskinesia with positive assisted and repository scapular test,&#xD;
      subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis, recent trauma or malignancy in malignant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, respondents will be able to relieve pain with paracetamol and/or tramadol.&#xD;
      Respondents will keep a diary of analgesia, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&#xD;
      and cryo massage will not be allowed due to their anti-inflammatory effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will record age, sex, dominant arm, height, body weight, body mass index,&#xD;
      cigarette smoking, medications, physical activity (sports), and profession. Clinical&#xD;
      examination will be performed on the first day and the last day of the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound therapy (Sonopuls 490u, Enraf-Nonius, Rotterdam, Kingdom of the Netherlands) will&#xD;
      be used with continuous output, frequency 1 MHz, intensity 1.5 W / cm2 and duration 10 min&#xD;
      per treatment, on the front of the shoulder, on the surface of 2 ultrasound heads (10 cm2),&#xD;
      with the position of the arm in adduction and internal rotation in RCT of the supraspinatus,&#xD;
      adduction and external rotation of the arm in RCT of the subscapularis and the position of&#xD;
      the arm over the opposite shoulder in RCT of the infraspinatus. Sham ultrasound therapy will&#xD;
      be applied in the same way as ultrasound therapy, using a frequency of 0 Hz, intensity 0 W /&#xD;
      cm2, 10 min per treatment. All respondents will conduct IMG that includes: unloading pendular&#xD;
      exercises if strength exercises cannot be started immediately, shoulder range exercises, and&#xD;
      rotator cuff and scapula stabilizer exercises for 30 minutes per treatment. The&#xD;
      physiotherapist will apply ultrasound therapy and sham ultrasound therapy by slow circular&#xD;
      motions through a neutral gel and perform IMG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The respondent and the researcher will not know in which group the subject was randomized.&#xD;
      The first group will receive ultrasound therapy and IMG, and the second sham ultrasound&#xD;
      therapy and identical IMG for four weeks (5 therapies per week, a total of 20 therapies). The&#xD;
      researcher will perform a standardized ultrasound examination of the shoulder of all&#xD;
      respondents immediately before and immediately after the therapeutic intervention, measuring&#xD;
      the size of the calcification. Another examiner will make an independent measurement of the&#xD;
      calcification size. The final measure will take the average value of the two. The researcher&#xD;
      will record a positive PD in the tendon around the calcification (on a scale of 0-3), assess&#xD;
      the severity of shoulder pain at rest, at night and when moving using a visual analog scale&#xD;
      of pain (VAS-pain; 0-10), measure passive and active shoulder mobility (goniometer in&#xD;
      degrees), rotator cuff muscle strength (manual muscle test; 0-5), handgrip strength&#xD;
      (hydraulic dynamometer in kg) and assess functional status using the Shoulder Pain and&#xD;
      Disability Index (SPADI)). All respondents will be assessed the overall satisfaction of the&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention using a five-point Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study will be the change in calcification size measured by D-US&#xD;
      before and after the intervention, while other outcome parameters are: reduction of pain, an&#xD;
      increase of shoulder mobility, improvement of functional status, and overall satisfaction&#xD;
      with rehabilitation.&#xD;
