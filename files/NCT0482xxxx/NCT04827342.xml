  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to explore with a feasibility and functionality test the potential of the Ada&#xD;
      DDSS prototype with cases of dyspnea patients using the data collected at the Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED) and the ward of Internal medicine of the University Hospital Basel.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational i.e. non-interventional, prospective feasibility study, which&#xD;
      assesses, through observation, the potential, functionality and diagnostic performance of the&#xD;
      Ada DDSS prototype in evaluating patients presenting with dyspnea as primary predominant&#xD;
      complaint to the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the consent form is signed, the Investigator documents patients' data, medical history,&#xD;
      symptoms and findings with the Ada DDSS prototype. During the entire patient journey through&#xD;
      the hospital (presentation at the ED through to admission in the ward of Internal Medicine)&#xD;
      relevant information are collected and documented in the Ada DDSS prototype simultaneously to&#xD;
      standard documentation by the medical staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination and treatment are carried out by the attending physician without being influenced&#xD;
      or affected by the entry of data in the Ada DDSS prototype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no intervention/change made to the usual care, and therefore neither an intervention&#xD;
      patient group nor a control patient group. The &quot;usual care&quot; that each patient receives is the&#xD;
      control comparison point for the performance of the Ada DDSS. The diagnoses proposed by the&#xD;
      tool at different times (after triage in the emergency centre, when transferred to the ward&#xD;
      and when discharged from the hospital) are then compared with those of the attending&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
