  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After exposure, rabies can be prevented in almost 100% of cases by the administration of&#xD;
      sufficient and timely post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PEP is based on wound cleansing,&#xD;
      antisepsis, administration of rabies vaccine as well as rabies immunoglobulin, if reviewed.&#xD;
      However, anti-rabies PEP remains too often out of financial and / or geographic access,&#xD;
      especially for poor and / or rural populations in endemic countries who remain the most&#xD;
      exposed to the risk of contracting rabies. Two major studies planned in Cambodia between 2014&#xD;
      and 2018 - the RESIST 0/1 clinical - epidemiological study and the RESIST-2 study on the&#xD;
      antibody response to the vaccine - provided the basis that allowed a change in international&#xD;
      recommendations on PPE. Since April 2018, the new &quot;IPC protocol&quot; of three sessions of reduced&#xD;
      double doses (0.1 mL x 2) administered intradermally (ID) over one week has replaced the&#xD;
      already very effective &quot;TRC protocol&quot; of four sessions over one month which was the reference&#xD;
      dose-sparing protocol for endemic countries until 2018. It remains to be determined whether&#xD;
      the IPC protocol (3 sessions / 1 week) confers long-term immunity equivalent to that obtained&#xD;
      after a TRC ID protocol (4 sessions / 1 month). This question is of importance to public&#xD;
      health decision-makers and clinical teams in endemic countries who would hesitate to switch&#xD;
      to the abbreviated IPC protocol.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, randomized, non-inferior clinical trial with samples for examinations&#xD;
      and vaccination booster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this study, persons who previously received PEP and of any age (including&#xD;
      children), gender or medical condition (including pregnant women) and whichever the status of&#xD;
      the dog which bit at least 2, 5 or 10 years ago will be contacted and invited to participate&#xD;
      to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in two centers :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The rabies prevention center at Institut Pasteur du Cambodge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The rabies prevention center at Institut Pasteur de Madagascar. The study will be&#xD;
           coordinated by Institut Pasteur in Paris which will subsequently conduct the analysis in&#xD;
           collaboration with researchers at Institut Pasteur du Cambodge and Institut Pasteur de&#xD;
           Madagascar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in two visits :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the first visit (day 0) : after receiving consent from the participants, the member of&#xD;
           the investigating team will perform the blood sample, followed by a single session of&#xD;
           two intradermal doses of 0.1 mL. The investigators will also carry out measurements and&#xD;
           complete the questionnaire with the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the second visit (day 7) : a follow-up visit will be performed by a member of the&#xD;
           investigating team who will perform a second blood sample to all the participants to the&#xD;
           study. The investigator will complete a second paper CRF with the participants to&#xD;
           document any unwanted effects which may have occurred during the seven days between the&#xD;
           inclusion visit and the follow-up visit.&#xD;
