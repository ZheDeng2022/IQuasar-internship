  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The epidemiology of myocarditis is largely unknown and based mainly on small single-center&#xD;
      studies. The study aim to evaluate the current incidence, clinical characteristics and&#xD;
      outcomes of patients hospitalized due to myocarditis in a general population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this retrospective-prospective study, data from the National Health Fund (NHF), which is&#xD;
      the only public healthcare insurer in Poland is used. The NHF reimburses drugs and healthcare&#xD;
      services provided by healthcare providers (both public and private) with public funds&#xD;
      collected from health insurance premiums. In Poland, public health insurance is obligatory&#xD;
      for almost all Poles - in December 2019, 88.4% of approx. 38 million Poles had public health&#xD;
      insurance and were entitled to obtain healthcare services and drugs reimbursed by the NHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on NHF claims data, the healthcare services reported over the years 2009-2021 with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of myocarditis - hospitalizations reported with codes I40, I40.0, I40.1, I40.8,&#xD;
      I40.9, I41, I41.0, I41.1, I41.2, I41.8, I51.4, B33.2 are derived according to the&#xD;
      International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10).&#xD;
      The dataset is narrowed to the first myocarditis hospitalization, i.e. patients for whom no&#xD;
      information about the diagnosis of myocarditis is reported in the 400 days preceding the&#xD;
      hospitalization. For such a group of patients, and to establish the baseline characteristics&#xD;
      of the patients, data is analyzed 400 days back from the initial diagnosis of myocarditis.&#xD;
      Also, in-hospital and long-term outcomes are analyzed, including all-cause mortality as well&#xD;
      as the occurrence of selected diseases (defined as receiving a service where selected ICD-10&#xD;
      was reported), and selected procedures are obtained, defined with codes according to&#xD;
      International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). For&#xD;
      the follow-up, at least a six-month period is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To show differences related to the age of patients hospitalized due to myocarditis, baseline&#xD;
      characteristics and long-term outcomes are assessed with regard to age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the Central Statistical Office of Poland is also used to refer the obtained results&#xD;
      to the population of Poland and to obtain life tables for survival analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No specific exclusion criteria were applied. No ethics approval was required for this study,&#xD;
      as it involved the analysis of administrative data.&#xD;
