  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objectives of this project are to compare clinical parameters in moderate risk&#xD;
      Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) patients following a Whole Food Plant Based&#xD;
      (WFPB) diet containing a high (4 TB) compared to a low (&lt;1 tsp) amount of raw extra virgin&#xD;
      olive oil.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to sixty-eight primary prevention outpatient adults with intermediate to high ASCVD risk&#xD;
      factors will be randomized in a crossover fashion to follow a WFPB diet without animal&#xD;
      products that is either high (4 tablespoons) or low (&lt; ~1 teaspoon) in raw extra virgin olive&#xD;
      oil. After confirming eligibility and patients provide consent, the research team will&#xD;
      randomize the participant at the baseline visit. The baseline visit and run-in visit 1 will&#xD;
      follow as described below. With the intent of recruiting cohorts of ten, a group of&#xD;
      participants will subsequently begin the first Whole Food Plant Based culinary diet&#xD;
      intervention for four weeks, followed by a one-week (+ 3 days) washout period before&#xD;
      switching to the opposite oil diet for an additional four weeks. During each of the 4-week&#xD;
      interventions, participants will attend weekly cooking sessions that align with the dietary&#xD;
      intervention with a registered dietitian. Patients will be asked to maintain levels of&#xD;
      physical activity through the duration of the study. Data will be collected at the patient's&#xD;
      cardiology visits before and after each diet intervention for a total of four in-person&#xD;
      visits excluding the screening visit.&#xD;

    <description>There will be a total of 4 in-person clinic visits as well as 8 weekly remote cooking classes and individual sessions with a registered dietitian. Subject will first have a physical exam, have their blood (about 3 tablespoons) and urine collected, complete surveys, and talk about their eating style and meal planning. Subject will then follow a plant-based diet high in olive oil for 4 weeks before switching to the other type of diet for 4 weeks.</description>
