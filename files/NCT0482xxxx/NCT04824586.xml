    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to explore which insulin-based regimen is better,&#xD;
      infusion or bolus regimen, for intraoperative management of glucose level for the diabetic&#xD;
      patient at cardiac surgery. Secondary objectives include: comparing the relative amounts of&#xD;
      insulin needed during the operation and subsequent cost impact and comparing potassium levels&#xD;
      between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Office for Research Ethics Committees at&#xD;
      Hashemite University - Prince Hamza hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial with 1:1 allocation ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Adult diabetic patients, type 2, who were admitted to hospital for cardiac&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention: Both patients in the infusion or bolus group received their dose of&#xD;
      insulin, fast-acting human insulin (Actrapid®) was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Patients were recruited at Prince Hamza hospital, Amman, Jordan. A tertiary care&#xD;
      center specialized unit in cardiac surgery for diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes monitoring: It was monitored six times as follows: preoperative induction measure,&#xD;
      then glucose post heparin, and after that for 2 hours, glucose levels were monitored every 30&#xD;
      minutes. Insulin quantities were recorded as well to be used in secondary outcomes analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization, allocation, and blinding During patient enrolment, concealed allocation to&#xD;
      either infusion group or bolus group was guaranteed through the use of a closed envelope&#xD;
      system prepared by an independent investigator. Block randomization with random block sizes,&#xD;
      ensured allocation balance, and avoided selection bias by preventing allocation prediction.&#xD;
      Researchers and physicians were blind to the block size sequence and randomization. Envelopes&#xD;
      were unopened until completion of patient registration. Hospital staff who monitor glucose&#xD;
      and those who administered insulin were blinded to the primary and secondary outcomes'&#xD;
      measure.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Ethical approval and study registration Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the&#xD;

      reference number 2/1/2019/2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Materials This study was a parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial with 1:1&#xD;
      allocation ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Adult diabetic patients, type 2, who were admitted to hospital for cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. In addition to signing the consent form, patients were recruited when they met the&#xD;
      following criteria: &gt;40 years old, patients who need the usual insulin according to insulin&#xD;
      dosing guidelines, patients with pre-operation glucose level &gt; 200 mg/dL and &lt; 300 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following patients were excluded: Insulin sensitive patents (Age &gt;70 years, Glomerular&#xD;
      Filtration Rate (GFR) &lt;45 ml/min, No history of Diabetes, Insulin resistance patients (Body&#xD;
      Mass Index &gt; 35 kg/m2, total daily insulin dose &gt;80 units, Steroids &gt; 20 mg prednisone daily,&#xD;
      patients who at high risk of complications and or (those whom their operation was differed to&#xD;
      be supervised by a specialized team). Patients who were unable to give written informed&#xD;
      consent, who had ≥4 emergency admissions during the six months prior to the index admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention Both patients in the infusion or bolus group received their dose of insulin,&#xD;
      fast-acting human insulin (Actrapid®) was used. The protocol of the insulin regimen and its&#xD;
      related details were carried out according to the standard recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting Patients were recruited at Prince Hamza Hospital, Amman, Jordan. A tertiary care&#xD;
      center specialized unit in cardiac surgery for diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic patients who had booked cardiac surgery and met the criteria were invited to the&#xD;
      study. Patients who accepted participation and signed the consent were recruited by&#xD;
      well-trained research assistance, who was trained on an ethical standard and patient-centered&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcomes In the present study, the primary outcome was the&#xD;
      intraoperative level of glucose. It was monitored six times as follows: preoperative&#xD;
      induction measure, then glucose post heparin, and after that for 2 hours, glucose levels were&#xD;
      monitored every 30 minutes. Insulin quantities were recorded as well to be used in secondary&#xD;
      outcomes analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size To detect a difference of at least 25mg/dL between infusion and bolus groups (the&#xD;
      standard deviation of the two groups is expected to be 35 mg/dL, i.e., the variance is 1225&#xD;
      mg/dL), the study will need to recruit and record full data for at least 31 patients in each&#xD;
      group. Providing that significant level of confidence 95% and the power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = (Zα/2+Zβ)2 *2*σ2 / d2. where Zα/2 is the critical value of the Normal distribution at α/2&#xD;
      (for a confidence level of 95%, α is 0.05, and the critical value is 1.96), Zβ is the&#xD;
      critical value of the Normal distribution at β (for a power of 80%, β is 0.2, and the&#xD;
      critical value is 0.84), σ2 is the population variance, and d is the difference needed to be&#xD;
      detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods Standard independent-samples t-test or separate variances t-test (Welch&#xD;
      t-test) was used to compare the results between the two arms of the study. General Linear&#xD;
      Model, one-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to determine whether there was a&#xD;
      statistically significant difference within groups. Cost analysis and cost-effectiveness were&#xD;
      used for the pharmacoeconomic analysis. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was&#xD;
      calculated as the cost of insulin in the Infusion protocol minus the cost of insulin in the&#xD;
      bolus protocol divided by drop-in glucose level by infusion - drop in glucose level by&#xD;
      bolus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization, allocation, and blinding During patient enrolment, concealed allocation to&#xD;
      either infusion group or bolus group was guaranteed through the use of a closed envelope&#xD;
      system prepared by an independent investigator. Block randomization with random block sizes,&#xD;
      ensured allocation balance, and avoided selection bias by preventing allocation prediction.&#xD;
      Researchers and physicians were blind to the block size sequence and randomization. Envelopes&#xD;
      were unopened until completion of patient registration. Hospital staff who monitor glucose&#xD;
      and those who administered insulin were blinded to the primary and secondary outcomes'&#xD;
      measure.&#xD;
