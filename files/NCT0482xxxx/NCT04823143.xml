  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A natural history study to understand the expected progression of disease in patients with&#xD;
      confirmed mutations in the VCP gene over 1 year.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, prospective natural history study to evaluate the utility of strength,&#xD;
      functional, and patient reported outcomes in quantifying disease progression over 1 year in&#xD;
      patients with mutations in the VCP gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will complete a remote and onsite visits at baseline, a remote visit at 6 months,&#xD;
      and then a final remote and onsite visit at 12 months. All strength, functional, and patient&#xD;
      reported measures will be completed at each visit to assess reliability, consistency of&#xD;
      results across testing environments, and sensitivity to change over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, patients may opt in to provide blood, serum, and urine samples for biobanking.&#xD;
