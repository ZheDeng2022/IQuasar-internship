      This prospective, unblinded, pilot randomized cross-over trial of 2 modes of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation will compare measures of pulmonary mechanics, respiratory gas exchange, and&#xD;
      patient comfort between conventional flow triggered mechanical ventilation and neurally&#xD;
      adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) among 20 prematurely born infants and young children&#xD;
      receiving invasive respiratory support for severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most research to date in neonatal lung disease has focused on bronchopulmonary dysplasia&#xD;
      (BPD) prevention. As a result, insufficient investigation has been performed to define&#xD;
      optimal respiratory management strategies for infants and young children with established&#xD;
      BPD. Thus, there is no robust evidence base to guide ventilator management to promote lung&#xD;
      disease recovery and support neurodevelopment in this population. Neurally adjusted&#xD;
      ventilatory assist (NAVA) is an alternative to conventional flow triggered ventilation that&#xD;
      has shown promise for improving respiratory gas exchange, patient-ventilator interaction, and&#xD;
      work of breathing in preterm neonates. The safety and efficacy of NAVA in infants and young&#xD;
      children with established, severe BPD is uncertain. This prospective, unblinded, pilot&#xD;
      randomized cross-over trial of 2 modes of mechanical ventilation will compare measures of&#xD;
      pulmonary mechanics, respiratory gas exchange, and patient comfort between conventional flow&#xD;
      triggered mechanical ventilation and NAVA among 20 prematurely born infants and young&#xD;
      children receiving invasive respiratory support for severe BPD.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxygen saturation (SpO2) index</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 days per study arm</time_frame>
    <description>Oxygen saturation index will be measured by assessing if invasive mechanical ventilation with NAVA compared to CMV improves respiratory gas exchange in patients receiving invasive respiratory support for BPD. This will be calculated as the median, time-weighted daily oxygen saturation (SpO2) index ([mean airway pressure x Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)]/SpO2).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sedation Medications</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 days per study arm</time_frame>
    <description>The need for sedation medication will be assessed by comparing the needs for sedation by the total daily dose milligram/kilogram (mg/kg) of sedation medications on invasive mechanical ventilation with NAVA compared to CMV.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 days per study arm</time_frame>
    <description>Patient stress will be assessed by collecting salivary swabs three times per day to measure cortisol levels. The daily average will be assessed and compared as a marker for patient stress on invasive mechanical ventilation with NAVA compared to CMV.</description>
