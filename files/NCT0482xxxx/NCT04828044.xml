  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to pathologically evaluate the amount of destruction of&#xD;
      cancer cells by Microwave Ablation (MWA) in primary breast tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive surgical alternatives are becoming more attractive for the treatment of&#xD;
      malignancy due to improvements in technology, reduced costs and reduced morbidity. The main&#xD;
      objective of this protocol is to determine the extent of ablation based on time and power&#xD;
      parameters of the MedWaves in breast cancers. This would be accomplished in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with breast cancer who are already scheduled for breast cancer surgery. Prior to&#xD;
      the surgical removal of the cancer, the microwave antenna would be inserted into the tumor&#xD;
      under ultrasound guidance (either percutaneously or open). The tumor would be ablated, and&#xD;
      then surgically resected in a standard, curative fashion.&#xD;

    <description>An 11-gauge microwave probe from MedWaves, Inc., will be placed in the tumor. An ablation lesion will then be generated at the appropriate power (10-35 watts) to maintain up to 130C degrees at the MW applicator tip thermocouple for 10 minutes duration. Palpation and/or ultrasound may be used to place the MWA needle and monitor the progress of the microwave ablation.</description>
