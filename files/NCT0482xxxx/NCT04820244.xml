  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mutations in USH2A give rise to two phenotypes: Usher syndrome type 2a (USH2A) and&#xD;
      nonsyndromic RP (USH2A associated nsRP). Usher syndrome is the most common form of congenital&#xD;
      deafblindness. Patients with Usher syndrome are hearing impaired or profoundly deaf from&#xD;
      birth and this can be rehabilitated with hearing aids or a cochlear implant. Furthermore,&#xD;
      these patients develop retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a slowly progressive type of retinal&#xD;
      degeneration that usually starts in the first or second decade of life. In both USH2A and&#xD;
      nsRP patients the disease leads to severe visual impairment and eventually blindness around&#xD;
      the 50th-70th year of life. There are no treatment options for the retinal degeneration. We&#xD;
      do not know if they also suffer from balance complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, genetic therapy for Usher syndrome type 2 and USH2A associated nsRP is in&#xD;
      development. But to measure the effect of a (genetic) therapy, it is crucial to know the&#xD;
      detailed natural course of the visual and hearing deterioration over time. Several genetic&#xD;
      therapy studies for other disorders are currently delayed, because the natural history of the&#xD;
      disease has not been studied in detail previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to map the natural course of the visual and hearing deterioration in&#xD;
      Usher Syndrome 2 and USH2A associated nsRP for upcoming genetic therapy studies. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are: 1) To determine the necessary type of (combined) examinations, the sample&#xD;
      size and length of studies (in years) essential to evaluate future genetic therapy in Usher&#xD;
      syndrome. 2) To improve counselling of patients with Usher syndrome type 2 and USH2A&#xD;
      associated nsRP with detailed information on the prognosis. 3) To identify additional&#xD;
      etiological factors that explain variability in hearing impairment by adding questionnaires&#xD;
      and psychophysical audiometric tests; and to assess the vestibular phenotype in Usher&#xD;
      syndrome type 2 and USH2A associated nsRP patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a longitudinal, prospective natural history study. The study population consists of&#xD;
      healthy human volunteers, 16 - 55 yr old with a confirmed genetic diagnosis of Usher Syndrome&#xD;
      type 2 or and USH2A associated nsRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study endpoint is the natural course of the visual and hearing deterioration in&#xD;
      Usher Syndrome type 2 and USH2A associated nsRP, over a time span of 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no risks associated with participation.&#xD;

        The Dutch Usher syndrome population consists of an estimated 850 patients. Additionally we&#xD;
        would like to include patients with USH2A associated nsRP. Subjects will be recruited from&#xD;
        this population. In the past years it has been clear that patients are highly motivated to&#xD;
        participate in research for their disease. We aim to include 50 subjects and given our past&#xD;
        experiences, we consider this a feasible number of participants. The study population&#xD;
        consists of both males and females between 16 and 55 years of age with a confirmed genetic&#xD;
        diagnosis of USH2A associated RP either syndromic or nonsyndromic.&#xD;
