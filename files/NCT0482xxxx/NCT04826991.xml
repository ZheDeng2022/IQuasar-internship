  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40 million people in the US are served by private, and frequently untreated,&#xD;
      wells. Our best estimate is that 1.3 million cases of gastrointestinal illnesses (GI) per&#xD;
      year are attributed to consuming water from untreated private wells in the US, but in&#xD;
      reality, there are no robust epidemiological data that can be used to estimate cases of GI&#xD;
      attributable to these sources. We propose the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to&#xD;
      estimate the burden of GI associated with private well water. We will test if household&#xD;
      treatment of private well water by ultraviolet light (UV) vs. sham (inactive UV device)&#xD;
      decreases the incidence of GI in children under 5. We will also examine the presence of&#xD;
      viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens in stool and well water from participants. These&#xD;
      data will fill a knowledge gap on sporadic GI associated with federally-unregulated private&#xD;
      water supplies in the US.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will conduct a triple-blinded randomized controlled trial of a whole-home UV&#xD;
      water treatment device in southeastern Pennsylvania. Participating families will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive an active UV device or a sham (inactive) UV device. Following the&#xD;
      installation of the device, participants will be followed for one year. During that year,&#xD;
      participants will respond to weekly text messages to report the presence of symptoms&#xD;
      associated with gastrointestinal and respiratory illness in their children. Upon reporting&#xD;
      symptoms, participants will complete an illness questionnaire on details regarding the&#xD;
      illness and other potential exposure events. A subset of participants will submit groundwater&#xD;
      samples as well as stool and saliva samples from their children. Water and stool samples will&#xD;
      be analyzed for common waterborne pathogens. Saliva samples will be analyzed for&#xD;
      immunoconversions to common waterborne pathogens (exploratory aim).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the guidance of an interdisciplinary advisory committee we will execute the following&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1- Quantify the incidence rate of endemic childhood GI associated with consuming&#xD;
      untreated private well water and compare that to the incidence rate of consuming well water&#xD;
      treated by UV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1a- Construct a Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) using water quality data we&#xD;
      collect to estimate the risk of childhood GI associated with consuming untreated private well&#xD;
      water and compare the incidence from the risk model to the incidence we calculate in Aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2- Identify, quantify and compare viral, bacterial and protozoan pathogens in stool of&#xD;
      children consuming UV treated or untreated (sham) private well water (including both&#xD;
      asymptomatic and symptomatic cases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3- Explore the presence of pathogens in untreated well water and stool samples of&#xD;
      children consuming untreated private well water (sham group only).&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will collect data on the presence of gastrointestinal illness symptoms through weekly text messages. Households that report symptoms through text messages will be directed to an online illness questionnaire to characterize the symptoms (type, incidence, severity, duration, etc.), as well as relevant exposure information such as recent travel, exposure to ill persons, etc. Incident gastrointestinal illness (GI) is defined by the reporting of a minimum of three episodes of diarrhea or vomiting in a 24 hour period. Each illness will be considered distinct when separated by ≥ 6 symptom-free days.</description>

    <measure>Acute respiratory infection</measure>

    <description>The investigators will collect data on the presence of acute respiratory infection symptoms through weekly text messages. Households that report symptoms through text messages will be directed to an online illness questionnaire to characterize the symptoms (type, incidence, severity, duration, etc.) as well as relevant exposure information such as recent travel, exposure to ill persons, etc. Acute respiratory infection is defined by the reporting of nasal congestion/discharge, sore throat or mouth sores, or cough lasting at least one day, in the absence of another explanation, such as isolated cough without nasal symptoms in known reactive airways disease. Each illness will be considered distinct when separated by ≥ 6 symptom-free days.</description>
