  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy is an innovative modality for the stimulation of&#xD;
      neural activity in order to improve brain function and is currently under investigation as a&#xD;
      treatment for several diverse neurological disorders. Our emphasis on this study is to review&#xD;
      the use of PBM as a treatment modality for concussions and the use of ImPACT® (Immediate&#xD;
      Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing) test to assess improvement in cognition and&#xD;
      symptomatology in patients with post-concussion syndrome (PCS) treated with PBM.&#xD;

      -  This will be a retrospective, single arm, unmasked, clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data scores will be collected for patients who initially underwent the Workplace&#xD;
           Post-Injury 1 test of the ImPACT® test system prior to PBM treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients were treated with photobiomodulation using the BIOFLEX® DUO+ system that&#xD;
           utilized a 180 bulb Light Emitting Diode (LED) array followed by laser probes. Both&#xD;
           delivery methods were applied to the cervical spine and the cranium, and both entailed&#xD;
           the use of red light at 660 nm wavelength and near-infrared light at 830-840 nm&#xD;
           wavelength. Treatment is provided three times per week on alternating days with weekends&#xD;
           off for 4 weeks for a total of 12 treatments utilizing Health Canada approved device&#xD;
           specific protocol guidelines for treatment of the cervical spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data scores will be collected for a second ImPACT® test using the Workplace Post-Injury&#xD;
           2 test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results of the Post-Injury 1 test and the Post-Injury 2 test will be compared.&#xD;
