  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study, prospectively, if contacts (household or close contacts) of&#xD;
      tuberculosis (TB) patients with high C-reactive protein (CRP), low hemoglobin (Hb) levels,&#xD;
      and a positive Xpert Host Response (HR) cartridge result develop active TB within 12 months.&#xD;
      They will also investigate if there is a correlation between progressing to active TB within&#xD;
      12 months and having high levels of the iron homeostasis markers (Hepcidin, Ferritin and&#xD;
      Transferrin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identified index cases who agree to participate will refer their household or close contacts&#xD;
      to also join the study. These contacts will be tested for TB and only contacts who are&#xD;
      negative will be enrolled and followed-up at 6 months and 12 months. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline and 6 months for testing. During the study period, TB testing will be&#xD;
      done on contacts who meet symptoms criteria. At 12 months, all contacts will undergo a chest&#xD;
      x-ray to assist in the diagnosis of TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PreFIT will target people aged 12 to 60 years of age and both HIV negative and positive. 1515&#xD;
      trial participants will be recruited at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, 1515 at&#xD;
      Fundaçao Manhiça in Mozambique and 1010 at Makerere University in Uganda, respectively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the estimated numbers of people infected with TB in Africa are declining since the&#xD;
      rollout of antiretroviral therapy a decade ago, TB is still the highest in the world. Early&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of TB disease are essential to reducing morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Transformative progress will never be possible with the current diagnostic tools as they rely&#xD;
      on the detection of active TB which usually happen after disease has already been spread to&#xD;
      others. Diagnostic technologies to accurately detect who will develop active TB are under&#xD;
      development. However, their performance is not well reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better TB prediction test is needed to detect TB before clinical manifestation. The PreFIT&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that volunteers with a combination of positive Xpert HR result,&#xD;
      high CRP, and/or low Hb levels will likely progress to active TB within 12 months. They also&#xD;
      hypothesize that those with TB will have early high Hepcidin, Ferritin and Transferrin&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to ask those found with TB at the local clinic if they accept to join&#xD;
      the study. The participants, if they consent will then give information about people&#xD;
      (contacts) who they stay with or meet frequently to also join the study. Contacts who have TB&#xD;
      symptoms will be asked to cough sputum to be tested for co-prevalent TB disease. If they are&#xD;
      found not to have TB disease, they will be asked to give blood: few drops from a finger prick&#xD;
      and about 50mls from the vein on the arm to be stored and used for further tests. Follow-up&#xD;
      and sampling of enrolled contacts without co-prevalent active TB will occur at six and 12&#xD;
      months (± 21 days before or after each time point, a six-week total window). Participants&#xD;
      meeting presumptive TB or sputum expectorator definitions at six (M6) or 12 months (M12) of&#xD;
      follow-up, or report with symptoms at any timepoint in-between, will undergo Xpert Ultra (or&#xD;
      Xpert MTB/RIF if Ultra unavailable) and culture testing. All positive cultures will undergo&#xD;
      whole genome sequencing (WGS) to track index case and co-prevalent or incident case&#xD;
      transmission. Chest X-ray (CXR) will be done at M12 to potentially rule-out active disease&#xD;
      missed by microbiological methods. Passive TB diagnoses (microbiological or empirical)&#xD;
      throughout the follow-up period will be captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prevent diagnostic information bias, M0 and M6 test results for Xpert HR, CRP and&#xD;
      haemoglobin will be kept concealed to the study nurse(s) and physician(s) who screen the&#xD;
      cohort participants for active TB during follow-up. Similarly, laboratory technicians who&#xD;
      test the stored samples for hepcidin, transferrin and ferritin will be blinded to whether the&#xD;
      sample is from a participant who developed active TB during follow-up, or from a cohort&#xD;
      participant who did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit 1515 trial participants each at Stellenbosch University in South&#xD;
      Africa, 1515 at Centro de Investigação em Saúde de Manhiça in Mozambique and 1010 at Makerere&#xD;
      University in Uganda. Participants will be between the ages of 12 and 60 years; pregnant&#xD;
      women, minorities, economic and education disadvantaged, both HIV negative and positive will&#xD;
      join the study. Contacts found to have co-prevalent active TB, potential pathologies on CXR,&#xD;
      abnormal Hb and CRP levels will be referred to the local clinic for investigation per&#xD;
      standard-of-care with a written summary of the relevant study results. All participant&#xD;
      information will be treated in a strictly confidential manner and will be identified only by&#xD;
      a code and not by any personal identifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PreFIT's results will contribute to the development and uptake of accurate, cost-effective,&#xD;
      scalable and field-friendly diagnostic tools, to facilitate scale-up of preventive treatment&#xD;
      in sub-Saharan Africa and beyond.&#xD;
