      This prospective, non-interventional, research registry is designed to study the comparative&#xD;
      safety and comparative effectiveness of approved Jak Inhibitors treatment for RA-PsA-SpA in a&#xD;
      cohort of patients and theirs controls cared for by rheumatologists across Latin América&#xD;
      (LA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is scarce data on the real-world safety and effectiveness of Jak in Latin America. This&#xD;
      registry will provide reliable data on the use of JAKi in LA, as will be a prospective study&#xD;
      involving carefully selected rheumatologists and centers. Soon, a good number of copies of&#xD;
      original JAKi will be available in LA, and it is important to keep track of the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of this drugs in the real world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the registry is to prospectively study the comparative safety and&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness of approved Jak Inhibitors treatment for RA-PsA-SpA in a cohort of&#xD;
      patients and theirs controls cared for by rheumatologists across Latin América (LA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry will be a cohort study where cases will be patients with RA, PsA and SpA&#xD;
      initiating any approved JAK inhibitor. To have an active control group, patients with RA, PsA&#xD;
      o SpA initiating any other disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) (biologic or not&#xD;
      biologic) will also be included in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be a Web based registry, where the investigators will include data related to the&#xD;
      cases and controls. Data collected will include, demographics, disease characteristics,&#xD;
      disease activity, past and current medications, comorbidities. At each visit adherence with&#xD;
      the medications, adverse events, changes in medications, disease activity and disability will&#xD;
      be assessed.Patients will be followed up at three months intervals, after inclusion in the&#xD;
      registry and thereafter every 6 months during the next three years. Adverse events could be&#xD;
      included at any time between visits if the investigator is notified.&#xD;
