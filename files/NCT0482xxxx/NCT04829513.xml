  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled study. 75 patients between the ages of 20-50 who were&#xD;
      diagnosed with sacroiliac joint dysfunction will be included in the study. 25 patients will&#xD;
      be given a home exercise program that strengthens the waist and hip girdle (to be shown once&#xD;
      in the hospital by a physiotherapist and the form of the exercises will be given), 25&#xD;
      patients will be given kinesiology taping with inhibition technique with the exercise&#xD;
      program, and 25 patients will be given kinesiology taping with fascia correction technique&#xD;
      with the exercise program. Patients will do the exercises once a day for 1 month. In&#xD;
      kinesiology taping with the inhibition method, an I-shaped tape of 15-20 cm in length will be&#xD;
      applied on the sacroiliac joint on both sides without stretching the ends with 50% stretching&#xD;
      in the middle. In addition, a 25-30 cm long I band will be applied over the right spina&#xD;
      iliaca posterior superior, towards the left spina iliaca posterior superior. In the facia&#xD;
      correction technique, 2 bands with no cut ends, a 10-15 cm web-shaped band divided into 4 or&#xD;
      5 parts with a width of 1-15 cm will be applied cross over the sacroiliac joint, without&#xD;
      stretching the ends with 50% stretching in the middle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gillet test (evaluation of sacroiliac joint movement with single hip flexion), Gaenslen test&#xD;
      (pain provocation with passive hip flexion), Patrick test (provocation of pain with hip&#xD;
      flexion, abduction and external rotation), standing flexion test (evaluation of sacroiliac&#xD;
      joint movement with forward flexion), sacroiliac compression and distraction test&#xD;
      (provocation of pain with anterior pelvic compression or distraction), long sitting test&#xD;
      (pain in the sacroiliac joint after sitting for more than 30 minutes), posterior shear test&#xD;
      (provocation of pain with hip flexion and adduction) will be applied to the patients. The&#xD;
      patients' resting and moving pain levels will be measured using the Visuel Analog Scale&#xD;
      (VAS). Pain duration in the last week will be questioned and noted. Global Assessment of the&#xD;
      Patient's Self within the last 1 week will be made over VAS. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)&#xD;
      will be applied to determine the level of disability. Evaluations will be made before, 15&#xD;
      days after and 1 month after treatment.&#xD;
