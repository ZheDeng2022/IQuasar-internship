      The overall aim of this multicenter RCT is to determine whether concomitant ALL&#xD;
      reconstruction in children undergoing and ACL reconstruction will longitudinally result in a&#xD;
      lower rate of graft failure than ACL reconstruction alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have reported a rising incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in&#xD;
      children and adolescents. Beck et al reported a 2.3% annual increase between 1994 and 2013.&#xD;
      In New York State, the rate of pediatric ACL reconstruction climbed from 17.6/100,000 in 1990&#xD;
      to 50.9/100,000 by 2009. Other reports echo these findings. After ACL reconstruction,&#xD;
      children are known to be at a higher risk for complications than adults. For example, while&#xD;
      the rate of postoperative graft failure in adults was 3% to 4% in large national registries,&#xD;
      as many as 12% to 19% of pediatric patients may sustain graft rupture. This can have&#xD;
      substantial medical, financial, and psychosocial implications on the patient and family.&#xD;
      Additionally, the results of revision ACL reconstruction are, on average, worse than after&#xD;
      index surgery. Exploration of treatments that may lower the rate of re-injury is paramount in&#xD;
      this population that is at highest risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the adult population, a growing number of studies have suggested that concomitant&#xD;
      reconstruction of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) with the ACL may help lower this risk. The&#xD;
      ALL was likely first characterized in 1879 by the French surgeon Segond, who commented on the&#xD;
      presence of a &quot;pearly, resistant, fibrous band&quot; in the lateral aspect of the knee. However,&#xD;
      only in 2012 was the structure given the name &quot;anterolateral ligament&quot; after it was&#xD;
      consistently identified in cadaveric specimens. Some studies suggest that the ALL is damaged&#xD;
      during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, implying that it may supplement the ACL in&#xD;
      providing rotational and translational stability. Biomechanical studies have confirmed that&#xD;
      it likely plays a role in rotational stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of ALL reconstruction techniques have been developed with the hope of lowering the&#xD;
      rate of re-injury after ACL reconstruction. Early literature in the adult population suggests&#xD;
      that this may indeed be the case. Early case series suggested that concomitant ALL&#xD;
      reconstruction resulted in high rates of return to sport and a low ACL graft failure rate&#xD;
      (2.6%). Comparative retrospective studies in adults suggest better patient reported outcome&#xD;
      scores, meniscal repair healing, and rates of return to sports when the ALL is reconstructed&#xD;
      with the ACL compared to isolated ACL reconstruction. Finally, a prospective cohort study of&#xD;
      adults reported that hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction with concomitant ALL&#xD;
      reconstruction resulted in 3.1 times lower odds of graft failure than isolated hamstring ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction and 2.5 times lower odds of failure than isolated patellar tendon ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses to be tested in this study have never been evaluated in the pediatric&#xD;
      population. Furthermore, the proposed investigation is a randomized controlled trial, which&#xD;
      will allow it to provide novel results with high-level evidence. The results of such a study&#xD;
      have the potential to change practice in a meaningful, tangible way and affect the outcomes&#xD;
      of thousands of children annually. In addition to the medical and functional impact, there&#xD;
      could also be important financial and psychosocial implications.&#xD;
