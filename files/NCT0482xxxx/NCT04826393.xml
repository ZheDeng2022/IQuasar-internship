    <textblock>
      This study is looking at the safety and efficacy of the drug combination of ASP8374 with&#xD;
      cemiplimab in people with recurrent malignant glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two parts, the first portion of the study will be to establish&#xD;
      the highest dose of ASP8374 that can be given safely with cemiplimab and will be used as the&#xD;
      recommended dose of ASP8374 in combination with cemiplimab for the second portion of the&#xD;
      study. The second portion of the study will be to compare the effect of having ASP8374 in&#xD;
      combination with cemiplimab prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ASP8374&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cemiplimab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  89Zr-Df-IAB22M2C (Administered as part of scan procedure)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase Ib trial of ASP8374 plus cemiplimab&#xD;
      among recurrent malignant glioma participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, eligible participants will enroll to Cohort 1 which will determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ASP8374 when combined with&#xD;
      cemiplimab among recurrent malignant glioma participants using a 3+3 design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon determination of the MTD/RP2D of ASP8374 plus cemiplimab in Cohort 1, a dose expansion&#xD;
      will be performed in which eligible participants who are candidates for surgical resection&#xD;
      will enroll to Cohort 2 and will be randomized into one of four treatment groups (2A-2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2A: IV ASP8374 within 14± 5 days prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2B: IV Cemiplimab within 14± 5 days prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2C: IV ASP8374 plus cemiplimab within 14± 5 days prior to surgery at the MTD/RP2D&#xD;
      established in Cohort 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2D: No immune checkpoint therapy prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ASP8374 as a treatment for any&#xD;
      disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved cemiplimab for&#xD;
      recurrent malignant glioma but it has been approved for other uses. The U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) has not approved 89Zr-Df- IAB22M2C as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility, then study treatment&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow up visits. Participants will receive study treatment for up&#xD;
      to two years and will be followed for their tumor's response, whether or not their disease&#xD;
      gets worse, and for side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 65 people will take part in this research study. At least 6 in&#xD;
      cohort 1 and 55 in cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical company Astellas is supporting this research study by providing study funding&#xD;
      and study drug, ASP8374, Regeneron is supporting this research by providing study drug&#xD;
      cemiplimab, and ImaginAb is supporting this research by providing study drug&#xD;

             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to registration. If the urine test is positive or&#xD;
             cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Women are&#xD;
             considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12&#xD;
             months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g.,&#xD;
             age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous&#xD;
             amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL or have had&#xD;

             of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during study treatment&#xD;
             and for 120 days after study discontinuation. Highly effective contraception is&#xD;
             defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  i. True Abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
                  of the participant. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods&#xD;
                  of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ii. Sterilization: Surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy)&#xD;
                  or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of oophorectomy alone, only&#xD;
                  when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone&#xD;
                  level assessment (as described in item 12 above).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  iii. Male Partner Sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy&#xD;
                  documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female participants&#xD;
                  on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                  participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of a combination of any two of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal&#xD;
                       suppository&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Appropriate hormonal contraceptives (including any registered and marketed&#xD;
                       contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational agent&#xD;
                       - including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male participants should agree to use adequate method of contraception starting with&#xD;
             the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of therapy.&#xD;

          -  Has confirmed history or any evidence of active non-infectious pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the participant's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. Examples&#xD;
             include but are not limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive within the projected duration of&#xD;
             the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             trial treatment. It is unknown whether ASP8374 and/or cemiplimab is excreted in human&#xD;
             milk or may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero. Since many drugs are excreted in&#xD;
             human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing&#xD;
             infant or fetus, these participants are not eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-TIGIT, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-cytotoxic&#xD;
             T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including ipilimumab), or any&#xD;
             other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint&#xD;
             pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known hypersensitivity to any of the study therapy products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has been previously treated with the PI3K inhibitor idelalisib.&#xD;
