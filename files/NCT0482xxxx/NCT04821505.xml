  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are major health disparities in Blacks associated with high blood pressure (BP) and&#xD;
      psychosocial stress. We evaluated the effects of lifestyle modification with meditation in&#xD;
      Black adults with high normal and normal blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (n=304) were randomized to either the Transcendental Meditation technique or&#xD;
      Health Education control in addition to usual care for up to 36 months for BP and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

      Background: Blacks suffer from disparities in hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and&#xD;
      currently, coronavirus-19. These conditions are associated with social determinants of health&#xD;
      and psychosocial stress. While previous trials demonstrated stress reduction lowering blood&#xD;
      pressure in grade I range in Blacks, there is a paucity of clinical trial data in Blacks with&#xD;
      high normal and normal BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of stress&#xD;
      reduction with the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique in Black adults with high normal&#xD;
      BP and normal BP using International Society of Hypertension (ISH) definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A total of 304 Black adults with high normal (130-139/85-89 mm Hg) and normal BP&#xD;
      (120-129/80-84 mm Hg) were randomized to either TM or health education (HE) arms. BP was&#xD;
      recorded at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 30, and 36 months after baseline. Linear mixed model analysis&#xD;
      was conducted to compare the BP change between TM and HE participants in the high-normal BP&#xD;
      and normal-BP groups. Survival analysis for hypertensive events was conducted.&#xD;
