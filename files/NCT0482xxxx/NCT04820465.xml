    <textblock>
      A cross-sectional study with 829 older Mexican adults were recruited from July to September&#xD;
      2015, from four localities in the southern region of México. Older adults were interviewed at&#xD;
      their homes and a fasting blood sample was obtained for analysis of micronutrient status&#xD;
      (iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, vitamin A deficiency and&#xD;
      biomarkers of inflammation). The aim of the study was to identify the main causes of anemia&#xD;
      in older adults with higher rates of anemia according to the recent data of the Mexican&#xD;
      National Health and Nutrition Survey.&#xD;

      A survey with cross-sectional design was applied in 829 older Mexican adults, recruited&#xD;
      during the period July to September 2015, from four localities in the southern region of&#xD;
      México: including Champotón, Campeche, Mérida, and Valladolid. Older adults were interviewed&#xD;
      at their homes to collect nutrition, health, cognitive and dietary information.&#xD;
      Anthropometric measures and functionallity tests were also collected. A finger prick&#xD;
      capillary blood sample was collected to measure hemoblobin in situ using HemoCue. Anemia was&#xD;
      defined according to WHO criteria. A fasting venous blood sample was collected in 803 older&#xD;
      adults. Serum was separated and frozen at -20°C to measure ferritin, retinol, vitamin B12,&#xD;
      folate, iron, soluble transferrin receptor, C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, alpha&#xD;
      glycoprotein 1, hepcidin, erythropoietin in the laboratory of nutrition of the National&#xD;
      Institute of Public Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol was approved by Research, Biosecurity and Ethics Committees of the&#xD;
      National Institute of Public Health. Participants received a detailed explanation of the&#xD;
      study procedures and signed an informed consent form prior to data collection.&#xD;
