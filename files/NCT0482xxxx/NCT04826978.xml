      Data on parent-infant physical closeness and infants' auditory environment will be collected&#xD;
      among preterm infants when they are at gestational age of 32 to 34 weeks. The follow-up&#xD;
      includes eye-tracker test at 7 months of corrected age for face preferences of the infants&#xD;
      and simultaneously parents' eye movements and pupil diameter responses. During the second&#xD;
      year, the follow up includes MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories (lexical&#xD;
      development) at 12 and 24 months of age; language development test (Reynell Developmental&#xD;
      Language Scales III) and developmental test (Bayley Scales for Infant development Edition&#xD;
      III) at 24 months of corrected age.&#xD;

      Study population: 63 infants from Turku University Hospital and 53 infants from Tallinn&#xD;
      Children's Hospital were recruited in 1/2017-12/2020. Inclusion criteria: Born before 32+0&#xD;
      week of gestation without life-threatening diseases or congenital anomalies or syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infant auditory environment was recorded for 16 hours at 32+0 to 33+6 weeks of postmenstrual&#xD;
      age. In addition, Parental Closeness Diary was recorded for 14 days to measure the parents'&#xD;
      presence and parent-infant closeness to get an estimate of language environment of the child&#xD;
      during a 14-day period at around 32-34 weeks of gestation. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression&#xD;
      Scale was collected during the recording day from both parents to identify parents' risk for&#xD;
      perinatal depression. During the day of recording, the research nurse reported the time when&#xD;
      a nurse was in the patient room. The auditory environment will be analyzed quantitatively and&#xD;
      qualitatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Infant face preference for familiar and unfamiliar faces. At the corrected age of 7&#xD;
      months (± 7 days), an eye-tracking based test battery will be used to assess infants'&#xD;
      attention to familiar and unfamiliar faces. During the eye-tracking testing, the infants will&#xD;
      sit on their parents' lap at ~60 cm distance from a stimulus monitor. Infants' eye movements&#xD;
      will be measured by using a screen-based eye-tracker and a video camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test will consist of a task assessing infants' attention to faces expressing neutral,&#xD;
      happy and fearful emotion, posed by the infant's own parents and an unfamiliar (female)&#xD;
      adult. In this task, the first stimulus (a non-face pattern or a face) is presented at the&#xD;
      participant's point of fixation in the center of the computer display, and the second&#xD;
      stimulus (a high-contrast distractor) 1 second later ~13-15° to the left or right of the&#xD;
      center. Gaze disengagement times from the central to the lateral stimulus will be extracted&#xD;
      from the eye tracking data (or from video data, if valid eye tracking data are missing).&#xD;
      Disengagement times from trials conforming to the following a priori inclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be used in the analyses: i) a sufficient length of fixation on the central stimulus (i.e.,70&#xD;
      % of the time) during the analysis period, which start at the onset of the trial and ends at&#xD;
      the onset of gaze disengagement or at maximum time out value (1000 ms post-target), ii)&#xD;
      sufficient number of valid samples in the gaze data (i.e., no gaps longer than 200 ms), and,&#xD;
      iii) valid information about the eye movement from the central to the lateral stimulus (i.e.,&#xD;
      the eye movement did not occur during a period of missing gaze data) will be retained for&#xD;
      analysis. The duration of attention dwell time on the first stimulus (face or non-face&#xD;
      pattern) will be determined for the period starting 150 ms from the onset of the lateral&#xD;
      stimulus and ending 1000 ms after the lateral stimulus onset. The duration will then be&#xD;
      converted to a normalized dwell time index score by using the formula described in Leppänen&#xD;
      et al. (2015). The shortest acceptable saccadic eye movement latency (150 ms) results in a&#xD;
      dwell time score of 0, and the longest possible latency (or a lack of saccade, which is equal&#xD;
      to the last measured time point of the first stimulus at 1000 ms) in a dwell time index score&#xD;
      of 1. The dwell time indices will be calculated separately for each trial and averaged for&#xD;
      non-face patterns (i.e., low-salience stimulus), for faces by familiarity (across emotion&#xD;
      categories), and for faces by emotion category (across familiarity and separately by&#xD;
      familiarity). The primary outcome of the analysis will be the mean dwell times for familiar&#xD;
      and unfamiliar faces, adjusted for the mean dwell time for respective non-face patterns. All&#xD;
      infants with &gt;2 valid trials per condition will be retained in the final statistical&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents' attention and physiological responses to infant faces. Parents attentional and&#xD;
      physiological (i.e., pupil dilation) to non-face patterns and faces of their own infant(s)&#xD;
      and unknown infants will be assessed at infant age 7 months. Parents will be asked to provide&#xD;
      pictures of their own infant(s) prior to each laboratory visit. Pictures displaying&#xD;
      positive/content and distressed emotions will be asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Picture from an existing dataset will be used as unknown infant pictures. Non-faced patterns&#xD;
      will be created by phase-scrambling the pictures so that they retain the low-level&#xD;
      characteristics of the original faces, but are not identifiable as faces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess attention, the adults will be asked to follow (by looking) a geometric shape (a&#xD;
      checkerboard pattern, measuring 2x2 degrees) as it shifts location from the center of the&#xD;
      screen (500-msec) to the left or right side of the screen (~13 degrees from the center).&#xD;
      After the participant has shifted gaze from the center to the side (as determined by the eye&#xD;
      tracker), the pattern will be replaced by a picture of a non-face pattern or a face for&#xD;
      300-msec. The side of the non-face pattern and face (A= non-face left, face right or B= face&#xD;
      left, non-face right) will be alternated between blocks of 20 trials following an ABBA-BAAB&#xD;
      design. Using this approach, estimates of saccadic reaction times (SRTs) to the location of&#xD;
      own infant face(s) vs. non-faces and two unknown infant faces vs non-face patterns. Because&#xD;
      saccadic reaction times will always be initiated by the shifting location of the shape (a&#xD;
      checkerboard pattern), any difference in mean SRT must reflect an endogenous or high-level&#xD;
      bias towards one of the stimuli (e.g. own infant face), instead of exogenous stimulus&#xD;
      properties. To extract attention indicators from the adult data, the latency of gaze shifts&#xD;
      between the center of the screen and lateral stimulus positions (following shifts in stimulus&#xD;
      position) will be analyzed by using the same procedures as those used for analyzing infant&#xD;
      attentional data. To assess parents' sympathetic activation to infant cues, we will follow&#xD;
      the procedures of our previous study (Yrttiaho et al., 2017). The adult will see a series of&#xD;
      trials consisting of a short 1000-ms pre-stimulus interval with the non-face pattern and a&#xD;
      4000-ms face stimulus (own or unknown infant). Pupil size will be measured from both eyes&#xD;
      during the pre-stimulus interval (with random visual pattern that has the same low-level&#xD;
      stimulus characteristics as paired face stimulus) and the presentation of the face stimuli.&#xD;
      By matching the low-level characteristics of the two consecutive stimuli, the present&#xD;
      approach minimizes the possibility that the recorded pupil dilation responses are driven by&#xD;
      changes in stimulus luminance. Latencies for each stimulus category will be extracted and&#xD;
      used as a primary dependent variable in subsequent statistical analyses. Physiological data&#xD;
      from adults (pupil diameter) will be preprocessed using the steps described in our previous&#xD;
      study (Yrttiaho et al., 2017), and pupil diameter in two time windows (based on prior&#xD;
      studies, these windows will be 300-1200 and 3000-4000 ms after face onset, respectively) will&#xD;
      be averaged to extract of pupil constriction and dilation, respectively. The dilation phase&#xD;
      will be used as the primary index of sympathetic arousal to infant distress cues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about the child's developing abilities of early language (receptive and&#xD;
      expressive language development) will be assessed by MacArthur-Bates Communicative&#xD;
      Development Inventory (MCDI) at 12 and 24 months of corrected age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At two years of corrected age the language skills of the children were measured using the&#xD;
      Reynell Development Language Scales III and MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories&#xD;
      (the Words and Sentences form). In addition, children's cognitive development was measured&#xD;
      using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development III.&#xD;
