  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether programs that include both a patient and their&#xD;
      spouse or a patient and family caregiver (known as a dyad) are helpful for families in which&#xD;
      one member of the dyad has cancer and mild memory difficulties and/or concerns. Participant&#xD;
      and their spouse or participant and their family caregiver will have six, 60-minute&#xD;
      video-conference sessions which will be scheduled at their convenience. The investigator will&#xD;
      loan participants a tablet computer (iPad) to use for videoconferencing and train the&#xD;
      participant in its use. Participant and their spouse or participant and their family&#xD;
      caregiver will complete three assessments - one before starting the sessions, one after the&#xD;
      sixth session, and one after 1 month. Each assessment will include surveys, which the&#xD;
      participant will complete separately from their spouse or family caregiver. For most people,&#xD;
      it will take upwards of 2 - 4 months to complete this study.&#xD;
