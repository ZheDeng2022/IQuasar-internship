    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label Phase II trial of non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients receiving initial&#xD;
      treatment with the immunomodulatory agent, pembrolizumab, plus low-dose (4 Gy x 5)&#xD;
      involved-site radiotherapy. Eligible patients will have r/r disease with at least 2 sites of&#xD;
      measurable disease (≥1.0 cm), and must be eligible for treatment with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
      Biosamples (blood and, where available, tumor) will be collected as outlined below.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab will be continued after RT until disease progression, drug intolerance, or at&#xD;
      the discretion of the treating medical oncologist.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Male/female participants who are at least 18 years of age on the day of signing informed&#xD;

             3), not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) as defined in Appendix 3 OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance in Appendix 3 during the&#xD;
                  treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
                  treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written&#xD;
             informed consent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. Lesions situated in a previously&#xD;
             irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such&#xD;
             lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have provided archival tumor tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy&#xD;
             of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE)&#xD;
             tissue blocks are preferred to slides. Newly obtained biopsies are preferred to&#xD;
             archived tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.&#xD;

                  to the most recent therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Refractory disease is defined as failure to achieve CR or PR.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 2 lines of prior therapy are required, but, at physician and patient&#xD;
                  discretion with shared decision making, not all FDA-approved treatments need be&#xD;
                  exhausted prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For DLBCL and PMBCL:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have relapsed after auto-SCT or have failed to achieve a CR or PR within 60 days&#xD;
                  of auto-SCT. Patients may have received intervening therapy after auto-SCT for&#xD;
                  relapsed or refractory disease, in which case they must have relapsed after or be&#xD;
                  refractory to their last treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For patients who are ineligible for auto-SCT, have received at least ≥ 2 lines of&#xD;
                  prior therapy and have failed to respond to or relapsed after their last line of&#xD;
                  treatment. For patients who received consolidative local radiotherapy after&#xD;
                  systemic therapy, local radiotherapy will not be considered as a separate line of&#xD;
                  treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy is allowed but not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the patient has received CART therapy, complete resolution of any active&#xD;
                  cytokine release syndrome is required 13. ≥2 sites of measurable disease (≥1.0&#xD;
                  cm), at least one outside of intended RT fields.&#xD;
