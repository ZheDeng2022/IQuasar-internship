  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Infertility is a serious reproductive health issue and affects 48.5 million&#xD;
      couples worldwide. Women undergoing fertility treatment often experienced psychological&#xD;
      distress but also social stigma that is close linked to later pregnancy outcome. Despite the&#xD;
      advancement in assisted reproductive technology, effective interventions for reducing stress,&#xD;
      anxiety, and depressive symptoms for infertility women remain lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objective of this proposal is to evaluate the efficacy of web-based mind-body&#xD;
      intervention combining HRV biofeedback on the infertility women's anxiety symptoms, levels of&#xD;
      depression, HRV function, mindful awareness, infertility self-efficacy, and pregnancy rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial on the web-based mind-body&#xD;
      intervention combining heart rate variability biofeedback. Eligible women will be recruited&#xD;
      and randomized into three groups. Intention-to-treat analysis and mixed regression modeling&#xD;
      will be used to estimate the effectiveness of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipatory results: Effective strategies will be determined for infertility women.&#xD;

      A designed data entry system for the current study will be developed to ensure an error-proof&#xD;
      process. It is important to inspect data for outliers, wild code, and consistency to maintain&#xD;
      the data quality in the pre-analysis data phase. We will assess the amount and pattern of&#xD;
      missing values by using descriptive statistics, such as frequency and percentage. The pattern&#xD;
      of missing data will be identified and decide whether the missing completely at random or&#xD;
      not. The appropriate corresponding method will be adopted for the subsequent statistical&#xD;
      analyses. For example, the mean imputation is considered when the percentage of items missing&#xD;
      at a given questionnaire is less than 10 %. The mean imputation will be used to replaces a&#xD;
      missing value with the item mean when applicable. The comparison between complete case&#xD;
      analysis and imputation data will be performed to assess the reliability and validity of the&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
