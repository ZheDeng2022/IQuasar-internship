      A randomised control trial will made to determine the effects of nursing care based on&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Transition to motherhood, being one of the most important life incidents in the lives of&#xD;
      women embodies the transition of role from a known situation to an unknown one. Being a&#xD;
      special period in which women hold the role of motherhood together with the birth of the&#xD;
      child; try to adapt the new role and reform relationship with the family members at the same&#xD;
      time, transition to motherhood is a progressive period experienced by many women. Transition&#xD;
      of woman to motherhood in a healthy manner will positively affect developing trust, achieving&#xD;
      healthy communication with the infant, adapting to new lifestyle and fulfilling her&#xD;
      responsibilities. Thus, transition to motherhood is quite significant both for mother and&#xD;
      other family members and the new-born infant and needs to be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is aimed in this research that effects of nursing care based on Meleis's Theory of&#xD;
      Transition on Adaptation of Women to Motherhood and their Perception of New-born Infant shall&#xD;
      be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will tested the hypotheses that there is no difference between the intervention and&#xD;
      control groups of pregnant women after the intervention in terms of adaptation to pregnancy,&#xD;
      adaptation to the postpartum period and newborn perception.&#xD;

    <description>Adaptasion with pregnancy period will be evaluated with &quot;Prenatal Self Evaluation Questionnaire&quot;.&#xD;
The scale was developed (1979) in order to evaluate the adaptation of women in the prenatal period to motherhood. The scale has 7 sub-dimensions. For the whole scale, a minimum of 79 and a maximum of 316 points can be obtained. Low scores show that adjustment to pregnancy is high.</description>

    <description>The &quot;Prenatal Self Evaluation Questionnaire&quot; will be used to compare the fits to pregnancy between 28th and 34th weeks of gestation.&#xD;
The scale was developed (1979) in order to evaluate the adaptation of women in the prenatal period to motherhood. The scale has 7 sub-dimensions. For the whole scale, a minimum of 79 and a maximum of 316 points can be obtained. Low scores show that adjustment to pregnancy is high.</description>

    <measure>Mother-Neonatal Perception after birth</measure>
    <time_frame>3rd - 5th day after the birth</time_frame>
    <description>Neonatal Perception Inventory (NPI-I) will be used to determine maternal- newborn perception.&#xD;
The scale was developed in 1971 to measure mothers' perception of their babies. It consists of two parts: the Neonatal Perception Inventory (NPI-I), applied in the first days after birth, and the NPI-II, administered one month after birth. In NPI-I and II of the scale, there are &quot;Any Baby&quot; and &quot;Your Baby&quot; forms, each containing six items (behaviors such as crying, feeding, sleeping, vomiting / drooling, pooping, eating and sleeping habits). It consists of 5-point Likert type 24 items.</description>
