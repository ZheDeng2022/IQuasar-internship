      In recent years, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has been integrated with mindfulness meditation&#xD;
      (CBT-M) following evidence for increased efficacy when modalities are combined. We will&#xD;
      assess whether online group CBT-M plus standard psychiatric care is non-inferior in efficacy&#xD;
      and more cost-effective than office-based, on-site group CBT-M (plus standard psychiatric&#xD;
      care) per outcomes at post-intervention and at 6-month follow up in adults with major&#xD;
      depressive disorder (MDD). This non-inferiority randomized controlled trial will employ both&#xD;
      assessor-blinded and self-report outcome measures and will include a full economic&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a commonly diagnosed mental health disorder that represents the most prevalent&#xD;
      cause of disability worldwide. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is the best-evidenced&#xD;
      treatment for depression, but despite demonstrated efficacy, many individuals cannot access&#xD;
      adequate psychotherapeutic treatment due to the limitations of face-to-face delivery. In&#xD;
      recent years, CBT has been integrated with mindfulness meditation (CBT-M) following strong&#xD;
      evidence for increased efficacy when the two modalities are combined. Previous RCTs have&#xD;
      demonstrated that online CBT-M is effective in depressive symptom reduction, but direct&#xD;
      comparisons to in-office CBT delivery assessing cost and treatment outcomes are required to&#xD;
      facilitate innovation and clinical policy change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To assess whether online group CBT-M plus standard psychiatric care is&#xD;
      non-inferior in efficacy and more cost-effective than office-based, on-site group CBT-M (plus&#xD;
      standard psychiatric care) per outcomes at post-intervention and at 6-month follow up in&#xD;
      adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). The study will assess whether&#xD;
      digitally recorded adherence data (i.e. online workbooks completed, Fitbit tracked step&#xD;
      count, online text-messages exchanged, phone sessions completed) predict outcome benefits in&#xD;
      the online-group participants as measured by changes in depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This single-centre, 2-arm non-inferiority randomized controlled trial will employ&#xD;
      both assessor-blinded and self-report outcome measures and will include a full economic&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research site is the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), a large&#xD;
      research-based psychiatry institution located in Toronto, Canada. Participants will be&#xD;
      identified from wait-lists for CAMH services and through contacts with other Toronto&#xD;
      outpatient clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: All participants will receive standard psychiatric care (1 pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      focused visit/month with a psychiatrist of 15-30 minute duration). Experimental participants&#xD;
      additionally receive online CBT-M while control participants receive standard care in-office&#xD;
      group CBT-M. The online group CBT-M program (in collaboration with NexJ Health, Inc.)&#xD;
      combines exposure to smartphone and computer accessed workbooks with phone-based mental&#xD;
      health counselling (16 hours in 16 weeks) that coordinates with ongoing software interactions&#xD;
      (e.g. secure text messaging, Fitbit tracked walking). Each participant is loaned a Fitbit-HR&#xD;
      Charge 3 to assess physical activity as measured by daily step count.&#xD;

    <description>The on-site, usual-care CBT group follows the structure of the Mind Over Mood workbook in reviewing CBT concepts and procedures. A series of work sheets assist participants in differentiating moods, and in differentiating moods from thoughts and situational influences, leading to modifications of thinking, behaviour, emotion and mood. Group leaders are standard leaders in the CAMH group-CBT program who have Masters-level degrees in psychology, social work and occupational therapists.</description>

    <description>The effectiveness of standard care office-based group CBT-MM at CAMH is indicated in a past study (n = 119) where depression symptoms reduced (after 16 weeks treatment) by 27% [3,18 ]. The office-based groups follow a carefully conceived structure that centers on the workbook Mind Over Mood (MOM) (Guilford Press) [41]. Key CBT concepts and procedures are conveyed via work sheets that structure personal and group exploration.</description>
