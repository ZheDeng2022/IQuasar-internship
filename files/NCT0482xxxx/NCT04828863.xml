  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is a disorder of protein metabolism that leads to&#xD;
      neurological differences. It is an exciting time where people diagnosed with MSUD are living&#xD;
      longer. The investigators want to learn about how adults with MSUD think, feel, and live. The&#xD;
      purpose of this research study is to 1) look at thinking skills, behavior skills, life&#xD;
      skills, and quality of life in adults with MSUD and 2) measure how medical and personal&#xD;
      factors impact these areas. The results of the study will be used to learn how to best help&#xD;
      adults with MSUD and how to prepare for their success. In this study, the participants will&#xD;
      answer questions on thinking, life skills, behavior skills, and quality of life. These&#xD;
      questions will be completed on the internet. The participants will have a formal testing of&#xD;
      their thinking and behavior. The participants may also have a 1-2-hour telephone conversation&#xD;
      about their life. Most of these tests will occur virtually at y home. The investigators will&#xD;
      send the participants a letter with the results of thinking and behavior tests.&#xD;
