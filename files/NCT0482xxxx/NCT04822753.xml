  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is both the single most common cause of disability and the leading cause&#xD;
      of visits when military personnel go to their primary care doctors. Military personnel that&#xD;
      deal with LBP can often be placed on limited duty profile. Not surprisingly, the direct and&#xD;
      indirect costs of low back and neck pain accounts for approximately $88 billion of health&#xD;
      care expenditure. In order to reduce the large financial and personal cost, clinical studies&#xD;
      must be designed to treat LBP. This study will provide evidence-based medicine on a new&#xD;
      regenerative medicine treatment option that may significantly affect military personnel with&#xD;
      LBP. PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) may offer alternate treatment methods that may help preserve&#xD;
      the facet joint structures, and improve pain and function without causing destructive lesions&#xD;
      or worsening degenerative joints. This healing process may favor improved participation with&#xD;
      rehabilitation therapy and ultimately improve return to duty status. This study will also&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness of point of care generated PRP, as a minimally invasive treatment&#xD;
      option for treating lumbar facet pain. Specifically, PRP effectiveness will be compared to&#xD;
      injecting placebo control when injected into facet joints.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will determine the efficacy of platelet rich plasma vs.&#xD;
      Control/Placebo. 170 healthy, physically active individuals with facet mediated lumbar low&#xD;
      back pain will be recruited to participate in the study. Part of the formal screening&#xD;
      procedures, consented participants will undergo a fluoroscopic guided diagnostic lumbar&#xD;
      medial branch block (MBB) within 60 days after consent. The results of the diagnostic MBB&#xD;
      will determine if they meet final eligibility criteria (facetogenic pathology) and should&#xD;
      continue on with the therapeutic injection. In the rare case that there is a positive MBB&#xD;
      within the past three months, then it will not be repeated. To clarify, the diagnostic MBB&#xD;
      will determine if the procedure will be beneficial to the participant by confirming they have&#xD;
      facet-mediated low back pain and that the experimental procedure may benefit them. This&#xD;
      avoids participants continuing in the study who would not benefit from the PRP injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete a standard pain diary following the lumbar MBB&#xD;
      procedure. Participants who experience a positive test result from the MBB (as indicated by a&#xD;
      reduction of â‰¥50% in pain symptoms using the 8 hour pain diary) will be eligible to proceed&#xD;
      with the study. Following the stated inclusion/exclusion criteria, participants who do not&#xD;
      experience a positive test result (indicate a reduction &lt; 50% in pain symptoms) will be&#xD;
      formally withdrawn from the study at this point and will resume normal care with their&#xD;
      referring physician to explore their best treatment option(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any female participant of child-bearing age will also be required to have a urine hCG test&#xD;
      performed prior to the diagnostic or therapeutic injection being performed. If the urine hCG&#xD;
      indicates the participant is pregnant, per stated inclusion/exclusion criteria, they will be&#xD;
      formally withdrawn from the study at this point and will resume normal care with their&#xD;
      referring provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet final eligibility criteria (positive lumbar MBB and, if applicable,&#xD;
      negative pregnancy test) will be randomized to a study arm within one week of the MBB. A&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization program prepared by the study biostatistician will be used&#xD;
      to assign participants 1:1 across both study arms (PRP vs. Control/Placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target area for either the PRP or saline injection will be the intra-articular facet&#xD;
      joint. During this time, adequate amount of peripheral blood will be drawn by a clinic nurse;&#xD;
      either 30ml if injecting single side, or 60ml will be drawn if injecting both sides. PRP&#xD;
      mixture will be prepared using a point of care centrifuge system. Participants in the PRP&#xD;
      group will receive 1 ml of PRP mixture for each facet joint. Participants in the&#xD;
      control/placebo group will receive 1 ml of normal saline for each facet joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to facilitate blinding, both groups will have at least 30ml of blood drawn on the&#xD;
      same day as the injection (PRP or saline). The blood drawn from participants in the control&#xD;
      group will be safely discarded per standard protocols. For the PRP group, a small sample will&#xD;
      be processed by point of care cell counter located within the Pain Clinic to establish&#xD;
      baseline platelet, white blood cell, and hemoglobin level and hematocrit of the peripheral&#xD;
      blood. In addition, a small sample of the actual prepared PRP solution will be processed to&#xD;
      check for concentrated platelet, white blood cell and hemoglobin level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be instructed to avoid other invasive treatments (including&#xD;
      acupuncture) while participating in this study. In order to prevent a potential&#xD;
      blunting-effect of the PRP treatment, participants will also be instructed to avoid&#xD;
      non-emergent use of NSAIDs for treating typical pain symptoms for at least the first 3-months&#xD;
      following the study intervention/injection to help the patient accurately reflect their&#xD;
      perception of pain. NSAIDs may reduce the effectiveness of PRP. If a participant needs&#xD;
      additional analgesia, acetaminophen is the preferred agent. Concomitant medications will be&#xD;
      recorded at each follow up visit. If necessary, participants will received pain medication&#xD;
      that is provided as SOC post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given appropriate temporary profile (if active duty) to protect them from&#xD;
      aggravating activities (such as airborne operation, ruck marches, formation running for at&#xD;
      least 3 months after the injection. All patients will be ask to enroll in pre and post&#xD;
      procedure physical therapy sessions for body mechanics training/rehabilitative protocol, for&#xD;
      total of up to 8 sessions during the study period. Participants will be evaluated by&#xD;
      experienced physical therapist specializing in chronic pain. The pre-procedure rehabilitation&#xD;
      will occur within a week prior to the procedure. The 1st post-procedure rehabilitation visit&#xD;
      will take place within 10-14 days of the procedure, with encouragement to begin the home&#xD;
      exercise program within 48-72 hours post-procedure. Additionally, all participants will be&#xD;
      offered optional rehabilitative and/or complementary techniques available as standard of care&#xD;
      such as aquatics, yoga, biofeedback, and pain psychology support, based on availability and&#xD;
      as SOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of the treatment/injection will be considered study time point 0. Participants will&#xD;
      return to clinic for follow up visits at 1 month (+/- 7 days), 3 months (+/- 14 days), 6&#xD;
      months (+/- 14 days) postinjection for PRP participants. Control participants will be given&#xD;
      the option to received PRP treatment at the 3-month visit (more below). If participants opt&#xD;
      for the injection, they will also come for a visit at 3 months (+/- 14 days) and 6 months&#xD;
      (+/- 14 days) post-PRP injection. If they do not opt for the PRP injection, they will come&#xD;
      6-month (+/- 14 days) post-saline injection. At each follow-up visit, participants will&#xD;
      undergo a standard physical examination by the provider who did not do the procedure (i.e.&#xD;
      the AI or PI within the pain clinic) and the participant will assess current pain and&#xD;
      functional level using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS-Pain) and the Defense Veteran Pain&#xD;
      Rating Scale (DVPRS) Supplemental Questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also complete the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Global Rate of Change&#xD;
      (GROC), PROMIS Pain Interference, Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, Ability to&#xD;
      participate in Social Roles and Activities, and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment&#xD;
      Questionnaire for Low Back Pain (WPAI:LBP). At each follow up visit, participants will be&#xD;
      evaluated for adverse events and any additional treatment, therapy, and concomitant&#xD;
      medications will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be blinded to assigned treatment arm (i.e. saline vs. PRP) until 3 months&#xD;
      post-injection. Blinding will be revealed to participants at the end of their 3 month&#xD;
      post-injection follow up visit after they complete all required follow up questionnaires. At&#xD;
      this time, participants assigned to the control (saline injection) arm will be offered the&#xD;
      option to receive PRP injections. Control participants who elect to receive PRP injections&#xD;
      will remain in the study and will continue follow up with the research team until 6-months&#xD;
      post PRP injection. Control participants that do not opt to receive PRP-injection at the 3-&#xD;
      months post-saline injection, will remain in the study until 6 months post saline-injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control participants who are not interested in receiving PRP injections and that would like&#xD;
      to be treated with additional medical management (i.e. radiofrequency ablation) will resume&#xD;
      normal care with their attending physician who will guide additional treatment options.&#xD;
      Participants electing not to receive PRP will still be evaluated at 6-months post-injection&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
