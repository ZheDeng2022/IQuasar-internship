  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effect of two different types of&#xD;
      education and support programs for partner caregivers of people with spinal cord injury&#xD;
      (SCI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCI particularly affects partners (spouses or other types of significant others), as they&#xD;
      face changes in relationship dynamics and identity as they take on a caregiver role. The&#xD;
      purpose of this research study is to compare the effect of two different types of education&#xD;
      and support programs for partner caregivers of people with spinal cord injury (SCI).&#xD;

    <description>Change in behavior and emotion, measured by the Behavioral Inhibition/ Behavioral Activation Scale. The extent to which behavior and emotions change over time will be measured with the Behavioral Inhibition/ Behavioral Activation Scale. The BIS/BAS scale is composed of three subscales; (1) drive, which measures the persistent pursuit of goals, (2) fun seeking, which measures the desire for new rewards and the willingness to approach a potentially rewarding event, and (3) reward responsiveness, which measures positive responses to rewarding outcomes.</description>
