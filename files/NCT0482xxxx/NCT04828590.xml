      DEEPVESSEL FFR is a medical device that is designed to extract three- dimensional coronary&#xD;
      tree structures and generate computed tomography-derived fraction flow reserve (FFR) values&#xD;
      from coronary CT angiogram images. The primary objective of this multi-center clinical&#xD;
      validation study is to validate the clinical performance of DEEPVESSEL FFR in identifying&#xD;
      patients with myocardial ischemia due to significant obstructive coronary artery diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease, and it is the leading&#xD;
      cause of death worldwide in both men and women. CAD happens when the coronary arteries become&#xD;
      hardened and narrowed, which is due to the buildup of cholesterol-containing deposits-plaque&#xD;
      on the inner vessel wall. As the plaque grows, less blood can flow through the arteries due&#xD;
      to the vessel narrowing. Decreased blood flow can then lead to chest pain (angina), shortness&#xD;
      of breath, or even a heart attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fractional flow reserve (FFR), a measure of blood flow reduction caused by vessel narrowing,&#xD;
      is accepted as gold standard for assessing the functional significance of stenotic lesions.&#xD;
      Multiple randomized trials have demonstrated that FFR has excellent diagnostic value in&#xD;
      identifying functionally significant lesions and guiding coronary revascularization&#xD;
      procedures. However, FFR is measured invasively through a pressure wire-based cardiac&#xD;
      catheter procedure in the catheterization lab. Current guidelines recommend assessing&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia of stable patients with CAD through non-invasive functional testing&#xD;
      before considering invasive coronary angiography (ICA) or conducting myocardial&#xD;
      revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEEPVESSEL FFR (DVFFR) is a software medical device that is designed to extract three-&#xD;
      dimensional coronary tree structures and generate computed tomography -derived FFR values&#xD;
      from coronary CT angiogram (CTA) images. It uses deep learning neural networks that encode&#xD;
      imaging, structural, and functional characteristics of coronary arteries and learn complex&#xD;
      mapping between FFR values and the encoded information. The quantitative FFR analysis based&#xD;
      on the coronary CTA images can help clinicians assess the physiological function in patients&#xD;
      with CAD non-invasively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of DVFFR&#xD;
      software in identifying patients with significant obstructive CAD causing myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia, using invasively measured ICA FFR as the reference standard.&#xD;
