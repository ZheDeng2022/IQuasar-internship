      This two-part study will be conducted in male and female patients 18 to 65 years of age&#xD;
      undergoing bunionectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I - three-step, single ascending dose study design in which two drug loads (low drug&#xD;
      load of funapide and high drug load of funapide) and two volumes (high volume and low volume)&#xD;
      of FX301 will be explored against placebo in four cohorts of 12 patients each (9 active:3&#xD;
      placebo) for the management of post-surgical pain in patients undergoing bunionectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II - expansion cohort to further assess safety, tolerability, systemic exposure, and&#xD;
      efficacy of a selected drug load/volume of FX301. An additional 36 patients will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either FX301 or placebo as a single-injection analgesic&#xD;
      nerve block adjacent to the sciatic nerve of the popliteal fossa.&#xD;

      This two-part study will be conducted in male and female patients 18 to 65 years of age&#xD;
      undergoing bunionectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I - three-step, single ascending dose study design in which two drug loads (low drug&#xD;
      load of funapide and high drug load of funapide) and two volumes (high volume and low volume)&#xD;
      of FX301 will be explored against placebo in four cohorts of 12 patients each (9 active:3&#xD;
      placebo) for the management of post-surgical pain in patients undergoing bunionectomy. At&#xD;
      each step, the amount of FX301 administered (dose level) will be constant (65 mg, 130 mg, and&#xD;
      260 mg) so that the local safety of the drug loads and the volumes administered can be&#xD;
      assessed separately. The 130 mg dose step will consist of both the low drug load at high&#xD;
      volume and the high drug load at low volume concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will review all safety data of each dose step prior to&#xD;
      escalation to the next dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the last cohort, data will be reviewed to assess whether to expand one of&#xD;
      the four dose/volume cohorts up to and including the highest tolerated drug load/volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II - expansion cohort to further assess safety, tolerability, systemic exposure, and&#xD;
      efficacy of a selected drug load/volume of FX301. An additional 36 patients will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either FX301 or placebo as a single-injection analgesic&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Has positive results on the alcohol test (breath or saliva) indicative of alcohol&#xD;
             abuse or urine drug screen (UDS) indicative of illicit drug use at screening, and/or&#xD;

             of THC-containing products from 14 days prior to surgery to Day 85, they may be&#xD;
             allowed to participate in the study. Additionally, it may be permissible for the&#xD;
             subject to participate if the results of the UDS can be explained by a current&#xD;
             prescription or acceptable over-the-counter medication as determined by the&#xD;

             medication for any reason (including, but not limited to, the risks described as&#xD;

             diagnosed with cancer within 2 years before screening (excluding squamous or basal&#xD;

&#xD;
         23. Laboratory evidence of infection with HIV, positive test for HBsAg, or positive&#xD;
