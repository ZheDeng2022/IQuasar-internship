  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the natural course and prognosis factors of inpatients and outpatients&#xD;
      with Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD). The investigators conducted a&#xD;
      cross-sectional study to determine the evolution of a sample of DMDD patients referred to the&#xD;
      hospital for suicidal behaviors between 2013 and 2018 in terms of diagnostic stability,&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidity, and psychosocial factors. A group of patients with various episodic&#xD;
      mood disturbances was used as a clinical case control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to change in DMDD symptoms across time, the investigators examined the onset and&#xD;
      persistence of psychiatric comorbidity using the KIDDIE-SADS PL and suicidal behaviors using&#xD;
      the Colombia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale. The investigators also examined the&#xD;
      persistence of depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), the&#xD;
      persistence of emotional lability (Affective Lability Scale-18), borderline traits&#xD;
      (Abbreviated Diagnostic of Inventory Borderline). Socio-demographic, clinical features and&#xD;
      actigraphy-measured sleep characteristics determined between 2013 and 2018 were used to&#xD;
      predict the evolution of the DMDD patients and the clinical control group.&#xD;

    <description>The evolution toward another psychiatric disorder would be examined using the semi-structured interview KIDDIE-SADS and the Ab-DIB to examine borderline traits.&#xD;
The K-SADS is a semi-structured interview to measure current and past symptoms of mood, anxiety, psychotic, and disruptive behavior disorders in children ages 6-18 years old.&#xD;
(Ab-DIB) as a screening measure of borderline psychopathology in an adolescent clinical population.</description>
