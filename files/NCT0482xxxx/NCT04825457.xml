  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is an effective and has been widely used technique for the&#xD;
      treatment of superficial colorectal neoplasms. Although, conventional EMR (CEMR) showed high&#xD;
      efficacy for the management of colorectal superficial neoplasms, there is problematic&#xD;
      limitation in this technique - incomplete resection. In literature, the anchoring-tip EMR&#xD;
      (AEMR), named as &quot;Tip-in EMR&quot; was first introduced in 2016 from Japan. Recently, several&#xD;
      retrospective studies have been suggested about the effectiveness of AEMR. However, there has&#xD;
      been no prospective randomized controlled study to identify its advantage over CEMR.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators performed a multicenter randomized controlled trial to estimate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of AEMR compared with CEMR for the endoscopic treatment of&#xD;
      intermediate-size (10 to 20 mm) colorectal polyps.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After injection of normal saline solution mix, snaring was tried for CEMR. In AEMR, the snare&#xD;
      tip was projected from the sheath by 1-2 mm length. Consequently, a small mucosal incision&#xD;
      was made at proximal side of lesion. Then the snare was deployed progressively and adjusted&#xD;
      around the lesion trying to obtain free margins. At the final step of both conventional and&#xD;
      Tip-in EMR, the lesion was resected.&#xD;
