  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalized patients with obesity who are not already in CWM (comprehensive weight&#xD;
      management), or not comfort care/hospice will be identified by the hospitalists then the&#xD;
      study dietitian will consent for the patient for enrollment (and answer any question&#xD;
      regarding diet/lifestyle) in the study. The intervention will be a CWM referral at discharge.&#xD;
      The outcome will be what percentage of these patients go to the CWM clinic at 6 months. At 6&#xD;
      months, the investigators will also call each participant to get a qualitative idea of the&#xD;
      process of inpatient referral and barriers to the CWM clinic visit. Weight loss, starting on&#xD;
      anti-obesity medication, bariatric surgery will be assessed as a secondary outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      -  The investigators will conduct an uncontrolled, one arm interventional study on Adult (≥&#xD;
           18 years of age) hospitalized patients who have obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 or BMI ≥ 27&#xD;
           kg/m 2 if Asian/South Asian), and after stabilization of their acute medical conditions.&#xD;
           Prior to hospital discharge, patients will receive a referral for an outpatient&#xD;
           comprehensive weight management clinic, with a message that will be sent to the CWM&#xD;
           clinic scheduler. Then the investigators will follow the patients forward for 6 months&#xD;
           from hospital discharge to assess primary and secondary outcomes. Also, the&#xD;
           investigators will look at a historical control group of hospitalized patients with&#xD;
           obesity (age, comorbidity matched) from 2014-2019 (chosen instead of 2020, to avoid any&#xD;
           impact of 2020 COVID 19 pandemic) and compare the primary and secondary outcomes. At six&#xD;
           months after discharge, patients will receive a phone call from the investigators to&#xD;
           ascertain whether they were able to go to the comprehensive weight management clinic and&#xD;
           about their experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalized patients who have decision-making capacity and whose acute medical&#xD;
           condition has been stabilized who meet study criteria will be identified by study&#xD;
           physician(s) who will look at his/her personal patient list on a regular basis to&#xD;
           identify patients who meet enrollment criteria and will refer the patients to the&#xD;
           co-investigator who is not directly involved in the patient's care who will then discuss&#xD;
           enrollment with patients.&#xD;
