      The objective of REVOCAN study is to assess the abrogation of PARP inhibitors resistance in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed platinum sensitive ovarian cancer treated with PARP inhibitors in&#xD;
      maintenance since at least 6 months and who have only an increase of CA 125 without any&#xD;
      progression according to RECIST criteria. AsiDNATM at 600 mg will be tested in addition to&#xD;
      PARP inhibitors given according to the label in REVOCAN study.&#xD;
