  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a group of heterogeneous malignancies derived from&#xD;
      hematopoietic precursors. Patients older than 65 years can hardly benefit from standard&#xD;
      intensive chemotherapy while having a poor toxicity tolerance, leading to a dismal prognosis.&#xD;
      Currently, there is no satisfactory treatment modality for this high-risk patient population,&#xD;
      which is an unmet clinical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax (ABT-199/GDC-0199, VEN) is a highly selective, oral B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2)&#xD;
      inhibitor that has shown activity in BCL-2- dependent leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, and&#xD;
      has recently exerted encouraging therapeutic effect with manageable toxicity profile in the&#xD;
      field of treatment of AML. Promising results have emerged in the combination of venetoclax&#xD;
      and hypomethylating agents (HMA), decitabine or azacitidin (AZA), producing complete&#xD;
      remission (CR) plus CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) rates of 74% and 66.7%,&#xD;
      respectively, in previously untreated elderly AML patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homoharringtonine (HHT) is an alkaloid and has been used in Chinese patients with acute and&#xD;
      chronic myeloid leukemia for more than 30 years. The add of HHT to the combination of&#xD;
      cytarabin and aclarubicin or daunorubicin has been proved to improve CR rate and prognosis of&#xD;
      AML patients. Moreover, HHT combined with low-dose cytarabine and granulocyte&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has achieved durable efficacy in AML patients, either in&#xD;
      the first-line or salvage setting. Interestingly, HHT has potent synergistic effects with VEN&#xD;
      through reducing the expression of BCL-XL and MCL-1 in BCL-2 related pathways as previouly&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims at investigating the combination of HHT, VEN, AZA and G-CSF (HVAG) in the&#xD;
      treatment of newly diagnosed elderly AML patients who are ineligible for intensive&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
