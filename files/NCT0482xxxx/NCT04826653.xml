  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gingival recession is defined as the displacement of the soft tissue margin apical to the&#xD;
      cemento-enamel junction with exposure of the root surface. It affects a broad population with&#xD;
      presence of periodontal disease as well as periodontally healthy individuals. The occurrence&#xD;
      of gingival recessions is age-dependent and their development begins relatively early in&#xD;
      life. For instance, gingival recessions were noticed in more than 60% of Norwegian&#xD;
      20-year-olds and in more than 90% of the older population. Similar findings were reported in&#xD;
      Brazilian and French population. In populations deprived of dental care, the occurrence of&#xD;
      gingival recessions was even higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many factors have been implicated in the etiology of gingival recession, including plaque,&#xD;
      position of the tooth in the arch and improper toothbrushing. It is difficult to see a single&#xD;
      cause for the development of labial gingival recession.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been demonstrated in several investigations that if left untreated, the probability of&#xD;
      progression of the recession is high even with good oral hygiene. The indications for&#xD;
      treatment of gingival recession are: esthetics, dental hypersensitivity, and the prevention&#xD;
      of caries as well as further progression of the recession. Therapeutic options for recessions&#xD;
      have been well documented with a high degree of success. Their ultimate goal is the location&#xD;
      of the gingival margin coronal to the CEJ, with minimal probing depth and a pleasant soft&#xD;
      tissue integration with the adjacent teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With such a prevalent condition, it becomes critical to discriminate when to treat these&#xD;
      lesions and which are the anatomical and surgical characteristics that are going to determine&#xD;
      the amount of root coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding surgical characteristics, it has been demonstrated that the accomplishment of&#xD;
      complete root coverage may be prejudiced by the post-surgical position of the gingival margin&#xD;
      (the more coronal to the CEJ the greater the chance to achieve root coverage). The same&#xD;
      author conducted a randomized clinical trial showing that the higher the flap tension, the&#xD;
      lower the recession reduction. Another surgical factor affecting root coverage may be the use&#xD;
      of microsurgical approaches by the use of smaller diameter sutures. According to a recently&#xD;
      published systematic review, early suture removal (less than 10 days) can negatively affect&#xD;
      root coverage outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The healing process after pedicle graft was investigated in an animal model study. The&#xD;
      healing was divided into four different stages, the adaption stage (0-4 days), the&#xD;
      proliferation stage (4-21 days), the attachment stage (27-28 days) and the maturation stage&#xD;
      (1-6 months). During the proliferation stage, connective tissue invades the fibrin layer from&#xD;
      the basal level of the flap, and after 6-10 days a layer of fibroblasts is seen in apposition&#xD;
      to the root surface. These cells are believed to differentiate into cementoblasts at a later&#xD;
      stage of healing. At the end of the proliferation stage, thin collagen fibers are formed&#xD;
      adjacent to the root surface, but a fibrous union between the connective tissue and the root&#xD;
      has not been observed. It seems logical that stabilizing the flap with sutures for a&#xD;
      prolonged period of time during the proliferation phase would help maintain the gingival&#xD;
      margin on a more coronal position postoperatively. On the other hand, the longer the sutures&#xD;
      remain postoperatively, the greater the chances of plaque accumulation and inflammation&#xD;
      affecting negatively to root coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The systematic review by Tatakis and Chambrone included 17 randomized clinical trials that&#xD;
      provided an overall data of 325 single recession defects that were treated by coronally&#xD;
      advanced flap. While they investigated time of suture removal, the studies included in this&#xD;
      study did not account for this variable, thus leading to some bias. Moreover, different&#xD;
      suture materials, type of suturing technique may also play an important role in the healing&#xD;
      process. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcome of timing&#xD;
      suture removal regarding root coverage on coronally advanced flap.&#xD;
