    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the performance, clinical benefits and safety of the Persona Revision&#xD;
      Knee System in patients who have received primary or revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA)&#xD;
      treatment. This will be done using a multicenter, single-arm, consecutive series,&#xD;
      retrospective cohort study with prospective follow-up.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Under study are the Persona® Revision Knee System (K181947 and K191625) implants and&#xD;
      instrumentation, and any compatible devices being used in conjunction according to the&#xD;
      Instructions for Use. This will be accomplished by retrospectively identifying patients who&#xD;
      underwent primary or revision TKA with this system and inviting them to participate in&#xD;
      prospective data collection at 1 and 2-years postoperative follow-up. As the device was not&#xD;
      available for commercial use until late 2019, the retrospective portion will involve those&#xD;
      activities that occurred per standard of care for participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for this study will be performance assessed by improvement in the 1989&#xD;
      Knee Society Clinical Rating System (KS) objective knee score (KS-KS) from baseline to 2&#xD;
      years (as evaluated using the overall group mean showing at least the Minimal Clinically&#xD;
      Important Difference (MCID) of 5.4 points).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 20 sites will contribute to this study. There will be a maximum of 380 patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the study.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint for this study will be performance assessed by improvement in the 1989 Knee Society Clinical Rating System (KS) objective knee score (KS-KS) from baseline to 2 years (as evaluated using the overall group mean showing at least the minimal clinically important difference [MCID] of 5.4 points)&#xD;
The Knee Society objective knee score (KS-KS) assesses the knee joint by awarding points for pain, stability, and range of motion, with a minimum possible score of 0 and maximum possible score of 100. As described in Insall et al. (1989), &quot;100 points will be obtained by a well-aligned knee prosthesis with no pain, [at least 121] degrees of motion, and negligible anteroposterior and mediolateral instability.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence and frequency of adverse events.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Safety of the device will be assessed by evaluating the incidence and frequency of adverse events including (re-)revision of any component during the study in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/745 - Medical Device Regulation (MDR) Article 80(2) as well as Medical Devices Coordination Group (MDCG) 2020-10/1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Performance and clinical benefits will be assessed by evaluating improvements in patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) of the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores from baseline to 2 years.&#xD;
The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain is scored on a scale of 0 to 10. A score of 0 indicates that the patient is experiencing no pain in their knee joint while a score of 10 indicates that the patient is experiencing the worst possible pain in their knee joint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Junior (KOOS-Jr)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Performance and clinical benefits will be assessed by evaluating improvements in patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) for the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Junior (KOOS-Jr) subscale scores from baseline to 2 years.&#xD;
The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Junior (KOOS-Jr) is scored on a scale of 0 to 100. A score of 100 indicates that a patient is experiencing perfect knee health while a score of 0 indicates that a patient is experiencing total knee disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Radiographic Imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Exploratory outcomes will include the evaluation of radiographic imaging as required for adverse event/complication reporting purposes with focus on the following parameters: radiolucency lines, component migration/subsidence, osteolysis, and localized osteopenia.</description>
