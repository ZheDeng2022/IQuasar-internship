  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria remains a major public health concern in Cameroon especially among vulnerable groups&#xD;
      such as children less than five years and pregnant women. Artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and&#xD;
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) have been used for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium&#xD;
      falciparum in Cameroon since 2004. Worldwide, several studies among children have reported&#xD;
      high efficacy and safety of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). There is paucity&#xD;
      of data to support the continuous use of ASAQ and AL in Cameroon. The main objective of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine and&#xD;
      artemether-lumefantrine during a 28-day follow-up period in children with acute uncomplicated&#xD;
      P. falciparum malaria in the Center Region of Cameroon. A randomized, open-labelled,&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial comparing artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether-lumefantrine&#xD;
      (AL) will be carried out from 5th April to 31st December, 2021 at six hospitals in the Center&#xD;
      Region of Cameroon. The study participants shall include febrile patients aged 6 months to 10&#xD;
      years with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. Eligible children for whom&#xD;
      parent/guardian informed consents are obtained will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      artesunate-amodiaquine (group A) or artemether-lumefantrine (group B) in the ratio 1:1. A&#xD;
      minimum sample of 76 patients will be required for the study. With a 20 % increase to allow&#xD;
      loss to follow-up and withdrawals during the 28-day follow-up period, 92 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled for each of the two study arms. The study will recruit a total of 184 patients.&#xD;
      However, since 6 sites will be involved, a minimum of 30 participants shall be enrolled per&#xD;
      site. Drug intake will be done under strict supervision on days 0, 1 and 2. Follow-up visits&#xD;
      will be performed on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 to evaluate clinical and parasitological&#xD;
      resolution of their malaria episode as well as adverse events. Polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (PCR) genotyping of merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 (msp-1, msp-2) as well as glutamate&#xD;
      rich protein (GLURP) will be used to differentiate between recrudescence and new infection.&#xD;

      Brief title: Efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine for&#xD;
      the treatment of malaria in Cameroon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Official title: Monitoring the efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine and&#xD;
      artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria&#xD;
      among children in the Center Region of Cameroon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To monitor the efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine and&#xD;
      artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria&#xD;
      among children in the Center Region of Cameroon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Malaria remains a major public health concern in Cameroon especially among&#xD;
      vulnerable groups such as children less than 5 years and pregnant women.&#xD;
      artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) are currently being used for&#xD;
      the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum in Cameroon. Worldwide, several studies&#xD;
      among children have reported high efficacy and safety of artemisinin-based combination&#xD;
      therapies (ACTs). There is paucity of data to support the continuous use of ASAQ and AL in&#xD;
      Cameroon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine and&#xD;
      artemether-lumefantrine during a 28-day follow-up period among children with acute&#xD;
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Center Region of Cameroon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sites: District Hospital Akonolinga, District Hospital Mfou, District Hospital Soa,&#xD;
      District Hospital Mbalmayo, District Hospital Mbandjock, and District Hospital Ngog-Mapubi in&#xD;
      the Center Region of Cameroon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period: 5th April to 31st December, 2021. Study design: This surveillance study is a&#xD;
      two arm, open label, randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population: Febrile patients aged 6 months to 10 years, with confirmed uncomplicated&#xD;
      P. falciparum infection. Eligible children for whom parent/guardian informed consents are&#xD;
      obtained will be randomized to receive either artesunate-amodiaquine (group A) or&#xD;
      artemether-lumefantrine (group B) in the ratio 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: A minimum sample of 76 patients will be required for the study. With a 20 %&#xD;
      increase to allow loss to follow-up and withdrawals during the 28-day follow-up period, 92&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled for each of the two study arms. The study will recruit a total of&#xD;
      184 patients. At least 30 participants shall be enrolled at each of the six study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment (s) and follow-up: Drug intake will be done under strict supervision on days 0, 1&#xD;
      and 2. Follow-up visits will be performed on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 to evaluate clinical&#xD;
      and parasitological resolution of their malaria episode as well as adverse events. Polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction (PCR) genotyping of merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 (msp-1, msp-2) as well&#xD;
      as glutamate rich protein (GLURP) will be used to differentiate between recrudescence and new&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classification of treatment outcomes: Classification of treatment outcomes will be done based&#xD;
      on the WHO 2009 guidelines: treatment failure (Early Treatment Failure-ETF, Late Clinical&#xD;
      failure-LCF and Late Parasitological Failure-LPF) and treatment success (Adequate Clinical&#xD;
      and Parasitological Response-ACPR).&#xD;
