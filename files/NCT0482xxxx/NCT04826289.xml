  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine variation in vertical distance between the medial and lateral malleolus in the&#xD;
      normal population subjected to X-rays for any other causes than ankle fracture Determine the&#xD;
      effect of weight bearing on this variation&#xD;

      There is gap of knowledge about determination of vertical distance between medial and lateral&#xD;
      malleolus Our research will cover this gap of knowledge ,so our research question will be&#xD;
      what is the normal variation of vertical distance between medial and lateral malleolus&#xD;
      Fractures of ankle are common injuries,approximately 2% of the general population will&#xD;
      sustain an ankle fracture during their life time .many can be successfully treated non&#xD;
      operatively However,for those injuries that require surgical intervention ,restoration of the&#xD;
      anatomy is the main principle The importance of anatomic restoration of the fibula ,specially&#xD;
      in preserving normal length has been appreciated by several authors Data will be obtained&#xD;
      from measuring the vertical distance between lateral and medial malleolus in AP view of ankle&#xD;
      in traumatic non ankle fractured people in standing and non standing position&#xD;
