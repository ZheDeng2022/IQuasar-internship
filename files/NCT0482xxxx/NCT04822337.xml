    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to learn if the study drug belantamab mafodotin, in&#xD;
      combination with other standard medications, can improve multiple myeloma. This study will&#xD;
      also help determine what effects, good and/or bad, this combination of study drugs have on&#xD;
      subjects and their cancer, and to evaluate the overall response to this study treatment&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I dose escalation and expansion study in RMM and RRMM followed by a single&#xD;
      arm phase II expansion in high risk, NDMM. The phase I portion of the protocol will utilize a&#xD;
      standard 3+3 dose escalation design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and RP2D of&#xD;
      the KRd-belantamab mafodotin combination. The phase II portion of the trial is a two-stage&#xD;
      design that will assess the efficacy and safety of the combination in newly diagnosed,&#xD;
      high-risk MM patients.&#xD;
