  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether there is any difference between the use of&#xD;
      standard techniques, ultrasonography and infra-red light for the success of the first attempt&#xD;
      in difficult peripheral vascular access patients. Patients who have difficult vascular access&#xD;
      history ( often need 2 or more attempt to access peripheral intravenous catheter), who do not&#xD;
      have palpable or visible vein after tourniquet, and who have the hard anticipation according&#xD;
      to operator ( easy-moderate-hard) are included to study. The primary objective is planned as&#xD;
      the determination of the success rate in the first attempt. Secondary aims of the study were&#xD;
      determined as: total procedure time,total number of attempts, and need for rescue procedure&#xD;

      Before starting the study, all nurses who work as senior nurse in the emergency department&#xD;
      will be informed. All the Emergency Nurses who are willing to participate in the study (the&#xD;
      consent form from the nurses who will be included in the study) will be taken pretest to&#xD;
      measure their knowledge about ultrasound and infrared light usage for intravenous access.&#xD;
      Then, the 4-hours theoretical and 4-hours practical lesson accompanied by an infrared device&#xD;
      and a single-operator with horizontal and longitudinal vascular access with ultrasonography&#xD;
      will be explained by the experienced Emergency Medicine Specialist to all the senior nurses .&#xD;
      Introduction of ultrasonography device in the theoretical training, principles of using,&#xD;
      linear probe and its properties, horizontal and longitudinal axis concepts used in the&#xD;
      determination of venous structures, principles of determination of venous structures in&#xD;
      ultrasonography, differentiation of artery and nerve structures will be explained. The&#xD;
      introduction of the device for infrared light, the principles of operation, the distance&#xD;
      between the light and operation area and the positioning of the device will be discussed.&#xD;
      Practical trainings will be arranged on horizontal and longitudinal axes by using ultrasound&#xD;
      on lifeless forearm mannequin. In the practical lesson in the infrared light device, the&#xD;
      device will be kept in a proper distance on the live mannequin, being positioned&#xD;
      perpendicular to the area to be treated and identification of the vascular structures while&#xD;
      the device is operating. After the theoretical and practical training, all of the senior&#xD;
      nurses will be evaluated with posttest and the nurses with a success rate of 80% will be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients and/ or their relatives will be included to study if they meet any of the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and accept the consent form. The randomization of the patients according&#xD;
      to the number of nurses participating in the study will be determined by the responsible&#xD;
      researchers before the study begins. For example, in the study where 10 senior nurses will&#xD;
      participate, the number of targeted patients will be at least 270 and 10 boxes specific to&#xD;
      each nurse will be created. These boxes will be kept in the senior nurse room. Each box will&#xD;
      have 27 different application methods (9 usg, 9 infrared, 9 standard methods). The nurse who&#xD;
      accepts to participate in the research will apply the method according to the procedure which&#xD;
      will be randomly drawn from this box. In this way, an equal number of procedures will be&#xD;
      provided for each nurse and an equal number of procedures will be provided for each nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of the procedure on the longitudinal or horizontal axis will be left to&#xD;
      senior nurse discretion. In the infrared light approach, 2 applicators will be operated.&#xD;
      While holding the auxiliary infra-red light, the practitioner will perform the operation at a&#xD;
      distance of 20 cm perpendicular to the process zone. The place of application will be left to&#xD;
      the discretion of the practitioner. In order to establish a standard approach between the&#xD;
      procedures performed, 18 gauge catheter will be used at the arm and the forearm areas, 20&#xD;
      gauge for the other regions. After the tourniquet is inserted, the procedure time will be&#xD;
      calculated as seconds. In order for the successful vascular access to be considered&#xD;
      successful, at least 5 ml of blood should be taken or at least 5 ml of saline fluid should be&#xD;
      given. In all three approaches, if there is no success after 2 attempts, the 3rd and&#xD;
      subsequent trials will be evaluated as rescue interventions and these interventions will be&#xD;
      left to the discretion of the practitioner and this will be recorded observably (standard&#xD;
      approach, usg, infra red light, central vascular, intraosseous approach, calling senior&#xD;
      nurse, calling emergency medicine physician etc.). For all three approaches, the success of&#xD;
      the first trial, the total duration of the procedure (in seconds), the total number of&#xD;
      trials, and rescue method need will be recorded.&#xD;
