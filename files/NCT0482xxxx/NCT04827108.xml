  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a leading cause of death for children. Chemotherapy is the most common treatment&#xD;
      for cancer. Notwithstanding the improved survival, children with cancer still have to face a&#xD;
      significant amount of symptoms associated with chemotherapy. Two major symptoms induced by&#xD;
      chemotherapy are nausea and vomiting. These two symptoms were demonstrated to cause serious&#xD;
      disruption in patients' daily function and quality of life. Given these devastating impacts,&#xD;
      intervening children with appropriate methods to alleviate nausea and vomiting during&#xD;
      chemotherapy is therefore crucial. It is imperative for nurses to develop non-pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions to reduce nausea and vomiting, with the goal of improving the QoL of children&#xD;
      with cancer when undergoing chemotherapy First, however, careful assessment of nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting in children with cancer is a necessary step towards designing appropriate&#xD;
      interventions. This study aims to translate and validate an instrument (PeNAT) which can&#xD;
      assess nausea and vomiting among Hong Kong Chinese children and adolescents undergoing&#xD;
      chemotherapy&#xD;

      Currently, the most effective anti-emetics appear to be 5-HT3 inhibitors, followed by NK1&#xD;
      inhibitors and neuroleptic drugs. Nevertheless, anti-emetics alone are not sufficient to&#xD;
      manage these two symptoms. This poor symptom control could be due to healthcare&#xD;
      professionals' perception that nausea and vomiting are solely biological problems, and their&#xD;
      heavy reliance on pharmacological treatment for management. After literature search, we can&#xD;
      identify only one validated instrument, the Pediatric Nausea Assessment tool (PeNAT),&#xD;
      assessing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in children. Yet, this instruments is not&#xD;
      available in Chinese. This study aims to translate and validate an instrument (PeNAT) which&#xD;
      can assess nausea and vomiting among Hong Kong Chinese children and adolescents undergoing&#xD;
      chemotherapy&#xD;
