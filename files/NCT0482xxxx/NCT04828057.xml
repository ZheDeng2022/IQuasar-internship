      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Tafluprost / Timolol in&#xD;
      controlling ocular hypertension, as measured by mean change in intra-ocular pressure (IOP)&#xD;
      from baseline to after 6 months of treatment from initiation, in patients with open angle&#xD;
      glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT), who do not respond sufficiently to initial&#xD;
      topical treatment, in routine clinical practice.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Tafluprost / Timolol in&#xD;
      controlling ocular hypertension, as measured by mean change in intra-ocular pressure (IOP)&#xD;
      from baseline to after 6 months of treatment from initiation, in patients with open angle&#xD;
      glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT), who do not respond sufficiently to initial&#xD;
      topical treatment, in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include adults with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, who received&#xD;
      their first Tafluprost / Timolol prescription at baseline, even if Tafluprost / Timolol was&#xD;
      not continued after the first prescription. In addition, patients must have their IOP&#xD;
      recorded within 7 days before their first prescription of Tafluprost / Timolol, in order to&#xD;
      be eligible for this study. Only those who provide informed consent will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of a scheduled clinic visit, eligible patients will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      the study and willing patients will be requested to sign an informed consent form. Once&#xD;
      informed consent is obtained, the patient is included in the study and relevant data will be&#xD;
      recorded during routine clinical visits. Participation in this study is entirely voluntary;&#xD;
      any patient may withdraw consent to participate in this study at any time. The withdrawn&#xD;
      patient's data will not be analyzed in this study and the number of patients who withdrew&#xD;
      consent will appear in the final study report.&#xD;
