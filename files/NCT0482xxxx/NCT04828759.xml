  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of the immersive 3D HMD VR technology&#xD;
      in the language intervention with a home-based telerehabilitation approach for people with&#xD;
      aphasia. The assessments will be conducted at the baseline (prior the intervention periods)&#xD;
      and after each intervention period (i.e. after the VR-intervention period and the waitlist&#xD;
      period).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present project is to study the effects, feasibility, and the&#xD;
      participants' experiences of this novel kind of language intervention. The effects of the&#xD;
      intervention will be studied with various outcome measures in terms of language performance,&#xD;
      functional communication, and quality of life. The aim is to explore the VR-intervention on&#xD;
      the group level and with a randomized waitlist control group design (or delayed crossover&#xD;
      design). In this study, the people with aphasia will be practicing at their home with support&#xD;
      of their relatives, and participants will also receive regular remote guidance by a speech&#xD;
      and language therapist (SLT) during the intervention. The relatives are also involved in the&#xD;
      assessment process.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive 8 weeks of VR-treatment. Participants are allowed to practice as much as they wish during the VR-intervention. However, they are given a recommendation of the amount of practice (5 h / week). Before the VR-intervention, the participants will receive a guidance for using the VR-devices (i.e. orientation period) by the SLT. Participants will be able to contact the SLT freely during the 8 weeks VR-intervention period. After the orientation period, the participants will be practicing at their homes independently. However, they will receive remote guidance by the SLT. The guidance includes weekly remote guidance sessions by SLT (8 x 45 min) to ensure that training is fluent and unproblematic. Additionally, the content of exercises can be modified during these sessions. The SLT is also able to monitor the training of participants with the system. Devices: VR headset and controller, Tablet computer.</description>

    <description>Wait list control group: During the waitlist period the participants will receive the traditional speech and language therapy rehabilitation offered by (if offered) the general health care system in their own home municipality. The amount of rehabilitation is not controlled during the wait list period. However, the amount of received traditional speech and language rehabilitation in waitlist period will be documented. The waitlist control group will receive the same VR intervention period after the 8 weeks waitlist period.</description>
