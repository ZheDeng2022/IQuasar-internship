    <textblock>
      Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a type of critically ill liver disease with high&#xD;
      short-term mortality in liver disease. Liver transplantation is currently the only method to&#xD;
      improve survival. Current clinical research evidence shows that mesenchymal stem cells can&#xD;
      reduce the mortality of ACLF patients and are safe. This study aims to explore the safety of&#xD;
      umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) in the treatment of ACLF. The study&#xD;
      population is ACLF patients with 1-2 organ failures. To explore the safety of 3 doses of&#xD;
      UC-MSCs, 16 patients need to be enrolled. The main observation indicators are the short-term&#xD;
      and long-term safety of the treatment. All patients need to receive the standard medical&#xD;
      treatment (SMT) at the same time. Stem cell treatment is given by intravenous infusion on the&#xD;
      first, fourth, seventh, and tenth day. The occurrence of adverse events (AE) and serious&#xD;
      adverse events(SAE) before and after the infusion will be observed. After the patient is&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital, patients will be followed , the follow-up time is 5 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute-on-chronic liver failure (acute-on-chronic liver failure, ACLF) is a special type of&#xD;
      rapid deterioration of liver function that occurs on the basis of cirrhosis or non-cirrhosis,&#xD;
      which is characterized by sequential multiple organ failure and high short-term (28 days)&#xD;
      mortality (15%). ACLF was first proposed by Jalan R and Williams R. in 2002. It is a newly&#xD;
      discovered type of critically ill liver disease characterized by high short-term mortality&#xD;
      after hospitalization [1]. At present, the pathophysiological mechanism of ACLF is not clear,&#xD;
      and its definition in Europe and Asia-Pacific is still controversial. However, severe&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response is often closely related to the cause, accompanied by single&#xD;
      or multiple organ failure are three important characteristics of ACLF. In the past ten years,&#xD;
      the prevalence of ACLF has increased. Due to the rapid progress of the disease and the close&#xD;
      relationship between mortality and organ failure, there is no effective method to improve the&#xD;
      survival rate of ACLF patients except liver transplantation. The latest literature review&#xD;
      shows that the 28-day and 90-day mortality rates are as high as 27.8-37.6% and 40-,&#xD;
      respectively. 51.2%[2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2013, European Association for the Study of Chronic Acute Liver Failure（EASL-CLIF）&#xD;
      conducted a prospective multi-center EASL-CLIF Chronic Acute Liver Failure (CANONIC) study in&#xD;
      29 liver disease treatment centers in eight European countries, and proposed chronic liver&#xD;
      failure-sequential organ failure assessment（CLIF-SOFA）score is used as the clinical&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria for alcoholic and hepatitis B virus（HBV）related ACLF. According to the&#xD;
      CLIF-SOFA score, the 90-day mortality rate of ACLF patients is as high as 51%, while that of&#xD;
      non-ACLF patients is 10% [3]. The European CANONIC study also shows that systemic&#xD;
      inflammation is the main driving force of multiple organ failure, which is a typical&#xD;
      pathogenesis of ACLF patients with western liver cirrhosis [4]. For another, the current&#xD;
      Asian ACLF diagnostic criteria is the Asia Pacific Association for the Study of Liver&#xD;
      Diseases (APASL) criteria, which reached a consensus in 2009, and the guidelines were&#xD;
      improved in 2014, but there is still a lack of multi-center, prospective evidence-based&#xD;
      medical evidence to support . In 2016, led by the person in charge of this project, an&#xD;
      oriental ACLF prospective multi-center observation cohort was established in China, which&#xD;
      included 3970 ACLF high-risk patients, filling the gap in the natural course and mortality of&#xD;
      oriental ACLF patients, and established a 90-day oriental ACLF diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
      mortality [5]. The person in charge of this project also explored the pathophysiological&#xD;
      mechanism of ACLF patients in areas with high prevalence of oriental HBV. The study showed&#xD;
      that submassive hepatic necrosis is an important histological feature in ACLF patients with&#xD;
      HBV-related cirrhosis. The systemic inflammatory response of multiple organ failure caused by&#xD;
      parenchymal liver cells has a similar mechanism to that of western alcoholic ACLF [6].&#xD;
      Although the causes of ACLF type are not the same in the East and the West, the cohorts from&#xD;
      the East and the West have confirmed the short-term high mortality rate of ACLF. Systemic&#xD;
      inflammation, sub-large necrosis, and aseptic inflammation may all important reasons that&#xD;
      lead to multiple organ failure and eventual death of ACLF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the high short-term mortality of ACLF and the limited liver source for liver&#xD;
      transplantation, exploring new methods for the treatment of ACLF is a major issue facing&#xD;
      clinical research. Mesenchymal stem cells have great application prospects in regenerative&#xD;
      medicine because of their strong self-renewal, low immunogenicity, non-tumorigenicity and&#xD;
      strong immune regulation ability[7]. Many previous documents have confirmed that mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells in animal models can promote liver cell regeneration, resist inflammation,&#xD;
      regulate local microenvironment and anti-fibrosis [8-10]. Among them, umbilical cord&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) have attracted attention of researchers because they are&#xD;
      easily obtained from the medical waste-the umbilical cord, are not invasive, and have high&#xD;
      expansion capabilities in vitro [11]. The possible mechanism of UC-MSC in the treatment of&#xD;
      end-stage liver disease is that it can repair the liver. At present, there are the following&#xD;
      opinions: ① Cell rehabilitation. In the case of liver failure, MSC can differentiate into&#xD;
      hepatocytes and play an alternative therapeutic effect. A large number of studies have shown&#xD;
      that MSC can be differentiated into functional hepatocytes in different inducing factors and&#xD;
      culture systems in vitro, capable of storing glycogen and urea synthesis. Function; ②Immune&#xD;
      regulation. Studies have shown that MSC can regulate immune cells by secreting a variety of&#xD;
      cytokines in the body, and play an immunomodulatory effect; ③Anti-fibrosis. MSC can induce&#xD;
      hepatic stellate cell apoptosis or inhibit its activation, and can secrete anti-fibrotic&#xD;
      substances such as granulocyte colony stimulating factor and matrix metallopeptidase&#xD;
      9（MMP-9）to reduce the deposition of extracellular matrix and inhibit the formation of liver&#xD;
      fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the results of a single-center clinical trial published by the Third Affiliated&#xD;
      Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University in the previous period, there were no serious adverse&#xD;
      reactions at 6 hours and 72 weeks after intravenous infusion of MSCs. The dose was (1-6)*10^7&#xD;
      cells/time for 4 times, confirming the safety and effectiveness of both low-dose and&#xD;
      high-dose treatments. Another open clinical trial of Beijing 302 Hospital used mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells at a dose of 5*10^5 cells/kg (based on the patient's weight of 60kg, the dose was&#xD;
      3*10^7 cells/time), excluded severe ACLF patients accompanied by severe infections and other&#xD;
      sever complications. In addition, previous pharmacokinetic tests showed that the half-life of&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells in animals is 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this research plans to carry out a single-center open clinical trial to confirm&#xD;
      the safety of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of ACLF, and&#xD;
      provide stronger clinical evidence for the safety of UC-MSCs in the treatment of ACLF.&#xD;
