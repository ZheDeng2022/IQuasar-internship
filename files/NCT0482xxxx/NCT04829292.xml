      The study will recruit 60 young people who meet established criteria for being at clinical&#xD;
      high risk for psychosis. They will be offered a range of psychological interventions starting&#xD;
      with the most benign treatments in different steps. At step 1 they will be offered individual&#xD;
      or group support and if there is no improvement they will be offered more intensive CBT&#xD;
      individual therapy or CBSST group therapy. Assessments will occur at baseline, 6,12 and 18&#xD;
      months&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In treating youth at clinical high risk of developing psychosis we have not been able to&#xD;
      address what treatment to offer first and when to offer more intense and, ultimately, more&#xD;
      costly treatments. The goals of achieving Precision Health objectives require that these&#xD;
      questions be addressed through research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim is to determine the most effective and efficient way to offer active and&#xD;
      maintenance treatment resources for CHR youth. The first step would be to offer a range of&#xD;
      treatments starting with the most benign as advocated in the McGorry and Hickie stage model.&#xD;
      We will use this project to test whether clinical staging will improve prediction of&#xD;
      prognosis and result in improved matching of treatment. The specific objectives of this&#xD;
      project are: (1) to determine which and what proportion of participants would remit (i)&#xD;
      within the first 1-2 months of treatment, (ii) after a brief supportive therapy, (iii) after&#xD;
      longer term, focused psychological interventions such as CBT, CBSST and family intervention&#xD;
      and (iv) how many make use of medications; (2) to determine adherence of CHR individuals to&#xD;
      different treatments; and (3) to determine the need for maintenance treatment. To assess&#xD;
      these objectives the following outcomes will be determined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improvement of Attenuated Psychotic Symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improved social functioning as rated by Global: Social Functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Percentage of the sample that demonstrate either symptomatic or functional improvement&#xD;
           after Step 1 treatments and do not require to move to Step 2 treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Percentage of sample that move to Step 2 Treatments and the percentage that achieve&#xD;
           improvement in either symptoms or functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Percentage of participants allocated to a given treatment that adhere to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be between ages 13 and 25. We will recruit 60 participants who meet&#xD;
      well-established criteria for clinical high risk for psychosis based on the Structured&#xD;
      Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be conducted at baseline and 2, 6, 12, and 18 months after baseline.&#xD;
      Assessments consist of clinical assessments. Clinical raters will be experienced raters and&#xD;
      will be trained on all clinical measures and routine reliability checks will be conducted.&#xD;
