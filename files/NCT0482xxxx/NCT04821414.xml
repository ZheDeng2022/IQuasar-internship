  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In severe infective patients who survive the initial inflammatory storm, the immune response&#xD;
      often evolves toward a state of immunosuppression, which contributes to increased mortality&#xD;
      and severe secondary hospital-acquired infections. However, the role of IL-1β and its&#xD;
      receptor antagonists in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock is discussed&#xD;
      controversially. To date, the efficacy and safety of IL-1β and its receptor antagonists in&#xD;
      children with severe infection is not fully evaluated.&#xD;

      The investigators intend to enroll all children who were hospitalized in pediatric intensive&#xD;
      care unit of Children's Hospital of Fudan University from January 2022 to December 2023.&#xD;
      Children with a PICU length of day less than 48h will be excluded. Patients who met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be divided into trial group and control group. Clinical and&#xD;
      demographic data, as well as treatment outcome will be collected from the electronic health&#xD;
      record.&#xD;
