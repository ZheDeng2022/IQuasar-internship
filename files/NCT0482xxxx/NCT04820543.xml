  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Botulinum type A (BTX-A) is an easy and efficacious treatment for gingival smile (GS).&#xD;
      However, its dosage and injection sites effect among patients are controversial.The objective&#xD;
      was to compare the reduction of gingival exposure using two methods in patients with&#xD;
      different dosage and injection sites. In this prospective self-controlled study, healthy GS&#xD;
      participates who had an anterior gingival exposure (GE) of more than 3 mm were enrolled and&#xD;
      administered single-point injection of 2 U BTX-A per side in the Simplified Method. And after&#xD;
      8 months, the Individualized Method was administered with 2-5 U BTX-A (total, 4-10 U)&#xD;
      injections into 1-2 points according to the severity presented pretreatment. Data were&#xD;
      collected at baseline and 4, 12, and 32 weeks of follow-up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The smile is one of universal facial expressions of the humans. Gingival smile (GS) or gummy&#xD;
      smile defined as any exposure of the gingiva &gt;2 or 3 mm upon smiling, and can substantially&#xD;
      vary from patient to patient, with patients presenting gummy exposures of up to more than 10&#xD;
      mm. The prevalence of GS is 10.57%, and it is more frequently seen in women. Although only an&#xD;
      anatomical variation, it can be considered unattractive and cause significant distress and&#xD;
      impact on one's quality of life. Moreover, most orthodontists and dentists regard GS as an&#xD;
      important risk factors for dental treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GS involves a complex interaction of facial muscles, bones and skin, specifically, it is&#xD;
      related to the hypermobile upper lip (HUL) by the involved muscles and alterations in&#xD;
      anatomical features such as short clinical dental crown, anterior dentoalveolar extrusion,&#xD;
      maxillary excess and short upper lip. Therapies for GS range from botulinum toxin injections&#xD;
      to surgical interventions according to its etiology. Whereas the outcomes of surgical&#xD;
      procedures are long-lasting, botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) treatment is an easy and fast&#xD;
      outpatient procedure, requiring no downtime and with high efficacy rates. Nevertheless, there&#xD;
      are controversies on the dosage and injection sites of BTX-A, and the efficiency of BTX-A for&#xD;
      GS treatment shows great variation in different studies, with the improvement rate of&#xD;
      gingival exposure (GE) ranging from 62.06% to 98%, Sucupira and Abramovitz advocate the use&#xD;
      of an average amount of BTX-A of 2 U at bilateral levator labii superioris alaeque nasi&#xD;
      muscles(LLSAN) for the treatment of GS, and an average satisfaction level of 9.75 on a&#xD;
      10-point scale was noted in their study. In their article, use of larger dosages and&#xD;
      additional injection sites is discouraged: &quot;Other target muscles described in the literature&#xD;
      do not give any additional benefit to this application and could easily lead to lip ptosis,&#xD;
      inferior lip protrusion, asymmetry, or excessive lengthening of the upper lip.&quot; Polo&#xD;
      disagreed their argument. They believe that dosage and injection sites of BTX-A need to be&#xD;
      individualized according to the degree of severity presented. However, no clinical study&#xD;
      compared and verified their divergence, and the highly personal experience and uncertainty&#xD;
      still limit the use of BTX-A for GS treatment. Some authors are of the opinion that injection&#xD;
      with BTX-A is a safe and cosmetically effective treatment for GS only when performed by&#xD;
      experienced practitioners. Other studies preferred to initiate the treatment with&#xD;
      average-dose BTX-A injection to single sites initially, with retouching at a later stage, as&#xD;
      and when required. Based on the lack of studies at the stage of creating the hypothesis for&#xD;
      this study, the investigators compared the efficiency using the simplified method use of 2U&#xD;
      BTX-A of at bilateral LLSAN and the individualized injection of dosage and injection sites&#xD;
      according to the severity of anterior GS presented in patients, and also to assess safety and&#xD;
      patients' satisfaction with the treatment.&#xD;

    <description>In this method, the patients were administered BTX-A after 8 months when the effect of the previous injection vanished. And A dosage and injection sites were individualized according to the degree of severity of anterior GE presented pretreatment. For mild GS (3 to&lt; 5mm), 2 U BTX-A was injected at bilateral LLSAN. For moderate (5 to &lt; 7mm) and severe GS (≥ 7mm), 3 U and 5 U of BTX-A were injected per side (total, 6 U and 10U). And The injection points located at both LLSAN and the Yonsei point, with half doses at each point.</description>

All the patients underwent twice injection with each methods with no change of the BTX-A(Botox, Allergan, Irvine, CA) and other injection details: Lyophilized 100 U of Botox was reconstituted in 2.5 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution. The injections were made with a 27-gauge insulin syringe. The treatment was an outpatient procedure and all injections were performed by one of the authors (X.G.). No anesthesia was given during the procedure.</description>
