  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apatinib has led to positive responses in the treatment of osteosarcoma refractory to&#xD;
      first-line chemotherapy. However, apatinib demonstrates only short-lived activity, and the&#xD;
      disease control of musculoskeletal lesions is worse than that of pulmonary lesions. This&#xD;
      treatment failure has been partly overcome by the addition of ifosfamide and etoposide (IE).&#xD;
      We have ever retrospectively compared the activity of apatinib + IE in relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      osteosarcoma in two sarcoma centers in China and concluded that for osteosarcoma with&#xD;
      multiple sites of metastasis, apatinib + IE demonstrated clinically meaningful antitumor&#xD;
      activity and delayed disease progression in patients with recurrent or refractory&#xD;
      osteosarcoma after failure of chemotherapy. However to overcome the influence of other&#xD;
      interventions on the outcome, we are currently performing a prospective trial to investigate&#xD;
      this combination, from which more accurate data on this treatment strategy are expected.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  2) initial treatment in the Orthopedic/Oncology Departments of Peking University&#xD;
             People's Hospital or Peking University Shougang Hospital;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3) progression less than 6 months after first-line chemotherapy with a combination of&#xD;
             high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, cisplatin and ifosfamide (first-line&#xD;
             chemotherapy);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4) measurable lesions according to the Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors&#xD;
             (RECIST 1.1) ;&#xD;
