  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the proposed study is to determine if Dexmedetomidine HCl (BXCL501)&#xD;
      is safe for treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD) with comorbid posttraumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD) and also shows potential signals of efficacy thereby supporting the conduct&#xD;
      of later phase clinical trials. Safety endpoints will be compared following an alcohol&#xD;
      challenge without and concurrent with BXCL501 treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BXCL501 is a sublingual film containing dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine is an alpha-2&#xD;
      adrenergic receptor agonist and has higher intrinsic activity and is more potent in vitro&#xD;
      than either clonidine or lofexidine. The drug has a high free brain to free plasma ratio&#xD;
      after dosing in rats that persists after plasma concentrations are cleared. Dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      does not depress respiratory function. It is not predicted to have abuse potential. BXCL501&#xD;
      will bypass 1st pass metabolism and produce fewer problems in participants with compromised&#xD;
      liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This laboratory study is a phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within subjects study.&#xD;
      This study will consist of 3 laboratory test sessions following pretreatment with&#xD;
      BXCL501/placebo for 10 heavy drinker participants with comorbid PTSD. Participants (n=10)&#xD;
      will participate in a laboratory study with 3 test days (minimum of 2 days, but no longer&#xD;
      than 2 weeks between each test session); for each test day they will be assigned to receive&#xD;
      sublingual BXCL501 40µg, 80µg and placebo in a randomized fashion. Test sessions will be&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate stress (PTSD) reactivity and alcohol cue reactivity. Participants will&#xD;
      also receive IV ethanol administered via &quot;clamp methodology&quot; to assess for the effects of&#xD;
      BXCL501 in combination with ethanol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this is the first time BXCL501 is being tested in combination with alcohol&#xD;
      administration, the study team will be using a modified randomization where participants will&#xD;
      not receive the 80µg dose until they have received the 40µg dose.&#xD;

The score range is 1 (marked agitation) to 9 (unarousable), thus higher scores indicate greater sedation. Participants will undergo an alcohol infusion condition on laboratory test days 1, 2, and 3 (where participant receives either BXCL501 40µg, 80µg, or placebo in a randomized fashion each day). For each test day (1-3), the change in ACES score is computed as the difference in measurements taken across the alcohol infusion to the measurement collected immediately prior to the alcohol infusion.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>BXCL501 is a thin film formulation of dexmedetomidine (DEX) for sublingual (SL) administration. The product is a small, solid-dose film formulation, approximately 286 mm2 in area and 0.7 mm thick, designed to solubilize in the SL space within 1-3 minutes. At the time of dosing, subjects will be verbally instructed on how to take the investigational product sublingually, and that they should retain the investigational product in the sublingual cavity until dissolved.</description>

    <description>Study team will be using a modified alcohol-IV clamp procedure developed and standardized by Subramanian and colleagues (Subramanian, Heil et al. 2002). The infusion will be performed using a 6% ethanol solution in 0.9% saline. The computer assisted administration program automatically calculates and corrects the infusion rate based on real-time BrAC data entry by staff, based on the pharmacokinetic profile of each subject (targeting a breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) of 100 mg%).</description>

    <description>Participants will be exposed to two conditions in random order: PTSD cues and neutral cues. The cues will consist of a 5 minute presentation of the stimulus (trauma or neutral) followed by immediate evaluation of craving and anxiety. There will be a relaxation procedure between each condition. The imagery scripts are developed based on the scene construction questionnaire developed by Lang et al (Lang, Kozak et al. 1980, Lang, Levin et al. 1983) using a standardized format designed by Sinha (Sinha 2001).</description>
