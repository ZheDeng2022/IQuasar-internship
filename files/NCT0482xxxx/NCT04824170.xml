      this project was a Quasi-Experimental Trial. conducted to compare the Effects of Neural&#xD;
      Glides Versus Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation in Terms of Joint Position Sense and&#xD;
      Pain in Cervical Radiculopathy . so that we can have best treatment option for patients with&#xD;
      cervical radiculopathy&#xD;

      non probability convenient sampling was done. patients following eligibility criteria from&#xD;
      Madina Teaching Hospital FSD and Kadijatulkubra hospital Chiniot. Non Probability Convenient&#xD;
      sampling was done. Sample size was calculated with G power. 28 Participants were randomly&#xD;
      allocated in two groups equally via convenient sampling method. Baseline assessment was done&#xD;
      initially. Group A was given neural glides and Group B was given PNF along with conventional&#xD;
      physiotherapy treatment (hot pack and traction). Duration of research was almost 6 months.&#xD;
      Intervention was applied for 4 weeks, 3 sessions per week. Pre and Post treatment readings&#xD;
      were taken in 1st and 4th week session Assessment was done via Numeric Pain Rating Scale;&#xD;
      NDI, CVA and JPE as subjective measurements. All participants were provided written informed&#xD;
      consent prior to commencement of the procedures. They were free to quit the treatment at any&#xD;
      stage of research. Data was analyzed by using SPSS version 23.&#xD;

    <description>hot pack and cervical traction is applied for 10-15 min.Group A received Neural mobilization of median nerve which includes gliding and sliding was given,therapist stood on the patient &amp; affected side besides the patient, patient'S shoulder was depressed with one hand and elbow was moved in 90 degree flexion, forearm supination, extend the wrist and fingers with other hand. Then patient arm was moved into 90 degree abduction and then sliding or gliding of nerve was applied. Sliding was applied with elbow extension and wrist flexion and elbow flexion with wrist extension. 6 sets were performed. Each set was performed for 60 seconds, for alternative days in week for 4 weeks and then progressed to gliding/tensioning technique when symptoms improved</description>

    <description>This group was receiving (PNF) Rhythmic stabilization technique with base line treatment.&#xD;
Subject was lying in spine position on the treatment table and therapist resist an isometric contraction of agonist muscle group.pt maintain this position for 10 sec without trying to move and 12-15 repetitions were performed with 30 sec rest. Each therapeutic session treatment was focused on facilitation of neck stabilizers, improving neck stability, coordination, decreasing pain and improving postural control</description>
