  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to test the effectiveness of an experimental drug combination&#xD;
      for people with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Telaglenastat (CB-839)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Talazoparib&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, researching the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      combination of telaglenastat and talazoparib in participants with metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved telaglenastat or the combination&#xD;
      of telaglenastat and talazoparib as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved talazoparib for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
      (mCRPC) but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telaglenastat is a drug designed to stop cancer growth by blocking glutaminase activity.&#xD;
      Glutaminase is an enzyme in the body that is overproduced by some cancers and can fuel cancer&#xD;
      growth. Telaglenastat can lower or block glutaminase and may slow the growth or spread of&#xD;
      some cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Talazoparib is a drug that interferes with the repair activity of proteins called poly&#xD;
      adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerases (PARP), which are found in normal and cancer cells&#xD;
      and are involved in the repair of DNA - the genetic material found in every cell. This&#xD;
      interference may lead to increased amounts of DNA defects and cancer cell death which may&#xD;
      help to slow the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are different points in this study in which participation will start. The first group&#xD;
      of participants will receive the combination of telaglenastat and talazoparib for the&#xD;
      entirety of the study. If telaglenastat plus talazoparib is beneficial to the first group&#xD;
      this will lead to the enrollment of the next group, since telaglenastat as a single drug has&#xD;
      not been evaluated in prostate cancer. The next group will receive telaglenastat alone with&#xD;
      the addition of talazoparib if the disease gets worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
