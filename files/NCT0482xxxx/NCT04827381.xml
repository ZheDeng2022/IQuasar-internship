  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, the investigators will conduct a three-arm patient-randomized pilot trial in&#xD;
      older adults with multimorbidity in ambulatory care settings to determine the feasibility,&#xD;
      usability, and acceptability of an audio-based PHL developed with older adults and&#xD;
      caregivers, HealthPAL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Providing digital recordings of clinical visits to patients has emerged as a new strategy to&#xD;
      promote patient and family engagement in care. With advances in natural language processing,&#xD;
      an opportunity exists to maximize the value of visit recordings for patients by automatically&#xD;
      annotate key visit information (e.g., medications, tests &amp; imaging) with linkages to&#xD;
      trustworthy online resources. These resources can be curated in an audio-based personal&#xD;
      health library (PHL). In this project, the investigators will conduct a three-arm&#xD;
      patient-randomized pilot trial in older adults with multimorbidity in ambulatory care&#xD;
      settings to determine the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of an audio-based PHL&#xD;
      developed with older adults and caregivers, HealthPAL. Participants in the intervention arms&#xD;
      will receive access to an audio-based PHL with either 1) a clinic visit recording where key&#xD;
      information is annotated and hyperlinks to trustworthy health information are provided&#xD;
      (HealthPAL), 2) a clinic visit recording without annotations or hyperlinks, or 3) the third&#xD;
      group of participants will receive usual care (control) with no recordings. Usability metrics&#xD;
      and satisfaction will be assessed at two weeks. Preliminary data on the impact of HealthPAL&#xD;
      on patient ability to seek, find and use health information with high confidence and patient&#xD;
      activation, as well caregiver preparedness will also be gathered.&#xD;
