  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesise that the adaptation of CYP3A5 genotype-based Tacrolimus (FK)&#xD;
      dosing will lead to earlier FK target achievement and consequently, better clinical outcome&#xD;
      after kidney transplantation (RTx).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to shed light on the possible impact of CYP3A genotype-based FK dosing on FK&#xD;
      target achievement and clinical outcome after RTx in a multi-ethnic population where current&#xD;
      evidence is lacking. This data would be helpful to the physicians so that by knowing the&#xD;
      genotype of the patient before undergoing transplantation, practitioners would be able to&#xD;
      decide on the starting dose of FK so as to avoid low trough levels and risk of acute&#xD;
      rejection or high trough levels and risk of nephrotoxicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tacrolimus (FK) remains the cornerstone of maintenance immunosuppressants after renal&#xD;
      transplantation. However, it is characterised by narrow therapeutic index and large&#xD;
      inter-individual variability in its pharmacokinetics, particularly in the dose required to&#xD;
      reach target trough blood concentrations. Among several factors investigated for their&#xD;
      possible influence on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics, polymorphisms in genes coding for&#xD;
      biotransformation enzymes (cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes 3A4 and 3A5) have received much&#xD;
      attention. Exposure to FK correlates with the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and CYP3A5 which are&#xD;
      polymorphically expressed. This is in part explained by the presence of single-nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, renal transplant (RTx) recipients receive standard weight-based dosing of FK and&#xD;
      therapeutic drug monitoring is employed for subsequent dose adjustment to ensure target FK&#xD;
      concentration is attained. However, the current weight-based dosing strategies to guide the&#xD;
      initial FK dosing have been poorly predictive of the actual FK dose required to attain&#xD;
      therapeutic FK level. With the increased possibility of sub-therapeutic FK level during the&#xD;
      early phase post renal transplantation, it puts them at a higher risk of developing acute&#xD;
      rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been increasing evidence to suggest the implementation of pre-transplantation&#xD;
      genotyping to guide the initial FK dose to achieve target FK concentrations as quickly as&#xD;
      possible. On the contrary, there are a few studies that report contradictory results of&#xD;
      genotype-guided FK dosing as being useful in attainment of target therapeutic levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the differences in CYP3A5 genotype prevalence among races and the controversy in&#xD;
      clinical benefits of such a pro-active dosage strategy, the impact of CYP3A5 genotype-guided&#xD;
      dosing on clinical outcome remains to be answered, especially in the local multi-ethnic&#xD;
      population. This pro-active approach may also sound promising for the local multi-ethnic&#xD;
      population where majority of the renal transplant population are CYP3A5 expressers who may&#xD;
      require a higher initial dose of FK based on genotyping profile.&#xD;
