  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A subject of major interest for researchers, clinicians, patients, and payers, is the role of&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in the treatment of these&#xD;
      older patients with AML. With conventional induction chemotherapy or hypomethylating agents,&#xD;
      the expected 2-year overall survival (OS) is less than 25% in patients with intermediate- or&#xD;
      high-risk disease. The 2-year OS ranges from 50 to 56% with allo-HSCT in AML patients older&#xD;
      than 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing an allo-HSCT in older patients is however still controversial because of the&#xD;
      higher risk of non-relapse mortality (15 to 35%) and graft-versus-host disease. Depending on&#xD;
      the center policy, patients older than 65 years will either be contraindicated for transplant&#xD;
      or will receive allo-HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a phase III comparative, randomized, controlled, prospective, multicenter study, the&#xD;
      trial aim to assess prospectively the outcomes and quality of life of older patients with AML&#xD;
      receiving allo-HSCT strategy compared to those receiving a non-transplant approach.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year, 30,000 patients in Europe and 20,000 in the USA are diagnosed with acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML). More than half of them are over 65 years old. In this older population, the&#xD;
      median overall survival (OS) is only 2 to 8 months. With conventional induction chemotherapy&#xD;
      or hypomethylating agents, the expected 2-year OS is less than 25% in patients with&#xD;
      intermediate- or high-risk disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing an allo-HSCT in older patients is however still controversial because of the&#xD;
      higher risk of non-relapse mortality (15 to 35%) and graft-versus-host disease. Depending on&#xD;
      the center policy, patients older than 65 years will either be contraindicated for transplant&#xD;
      or will receive allo-HSCT. Noteworthy, no prospective randomized trial has yet compared&#xD;
      allo-HSCT to a non-transplant strategy in older patients with AML. A previous attempt made 10&#xD;
      years ago, by the EBMT to run a slightly similar trial, has failed in France and most&#xD;
      European countries, mainly (i) because it mandated the type of transplant procedure to be&#xD;
      applied and (ii) because of the absence of novel and effective drugs.&#xD;

&#xD;
      New targeted therapies and treatment strategies are evolving rapidly. A standardized unique&#xD;
      treatment administrated to all sub-types of AML is no longer the optimal approach for&#xD;
      induction and non-transplant maintenance strategies. No treatment has reached consensus for&#xD;
      older patients. For these reasons, this trial will not limit the choices of drugs&#xD;
      administered to the patients but compare two strategies allowing patients to receive the best&#xD;
      available standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial aim to assess prospectively the outcomes and quality of life of older patients with&#xD;
      AML receiving allo-HSCT strategy compared to those receiving a non-transplant approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive initial treatment with chemotherapy (or other appropriate&#xD;
      non-palliative therapy). Once first complete remission is achieved and a donor is identified,&#xD;
      patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) after inclusion to receive one of the following&#xD;
      strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation arm: patients will undergo allo-HSCT&#xD;
           after consolidation therapy (or completion of other appropriate non-palliative strategy)&#xD;
           according to standard procedures of the transplant center (choice of donor, conditioning&#xD;
           regimen, GVHD and infection prophylaxis). The use of novel therapies (such as sorafenib,&#xD;
           midaustorine, venetoclax, etc.) will be allowed as post-transplantation maintenance&#xD;
           strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-transplant arm: patients will be treated according to the standard procedures of the&#xD;
           treating center for this type of population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive the best available treatments (including additional conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapy or other non-palliative therapies such as 5-azacytidine, decitabine, venetoclax,&#xD;
      midaustorine, enasidenib, etc.). Supportive care will be performed according to each&#xD;
      participating center usual practice.&#xD;
