      There is wide evidence regarding the weak points of end-stage Chronic kidney disease (CKD)&#xD;
      patients in hemodialysis, and they include three intervention aspects: exercise, nutrition&#xD;
      and psychological support. Evidence shows that exercise for patients in hemodialysis results&#xD;
      in increased survival rate, functional capacity, strength and health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, different studies have shown the benefits of psychological interventions and&#xD;
      the positive effect of educational programs on nutritional care for patients in hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the well-known benefits of exercise, this kind of programs are not being implemented&#xD;
      in the routine clinical care of hemodialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the GoodRENal project aims to promote healthy lifestyles among dialysis patients in a&#xD;
      holistic approach that combines exercise, nutrition and psychological wellbeing plus&#xD;
      cognitive functioning addressing adult learners. The project will, in phase 1, explore&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators of patients, carers and health professionals towards healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle (physical activity, nutrition and psychological well being). In phase 2, the&#xD;
      project will develop a health virtual platform including these three dimensions of cares. In&#xD;
      summary, the project outputs will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A didactic content in a modular platform to create an educational program for integrated&#xD;
           treatments in patients with dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A guideline to promote healthy lifestyles among dialysis patients for health care&#xD;
           providers&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A guideline to promote e healthy lifestyles among dialysis patients for patients and&#xD;
           formal - nonformal carers&#xD;

    <textblock>
      CKD stage 5D, has a high incidence, 100-200 people per million, and high prevalence, 750-1500&#xD;
      per million. More than 40-50% are above 65 years old, with a lower rate in women but with&#xD;
      higher frailty than men. This cohort presents high comorbidity, malnutrition, sedentary&#xD;
      behavior, low health-related quality of life, frailty and high dependency levels. Mortality&#xD;
      risk is close to 15% per year. Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death in end-stage&#xD;
      CKD. It is also a high risk factor for peripheral artery disease and lower limbs amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supporting this cohort results in high direct and indirect costs. Additionally, these&#xD;
      patients present high anxiety and depression rates. Comorbidity between depression and&#xD;
      somatic illness leads to a significant increase of the illness load since there is higher&#xD;
      symptomatology, higher morbidity, higher health costs, and worse functioning and quality of&#xD;
      life. Current evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between depression and medical&#xD;
      illness. Mechanisms suggested explaining this complex relationship would include both&#xD;
      biological and behavioral aspects. Depression is also associated with the worst adherence to&#xD;
      treatment of comorbid patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is wide evidence regarding the weak points of end-stage CKD patients in hemodialysis,&#xD;
      and they include three intervention aspects: exercise, nutrition and psychological support.&#xD;
      Evidence shows that exercise for patients in hemodialysis results in increased survival rate,&#xD;
      functional capacity, strength, and health-related quality of life. Additionally, different&#xD;
      studies have shown the benefits of psychological interventions and the positive effect of&#xD;
      educational programs on nutritional care for patients in hemodialysis. Several combined&#xD;
      interventions have been implemented leading to heterogeneous results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the well-known benefits of exercise, this kind of programs are not being implemented&#xD;
      in the routine clinical care of hemodialysis patients. Patients' lack of interest regarding&#xD;
      participation in exercise programs, time constraints, and lack of knowledge by health&#xD;
      professionals at the hemodialysis units, are some of the factors underpinning the low&#xD;
      implementation rate of intradialysis exercise programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality (VR) refers to computer-generated interactive simulation that offers users&#xD;
      the opportunity to participate in environments that look like objects and events of the real&#xD;
      world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VR exercise has been successfully implemented in neuro-rehabilitation, resulting in better&#xD;
      balance, gait, and mobility in cerebrovascular accidents, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barre&#xD;
      syndrome, and Parkinson's disease. Few studies have explored the impact of VR exercise in&#xD;
      renal rehabilitation. Three of the partners (Universidad Cardenal Herrera-CEU, Universitat&#xD;
      Politècnica de Valéncia, and Hospital de Manises) have implemented two randomized trials of&#xD;
      non-immersive VR exercise intradialysis. Currently, those partners are developing a third&#xD;
      trial with this technology and they have verified that this type of exercise has good&#xD;
      tolerance and high adherence rates. Additionally, it has a positive impact on strength,&#xD;
      functional capacity, physical activity level, and health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, the most traditional way to assess and implement psychological and&#xD;
      psycho-educative treatments has been 'face to face'. Nevertheless, more than 50% of people&#xD;
      suffering from depression are not being treated appropriately. This is why alternative&#xD;
      treatment models to assess and treat are being implemented, and technology (as the internet)&#xD;
      is an option to increase the number of patients that can be treated. Additionally, few&#xD;
      studies have explored technology as a means to educate renal patients regarding nutrition or&#xD;
      psychological health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the hypothesis of the present study is that a health virtual platform designed for&#xD;
      holistic treatment of patients undertaking hemodialysis will result in health benefits for&#xD;
      this cohort, regarding physical activity, nutritional and psychological health. The platform&#xD;
      will be designed according to the aims highlighted by experts, barriers, and needs of&#xD;
      end-stage CKD patients and their caregivers. As mentioned above, end-stage chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease patients have high comorbidity, malnutrition, sedentarism, low health-related quality&#xD;
      of life, low physical function, frailty, and high dependency levels. So they rely on&#xD;
      non-formal caregivers for their activities of daily living. This cohort presents high anxiety&#xD;
      and depression levels and the combination of somatic disease plus depression results in&#xD;
      higher symptoms, higher comorbidity, higher health resources, and worst quality of life.&#xD;
      Besides, there is a bidirectional relationship between depression and disease, and depression&#xD;
      is associated with lower adherence to medical treatment.&#xD;
