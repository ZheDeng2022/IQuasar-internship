    <textblock>
      Recovering blood flow to a coronary stenosis may improve left ventricular (LV) function in&#xD;
      patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the reported data about evaluation of&#xD;
      LV function post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in CAD was limited. The aim of this&#xD;
      study was to compare the LV function measured by 3 min low dose exercise stress&#xD;
      echocardiography (ESE) combined 2D speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) in patients with&#xD;
      CAD underwent PCI, and to identify factors affecting the change of LV function. Patients with&#xD;
      CAD who underwent acute PCI were enrolled.&#xD;

      The assessment of temporal changes in systolic and diastolic regional left ventricle function&#xD;
      by 2D-STE after successful reperfusion therapy of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).The&#xD;
      estimated total number of participants is 90 patients with AMI and treated with successful&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention were included in this study. The echocardiographic&#xD;
      measurements were performed in all patients within in-hotpital after PCI procedure, and then&#xD;
      followed up at 7, 14, 30, 60 and 180 days after discharge. Recovery of regional systolic and&#xD;
