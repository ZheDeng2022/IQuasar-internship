  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improving healthy physiological processes through nutritional intervention, as opposed to&#xD;
      restoring physiology after disease occurrence, is an important new avenue for the reduction&#xD;
      of disease burden in the population. A relatively new target for interventions is the gut&#xD;
      microbiome. Dietary fibre is a nutritional intervention shown to alter gut microbiome and&#xD;
      function. The present study aims to elucidate the relationship between microbiome modulation&#xD;
      with dietary fibre and health. In order to assess health improvement, a meal challenge will&#xD;
      be given to characterize the physiological processes and their resilience to challenge in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers before and after microbiome modulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gut microbiome has been extensively implicated as an organ involved in various&#xD;
      physiological processes such as nutrient and drug metabolism, microbial protection and&#xD;
      immunomodulation. The gut microbiome educates the host immune system, promotes homeostasis&#xD;
      and protects against systemic inflammation, among other things through production of&#xD;
      short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). An altered microbiome is also involved in inducing low-grade&#xD;
      systemic inflammation by translocation of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through the&#xD;
      intestinal lining. Additionally, the gut microbiome produces trimethylamine (TMA), which when&#xD;
      oxidized to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is documented as an indicator of endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction and cardiovascular health risk. The goal of the present study is to further&#xD;
      clarify the relationship between the gut microbiome, homeostasis, immunity and health. This&#xD;
      will be achieved by introducing an intervention known to alter gut microbiome&#xD;
      characteristics, dietary fibre, and measuring its effect on the gut microbiome on the one&#xD;
      hand and the response to metabolic challenge on the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibre mixtures consisting of indigestible carbohydrates have been shown to alter the&#xD;
      composition and function of the gut microbiome. Fibre functions as a substrate for&#xD;
      fermentation, creating SCFAs, and as a food source for bacterial commensals regarded as&#xD;
      beneficial. Thus, fibre can shift the balance of microbial species in the gut towards&#xD;
      beneficial commensals and away from potential pathogens. Moreover, these changes in&#xD;
      composition and function of the microbiome can feasibly affect integrity of intestinal&#xD;
      lining, TMA production and various other processes, therefore exerting an effect on low-grade&#xD;
      inflammation, cardiovascular and metabolic health. The gut microbiome can be analysed using&#xD;
      16s RNA sequencing, quantifying the relative abundance of various bacterial species, and by&#xD;
      measuring SCFAs in human plasma, quantifying their production by bacteria in the gut. In this&#xD;
      study, we will integrate a third method to measure the gut microbiome. The I-screen,&#xD;
      developed by TNO, is a platform in which the in vivo microbiome composition can be mimicked&#xD;
      in an in vitro system, allowing for experimental analysis of the effects of compounds and&#xD;
      ingredients on the microbiome. With this method, the processes and conditions affecting&#xD;
      microbiome composition can be assessed more closely, possibly clarifying specific&#xD;
      relationships between intervention and microbiome composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to assess the effects of this microbiome modulation by evaluating the&#xD;
      response to a metabolic challenge, quantified through measurement of a metabolic and&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarker panel to create a composite outcome called 'resilience'. This&#xD;
      phenotypical flexibility test (PhenFlex, PFT), consisting of a mixed meal with protein, fat&#xD;
      and glucose, induces a systemic response which when analysed allows for sensitive assessment&#xD;
      of subtle health benefits in otherwise healthy subjects. Results of the PFT are presented as&#xD;
      a composite of multiple biomarkers grouped by physiological processes such as inflammation&#xD;
      and liver metabolism, creating the 'axes' of a 'health space'. Earlier research shows that&#xD;
      selected dietary products affected inflammatory processes, oxidative stress and metabolism,&#xD;
      based on dynamic responses after fat load. Other research has shown that the challenge test&#xD;
      concept is able to reveal previously unidentified correlations between specific nutrients and&#xD;
      health-related processes, and that decreased phenotypic flexibility as measured by PFT can be&#xD;
      used to identify people that might benefit from health interventions. Finally, in a human&#xD;
      volunteer study with whole grain wheat products researchers were able to show a positive&#xD;
      effect on diverse composite markers of resilience, including low grade inflammation, after 12&#xD;
      weeks of exchange of refined wheat for whole grain wheat consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By measuring the effect of our intervention on the gut microbiome with several tools, as well&#xD;
      as using the challenge concept for quantifying health, this study is well positioned to&#xD;
      provide insight in the specific mechanisms of interaction between microbiome and host, as&#xD;
      well as create new evidence-based avenues for the improvement of health.&#xD;
