      Purpose: We aimed to introduce a new modified suture bridge technique and report the clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and radiological assessments of modified suture bridge technique for medium rotator&#xD;
      cuff tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We prospectively followed 50 consecutive patients with medium rotator cuff tears&#xD;
      treated with the modified suture bridge (MSB) or traditional suture bridge technique (TSB)&#xD;
      from December 2018 and December 2019. On the basis of preoperative findings and MRI&#xD;
      performance, 26 patients underwent MSB repair whereas 24 underwent TSB repair. Range of&#xD;
      shoulder motion, visual analog scale score (VAS score), University of California-Los Angeles&#xD;
      score (UCLA score), Constant-Murley shoulder score (Constant score), American Shoulder and&#xD;
      Elbow Surgeons score (ASES score) were assessed. Magnetic resonance imaging were performed&#xD;
      preoperatively and at 12 months postoperatively.&#xD;

    <time_frame>at 12 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Grade I: sufficient thickness of tendon; Grade II: sufficient thickness of tendon and partial high intensity within tendon; Grade III: insufficient thickness of tendon without discontinuity; Grade IV: slight discontinuity in 1 or 2 images of oblique coronal plane and sagittal plane; Grade V:obvious discontinuity of tendons in more than 2 images of both oblique coronal plane and sagittal plane.</description>

    <measure>Muscle atrophy grade of MRI assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>at 12 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Grade I: a ratio between 1.00 and 0.60 can be considered as normal or slightly atrophied; Grade II: values between 0.60 and 0.40 suggest moderate atrophy. Grade III: values below 0.40 indicate serious or severe atrophy.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatty degeneration grade of MRI assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>at 12 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Grade 0: completely normal muscle; Grade 1: muscle contains some fatty streaks; Grade 2: there is more muscle than fat; Grade 3: equal distribution of fat and muscle; grade 4: more fat was present than muscle. Among them, grade 0 is normal, grade 1 and 2 are considered moderate, grade 3 and 4 are classified as severe.</description>
