    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia in patients&#xD;
      hospitalized in the follow-up care and rehabilitation units of the geriatrics department of&#xD;
      the Mulhouse French hospital.&#xD;

      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the performance of the SARC-F questionnaire to screen for sarcopenia ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the characteristics of sarcopenic patients hospitalized in each follow-up&#xD;
           care and rehabilitation unit (i.e. day hospital, full hospitalization);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify predictive factors of sarcopenia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine, in the subgroup of patients hospitalized in the conventional follow-up&#xD;
           care and rehabilitation unit (i.e. full hospitalization), the evolution of sarcopenia&#xD;
           between admission and discharge of the following variables :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. muscle strength,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. muscle mass,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. functional ability,&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. dependency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct of research&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving the written consent of the study participant, all of the following tests and&#xD;
      questionnaires will be performed :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SARC-F questionnaire,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measurement of muscle strengh by a grip test,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measurement of muscle mass by impedancemetry (ASM/size2),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4-meter walking speed test,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Timed-Up and Go (TUG) test,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ADL (Activities of Daily Living) and IADL (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living)&#xD;
           questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in day hospital care, the study will end upon completion of these tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients hospitalized in the conventional follow-up care and rehabilitation unit (i.e.&#xD;
      full hospitalization), a follow-up visit will be scheduled within 72 hours prior to the&#xD;
      patient's discharge from the service, or at 3 months of hospitalization. The following tests&#xD;
      and questionnaires will be performed during this visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measurement of muscle strengh by a grip test,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measurement of muscle mass by impedancemetry,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4-meter walking speed test,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Timed Up and Go (TUG) test,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ADL and IADL questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>The diagnosis of sarcopenia will be established according to the 2018 criteria of the European Working Group On Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2) based on the evaluation of muscle strength and muscle mass. Sarcopenia will be defined by an abnormal value measured by a grip test and confirmed by an abnormal value of the ASM/size2 ratio measured by impedancemetry.</description>
