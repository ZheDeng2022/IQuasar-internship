    <intervention_model_description>This study had two components. One component evaluated the effect of food and the effect of swallowing capsule whole versus sprinkling on apple sauce on the PK/bioavailability of palovarotene, and the other component evaluated the effect of palovarotene on the PK of the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam. The PK of palovarotene after single and multiple doses was also evaluated as part of the DDI component. Two cohorts of healthy adult subjects were enrolled, one for each component.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>On the morning of Day 1, subjects received a single dose of midazolam 30 minutes after the start of a standardized breakfast.

A second dose of midazolam was administered on Day 15 in the morning (immediately following the palovarotene dose) 30 minutes after the start of a standardized breakfast.</description>
