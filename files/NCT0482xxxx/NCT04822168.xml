  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid overdoses are a significant problem nationwide and novel interventions that can&#xD;
      prevent overdose by improving Buprenorphine/ Naloxone (B/N) treatment for opioid use disorder&#xD;
      are a public health priority. This study will both investigate the effects of starting remote&#xD;
      motivational enhancement during inpatient detoxification on rates of engagement in B/N&#xD;
      treatment and evaluate the impact of MySafeRx, a mobile device application which integrates&#xD;
      remote motivational coaching with daily observed dosing from secure electronic pill&#xD;
      dispensers at home via videoconference, on treatment retention and overdose prevention. Broad&#xD;
      dissemination of this new intervention could help communities across the nation expand and&#xD;
      advance their capacity to increase B/N treatment engagement and retention, enhance medication&#xD;
      adherence, and prevent overdose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate an&#xD;
      innovative strategy among opioid use disorder patients being discharged from detox. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate the extent to which remote motivational enhancement sessions via&#xD;
      videoconference and the option for flexible daily dosing at home with MySafeRx can improve&#xD;
      engagement and retention with B/N treatment after detox in a county where access to&#xD;
      outpatient, take-home B/N prescriptions are more limited compared to in-person daily B/N&#xD;
      dosing and treatment. This study seeks to expand our understanding about what works to&#xD;
      prevent opioid overdose by incorporating a RCT evaluating the effects of remote motivational&#xD;
      enhancement (RME) sessions provided via videoconferencing at an inpatient detox facility and&#xD;
      during early treatment in order to increase treatment engagement with daily outpatient&#xD;
      supervised-dosing of B/N. Participants will use an Android smartphone device to access the&#xD;
      MySafeRx app and complete their daily motivational interview sessions. This study will&#xD;
      generate new knowledge about the most effective way to prevent overdose and engage patients&#xD;
      in B/N treatment with observed daily dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Engagement: To examine the effect of Remote Motivational Enhancement (RME) sessions +&#xD;
      MySafeRx Inspire Flex versus information alone + ACTS Standard Care on early engagement in&#xD;
      outpatient B/N treatment based on the number of daily doses of prescribed B/N during the&#xD;
      first 5 weeks post-detox.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Participants enrolled in RME + MySafeRx Inspire Flex arm will be engaged in&#xD;
      outpatient B/N treatment with significantly higher number of daily doses of prescribed B/N&#xD;
      during the first 5 weeks post-detox than the information alone arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early Engagement: To examine the effect of RME + MySafeRx Inspire Flex versus information&#xD;
      alone + ACTS Standard Care B/N treatment on early engagement in B/N treatment based on the&#xD;
      proportion of participants a) who receive at least one outpatient B/N dose in first 7 days&#xD;
      and b) who receive at least one outpatient B/N prescription at ACTS in the first 14 days post&#xD;
      discharge from detox.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioid-Related Deaths: To examine the effects of RME + MySafeRx Inspire Flex versus&#xD;
      information + ACTS Standard Care B/N on number of opioid-related deaths (as measured by&#xD;
      county coroner report and clinic report) during the 6-months after discharge from inpatient&#xD;
      detox.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioid Use (toxicology): To examine the differences in opioid use as measured by monthly&#xD;
      urine toxicology for illicit opioids between MySafeRx Inspire Flex and information alone +&#xD;
      ACTS Standard Care B/N treatment during a 24-week study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Pre-Specified Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overdoses: To examine the effect of RME + MySafeRx Inspire Flex versus information + ACTS&#xD;
      Standard Care B/N treatment on the number of self-reported (with and without naloxone&#xD;
      administered), county coroner reported, and clinic-reported opioid overdoses, throughout the&#xD;
      24 weeks of the study follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioid Use (self-report): To examine the differences in self-reported illicit opioid use&#xD;
      between MySafeRx Inspire Flex information alone + ACTS Standard Care B/N treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Retention: To examine the effect of RME + MySafeRx Inspire Flex versus information&#xD;
      alone + ACTS Standard Care on retention in B/N treatment based on active B/N prescription at&#xD;
      12 and 24-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental Health Symptoms: To examine the differences in mental health symptomatology using the&#xD;
      BSI between MySafeRx Inspire Flex versus information alone + ACTS Standard Care B/N treatment&#xD;
      during the 24-week study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the current proposal, the investigators plan to recruit up to 120 B/N eligible patients&#xD;
      during the high-risk period of transition out of detox into outpatient B/N treatment in order&#xD;
      to be able to randomize 104 participants. Study participants will be recruited from the&#xD;
      outpatient detox program at ACTS in Tampa, Florida. The investigators aim to recruit 2&#xD;
      patients a week for the study and randomize, on average, one patient to the MySafeRx program&#xD;
      each week. Study participants will participate in a baseline assessment and six follow-up&#xD;
      assessments at week 4, week 8, week 12, week 16, week 20, and week 24. These assessments will&#xD;
      be conducted by the project coordinator and will occur via phone or at the ACTS facility&#xD;
      (baseline assessment will always occur at ACTS detox prior to discharge). To protect the&#xD;
      privacy of this information, the assessments will be identified only by a code number linked&#xD;
      to study participants with a key that is only accessible to the data analyst. Study&#xD;
      assessments will take approximately one and a half hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participant has consented, completed the baseline assessment, and a PI or Co-I has&#xD;
      approved them to participate, they will be randomized to either MySafeRx or Standard Care.&#xD;
      Given the study population, the investigators assume there will be some loss of participants&#xD;
      at follow-up. The investigators have planned for this in the assessment of appropriate sample&#xD;
      size, as well as in the data analysis procedures.&#xD;
