    <textblock>
      The introduction of modern staging systems has increased the detection of small peripheral&#xD;
      lung cancers at an early stage [1]. Stage I non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are confined&#xD;
      to the lung without lymph node involvement, and surgical resection is currently considered&#xD;
      the standard therapeutic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nodal staging is initially performed non-invasively with computer tomography (CT) and&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) scans followed by minimally invasive staging with&#xD;
      endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) when CT and/or&#xD;
      PET are suggestive of mediastinal nodal involvement. Lobectomy with radical lymphadenectomy&#xD;
      is currently considered the treatment of choice for early-stage lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies demonstrated that primary invasive non- small-cell lung carcinomas &gt; 2.0 cm&#xD;
      were twice as likely to have nodal metastases as carcinomas ≤ 2.0 cm, emphasizing that small&#xD;
      lung cancers had less lymph node involvement and confirming a better survival. In our pilot&#xD;
      study [18] published in 2011 in the European Journal of Thoracic Surgery, no nodal&#xD;
      involvement was observed in any of the 62 patients with pulmonary nodule size less than 10&#xD;
      mm, in 20 out of 120 patients (17%) with nodule size 11-20 mm, and in 9 out of 37 tumors&#xD;
      (24%) 21-30 mm in size (p = 0.0007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients could be spared radical lymph node dissection if deemed not essential, thereby&#xD;
      reducing operative risks, postoperative morbidity, and surgery time. A preoperative&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE The introduction of modern staging systems such as computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)&#xD;
      has increased the detection of small peripheral lung cancers at an early stage [1]. Stage I&#xD;
      non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are confined to the lung without lymph node involvement,&#xD;
      and surgical resection is currently considered the standard therapeutic approach. Lobectomy&#xD;
      with radical lymphadenectomy is currently considered the treatment of choice for early-stage&#xD;
      lung cancer, irrespective of tumor size or its metabolic features on PET. However, the new&#xD;
      TNM classification recently demonstrated that very small lung cancers may be less aggressive&#xD;
      than others [2], suggesting a less aggressive surgical approach to reduce morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the new TNM classification (8th edition), the overall 5-year survival rate for&#xD;
      pathological stage IA NSCLC was 85%, ranging from 80% to 90% for T1a and T1c tumors&#xD;
      respectively, compared with 64% for stage IB tumors [2]. Among patients with stage I cancer,&#xD;
      tumor size may affect outcome and drive survival, as confirmed by different studies [7-12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies demonstrated that primary invasive non- small-cell lung carcinomas &gt; 2.0 cm&#xD;
      were twice as likely to have nodal metastases as carcinomas ≤ 2.0 cm, emphasizing that small&#xD;
      lung cancers had less lymph node involvement, and confirming a better survival [11-15]. Based&#xD;
      on that, Ishida et al. and then Konaka et al. have already demonstrated the absence of lymph&#xD;
      node involvement in sub-centimeter lung cancers and the feasibility to omit lymph node&#xD;
      dissection in those cases [15,16]. However, Zhoua et al. recommended systematic nodal&#xD;
      dissection in the presence of sub-centimeter disease, finding nodal metastases in 15% of&#xD;
      NSCLC &lt; 1 cm, but also including higher tumor stages such as stage II and III in their study&#xD;
      without performing PET scan as part of the preoperative staging [17]. In our pilot study [18]&#xD;
      published in 2011 in the European Journal of Thoracic Surgery, no nodal involvement was&#xD;
      observed in any of the 62 patients with pulmonary nodule size less than 10 mm, in 20 out of&#xD;
      120 patients (17%) with nodule size 11-20 mm, and in 9 out of 37 tumors (24%) 21-30 mm in&#xD;
      size (p = 0.0007). All 55 patients with nodule SUV &lt; 2.0 and all 26 non-solid lesions were&#xD;
      pN0 (respectively, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.03). So we adopted cut-offs of 10 mm for nodule&#xD;
      diameter and 2.0 as peak SUV to distinguish patients with nodal involvement from those&#xD;
      without.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients could be spared radical lymph node dissection if deemed not essential, thereby&#xD;
      reducing operative risks, postoperative morbidity, and surgery time. A preoperative&#xD;
      diagnostic determination to establish the size and correct staging of the tumor is mandatory&#xD;
      for appropriate selection of candidates, avoiding unnecessary surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data have demonstrated that positron emission tomography (PET-FDG) is a reliable tool versus&#xD;
      CT in evaluating both solitary pulmonary nodules and lymph node involvement [3]. Standard&#xD;
      nodal staging is initially performed non-invasively with PET followed by minimally invasive&#xD;
      staging with endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA)&#xD;
      when PET is suggestive of mediastinal nodal involvement. In fact, EBUS-TBNA is a minimally&#xD;
      invasive procedure with a high yield for lymph node staging of lung cancer [4]. EBUS-TBNA&#xD;
      allows access to the paratracheal lymph node stations (levels 2R, 2L, 4R, 4L), the subcarinal&#xD;
      lymph node (level 7), hilar, interlobar, and lobar lymph nodes (levels 10, 11, and 12).&#xD;
      Previous studies, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and more recently Yasufuku&#xD;
      et al. have demonstrated a major impact of EBUS-TBNA on management of patients with non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with a diagnostic yield comparable to mediastinoscopy [5,6]. Annema&#xD;
      et al. have recently confirmed that the sensitivity of endosonography is similar to that of&#xD;
      mediastinoscopy (85% vs 79%, respectively), and associated with a lower complication rate (1%&#xD;
      vs 6% for mediastinoscopy), so concluding that endosonography should be the first step for&#xD;
      mediastinal nodal staging [19].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients without evidence of mediastinal nodal metastasis on PET and CT, the need for&#xD;
      EBUS-TBNA becomes less clear. The most recent American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP)&#xD;
      evidence-based guidelines recommend minimally invasive mediastinal staging with a needle&#xD;
      technique in patients with a central tumor or nodal hilar disease (N1) on PET/CT. This is&#xD;
      based on the increased prevalence of N2 disease in this group, but this is a grade 1C&#xD;
      recommendation, that is based on low quality evidence. In patients with peripheral tumors and&#xD;
      no evidence of mediastinal or hilar nodal disease on PET/CT, invasive staging is not&#xD;
      recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerns have been raised regarding these recommendations given that the prevalence of occult&#xD;
      nodal metastasis in patients with N0 disease by PET/CT appears to be higher than previously&#xD;
      reported, with recent studies showing values as high as 17-22% [20,21]. EBUS-TBNA may provide&#xD;
      an attractive option to increase staging accuracy. However, sensitivity of EBUS-TBNA in&#xD;
      patients with clinical N0/N1 disease on PET/CT is unclear and largely based on retrospective&#xD;
      studies [22,23]. The only prospective study published by Leong et al. [24] demonstrated that&#xD;
      a significant proportion of patients with N0/N1 disease by PET/CT had N2 disease (20%) and&#xD;
      EBUS-TBNA was able to identify a substantial fraction of these patients, thus improving&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy compared with PET/CT alone. Sensitivity of EBUS-TBNA however appears&#xD;
      lower compared with historical data from patients with larger volume mediastinal disease&#xD;
      [5,6,26].&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In selected series the overall sensitivity of EBUS varies from 80-90% (88%) but for&#xD;
           clinical N0/N1 drops to 40-49%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About 24% of patients with early stage lung cancer &gt; 2 cm and less than 5 cm (T1b,c and&#xD;
           T2a,b N0 PET-) would be N+ , whereas none of the T1a (less or equal than 1 cm) NSCLC&#xD;
           would be upstaged considering the absence of N+ [19].&#xD;
&#xD;
      From reference 19 pT size ALL pN+ &lt;10 mm 62 0 ( 0%) 11-20 mm 120 20 (17%) &gt;20 mm 37 9 (24%)&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. OVERALL DESIGN AND PLAN OF TRIAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1 Design of the study All patients clinical stage I and II will be undergone EBUS-TBNA for&#xD;
      the staging of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be undergoing robotic (RATS) or videothoracoscopic (VATS) lobectomy plus&#xD;
      radical lymph node dissection following the Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS) guideline. All&#xD;
      lymph nodes previously sampled with EBUS-TBNA will be compared with those harvested during&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Observed (Surgery) pN- pN+ Predicted EBUS Negative TN FN UPSTAGING =&#xD;
      (FN+TP)/total patients Positive FP TP SENSITIVITY is defined as the ration of TP/ (TP+FN) A&#xD;
      sample size of 12 upstaged patients will achieve 80% power to detect a difference of&#xD;
      sensitivity &gt;38.4% assuming that the sensitivity under the null hypothesis is 49% (results of&#xD;
      the meta-analysis by Leong et al, 2018 [22]), and that the actual sensitivity is &gt;88% (95.6%&#xD;
      in the study by Guarize et al, 2018 [25]) using a two-sided binomial test.&#xD;

      (15/75) 40% (6/15)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming that the proportion of patients with pathological pN+ (upstaging) is 24%, a total&#xD;
      sample of 50 patients will be necessary to be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hypothesis will be rejected if 2 or more FN are observed among the 12 upstaged patients.&#xD;
