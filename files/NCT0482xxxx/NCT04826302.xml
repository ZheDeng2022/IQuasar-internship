  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of a myofascial intervention as a technique within manual&#xD;
      therapy in the treatment of clinical anxiety in adults. Half of the participants will receive&#xD;
      a myofascial intervention program, while the other half will receive a sham myofascial&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within physiotherapy, some studies have been carried out with psychological outcome measures,&#xD;
      mainly from therapeutic exercise, but there continues to be an important documentary gap and&#xD;
      the few results are not conclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The myofascial approach is presented as an effective tool for the treatment of different&#xD;
      pathologies, mainly musculoskeletal. However, few are the studies that relate it to&#xD;
      psychological variables and specifically to improve anxiety levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The myofascial approach is proposed as a fast and low-cost tool for the management of&#xD;
      clinical anxiety.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A randomized double blind clinical trial controlled with placebo in which neither the participants assigned to the groups nor the evaluators who measure the variables know to which group the subjects belong.&#xD;
To be part of the study, participants must obtain high scores in anxiety (STAI questionnaire).&#xD;
The calculation estimates a sample of 36 participants: 18 for the experimental group and 18 for the placebo group.&#xD;
Participants will be randomly assigned to the experimental group or the placebo group.&#xD;
In addition to anxiety levels before and after treatment, variables such as chronic pain, central sensitization, general health, somatization and depression will be measured.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline (pre-treatment), immediately after myofascial intervention (intrasession), through study completion (an average of 1 month), 3 and 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of a self-report to evaluate two independent concepts about anxiety: anxiety as a state (&quot;in this moment&quot;) and anxiety as a trait (&quot;in most cases&quot;). Each of these subscales has a total of 20 items in a 4-point Likert response system according to intensity (0 = not at all; 3 = a lot). The total score in each of the subscales ranges from 0 to 60 points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline (pre-treatment), immediately after myofascial intervention (intrasession), through study completion (an average of 1 month), 3 and 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of a horizontal line of 10 centimeters, at the ends of which appear &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;maximum pain&quot;. Patients mark where they would locate their intensity of chronic pain and later it is measured with a ruler indicating its result in millimeters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline (pre-treatment), through study completion (an average of 1 month), 3 and 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report to identify symptoms related to a central sensitization. It consists of a total of 25 items in a 5-point response system according to intensity (0 = never; 4 = always). The total score ranges from 0 to 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline (pre-treatment), through study completion (an average of 1 month), 3 and 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire to evaluate general health. It consists of a total of 12 items (6 of them positive sentences and 6 negative sentences) in a 4-point response system according to intensity (0-3). The total score ranges from 0 to 36.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline (pre-treatment), through study completion (an average of 1 month), 3 and 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire to evaluate somatic symptoms. It consists of a total of 15 items in a 2-point response system according to intensity (0 = not at all; 2 = a lot). The total score ranges from 0 to 30.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline (pre-treatment), through study completion (an average of 1 month), 3 and 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report to evaluate depressive symptoms. It consists of a total of 21 items in a 3-point response system according to intensity (0 = not at all; 3 = a lot). The total score ranges from 0 to 63.</description>
