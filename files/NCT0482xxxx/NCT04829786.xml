             or more. Body mass index was calculated as follows: weight (kg)/height2 (m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject had a resting (at least 5 minutes) sitting pulse of greater than 45 but&#xD;
             less than 100 beats per minute (BPM) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) of&#xD;
             less than 140/90 mmHg&#xD;

             a maximum smoking history of 5-pack years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject was in good general health as determined by medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, 12-lead ECG, vital signs, and clinical laboratory results obtained within&#xD;
             28 days prior to the start of the study.&#xD;

             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The subject had been exposed to any investigational drug within 30 days or six&#xD;
             half-lives (whichever is greater) of the screening visit.&#xD;
