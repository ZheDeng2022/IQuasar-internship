  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The menstrual cycle is one of the most important signs of a functioning reproductive system&#xD;
      in women, but sometimes this cycle is associated with signs and symptoms that cause physical&#xD;
      and psychological problems for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the high prevalence of PMS among women and the complications of this syndrome on&#xD;
      work performance, social and interpersonal relationships and family, and its role in limiting&#xD;
      education, social and economic progress in society, 8 weeks of online yoga exercises given&#xD;
      online to female students were helpful in reducing PMS symptoms The aim was to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and effect on inflammation parameters. The study was planned as an interventional,&#xD;
      single-blind, randomized controlled study. The sample size of this study was calculated based&#xD;
      on the latest research available on the effect of exercise on PMS (Kamalifard et al.2017). A&#xD;
      power analysis was performed in student PMS scores between exercise and control groups and to&#xD;
      expect a difference of 80% strength and α = 0.50 and 30%. 80% power (1 - ß) minimum 18&#xD;
      students for each group, total 36 students will be included in the sample.&#xD;

      students for each group, total 36 students will be included in the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will provide brief information about the scope of the research by interviewing&#xD;
      the students who meet the case selection criteria online. Verbal and written consents of the&#xD;
      &quot;Informed Consent Form&quot; will be obtained (written consents will be sent to the researcher&#xD;
      online). Female students who accepted to participate in the study were given the &quot;Data&#xD;
      Collection Form&quot; (see Annex: 1), &quot;Beck Depression Inventory&quot; (APPENDIX: 2), Visual Pain Scale&#xD;
      (VAS) (see APPENDIX: 3) and PMS for 3 cycles. Scale (see Annex: 4) will be applied using the&#xD;
      online data collection method. Students who meet the sample selection criteria will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to the intervention and control group by the method of computer-assisted&#xD;
      randomization (www.randomizer.org). In order to ensure blindness, randomization and random&#xD;
      distribution of the participants to the groups will be done by a researcher and will not be&#xD;
      shared with other researchers. and Body Mass Index will be calculated. CRP, Procalcitonin,&#xD;
      sedimentation, Interleukin (IL) -2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and interferon from all&#xD;
      participants on the day of the highest VAS score (the day when symptoms peak) and the day&#xD;
      when symptoms were highest. (IFN gamma), TNF alpha and PMS scale will be taken. Students in&#xD;
      the intervention group will be given a total of 120 minutes out of 40 minutes, and 24&#xD;
      sessions of yoga for 8 weeks, 3 days a week. The researcher who will make yoga with each&#xD;
      student will be sent videos on the online platform, including a yoga presentation and a full&#xD;
      yoga session with the students after a yoga session. The students were asked to do yoga 3&#xD;
      times a week in accordance with the video and the researcher will be called twice a week to&#xD;
      get information about the process.&#xD;
