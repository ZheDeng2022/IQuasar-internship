  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diacutaneous fibrolysis is a physiotherapeutic instrumental technique, used to treat&#xD;
      musculoskeletal conditions causing pain and/or movement restriction. It is applied by means&#xD;
      of metallic hooks, ending in a spatula with beveled edges, that seems to allow a better&#xD;
      pressure distribution on the skin and a deeper and more precise application, compared to the&#xD;
      manual approach. Recent studies indicate positive responses regrading pain intensity decrease&#xD;
      in sports people suffering anterior knee pain, improving range of motion in subacromial&#xD;
      impingement syndrome, improving sensory conductivity in symptomatic patients with carpal&#xD;
      tunnel syndrome, decreased pain in patients with chronic epicondialgia or improveing function&#xD;
      athletes with anterior knee pain. However, the specific action mechanism, have not been&#xD;
      investigated in depth yet. There are no studies evaluating its effects on posterior muscular&#xD;
      chain of lower extremity in athletes, where FD effects on neuromuscular response could be&#xD;
      more evident due to the overload involved on this area. The aim of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the immediate, and after 30 minutes, effects of a single diacutaneous fibrolysis session on&#xD;
      flexibility, strength and neuromuscular activity on hamstring in athletes. A randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with blind evaluator. Randomization will be done between lower extremities&#xD;
      of each subject (Random.org). Regardless of its own dominance, diacutaneous fibrolysis will&#xD;
      be applied to de following muscles and intermuscular septums: gluteus maixmus, biceps femoris&#xD;
      and semitendinosus to de lower experimental limb. The other extremity will not be treat&#xD;
      (control limb).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample recruitment. Athletes from UIC university community, who compete officially or&#xD;
      institutionally, whether they are federated or recorded in a sport official register where&#xD;
      the predominant activity focuses on the lower train (athletics, cycling, football, rugby...).&#xD;
      Procedure. The anthropometric data will be collected at the beginning of the study. Each&#xD;
      outcome assessment will be performed by a blinded evaluator at the baseline, immediately&#xD;
      after the technique application and 30 minutes after.&#xD;
