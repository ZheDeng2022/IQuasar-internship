    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate physical activity level and functional exercise&#xD;
      capacity in patients with hyperthyroid. The secondary aim of the study is assessment of&#xD;
      respiratory function, peripheral and respiratory muscle strength, respiratory muscle&#xD;
      endurance, fatigue, depression, anxiety, stress, sleep and quality of life in patients with&#xD;
      hyperthyroid and compare them with healthy controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperthyroidism is a pathological disease in which the synthesis and secretion of thyroid&#xD;
      hormones are increased by the thyroid gland. Thyroid hormone excess affects many systems.&#xD;
      Common clinical symptoms are fatigue, palpitations, disturbed sleep, weight loss, heat&#xD;
      intolerance, sweating, tremors, polydipsia, and anxiety. Common physical findings are&#xD;
      tachycardia, extremity tremors and weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid hormone directly affects skeletal muscles. Increased thyroid hormone causes myopathy&#xD;
      with a decrease in muscle strength and mass. Hyperthyroid myopathy can cause a decrease in&#xD;
      exercise capacity. The main cause of exercise intolerance in individuals with hyperthyroidism&#xD;
      is the change in energy metabolism. The number of studies investigating the exercise capacity&#xD;
      in hyperthyroid patients is limited. Information support will be provided to the literature&#xD;
      by evaluating the exercise capacity in patients with hyperthyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity is positively associated with changes in cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
      Neuromuscular symptoms and exercise intolerance seen with thyroid hormone excess can lead&#xD;
      people to an inactive life. Indirect calorimetry, the gold standard in energy expenditure,&#xD;
      has been shown to be highly correlated with metabolic holter.There are no studies evaluating&#xD;
      physical activity level with metabolic holter in individuals with hyperthyroidism. In this&#xD;
      study, physical activity level will be evaluated by metabolic holter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with hyperthyroidism referred to the Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation Unit of Gazi&#xD;
      University Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Department by the physicians of the Department of&#xD;
      Endocrinology and Metabolism of the Department of Internal Diseases of Gazi University&#xD;
      Faculty of Medicine will be included in the study. Patients and healthy individuals will be&#xD;
      evaluated and the evaluation results will be compared. According to the sample size analysis&#xD;
      15 patients and 15 healthy individuals with similar demographic characteristics will be&#xD;
      included the study. Patients and healthy individuals will be selected according to&#xD;
      predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients will be evaluated twice. The first&#xD;
      evaluation will be made in the new diagnosis. The second evaluation will be made in the&#xD;
      euthyroidism.The assessments will be completed in two days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional exercise capacity (6 minutes walk test and 6 minutes stepper test), physical&#xD;
      activity level (multi-sensor activity monitor), respiratory functions (spirometer),&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength (mouth pressure measurement), peripheral muscle strength&#xD;
      (dynamometer), respiratory muscle endurance (incremental threshold loading test), quality of&#xD;
      life (The Thyroid-Related Quality of Life-ThyPRO), fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale),&#xD;
      depression-anxiety-stress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-42), quality of sleep (Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Sleep Quality Index) and shortness of breath (Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC)) will&#xD;
      be evaluated.&#xD;

Patients will be asked to continue breathing through the device during the test. During the test, the number of breaths delivered and the maximal time reached during each 2-minute period will be recorded. If the individual cannot breathe 3 consecutive times, the test will be terminated by the physiotherapist. The total duration of the test and the maximum pressure value at which it continues to breathe for at least 1 minute will be multiplied.
