  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with potentially resectable pancreatic head cancer and high bilirubin level, were&#xD;
      stratified into two equal groups according to the method of biliary drainage: endoscopic&#xD;
      stenting or percutaneous drainage.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Along with history taking and complete clinical examination, the results of complete blood&#xD;
      count, international normalized ratio , renal and liver function tests were obtained.&#xD;
      Patients with coagulopathy were corrected by fresh frozen plasma and repeated vitamin K&#xD;
      injections to reach an INR of at least 1.4 before the intervention, otherwise, they were&#xD;
      excluded. Besides, ultrasound and computed tomography of the abdomen/pelvis (pancreatic&#xD;
      protocol) were routinely undertaken. Tumors were staged for resectability according to TNM&#xD;
      staging system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly divided by closed envelope method into two groups; patients were&#xD;
      allocated to the first group (ERCP) who underwent Endoscopic Retrograde&#xD;
      Cholangio-Pancreatography coupled with placement of a 10-French plastic stent; and to the&#xD;
      second group (PTD) who underwent Fluoroscopy-guided Percutaneous Transhepatic Drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative biliary drainage Parenteral broad spectrum antibiotics were administered prior&#xD;
      and after each intervention. ERCP was performed under general anesthesia in the operation&#xD;
      room and a 10-french (3.2 mm) covered polyethylene stent with side flaps to prevent migration&#xD;
      was placed below the level of biliary bifurcation. Stents were inserted over a guidewire via&#xD;
      an Olympus 4.2 mm channel endoscope, by standard techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTD was placed in the interventional radiology department under local anesthesia via the left&#xD;
      duct sub-xiphoid approach, only via the external approach. A 6 french gauge catheter was&#xD;
      positioned with its tip above the biliary obstruction. After PTD, patients were instructed to&#xD;
      drink a lot of fluids to replace fluid loss or they were given temporary intravenous fluid&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After either procedure, patients were either discharged home or kept in hospital. Those who&#xD;
      were discharged were readmitted for preoperative preparation. Patients were followed up&#xD;
      clinically as well as by laboratory results. The total and direct bilirubin level and other&#xD;
      liver function tests were repeated after ten days from the procedure to estimate the decline&#xD;
      in their levels. Post-intervention complications either PTD-related such as bleeding,&#xD;
      cholangitis, bile leak and catheter occlusion/displacement; or ERCP-related such as&#xD;
      pancreatitis, cholangitis, bleeding and stent displacement; were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery After improvement of liver functions, patients were scheduled for PD. All operations&#xD;
      were performed through a hockey-stick incision by consultant surgeons experienced in&#xD;
      pancreatic surgery. The standard surgical procedure was pancreaticoduodenectomy with pylorus&#xD;
      preservation. The effects of pre-operative drainage were evaluated during the operation in&#xD;
      terms of operative resection time, blood loss, difficulties of dissection and intra-operative&#xD;
      bleeding. While the endoscopic stent is removed intra-operatively after transection of the&#xD;
      common hepatic duct, the catheter of PTD is left and inserted in the hepaticojejunostomy&#xD;
      (stented anastomosis) to be removed two weeks later. Perioperative complications (&lt; 30 days)&#xD;
      were stratified for each group according to Clavien-Dindo classification.&#xD;
