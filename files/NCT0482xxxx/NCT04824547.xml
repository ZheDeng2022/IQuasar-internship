      Identification of the long term effects of exercises in individuals with low back pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with low back pain who will participate in the study will be divided into two&#xD;
      groups. In the stabilization exercise group will be instructed to perform spinal&#xD;
      stabilization exercises and in the yoga group will be instructed to perform yoga program&#xD;
      consisting of breathing, relaxation and flexibility exercises. The intensity of the pain will&#xD;
      be evaluated through visual analog scale, functional status and quality of life will be&#xD;
      evaluated through Oswestry Disability Index(ODI), Nottingham Health Profile (NHP),&#xD;
      respectively. The exercise adherence will evaluated Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (EARS).&#xD;
      The time-distance characteristics of the gait will be evaluated by the OPTOGAIT photoelectric&#xD;
      cell (OPTOGait, Microgate, Italy, 2010) and the treadmill system. Assessments will be&#xD;
      repeated before, after the treatment, 6 and 12 month follow-up. Also,the number of back pain&#xD;
      attacks of the individuals will be questioned and recorded.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in pain severity</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in pain intensity at 8 weeks, 6 and 12 month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' average pain intensities will be assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Participants asked to mark the intensity of pain on a 10 cm long line, explaining that the leftmost of the line does not have pain, that the pain increases while moving to the right, and that the pain is unbearable on the far right.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of functional status</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in functional status at 8 weeks, 6 and 12 month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's pain related functional status will be measured by Oswestry Disability Index. The scale is considered the 'gold standard' of low back functional outcome tools. This scale contain questions related to functional activities of pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life, social life and traveling. The total score is between 0 and 100. The higher the score, the higher the level of disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in life quality levels at 8 weeks, 6 and 12 month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life will be assessed by Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). The NHP contain 38 questions in 6 subareas: pain, physical abilities, energy level, sleep, social isolation and emotional reaction. The scores range from 0 to 100, with each question assigned a weighted value; the sum of all weighted values in a given sub-area adds up to 100. Lower scores denoting a better quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Exercise Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in exercise compliance at 8 weeks, 6 and 12 month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (EARS) will be used to evaluate the exercise compliance of individuals. The result score of the questionnaire is between 0 and 64. A higher score indicates greater compliance with exercise.</description>

    <measure>Changes in the gait</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in gait at 8 weeks, 6 and 12 month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The gait of individuals will be evaluated by the valid and reliable OPTOGait photoelectric cell and the treadmill system. The gait of individuals on flat ground at their own pace will be recorded for 1 minute. The effects of the exercises on gait will be determined.</description>
