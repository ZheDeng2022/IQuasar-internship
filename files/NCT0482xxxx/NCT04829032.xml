  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hartmann's procedure was described for the first time in 1921 as an alternative to&#xD;
      abdominoperineal resection for the treatment of upper rectal tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although Hartmann's procedure fell out of favour for rectal cancer after the introduction of&#xD;
      restorative procedures, it remained the most common procedure in emergency setting for many&#xD;
      years. Nowadays Hartmann's procedure is a useful procedure in selected cases e.g. severely&#xD;
      ill patients with a high risk of anastomotic failure. However, restoring intestinal&#xD;
      continuity for Hartmann patients is often associated with high morbidity, and about 70% will&#xD;
      live with a permanent colostomy. Hartmann procedure' is a rapid and simple surgical technique&#xD;
      intended to decrease perioperative morbidity and mortality. This technique is often performed&#xD;
      by young surgeons Indeed, end colostomy may be necessary in situations where restoration of&#xD;
      continuity is risky, either because of unfavorable local conditions or because a more&#xD;
      definitive resection must be aborted due to hemodynamic instability. In the last decade the&#xD;
      Hartmann's procedure has been revalued in many studies. In diverticular disease the results&#xD;
      of DIVA arm of the LADIES trial showed that more patients in the primary anastomosis group&#xD;
      were stoma free compared with patients in the Hartmann's procedure group. Other studies have&#xD;
      observed no differences in major postoperative complications or postoperative mortality&#xD;
      between patients undergoing primary anastomosis versus Hartmann's procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hartmann's procedure reversals were associated with a higher risk of serious postoperative&#xD;
      complications than were stoma reversals after primary anastomosis with ileostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the growing evidence in favour of primary anastomosis and its inclusion as a valid&#xD;
      treatment option for perforated diverticulitis or perforated sigmoid colon in recent clinical&#xD;
      practice guidelines, some surgeons have been hesitant to undertake anastomosis in the setting&#xD;
      of purulent or faecal contamination and continue to choose Hartmann's procedure to eliminate&#xD;
      concerns about anastomotic leakage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Left-sided surgical acute colonic diseases (perforated diverticulitis with generalized&#xD;
      peritonitis, colon perforation, large bowel obstruction, colon cancer perforation or&#xD;
      obstruction, ischemic colitis, abdominal trauma) are still a life-threatening condition&#xD;
      requiring urgent surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite several published randomized trials, showing that primary anastomosis with or without&#xD;
      protective ileostomy is feasible and randomized trials for laparoscopic lavage with&#xD;
      conflicting results, the Hartmann's procedure, described for the first time in 1921 as an&#xD;
      alternative to abdominoperineal resection for the treatment of upper rectal tumours, is still&#xD;
      performed in many hospitals worldwide. It remained the most common procedure for acute&#xD;
      diverticulitis and colonic perforation in emergency setting for many years. Hartmann's&#xD;
      procedure is safe for severely ill patients; however, restoring intestinal continuity for&#xD;
      such patients is often associated with high morbidity leaving a great percentage of patients&#xD;
      with (up to 50%) with a permanent stoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hartmann procedure' is a rapid and simple surgical technique intended to decrease&#xD;
      perioperative morbidity and mortality. This technique is often performed by young surgeons&#xD;
      Indeed, end- colostomy may be necessary in situations where restoration of continuity is&#xD;
      risky, either because of unfavourable local conditions (Hinchey IV peritonitis) or because a&#xD;
      more definitive resection must be aborted due to hemodynamic instability. Although&#xD;
      anastomosis at the time of surgery is an alternative approach to Hartmann's procedure, there&#xD;
      have been concerns about the safety of this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last decade the Hartmann's procedure has been revalued and the results of different&#xD;
      studies [DIVA arm of the LADIES trial; DIVERTI study; Halim et Al] showed that more patients&#xD;
      in the primary anastomosis group were stoma free compared with patients in the Hartmann's&#xD;
      procedure group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have observed no differences in major postoperative complications or&#xD;
      postoperative mortality between patients undergoing primary anastomosis versus Hartmann's&#xD;
      procedure. Hartmann's procedure reversals were associated with a higher risk of serious&#xD;
      postoperative complications than were stoma reversals after protected primary anastomosis.&#xD;
      The management of colorectal cancer emergencies is challenging. WSES guidelines recommend in&#xD;
      case of perforation resection with anastomosis, with or without ileostomy. Hartmann's&#xD;
      procedure should be preferred to simple colostomy, since colostomy appears to be associated&#xD;
      with longer overall hospital stay and need for multiple operations, without a reduction in&#xD;
      perioperative morbidity in patients with colorectal cancer obstruction. Resection with&#xD;
      primary anastomosis should be preferred for uncomplicated malignant left-sided large bowel&#xD;
      obstruction in absence of other risk factors. Patients with high surgical risk are better&#xD;
      managed with Hartmann's procedure Despite the growing evidence in favour of primary&#xD;
      anastomosis and its inclusion as a valid treatment option for perforated diverticulitis or&#xD;
      perforated sigmoid colon cancer in recent clinical practice guidelines, surgeons have been&#xD;
      reluctant to perform anastomosis. Moreover, the postoperative course of the septic patient is&#xD;
      unpredictable and it very hard to estimate it intraoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the setting of purulent or fecal contamination most surgeons choose Hartmann's procedure&#xD;
      to eliminate also legal concerns about anastomotic leakage. It's important to note that most&#xD;
      of these procedures are performed off normal working hours when maybe best colorectal&#xD;
      expertise is lacking for decision making regarding anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the role of Hartmann's procedure in emergency setting for left-sided colonic&#xD;
           acute surgical disease (perforated diverticulitis with purulent or fecal peritonitis;&#xD;
           colon cancer perforation-occlusion; ischemic colitis; abdominal trauma) and the type of&#xD;
           surgery commonly performed in different level of care hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate which factors contribute in the choice of Hartmann's procedure instead of&#xD;
           colon resection with primary anastomosis (Hospital characteristics, surgeon experience,&#xD;
           time of surgery, age of patients, comorbidities, etc ) Study design: International&#xD;
           multicenter prospective cohort study. Study population: Adult patients with left-sided&#xD;
           colonic acute surgical disease who need surgery in an emergency setting (perforated&#xD;
           diverticulitis with purulent or fecal peritonitis; colon cancer perforation-occlusion;&#xD;
           ischemic colitis; abdominal trauma).&#xD;
