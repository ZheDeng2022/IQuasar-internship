    <textblock>
      Left ventricular thrombus is a recognised complication of acute myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      associated with stroke, recurrent myocardial infarction and adverse cardiac remodelling. The&#xD;
      prevention, treatment and resolution of thrombus is hampered by a lack of understanding of&#xD;
      its initiation, propagation and dissolution. Advanced non-invasive imaging holds major&#xD;
      promise in improving our understanding of the incidence and the natural history of left&#xD;
      ventricular thrombus as well as providing potential biomarkers to assess disease activity and&#xD;
      treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective observational study, the investigators will recruit patients with recent&#xD;
      acute anterior myocardial infarction and screen them for evidence of left ventricular&#xD;
      thrombus and subclinical stroke using hybrid positron emission tomography and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (PET/MR). Each patient will undergo PET/MR of the heart and head 7±2 days&#xD;
      after acute myocardial infarction. If left ventricular thrombus is present on baseline MR,&#xD;
      patients will be started on anticoagulation at the discretion of the attending physician, who&#xD;
      will determine the agent used (warfarin or direct oral anticoagulant) and the duration of&#xD;
      therapy (3-6 months). Patients will then undergo repeat PET/MR at completion of&#xD;
      anti-coagulant therapy and then again after another 3 months. Patients with increased 18F-&#xD;
      GP1 activity but no overt thrombus on MR will undergo repeat PET/MR of the head and heart at&#xD;
      3 and 6 months to establish the natural history of this observation and its association with&#xD;
      thromboembolism in the brain. They will not routinely receive anticoagulation given the&#xD;
      exploratory nature of this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular thrombotic conditions were estimated to account for 1 in 4 deaths worldwide in&#xD;
      2010 and are the leading cause of global mortality. Thrombosis begins with damage to the&#xD;
      vascular wall. Physiological haemostasis is triggered when underlying collagen is exposed to&#xD;
      circulating platelets which bind directly to collagen with collagen-specific glycoprotein&#xD;
      surface receptors. After an initial signalling cascade involving release of platelet binder&#xD;
      von Willebrand Factor, platelets become activated which allows adherence to the site of&#xD;
      injury. Following activation, phospholipase A2 modifies the integrin membrane glycoprotein&#xD;
      IIb/IIIa (GP IIb/IIIa) increasing platelet ability to bind fibrinogen. The activated&#xD;
      platelets then change shape from spherical to stellate, and the fibrinogen cross-links with&#xD;
      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa aiding aggregation of more platelets and completing primary&#xD;
      haemostasis. Secondary haemostasis involves activation of the coagulation cascade through&#xD;
      extrinsic and intrinsic pathways and ends with cross linked fibrin deposition and a mature&#xD;
      thrombus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The haemostatic process is fluid and dynamic with the expression of activated membrane&#xD;
      proteins and coagulation factors changing throughout. Platelet expression of GP IIb/IIIa&#xD;
      falls as a thrombus matures hence why it is a pharmacological target for antithrombotic&#xD;
      therapies. The investigators aim to explore the expression and distribution of GP IIb/IIIa&#xD;
      receptors in the cardiovascular system. Improving our understanding of how clinical&#xD;
      presentation relates to platelet activation over a range of conditions, will help optimise&#xD;
      the appropriate use of anti-thrombotic therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the aftermath of major acute myocardial infarction, the combination of blood stasis and&#xD;
      activated tissue factor frequently leads to the formation of left ventricular (LV) thrombus&#xD;
      which is associated with stroke, recurrent myocardial infarction and adverse cardiac&#xD;
      remodelling. The prevention, treatment and resolution of thrombus is hampered by a lack of&#xD;
      understanding of its initiation, propagation and dissolution. Moreover, the current clinical&#xD;
      approach fails to diagnose a high proportion of LV thrombi and we lack evidence regarding the&#xD;
      optimal anti-coagulant therapy to use and duration of therapy. Non-invasive imaging&#xD;
      techniques hold major promise in improving our understanding of the incidence and the natural&#xD;
      history of LV thrombus as well as providing potential biomarkers to determine the optimal&#xD;
      treatment strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left ventricular (LV) thrombus post myocardial infarction (MI):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before thrombolytic therapy was available, LV thrombus occurred in 20% to 60% of patients&#xD;
      with acute myocardial infarction. In the thrombolytic trials, the incidence of LV thrombosis&#xD;
      detected by echocardiography was 5.1% increasing to 11.5% in those who had an anterior&#xD;
      myocardial infarction. The incidence has further declined with the advent of primary&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention, likely due to enhanced myocardial salvage, and now ranges&#xD;
      from 2.5% to 15%. However, the incidence is much higher in patients with anterior myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, with studies using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging reporting an incidence of&#xD;
      LV thrombus of 26%.Furthermore, the natural history of this condition is rather vague.&#xD;
      Indeed, in most published studies, thrombi were assessed at a single time, and their size,&#xD;
      mobility, and characteristics were not reported. Although echocardiography is currently used&#xD;
      to identify LV thrombus in the clinic, it lacks sensitivity and leaves many cases undetected.&#xD;
      In some studies, the sensitivity of transthoracic echocardiography compared to cardiac&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging with contrast delayed enhancement (LGE-CMR) was 20-25%. We&#xD;
      therefore need a more highly specific and sensitive imaging technique to detect the presence&#xD;
      LV thrombus early after myocardial infarction. In this study the investigators will use&#xD;
      18F-GP1 PET to describe the prevalence and natural history of LV thrombus in patients after&#xD;
      myocardial infarction and to differentiate old from new LV thrombus. This study will also&#xD;
      facilitate the identification of features that predict thrombus formation as well as&#xD;
      providing a useful biomarker for potential therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of stroke after acute myocardial infarction during the hospital stay ranges&#xD;
      from 0.7% to 2.2%. Despite contemporary antithrombotic treatment, LV thrombus detected by&#xD;
      LGE-CMR is associated with a 4-fold higher long-term incidence of embolism. In a large cohort&#xD;
      of patients with LV thrombus detected by LGE-CMR, there was an annualized incidence of&#xD;
      embolism of 3.7%, despite the use of contemporary anticoagulant treatment in 89% of patients.&#xD;
      This was 4-fold higher than the 0.8% annualized incidence of embolism in matched patients&#xD;
      without LV thrombus. Moreover, among patients with LV thrombus detected by LGE-CMR, the rate&#xD;
      of embolism was the same irrespective of whether or not the LV thrombus had been observed on&#xD;
      echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of subclinical ischaemic stroke in patients with anterior myocardial infarction&#xD;
      has not been investigated previously. However, mounting epidemiologic evidence has shown that&#xD;
      subclinical stroke is clinically important, contributing to cognitive dysfunction, dementia&#xD;
      and increased overall mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding Platelet Biology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As platelet aggregation is a major component of both arterial and venous thrombi, the&#xD;
      investigators will use 18F-GP1 - a radiolabelled ligand of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa&#xD;
      (GPIIb/IIIa) receptor- to detect activated platelets on thrombus. GPIIb/IIIa receptors&#xD;
      mediate platelet adherence and aggregation. They are expressed in greater numbers and assume&#xD;
      a more ligand binding conformation on activation. The receptor can then bind protein ligands&#xD;
      including von Willebrand factor and Fibrinogen, facilitating platelet bridging and&#xD;
      aggregation. Accordingly, 18F-GP1 PET will provide important information on LV thrombus&#xD;
      formation following myocardial infarction, allowing us to better understand and time course&#xD;
      of this pathology.&#xD;
