  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent clinical trials have reported a remarkable therapeutic efficacy of cladribine tablets&#xD;
      not only in the early and recurrent phases of the disease, but also in progressive multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis. However, its role on the immune and nervous systems has hardly been studied,&#xD;
      although these studies suggest that CoA may exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective&#xD;
      actions. Thus, the objective is to better understand/describe how cladribine acts during MS&#xD;
      and to demonstrate whether CoA: (1) is able to effectively modulate pro-inflammatory immune&#xD;
      processes and (2) has powerful neuroprotective properties. Ultimately, it will provide proof&#xD;
      of concept that cladribine can be used not only in the early but also in the progressive&#xD;
      phase of MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this hypothesis, the goal is to study the beneficial&#xD;
      immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory effects of cladribine on multiple sclerosis.&#xD;

    <description>Six 5 mL heparinized tubes, approximately 24 mL of blood will be collected as per standard practice. The 5 tubes collected from a given individual will be transported directly to the laboratory. In the laboratory, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be prepared for the various analyses.&#xD;
However, in order to minimize the effect of agents other than CoA in MS patients, it is necessary that peripheral blood mononuclear cells are collected before treatment is given: for RR MS patients treated with first-line drugs (IFNβ, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate, ...), RR MS patients treated with second-line drugs (natalizumab and fingolimod, ...) and RR MS patients treated with third-line drugs (alemtuzumab, ...).</description>
