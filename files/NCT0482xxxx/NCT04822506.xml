      Although there are large intestine cancer postoperative clinical research of acupuncture, but&#xD;
      fewer sample size, whether perioperative acupuncture intervention is superior to the&#xD;
      postoperative acupuncture intervention, remains to be seen, so investigators proposed to&#xD;
      carry out the preliminary experiment, the data can be collected according to the different&#xD;
      characteristics of perioperative, perioperative choose different acupoints compatibility,&#xD;
      give full play to the needle medicine compound anesthesia in colorectal cancer surgery play a&#xD;
      unique function of viscera protection, to explore the curative in colorectal cancer surgery&#xD;
      perioperative intervened to promote the role of gastrointestinal function after surgery for&#xD;
      early rehabilitation provides evidence-based medical evidence, develop and optimize the&#xD;
      acupuncture and drugs combined anesthesia in colorectal cancer surgery perioperative&#xD;
      application of specification, It promoted the establishment of the first treatment mode of&#xD;
      &quot;accelerated recovery in perioperative period of colorectal cancer operation based on&#xD;
