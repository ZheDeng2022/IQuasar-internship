    <textblock>
      Hyperkinetic movement disorders in patients with diseases of motor neurons will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and motor neuron disease patients will be&#xD;
      studied. Involuntary movements will be video recorded and accelerometry with electromyography&#xD;
      (EMG) will be recorded in a subset of patients. Hyperkinetic involuntary movements studied&#xD;
      will be tremor and minipolymyoclonus. Tremor is defined as involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory&#xD;
      movements of a body part, and minipolymyoclonus are intermittent and irregular movements,&#xD;
      with amplitudes sufficient to produce visible movements of the joints. Hyperkinetic movement&#xD;
      disorders may be of central or peripheral origin and using accelerometry with EMG may help&#xD;
      distinguish the two mechanisms. In patients with SMA the investigators will explore the&#xD;
      effect of Nusinersen treatment on phenomenology and amplitude of tremor and&#xD;
      minipolymyoclonus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To explore the prevalence and phenomenology of hyperkinetic movement disorders in&#xD;
      patients with MND and SMA and to study the underlying pathological mechanisms with the use of&#xD;
      accelerometry and EMG. To explore the effect of Nusinersen treatment on phenomenology and&#xD;
      amplitude of involuntary movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Based on clinical observations the investigators believe it will proven that&#xD;
      hyperkinetic movement disorders are common in patients with disease of motor neurons. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that hyperkinetic movement disorders in MND and SMA patients are of&#xD;
      peripheral origin, being caused by uneven graduation of contraction in the wasted muscles&#xD;
      with large motor units being active with no sufficient previous recruitment of small units to&#xD;
      smooth contraction of large motor units. If tremor and minipolymyoclonus in SMA are due to&#xD;
      the activation of enlarged motor units which are caused by reinnervation of muscle fibers,&#xD;
      the treatment with Nusinersen will increase the amplitude of tremor and minipolymyoclonus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Presence, quality, and regularity of hyperkinetic movement disorders will be defined&#xD;
      using clinical examination, accelerometry and EMG. Hyperkinetic movements will be classified&#xD;
      as minipolymyoclonus or tremor. In patients with SMA, the measurements will be repeated 6-12&#xD;
      months after initiation of treatment with Nusinersen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Minipolymyoclonus and tremor are frequently mentioned as part of the clinical&#xD;
      picture of spinal muscular atrophy, but the precise mechanism of the occurrence of tremor and&#xD;
      minipolymyoclonus in these patients remains unknown. In the 1970s it was suggested&#xD;
      minipolymyoclonus and tremor are caused by reinnervation that follows denervation of muscle&#xD;
      fibers in neuropathies. The investigators are not aware of any later or more systematic study&#xD;
      on the frequency of minipolymyoclonus and tremor occurrence in SMA patients or its evolution&#xD;
      during the disease course. Nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide, is a medicine registered&#xD;
      for treating SMA. Nusinersen increases the production of the functional survival motor neuron&#xD;
      protein by regulating gene expression and thus slows down or stops alpha-motor neuron&#xD;
      degradation. MND is considered a disease of upper and lower motor neuron and movement&#xD;
      disorders are not considered part of its typical clinical picture. Movement disorders are&#xD;
      only reported in MND in association with extrapyramidal or cerebellar degeneration or&#xD;
      dysfunction. Contrary to this, the investigators have encountered anecdotal evidence from a&#xD;
      number of patients with otherwise typical MND who manifested involuntary jerks and tremor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To explore the prevalence and phenomenology of hyperkinetic movement disorders in&#xD;
      patients with SMA and MND, to explore the effect of Nusinersen treatment on phenomenology and&#xD;
      amplitude of tremor and minipolymyoclonus, and to elucidate the underlying pathological&#xD;
      mechanisms by using accelerometry and EMG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and inclusion/exclusion criteria: All genetically proven SMA patients who will be&#xD;
      treated with Nusinersen and consecutive patients followed in MND outpatient clinic will be&#xD;
      recruited. Patients with SMA type I, II, III, and IV and patients with ''clinically definite&#xD;
      ALS'' or ''clinically probable ALS'' or ''clinically probable ALS - laboratory supported''&#xD;
      according to the revised El Escorial diagnostic criteria or with the diagnosis of PMA or PLS&#xD;
      will be included. There will be no exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol: All patients will be clinically examined and video-recorded. SMA patients&#xD;
      will be examined and video-recorded for the second time 6-12 months after initiation of&#xD;
      treatment with Nusinersen. The presence, quality, and regularity of involuntary movements&#xD;
      will be evaluated while subjects will be sitting in a chair with hands resting in their lap&#xD;
      (usual posture when examining rest tremor), during forward horizontal reach posture, and&#xD;
      during finger to nose task. Based on regularity and distribution, hyperkinetic movements will&#xD;
      be classified as minipolymyoclonus (MPMC) or tremor. Accelerometry with EMG will be recorded&#xD;
      in a subset of patients with hyperkinetic movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accelerometry with electromyography: With accelerometry tremor (frequency and amplitude) in&#xD;
      the subjects will be objectively evaluated. A triaxle accelerometer will be attached to the&#xD;
      3rd metacarpal bone bilaterally. Simultaneously EMG will be recorded. Bipolar Ag / AgCl&#xD;
      surface EMG electrodes will be placed over the flexor carpi radialis and the extensor carpi&#xD;
      radialis muscle bilaterally. Electromyography and accelerometry will be recorded while&#xD;
      subjects will be sitting in an armchair/wheelchair or lying in a hospital bed (a) at rest&#xD;
      position (b) with arms outstretched (postural condition) (c) at the postural condition with&#xD;
      500 g mass attached to the hand (weight loading) and (d) while performing a goal-directed&#xD;
      task (action).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Clinical measures before and after Nusinersen treatment will be&#xD;
      compared using two-related-samples T-test or repeated-measures ANOVA. To assess possible&#xD;
      causative mechanisms (disease factors) that determine the presence of involuntary movements,&#xD;
      separate multilevel binary logistic analyses will be performed.&#xD;
