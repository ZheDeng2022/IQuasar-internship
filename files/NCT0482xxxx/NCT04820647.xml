    <textblock>
      The goals of the current study are to evaluate the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility&#xD;
      of Kessler Foundation-Strength Identification and Expression (KF-STRIDE) in an 8-week&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial comparing the intervention to services as usual (SAU).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a strength-based intervention&#xD;
      (Kessler Foundation Strength Identification and Expression; KF-STRIDE) that can enhance job&#xD;
      interview skills and employment. Despite possessing employable talents, the core social&#xD;
      deficits of transition age youth with autism spectrum disorder (TAY-ASD) make it difficult&#xD;
      for this group to articulate their individual strengths. This inability to identify and&#xD;
      express one's strengths to a potential employer can negatively affect interview performance&#xD;
      and lead to difficulty with job obtainment. Thus, the current proposal will examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness (Aim 1), acceptability, usability, and feasibility (Aim 2) of a novel&#xD;
      strength-based intervention, KF-STRIDE, which is designed to enhance the ability of TAY-ASD&#xD;
      to identify personal strengths and effectively discuss them. The goals of the current study&#xD;
      are to evaluate the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of KF-STRIDE in an 8-week&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial comparing the intervention to services as usual (SAU). The study&#xD;
      will be performed at two private therapeutic schools. Compared to a SAU group, we hypothesize&#xD;
      that the KF-STRIDE group will: a) improve the ability to identify strengths (Hypothesis 1),&#xD;
      b) improve the ability to express strengths (Hypothesis 2), c) improve other job interview&#xD;
      skills (Hypothesis 3) and finally c) improve ability to obtain employment 6-months following&#xD;
      the intervention (Hypothesis 4). In this way, the current study is in line with the NIMH's&#xD;
      experimental therapeutics model, as we will examine whether the intervention improves&#xD;
      employment, as well as identify potential mechanistic targets that could affect outcome. In&#xD;
      Aim 2, we will also monitor fidelity, acceptability, usability, and feasibility of the&#xD;
      strength-based intervention. The long-term goal of the current research is to collect pilot&#xD;
      data that will lead to fully-powered effectiveness and implementation evaluations of&#xD;
      KF-STRIDE in other community settings.&#xD;
