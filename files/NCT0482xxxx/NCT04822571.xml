  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Femoroacetabular impingement is an orthopedic condition that is primarily characterized by&#xD;
      the presence of anatomic bony abnormalities in the femoral head and/or the acetabulum&#xD;
      resulting in an abnormal contact between the two during hip motion, especially in positions&#xD;
      of increased hip flexion and rotation, ultimately leading to hip pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study was initiated with the goal of exploring the etiology of FAI in a&#xD;
      multidimensional and novel way that addresses the major gaps in literature. Within the main&#xD;
      study a 3D motion capture protocol has been designed in line with the latest literature&#xD;
      recommendations, which called for more hip ROM specific movements and athlete oriented 3D&#xD;
      motion capture protocols that incorporate the spinopelvic complex. While the protocol surely&#xD;
      contains movements that have been previously validated and published such as squats and&#xD;
      lunges, a unique addition of high velocity soccer kicks and hop- lunges have been included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such additions elevate the relevancy of the 3D motion analysis protocol, however they also&#xD;
      pose questions on how reliable and accurate these additions are. This is especially important&#xD;
      a 3D motion analysis has a very subjective component, which is the placement of the skin&#xD;
      markers by the clinician. Errors or alteration to markers placement between different&#xD;
      sessions or different subjects have been shown to significantly affect the quality of data.&#xD;
      Furthermore, not all physical movement can be properly documented using motion analysis. The&#xD;
      velocity at which the movement is preformed combined with how complex it is can affect the&#xD;
      quality of data collected by the motion analysis system. Also another important component is&#xD;
      the uniqueness of the population recruited for the main study. Most studies with highly&#xD;
      dynamic motion protocols have been validated and published on adult populations. Thus the&#xD;
      investigators cannot use their findings liberally to compare with the adolescent protocol, as&#xD;
      differences in patterns of motion between adults and adolescence have been documented.&#xD;
      Indeed, a need to test the reliability of the investigators' protocol among their own study&#xD;
      groups is highly imperative.&#xD;

      Femoroacetabular impingement is an orthopedic condition that is primarily characterized by&#xD;
      the presence of anatomic bony abnormalities in the femoral head and/or the acetabulum&#xD;
      resulting in an abnormal contact between the two during hip motion, especially in positions&#xD;
      of increased hip flexion and rotation, ultimately leading to hip pain. FAI can be&#xD;
      radiologically classified into 3 types of morphology: Pincer, CAM and mixed type. Pincer&#xD;
      morphology is mainly characterized on radiological films by an over-coverage of the&#xD;
      acetabulum, has a high center edge angle and is seen in females more frequently. CAM&#xD;
      morphology is characterized by an increase in bone formation at the femoral head-neck&#xD;
      junction and is mainly identified by a large alpha angle on medical imaging scans. Unlike&#xD;
      pincer, CAM morphology occurs mainly in males. Mixed morphology is a third type of FAI and&#xD;
      consists of a combination of both CAM and pincer impingement characteristics. FAI has been&#xD;
      increasingly garnering attention in the last two decades due to two main reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first reason is its recognition as a leading cause of hip pain in the young&#xD;
      economically-active adult. Epidemiological reports show the average age of FAI patients is 28&#xD;
      years old. Furthermore, a significant number of FAI patients are athletes who have&#xD;
      professional careers that heavily depend on their physical wellbeing. The second reason FAI&#xD;
      has been in the spotlight of orthopedic research recently, is the growing evidence linking it&#xD;
      to early cartilage and labral damage, and subsequently to the development of hip&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA). Ganz and colleagues were the first to make this link and assumed that&#xD;
      the presence of the inter-articular morphological abnormality leads to abutment of the&#xD;
      femoral head-neck junction against the acetabular rim. This repeated mechanical abutment is&#xD;
      assumed to then lead to acetabular labral damage and progressive breakdown of the&#xD;
      chondrolabral junction, thereby leading to chondral defects and the eventual onset of OA. Hip&#xD;
      OA by itself is an acknowledged source of pain/disability and is associated with an&#xD;
      ever-increasing socioeconomic cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent systematic review on the prevalence of symptomatic hip morphology reported the&#xD;
      prevalence of CAM type deformity to be 37%; the prevalence of pincer deformity was 67% in the&#xD;
      general population. Interestingly, there was an almost 3:1 ratio of CAM deformity in an&#xD;
      athletic population compared with non-athletes. This was not the case for pincer deformity.&#xD;
      Furthermore, such morphological findings are increasingly being reported in the adolescent&#xD;
      athletic population specifically. A number of recent studies found a markedly higher&#xD;
      prevalence of cam deformities in asymptomatic adolescents participating in, specifically,&#xD;
      soccer, ice-hockey and basketball as compared with their non-athlete controls. Such reports&#xD;
      have led researchers to speculate whether participating in high intensity physical activity&#xD;
      at the critical period of bone maturation prior to femoral physis closure (10 - 15 years of&#xD;
      age) could cause CAM deformity post femoral physis closure (15 -18 years of age old). It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that a CAM in this population could form either due to new bone formation at the&#xD;
      anterosuperior head-neck junction, or be induced by changes in the shape of the growth plate&#xD;
      due to high shear forces acting on the growing hip during these athletic activities. However,&#xD;
      as of date there is no concrete evidence to support this hypothesis. Consequently, the&#xD;
      reasons behind the formations of CAM deformity in adolescent athletes remain unclear and call&#xD;
      for further research. Such research is imperative to increase our understanding of the effect&#xD;
      high training load can have on the wellbeing and long term health of young athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is with this background in mind that the main study was initiated with the goal of&#xD;
      exploring the etiology of FAI in a multidimensional and novel way that addresses the major&#xD;
      gaps in literature. Within the main study a 3D motion capture protocol has been designed in&#xD;
      line with the latest literature recommendations, which called for more hip ROM specific&#xD;
      movements and athlete oriented 3D motion capture protocols that incorporate the spinopelvic&#xD;
      complex. While the protocol surely contains movements that have been previously validated and&#xD;
      published such as squats and lunges, a unique addition of high velocity soccer kicks and hop-&#xD;
      lunges have been included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such additions elevate the relevancy of the 3D motion analysis protocol, however they also&#xD;

      a 3D motion analysis has a very subjective component, which is the placement of the skin&#xD;
