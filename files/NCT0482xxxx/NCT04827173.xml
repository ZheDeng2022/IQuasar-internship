    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from neurological disorders often exhibit unwanted sensorimotor activities&#xD;
      e.g. spasticity, hypersensitisation, hyper- and dystonia and motor disabilities. Currently,&#xD;
      several therapeutic interventions are developed and implemented to overcome these unwanted&#xD;
      activities e.g. transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES), oral medication, botulinum&#xD;
      neurotoxin injections, local anaesthetics, rehabilitation robotic training and surgery.&#xD;
      However, these therapies offer varying results. Compared to analgesic drugs, TES is&#xD;
      associated with fewer side effects and has therefore become a popular therapeutic strategy to&#xD;
      treat these unwanted sensorimotor activities. To enable this TES strategy, surface electrodes&#xD;
      are attached to the skin overlying the site of pain. Next, a low-frequency electrical current&#xD;
      (LFC; 1-100 Hz) is applied. However, this low-frequency current acts as an excitatory agent&#xD;
      and results in muscle contraction. Therefore, this technique cannot be used to treat unwanted&#xD;
      motor activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical stimulation with medium-frequency alternating electrical currents (MFAEC; 2-50&#xD;
      kHz) can inhibit peripheral motor nerve activities and force production, when implanted&#xD;
      directly on top of the peripheral nerve of interest. However, this strategy is rather&#xD;
      invasive. Thus, the administration of transcutaneous medium-frequency alternating electrical&#xD;
      currents (tMFAEC), i.e. administration of electrical currents through the skin, might offer a&#xD;
      solution. However, the effects of tMFAEC on motor nerve inhibition remains largely unknown.&#xD;
      Theoretically, the administration of tMFAEC on the sensory nerve may even result in partial&#xD;
      or complete (reversible) nerve block thereby serving as an anesthesia in order to perform&#xD;
      surgical or painful procedures.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering from neurological disorders often experience undesired sensorimotor&#xD;
      activities e.g. hypersensitisation, spasticity and hyper- and dystonia. To overcome these&#xD;
      disabilities, various therapeutic interventions e.g. oral medications, botulinum neurotoxin&#xD;
      injections, local anaesthetics, transcutaneous electrical stimulation and surgeries are&#xD;
      implemented. However, these often do not offer permanent solutions. Electrical stimulation&#xD;
      with medium-frequency alternating electrical currents (MFAEC; 2-50 kHz) can inhibit&#xD;
      peripheral motor nerve activities and force production, when implanted directly on top of the&#xD;
      peripheral nerve of interest. The administration of transcutaneous medium-frequency&#xD;
      alternating electrical currents (tMFAEC), i.e. administration of electrical currents through&#xD;
      the skin, might offer a less-invasive alternative. Theoretically, the administration of&#xD;
      tMFAEC on the sensory nerve may even result in partial or complete (reversible) nerve block&#xD;
      thereby serving as an anesthesia in order to perform surgical or painful procedures. A&#xD;
      promising pre-clinical study of Kim et al.1 already demonstrated that tMFAEC stimulation at&#xD;
      10 kHz can partially inhibit both sensory perception and motor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. AIM AND HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary aim of this study is to confirm the previous results in literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is hypothesized that tMFAEC stimulation on the distal median nerve would:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Reduce sensory perception in the index and middle fingers&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inhibit force production by the index and middle fingers&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OUTCOME MEASURES 2.1 Primary outcome measure&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessment of peripheral sensory perception and force production in the index and middle&#xD;
           finger when tMFAEC is applied with a fixed current intensity of 31.5mA at a frequency of&#xD;
           10kHz to the distal median nerve. The peripheral sensory perception will be measured&#xD;
           with the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament examination and pressure algometry that measures&#xD;
           tactile and pressure sensation, respectively. The assessment of force production will be&#xD;
           measured with an electronic handheld dynamometer (CompuFet 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Secondary outcome measures I. Confirmation of participant's safety of tMFAEC by&#xD;
           determining the maximum capacity tolerable for a participant. Determination is assessed&#xD;
           by gradually increasing the tMFAEC to individual pain threshold with a maximum current&#xD;
           intensity of 35mA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           II. Evaluation of the effect of a different frequency i.e. 2kHz with a fixed current&#xD;
           intensity of 31.5mA on the level of sensorimotor inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           III. Evaluation of the effect of two substantially different electrodes (i.e. PALS&#xD;
           Platinum Electrodes 50x50mm and 3M™ Red Dot™ Elektrode foam basis klevende gel, 2228) on&#xD;
           the level of sensorimotor inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           IV. Evaluation of the level of impedance in relation with frequency and the effect of&#xD;
           impedance on the level of sensorimotor inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           V. Evaluation of effect of the depth of the median nerve at mid-forearm level on the&#xD;
           level of sensorimotor inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY PROCEDURE AND MEASUREMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the location and depth (in mm) of the median nerve will be identified using a Sono&#xD;
      Site Xporte ultrasound machine with a high-frequency linear transducer HFL38 (15-6MHz). The&#xD;
      skin over the median nerve will be cleaned with ether. Electrode 1 will be placed on the skin&#xD;
      overlying the median nerve near the transverse carpal ligament. Electrode 2 will be placed 7&#xD;
      cm superior to electrode 1, right above the course of the median nerve in the forearm&#xD;
      (identified with ultrasound). Electrode placement will be slightly adjusted if MFAC&#xD;
      stimulation induced undesired muscle contraction secondary to direct stimulation of the&#xD;
      neuromuscular junction or asynchronous firing of the nerve. For example, if stimulation will&#xD;
      cause thenar muscle contraction, the location of the electrodes will be moved slightly&#xD;
      (approximately 0.5 cm) toward the ulnar or the proximal side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the participants will be seated on a chair and their arms will be positioned on&#xD;
      a testing table. The height of the chair will be adjusted such that participants can put&#xD;
      their arms on the table with both shoulders at approximately 35° of abduction and 45° of&#xD;
      flexion and elbows at approximately 45° of flexion. A rigid Styrofoam™ board will be used to&#xD;
      support both wrists and forearms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To apply tMFAEC stimulation through surface electrodes (PALS Platinum Electrodes 50x50mm and&#xD;
      3M™ Red Dot™ Elektrode foam basis klevende gel, 2228) and to measure the level of impedance,&#xD;
      we will use the following device:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ● DS5 Isolated Bipolar Constant Current Stimulator&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to create a biphasic, steady, unmodulated alternating current of 10 kHz, we generate&#xD;
      the waveform on a signal generator and deliver this to the DS5 input.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semmes-Weinstein monofilament examination and pressure algometry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These tests will be performed at baseline and 100% current intensity in both the 2kHz and 10&#xD;
      kHz stimulation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tactile sensation - A set of 20 nylon monofilaments, graded according to monofilament&#xD;
      diameter, will be used. Each monofilament will be pressed to the skin, beginning with the&#xD;
      smallest diameter to obtain an ascending method of threshold testing. All monofilaments will&#xD;
      be held in contact with the skin until it bends (creating a 'C-letter'), and will then be&#xD;
      removed after 1 second. During this test, all participants will be asked to close their eyes&#xD;
      and indicate whether or not they can sense the monofilament stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both the 2kHz and 10 kHz, tMFAEC stimulation will be applied for 5 seconds. Then,&#xD;
      monofilament stimulation will start 1-3 seconds after starting the tMFAEC stimulation, so&#xD;
      that participants cannot anticipate the onset of the monofilament stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tactile threshold will be recorded in milligram force as directed by the manufacturer and&#xD;
      force values will be presented using a logarithmic scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure sensation/pain - A 1 centimeter diameter algometer will be used. The pressure will&#xD;
      be applied in a perpendicular direction using the algometer. The participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to indicate when they feel a transition from touch/pressure to pain, corresponding&#xD;
      to each participant's pressure pain threshold. Pressure will be increased at a rate of&#xD;
      1kg/cm² and released after the subject reports pain. Pressure will be applied after tMFAEC&#xD;
      stimulation. When the pressure pain threshold is reached, tMFAEC stimulation will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pressure pain threshold values will be recorded in kg/cm².&#xD;
&#xD;
      Force production assessment: This test will be performed at baseline and 100% intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A customised plastic frame (120 x 110 mm) with an arch will be placed underneath the palm to&#xD;
      maintain approximately 0° wrist extension and metacarpophalangeal flexion. Next, 2 straps&#xD;
      will be used to fix the participant's wrist and forearm to a testing platform to limit force&#xD;
      transmission from proximal muscles and from the elbow and shoulder joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will press a force sensor (i.e. an electronic hand held dynamometer&#xD;
      (CompuFET 2) with the head of the proximal phalanx of each index and middle finger. The wrist&#xD;
      and hand position will be optimised to maximise the contribution of the intrinsic hand&#xD;
      muscles. To determine the target force, participants will be asked to press the sensors using&#xD;
      maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). During the MVC measurements, a digital monitor will&#xD;
      provide visual feedback on virtual finger forces, calculated as the sum of the forces&#xD;
      produced by the index and middle fingers. The MVC measurement will be repeated 3 times and&#xD;
      the values will be averaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3-5 practice times, the task will be repeated with MFAC stimulation. The tasks will be&#xD;
      conducted under 4 conditions: 90-100% MVC, 100% tMFAEC stimulation at 2kHz or 10kHz and&#xD;
      application of platinum electrodes or 3M electrodes. These 4 conditions will be repeated 3&#xD;
      times. Between every measurement, a 1 minute rest period will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Data will be presented using the mean and standard deviation values&#xD;
      or median and interquartile range according to the data distribution (normal or non-normal&#xD;
      distribution, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.1 Primary study outcome To compare the tactile threshold on the level of sensorimotor&#xD;
      inhibition between baseline and 100% MFAC intensity (31.5mA) with two different stimulation&#xD;
      frequencies i.e. 2kHz and 10kHz a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures (in case of a normal&#xD;
      distribution of the data) or a Friedman test (in case no normal distribution) will be used&#xD;
      for each of the index and middle fingers followed by a post-hoc test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the comparison of pressure pain thresholds among baseline and 100% intensity of tMFAEC&#xD;
      stimulation in the index and middle fingers and to compare finger forces between the three&#xD;
      phases using normalized mean and minimum values, a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures or a&#xD;
      Friedman test will be used. To evaluate the exact significant differences, a Student t test&#xD;
      or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with a Bonferroni adjustment will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of significance will be set at p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2 Secondary study outcomes Confirmation of participant's safety of tMFAEC by determining&#xD;
      the maximum current intensity capable to a participant will be presented with descriptive&#xD;
      statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the effect of two different electrodes with substantially different materials&#xD;
      on the level of sensorimotor inhibition will be presented with descriptive statistics.&#xD;
