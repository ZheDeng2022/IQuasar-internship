      Purpose: To evaluate the clinical outcome of patients with refractory Neurotrophic&#xD;
      Keratopathy (NK) in stages 2 and 3 treated with topical insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A retrospective, observational analysis of eyes with NK in stages 2 and 3 refractory&#xD;
      to standard medical and/or surgical treatment which were treated with topical insulin.&#xD;
      Topical insulin (1 unit per mL) was applied 4 times a day; treatment was continued until&#xD;
      persistent epithelial defect (PED) or ulcer resolved and then tapered accordingly. The&#xD;
      primary outcome of the study was the complete resolution of the PED or ulcer. Best-corrected&#xD;
      visual acuity (BCVA), days until complete resolution as well as anterior segment photographs&#xD;
      were obtained.&#xD;

      Study type&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective, observational, single-center study at the Department of Ophthalmology of&#xD;
      Centro Hospitalar Vila Nova de Gaia e Espinho, EPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data was obtained from patients' medical records and anterior segment photographs from&#xD;
      October 1, 2018 to November 1, 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant and/or relative was given a detailed explanation and a written informed&#xD;
      consent regarding possible alternatives, risks and benefits of off-label use of topical&#xD;
      insulin drops. This study was approved by the board of Centro Hospitalar de Vila Nova de Gaia&#xD;
      e Espinho (UIEC-2020-981914339595fa024c567ec5). This study complied with the tenets of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in this study were provided from the Cornea department of the Ophthalmology&#xD;
      center in Centro Hospitalar de Vila Nova de Gaia e Espinho. Every patient included had an&#xD;
      established diagnosis of NK (ICD10: H16.2) in stages 2 or 3 that was refractory to standard&#xD;
      medical and/or surgical treatment and underwent treatment with topical insulin. All patients&#xD;
      underwent complete ophthalmological exam including best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp&#xD;
      examination, corneal sensitivity in the center and four quadrants of the cornea and&#xD;
      fundoscopic evaluation. NK was graded based on slit-lamp and fluorescein stain findings -&#xD;
      stage 2: epithelial defect (with or without a rim of loose epithelium) without stromal&#xD;
      ulceration; stage 3: corneal ulceration and/or stromal lysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical insulin preparation and administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical insulin drops were prepared by diluting 1 unit of fast-acting insulin per 1 mL of an&#xD;
      artificial tear with a propylene glycol base. Drops were preserved at low temperature (2ºC)&#xD;
      and were applied four times a day. A therapeutic corneal CL was placed in every patient and&#xD;
      fluoroquinolone drops were applied to prevent possible CL side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment was continued until NK PED or Ulcer resolved and tapered accordingly. Patients&#xD;
      would discontinue topical insulin if the condition did not improve within 30 days or worsen.&#xD;
      Follow-up was ensured on the 3rd,5th, and 7th day and then individualized during the&#xD;
      full-extent of treatment. Anterior segment photos were taken on each visit.&#xD;

          3. Clinical history of conditions related to trigeminal innervation impairment;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Standard treatment - lubrication with artificial tears, topical and/or oral&#xD;
                  antibiotics, topical and/or oral steroids, antiviral drugs, punctal plugs,&#xD;
                  therapeutic CL, amniotic membrane surgery and temporary tarsorrhaphy.´&#xD;
