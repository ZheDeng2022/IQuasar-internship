      Antibiotic resistance is a major threat in modern medicine. Overuse of antibiotics is an&#xD;
      important driver of antibiotic resistance. However, some authors have shown that up to 50% of&#xD;
      antibiotic treatments in critically ill patients are inappropriate, mostly because they are&#xD;
      used in patients with non-bacterial infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to improve antibiotic use, several antibiotic stewardship programs have been&#xD;
      implemented worldwide. However, only few of them have taken into account the determinants of&#xD;
      prescribing behaviors. Yet, these determinants have been shown to play a role among general&#xD;
      practitioners of hospital doctors. Nevertheless, none of these factors have been studied&#xD;
      among intensivists.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Antibiotic resistance is a major threat in modern medicine. Overuse of antibiotics is an&#xD;
      important driver of antibiotic resistance. In critical care setting, antibiotic therapies are&#xD;
      widely used due to the high number of patients presenting with sepsis. However, some authors&#xD;
      have shown that up to 50% of antibiotic treatments in critically ill patients are&#xD;
      inappropriate, mostly because they are used in patients with non-bacterial infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to improve antibiotic use, several antibiotic stewardship programs have been&#xD;
      implemented worldwide. However, only few of them have taken into account the determinants of&#xD;
      prescribing behaviors. Yet, these determinants have been shown to play a role among general&#xD;
      practitioners of hospital doctors. Nevertheless, none of these factors have been studied&#xD;
      among intensivists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to investigate social, cultural, contextual and personal factors&#xD;
      influencing antibiotic prescribing among French intensivists. The design will consist of&#xD;
      three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1: construction and validation of a questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2: the questionnaire will be sent to all intensivist, including residents, in&#xD;
           France&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 3: qualitative study, based on semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project represent phase 1 of the study.&#xD;

This questionnaire will include these items: demographic datas, medical data concerning the use of antibiotics, social data exploring the collective and social components of antibiotic prescription, personal data in search of individual factors, attitude to antibiotic therapy.</description>

    <description>For the validity of built, it is generally advisable to include a ratio of 100 participants for 30 questionnaire items. In order to have a suitable questionnaire, we will limit ourselves to 30 items which will be the size of our questionnaire. It was therefore planned to include 100 participants The selection of experts will be based on experience in this area, knowledge and availability. It will be a rescimant physician and an infectious disease doctor. Each expert will be invited in isolation to comment on the items in the questionnaire</description>
