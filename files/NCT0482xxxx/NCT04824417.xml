  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current initial therapy for CPA is with six months of oral itraconazole. However, the&#xD;
      response with six months of therapy has a response rate of 65-70% and has a relapse rate&#xD;
      after stopping treatment of up to 50%. Voriconazole is a third-generation azole and a&#xD;
      theoretical advantage of lower MICs compared to itraconazole. Also, oral voriconazole has&#xD;
      good availability (95%) in fasting state. This is likely to improve the response rate and&#xD;
      reduce the chances of relapse of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. There is no head to head&#xD;
      comparison of oral itraconazole with oral voriconazole. In this study we intent to compare&#xD;
      the clinical outcomes with six months of therapy with oral itraconazole versus oral&#xD;
      voriconazole for management of treatment naïve subjects with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis&#xD;

      Aspergillus is a saprophytic fungus which is present normally in our surroundings and causes&#xD;
      a large number of pulmonary diseases spreading through inhalational route. The spectrum of&#xD;
      disease caused by aspergillus spp. is wide with the manifestations of the disease being&#xD;
      governed primarily by the status of the underlying host immunity, which then determines the&#xD;
      nature of the host-aspergillus interaction. Patients with an intact immunity have a more&#xD;
      stable and indolent form of disease like aspergilloma whereas with a worsening immune status,&#xD;
      the risk of invasive disease increases. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) and allergic&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) are two of the commonest pulmonary manifestations seen&#xD;
      in non-immunocompromised patients whereas invasive pulmonary aspergillosis being more common&#xD;
      in the immunocompromised patients.(1-3) Estimates suggest that CPA affects around 3 million&#xD;
      people across the globe, which may still be an under estimated number as the disease co&#xD;
      exists with other pulmonary co-morbidities which make accurate diagnosis a pitfall. In India&#xD;
      the annual incidence of CPA was estimated in 2011 and varied between 27,000-0.17 million&#xD;
      cases, with different estimates. Based on the mortality rate for CPA which was estimated to&#xD;
      be 15% annually, the 5-year prevalence of CPA was placed at 290,147 cases with 5-year&#xD;
      prevalence rate being 24 per 100,000 in the same year.(4, 5) The disease confers significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, making it a significant burden for the society as well as the&#xD;
      healthcare. Apart from the respiratory symptoms, CPA causes significant constitutional&#xD;
      symptoms as well which adds to the misery of the patient. The diagnosis of CPA is based on&#xD;
      presence of chronic symptoms, consistent radiology and demonstration of Aspergillus by direct&#xD;
      (culture) or indirect (serological) methods.(1-3) Even though CPA is more of a disease&#xD;
      spectrum but overall it is characterized by slowly progressive lung cavitation which may or&#xD;
      may not show presence of mycetoma /fungal ball in patients with pre-existing structural lung&#xD;
      diseases, even though other patterns have also been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment options majorly consist of medical management with at least 6-month long&#xD;
      treatment with antifungal drugs - most significantly the azole groups. Itraconazole is the&#xD;
      preferred azole for the treatment of CPA.(6-8) However the response with itraconazole is seen&#xD;
      in around 60-75% of the subjects.(9) Moreover, about 30%-50% of the subjects have disease&#xD;
      relapse that requires prolonged therapy. The lower response could be because of variable&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and drug absorption of oral itraconazole. Also, itraconazole has many drug&#xD;
      interactions. Voriconazole is a third-generation azole and is currently the therapy of choice&#xD;
      for invasive aspergillosis due to its lower minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values&#xD;
      compared to itraconazole. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of voriconazole are not variable&#xD;
      and oral form has a good bioavailability (up to 95%). In a previous study, the use of&#xD;
      voriconazole resulted in radiological control in 97% of the subjects and a significant&#xD;
      improvement in patients' symptoms but global success at six-months was only seen in 32%&#xD;
      subjects.(10) However, despite being multicenter the study only included 48 subjects.&#xD;
      Moreover, there was no control group and the authors did not use therapeutic dose monitoring.&#xD;
      In addition, the study also included subjects with subacute invasive aspergillosis (SAIA).&#xD;
      Thus, there is lack of information regarding the role of voriconazole in subjects with CPA.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the use of voriconazole will be associated with better treatment outcomes&#xD;
      compared with oral itraconazole in treatment naïve subjects with CPA. In this randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, we compare the clinical outcomes of six months therapy with oral&#xD;
      itraconazole with oral voriconazole in treatment naïve subjects with chronic pulmonary&#xD;
      aspergillosis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The cases will include treatment naïve consecutive subjects with chronic cavitary pulmonary&#xD;
        aspergillosis (CPA). The diagnosis of CPA will be made by a multidisciplinary team&#xD;
        (pulmonary physicians, radiologist and microbiologist) based on composite of clinical,&#xD;
        radiological and microbiological criteria.(9, 10) This includes presence of all the&#xD;
        following: (i) one or more clinical symptoms (persistent cough, recurrent hemoptysis,&#xD;
        weight loss, malaise, fever and dyspnea) for ≥3 months; (ii) slowly progressive or&#xD;
        persistent radiological findings (one or more cavities and surrounding fibrosis,&#xD;
        infiltrates, consolidation, with or without fungal ball or progressive pleural thickening)&#xD;
        on computed tomography (CT) of the thorax; (iii) immunological (A.fumigatus-specific IgG&#xD;
        &gt;27 mgA/L or positive Aspergillus precipitins) or microbiological evidence of Aspergillus&#xD;
        infection (growth of Aspergillus in respiratory secretions or serum galactomannan index&#xD;
        &gt;0.6 or BALF galactomannan index &gt;1.4); and, (iv) exclusion of other pulmonary disorders&#xD;
        with similar presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with any of the following will be excluded: (i) failure to provide informed&#xD;
        consent; (ii) patients on immunosuppressive drugs, intake of prednisolone (or equivalent)&#xD;
        &gt;10 mg for at least 3 weeks or a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus syndrome; (iii)&#xD;
        intake antifungal azoles for &gt;3 weeks in the preceding six months; (iv) subjects with&#xD;
        active pulmonary infection due to mycobacterium tuberculosis or mycobacteria other than&#xD;
        tuberculosis (MOTT); (v) subjects with others forms of pulmonary aspergillosis (allergic&#xD;
        bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic necrotizing aspergillosis and angio-invasive&#xD;
        aspergillosis); and, (vi) pregnancy.&#xD;
