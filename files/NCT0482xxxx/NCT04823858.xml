    <textblock>
      This study is designed to collect real world evidence (RWE) safety and efficacy data on&#xD;
      patients who plan to undergo a single-level TLIF instrumented with pedicle screws, using the&#xD;
      framework of a prospective clinical study (with defined enrollment criteria and pre-specified&#xD;
      research follow-up timepoints).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multi-center (up to 15), non-blinded study of patients who plan to undergo a&#xD;
      single-level TLIF stabilized with pedicle screws. Investigators who perform instrumented&#xD;
      TLIFs will be selected for participation prior to enrolling subjects into the study.&#xD;
      Investigators will only select those patients who are planned for treatment with on-label use&#xD;
      of FDA cleared TLIF devices (cage and screw system).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 200 subjects with a potential sample size re-estimation at completion. The subjects&#xD;
      will return for follow-up at 6-weeks, 3-months, 6-months, and then annually for 5-years post&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
