      This is a Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double masked, parallel design study in&#xD;
      healthy subjects performed in the US. It is designed to evaluate the safety and anesthetic&#xD;
      efficacy of AG-920 Sterile Topical Ophthalmic Solution. In this study, subjects who provide&#xD;
      informed consent and fulfill all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of AG-920 or identical looking&#xD;
      placebo into the study eye. Subjects will undergo a conjunctival pinch procedure and the pain&#xD;
      associated with the pinch rated.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The Investigator(s), Sponsor, and the subject will be masked to treatment assignment throughout the conduct of the study. Exceptions to this are limited to one statistician at the Contract Research Organization (CRO) who will prepare the randomization code, and three people at the Sponsor who will review the batch records and release product. None of these unmasked persons will be involved in the day to day execution of the study. The masking will be broken after database lock.</masking_description>

    <description>Articaine Sterile Topical Ophthalmic Solution (AG-920) is a sterile, isotonic, non-preserved aqueous solution containing the active ingredient Articaine HCl 8%, Boric Acid, Mannitol, Sodium Acetate Trihydrate, Glacial Acetic Acid, and Edetate Disodium Dihydrate. The product formulation is adjusted to pH 4.5 to 5.0. Each subject randomized to AG-920 will receive a single dose of 2 drops 30 seconds apart from a single vial into study eye.</description>
