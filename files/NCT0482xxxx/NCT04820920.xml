  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pilot trial aims to test the feasibility, acceptability and cultural appropriateness of&#xD;
      online LTP+CaCBT for treating postnatal depression and to improve the mental health and&#xD;
      wellbeing of mothers and their children in the UK.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who scored 5 or above on Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) will be would be&#xD;
      recruited and randomly assigned into one of two groups (experimental or controlled).&#xD;
      Experimental groups will receive the online LTP+CaCBT treatment - the intervention will&#xD;
      consist of a total of 12 group training sessions (approx. 60 minutes each). The controlled&#xD;
      groups will receive 'placebo effects' in the form of psychoeducation involving basic&#xD;
      discussions around mother-child relationships, childcare, child nursing related activities&#xD;
      and general maternal discussions. Each of the two groups (both experimental and controlled)&#xD;
      will be comprised of approximately 10 mother-child pairs per sub-group.&#xD;
