    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomised, positive-controlled, study to assess the neurocognitive&#xD;
      function of upfront Osimertinib compared to whole-brain irradiation (WBI) plus Osimertinib in&#xD;
      EGFR-mutant (Ex 19Del and L858R) NSCLC patients with symptomatic brain metastases, as well as&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Account for patients with wild type EGFR, sample attrition , incidence rate of symptomatic&#xD;
      brain metastasis(10%) and any other reasons for screen failure rate(50%), it is esimated that&#xD;
      88 patients will be randomized from 5 sites. Patients will be randomized 1:1, the&#xD;
      experimental arm is upfront Osimertinib with WBI sequential therapy, while the control arm is&#xD;
      Osimertinib plus WBI. Osimertinib at a dose of 80 mg once per day, until unacceptable adverse&#xD;
      events or disease progression occurred. WBI could be given to patients in experimental arm at&#xD;
      any time base on investigator's decision after treatment initiated. Patients will be&#xD;
      stratifed at randomization by GPA score (3.5-4 vs &lt;3.5) and the mutation type (Ex19Del /&#xD;
      L858R). Patients will undergo the neurocognition, efficacy and safety assessments at&#xD;
      baseline, and every 8 weeks until treatment is completed or discontinued. About time to brain&#xD;
      metastases symptoms deterioration, the assessment was repeated in the first week (on site),&#xD;
      second week (through telephone) and fourth week (on site). The rest assessment will be as&#xD;
      well as other evaluations repeated every 8 weeks. To evaluate the correlation and predictive&#xD;
      or prognostic value between gene dynamic changes and clinical efficacy, the tissue, plasma&#xD;
      and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples will be collected at baseline. CSF will be collected in&#xD;
      patients with intracranial progression. Plasma will be collected in all the patients at&#xD;
      disease progression, while tissue is optional. Also, plasma will be collected at week 8(first&#xD;
      evaluation of efficacy).&#xD;
