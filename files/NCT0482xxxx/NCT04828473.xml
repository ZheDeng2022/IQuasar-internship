  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to determine whether exposure to a narrow band of green light&#xD;
      (NBGL) improved sleep quality in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a within-subject study design that examines NBGL effects on sleep onset, sleep&#xD;
      fractures (i.e., how many times per night the subjects wake up), total sleep duration, and&#xD;
      sleep quality using high-resolution assessments. To complete the study, each participant will&#xD;
      complete a 30-day, daily sleep diary while using white light (i.e., being in regular room&#xD;
      light) during the last 2 hours of their waking period. This period will be defined as the&#xD;
      baseline/control arm of the study. After completing this phase 1, subjects will receive a&#xD;
      lamp designed to emit the narrow band of green light and again be asked to complete a 30-day,&#xD;
      daily sleep diary, but this timer while using the NBGL light (i.e., being in what appears&#xD;
      green light) during the last 2 hours of their waking period. This period will be defined as&#xD;
      the active arm of the study. After completing this phase 2,&#xD;

      Sleep quality will be assessed using the Consensus sleep diary [Carney et al., (2012)] The&#xD;
      consensus sleep diary: Standardizing prospective sleep self-monitoring, Sleep Vol.35, No.2,&#xD;
      pp.287-302], the latter of which captures total sleep time, sleep latency, wake after sleep&#xD;
      onset, number of awakenings, quality, sleep efficiency, and trouble staying awake.&#xD;

    <description>this primary outcome measures improvement in sleep quality during the month in which subjects used the green light as compared to the month in which they used the regular room light. Sleep quality will be measured by the Consensus Sleep Diary. THe Consensus Sleep Diary requires subjects to answer 8 questions by depicting numbers that represent best their answers. These numbers provide the basis for our ability to quantify the difference between the two light conditions of the study.</description>

    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Allay Lamp</intervention_name>
    <description>The Allay Lamp is a consumer product currently available and widely used in the US. It emits low intensity (1-10lux)narrow band (20nm) green light (peak wavelength 520nm) that is marketed as non-irritating to users. In that context, it is not a medical device and does not require a 510(k). However, we believe that light likely also has benefits for sleep. To better understand its effects,we are planning to conduct the proposed study. In that context, the Allay Lamp would be considered an investigational medical device because it has not been cleared or approved by FDA for the intended purpose of treating sleep. No FDA submission should be necessary for this study using 21 C.F.R. 812.3, because the Allay Lamp is a non-significant risk (NSR) device:&#xD;
It is not an implant&#xD;
It is not intended for use in supporting or sustaining human life The Allay Lamp provides a very low risk light-based therapy. The light provides no more risk than any other table lamp available on the market today.</description>
