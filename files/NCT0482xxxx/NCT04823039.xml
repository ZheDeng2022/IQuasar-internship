  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccination is established as an effective means of individual and collective protection.&#xD;
      Hospitalization is an opportunity not to be missed to catch up on vaccinations in certain&#xD;
      fragile patients. Patients hospitalized in infectious diseases are generally treated for an&#xD;
      acute or chronic infection that can modulate their immunity and therefore their vaccine&#xD;
      response. Current vaccine immunogenicity data in immunocompromised patients support a lower&#xD;
      percentage of responders than observed in immunocompetent patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is little data to assess the vaccine response (VR) in patients treated for an infection&#xD;
      (bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, etc.). In order to respond to this problem,&#xD;
      the investigators have chosen to evaluate the vaccine response to Prevenar 13 (PCV13), a&#xD;
      conjugate vaccine recommended as a prime-boost since 2013, which must be followed by a&#xD;
      vaccination at 2 months with Pneumovax, an unconjugated vaccine of 23 valences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-pneumococcal vaccine coverage in frail people (immunocompromised, heart failure,&#xD;
      respiratory failure, kidney failure, diabetics) remains low and is estimated at less than 10%&#xD;
      in 2011, while the bacteria is responsible for severe invasive infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, the investigators would like to study the vaccine response at 1 month of&#xD;
      vaccination with Prevenar 13 in patients hospitalized in infectious disease for sepsis, in&#xD;
      order to demonstrate the benefit of vaccination per hospitalization.&#xD;
