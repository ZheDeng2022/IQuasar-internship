    <measure>Change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), End of treatment (week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADARS) is a 10-item instrument used for the evaluation of depressive symptoms in adults and for the assessment of any changes to those symptoms. Each of the 10 items is rated on a scale of 0 to 6, with differing descriptors for each item. These individual item scores are added together to form a total score, which can range between 0 and 60 points, higher score indicating poorer health outcomes. The MADRS provides a measure of the overall level of depression.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Self-Report [QIDS-SR] Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), End of treatment (week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Self-Report (QIDS-SR) is a 16-item self-rated instrument designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. The 16 items cover the nine symptom domains of major depression and are rated on a scale of 0-3. Total score ranges from 0 to 27, with ranges of 0-5 (normal), 6-10 (mild), 11-15 (moderate), 16-20 (moderate to severe), and 21+ (severe).</description>

    <measure>Change in Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), End of treatment (week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) is a well-validated 14-item self-report questionnaire commonly used to assess anhedonia. Each item on the SHAPS is worded so that higher scores indicate greater pleasure capacity. A total score can be derived by summing the responses to each item. Items answered with &quot;strongly agree&quot; are coded as &quot;1&quot;, while a &quot;strongly disagree&quot; response was assigned a score of &quot;4.&quot; Total scores on the SHAPS can range from 14 to 56, with higher scores corresponding to higher levels of anhedonia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), End of treatment (week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS) is an 18-item self-report measurement of anhedonia which consists of a series of statements that must be rated according to how accurate they are for the individual. The scale produces a sub-score that differentiates the role of anticipatory pleasure ('wanting') and is derived of 10 items. Total scores range is 16-108. Lower scores indicate greater levels of anhedonia.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), End of treatment (week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a widely administered clinician rated scale that assesses the subject overall illness severity and the degree of improvement from the initial assessment.&#xD;
Illness severity is rated on a 1-7 scale where 1 corresponds to &quot;Normal, Not at All Ill&quot;, 2 is &quot;Borderline Mentally Ill&quot;, the anchor for 3 is &quot;Mildly Ill&quot;, the anchor for 4 is &quot;Moderately Ill&quot;, 5 is &quot;Markedly Ill&quot;, 6 is &quot;Severely Ill&quot;, and 7 is &quot;Among the Most Extremely Ill Patients&quot;.&#xD;
The degree of improvement is rated on a 1-7 scale where 1 corresponds to &quot;Very Much Improved&quot;, 2 is &quot;Much Improved&quot;, the anchor for 3 is &quot;Minimally Improved&quot;, the anchor for 4 is &quot;No Change&quot;, 5 is &quot;Minimally Worse&quot;, 6 is &quot;Much Worse&quot;, and 7 is &quot;Very Much Worse&quot;.</description>
