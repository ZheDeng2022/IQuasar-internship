  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin disease, resulting from genetical,&#xD;
      immunological and environmental factors. Head and neck are among the most frequent involved&#xD;
      areas, almost 50% in adult patients according to most publications. Palpebral involvement is&#xD;
      also common and a source of major quality of life impairment for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the real frequency of this palpebral involvement is unknown, only estimated about&#xD;
      20% in few studies. The treatment of this location remains difficult, regarding to the&#xD;
      thickness of palpebral skin and proximity of the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, no prospective studies about allergological skin tests (such as&#xD;
      patch-tests) in atopic patients with palpebral involvement had been conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, atopic dermatitis is frequently associated with ophthalmological diseases such as&#xD;
      conjunctivitis, keratoconus or cataract, which belong to the minor criteria of Hanifin and&#xD;
      Rakja classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better knowledge of the atopic dermatitis palpebral involvement and the associated factors&#xD;
      seems to be needed to improve the treatment and the quality of life of patients&#xD;
