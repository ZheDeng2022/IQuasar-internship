  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) are characterized by subacute onset of memory deficits, altered&#xD;
      mental status or psychiatric symptoms, frequently associated with seizures, inflammatory&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid and in cases with prominent limbic involvement, typical magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging. Several autoantibodies (Abs) may be detected in AE, although its detection&#xD;
      is not mandatory to establish a diagnosis. These Abs mainly recognize different synaptic and&#xD;
      cell-surface proteins in the central nervous system, and are thought to be pathogenic as they&#xD;
      alter the normal location or function of its antigens. Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes&#xD;
      (PNS) are immune-mediated, remote complications of cancer. The clinical presentation is&#xD;
      highly diverse, from central nervous system disorders (limbic encephalitis, cerebellar&#xD;
      ataxia) to peripheral neuropathies and neuromuscular junction diseases. Two different kinds&#xD;
      of Abs are associated with PNS: a first group known as onconeural Abs, which recognize&#xD;
      intracellular antigens and are thought not to be pathogenic; and a second one whose targeted&#xD;
      synaptic and cell-surface antigens shared with some non-paraneoplastic AE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary trigger of the immune response is unknown for most of AE. In addition to acquired&#xD;
      susceptibility such as herpes simplex encephalitis, genetic predisposition may also be&#xD;
      important in the pathogenesis of AE. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is the genetic factor most&#xD;
      frequently associated with autoimmune diseases, due to its genetic complexity and key role in&#xD;
      the adaptive immune response. Others and we already described the HLA haplotypes associated&#xD;
      with three types different of AE: anti-leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1),&#xD;
      anti-contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2), and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase&#xD;
      (GAD). Nevertheless, the genetic predisposition of many other AE has not been investigated&#xD;
      yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer is considered as the trigger of the immune response that lead to PNS development, as&#xD;
      the neural antigens recognized by the onconeural Abs are also expressed by tumor cells.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, it is still unknown why some patients develop PNS and others do not, even if&#xD;
      they present the same histological type of tumor, suggesting that some particular, maybe&#xD;
      genetic, characteristics of the patients may play a role in this susceptibility. Furthermore,&#xD;
      there is already evidence that, for those neurological diseases that may appear either as PNS&#xD;
      or as non-paraneoplastic autoimmune disorder (i.e. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome), HLA&#xD;
      profiles are not the same.&#xD;

    <description>This is a non-interventional study involving biological samples (DNA). Samples are already stored in biobank repositories and collected as part of &quot;good clinical practice&quot; in the diagnostic process of patients with suspected autoimmune encephalitis, meaning that the standard diagnostic and therapeutic approaches will not be altered in the selected study population. Patients have already gave explicit written consent for biological specimens sampling and storage at the &quot;Centre de Ressources Biologiques des Hospices Civils de Lyon&quot; (CRB-HCL)/NeuroBioTec (including tissue, cells or biological fluids) and genetic analysis for research purposes (e.g. involving genes related to the disease for which the patient was followed). Additionally, patients will be informed about the present study.</description>
