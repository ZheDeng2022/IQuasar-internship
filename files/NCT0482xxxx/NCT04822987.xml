  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Harmful alcohol use is a global risk factor for disease, injuries and death. Research on&#xD;
      treatment of Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) indicates that different treatment modalities are&#xD;
      equally effective, but also that a large group of patients do not change their drinking&#xD;
      pattern despite being in treatment. It is assumed that it is not random who benefits from&#xD;
      treatment. Thirty to forty percent of outcome variance in treatment is probably explained by&#xD;
      patient factors, and we need more knowledge on how different patient factors moderate&#xD;
      treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, clinicians also need more knowledge about selecting patients to different therapies.&#xD;
      The present study will investigate how patient factors predict outcome in group treatment of&#xD;
      AUDs, and what predicts positive treatment outcomes over time. The study is designed as a&#xD;
      quasi-experimental, multi-centre, follow-up study. Patients will be included from Vestfold&#xD;
      Hospital Trust, Borgestadklinikken, Blue Cross Clinic, Behandlingssenteret Eina, Blue Cross&#xD;
      Clinic and A-senteret, Oslo, Church City Mission. The Project will provide more knowledge&#xD;
      about patients seeking treatment for AUDs, and specifically how patient factors predict&#xD;
      outcome in group treatment. These results will in turn lead to better selection of treatment&#xD;
      modalities, and patients will receive a more effective treatment earlier on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main aims: 1) How do patient factors predict outcome in group treatment of alcohol use&#xD;
      disorders (AUDs)? 2) Do positive treatment outcomes last over time? Specifically, do the&#xD;
      following factors: a) psychiatric comorbidity b) severity of alcohol use pre-treatment c)&#xD;
      personality disorders and d) cognitive impairments predict 1) completion of group treatment&#xD;
      and 2) positive outcome after 1 year. As an additional aim, we will investigate if the&#xD;
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCa) is feasible as a brief screening instrument for&#xD;
      mild cognitive impairments for AUD patients.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESES, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective of the study is to increase the knowledge of addiction treatment, and&#xD;
      how therapy can be made more effective, especially in the case of AUD. In particular, the&#xD;
      project will study how patient characteristics interact with treatment and influence therapy&#xD;
      outcome. The main research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How do patient factors moderate treatment outcome in group therapy with patients with&#xD;
           AUD? The following variables will be investigated: Severity of alcohol dependence,&#xD;
           symptom disorders, personality disorders, cognitive deficits and demographic variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do positive treatment outcomes last over time? The participants will be followed up&#xD;
           after one and three years post-treatment to see if recovery persists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCa) feasible as a brief screening instrument for&#xD;
           mild cognitive impairments in patients with AUD? At face value, this instrument contains&#xD;
           rather crude tasks, which seems to make it more sensitive to large cognitive deficits&#xD;
           than small. By comparing MoCa results to more extended neuropsychological testing we&#xD;
           will assess the correlations, sensitivity and specificity of impairment assessed with&#xD;
           MoCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has two main aims. The first primary aim is predictors of successful treatment&#xD;
      completion operationalized as percentage of participation in therapeutic activities. The&#xD;
      second primary aim is predictors for effect of group therapy one year after treatment&#xD;
      termination. Primary outcome variable is alcohol and substance use reduction, measured with&#xD;
      AUDIT and DUDIT. Secondary outcomes are symptom level measured with SCL-90 and quality of&#xD;
      life measured with WHOQOL-bref. In addition, register data concerning use of health services&#xD;
      after finishing treatment, and participation in working life, will be collected three years&#xD;
      after treatment completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed as a quasi-experimental, multi-centre study on treatment in&#xD;
      ordinary clinical practice. The study will include at least 120 patients (approximately 40&#xD;
      participants pr. fall and spring-inclusion term). Four data collection sites are included in&#xD;
      the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients enrolled in treatment at the Department of Addiction treatment, Vestfold&#xD;
           Hospital Trust&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients enrolled in residential treatment at the Borgestad Blue Cross Clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients enrolled in residential treatment at the Blue Cross Clinic, Treatment center&#xD;
           Eina&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients enrolled in residential treatment at A-senteret, The Church City Mission&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study will be patients group treatment for a primary diagnosis of AUD.&#xD;
      Treatment is administered in a time-limited format at all sites. The therapy format may vary&#xD;
      to some degree, but is similar in overall structure and content. In this quasi-experimental&#xD;
      study research is carried out in an ordinary clinical situation, and study attempts to&#xD;
      investigate the complexity of clinical practice. As a result, the researchers do not have&#xD;
      control over all of the variables, but the results will be more ecologically valid with a&#xD;
      higher degree of generalizibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT ARRANGEMENTS, METHOD SELECTION AND ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use well-researched tools and methods, used in both research and ordinary&#xD;
      clincial practice. The following information will be entered in the registry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient pre-therapy background: Earlier treatment episodes and diagnoses, demographic&#xD;
      variables (age, sex, education, marital status, economical situation) will be retrieved from&#xD;
      participants' journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening pre-treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Short structured diagnostic&#xD;
           interview for Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders IV&#xD;
           (DSM-IV)-diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Severity indices of personality problems (SIPP-118). Self-report questionnaire focusing&#xD;
           on core components of mal-adaptive personality functioning. 118 questions scored on a 4&#xD;
           point&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Montreal Cognitive assessment (MoCa). A 10 minute screening tool to assist clinicians in&#xD;
           detecting mild cognitive impairments. Yields a maximum score of 30. Cut-off under 26,&#xD;
           indicating cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV). Measures core aspects of intelligence&#xD;
           (estimate of General Ability Index). The following subtests will be administered:&#xD;
           Similarities, Information, Visual puzzles, Block design and Digit span.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS). Measures executive functioning. (Color&#xD;
           Word Interference Test and tasks 2-4 from Trail Making Test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening pre- and post-treatment, and after 1 and 3 years:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Alcohol disorders identification test (AUDIT). 10 item self-report questionnaire for&#xD;
           identifying harmful drinking and dependence. Responses are scored on a scale from 0 to&#xD;
           4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Drug disorders identification test (DUDIT). 11 item self-report questionnaire for drug&#xD;
           problems. Responses are scored on a scale from 0 to 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Symptom check list 90-R (SCL-90-R). Self-report inventory, 90 questions. Scored on a 4&#xD;
           point scale. Measures severity of psychological distress. Will be administered&#xD;
           pre-treatment, post-treatment and after 1 and 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. World health organization quality of life scale (WHOQOL-BREF). Measures quality of life&#xD;
           on four dimensions: Sensory abilities, autonomy in the past, present and future&#xD;
           activities and social participation. 26 items scored on a 1 to 5 Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening post-treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Treatment satisfaction: 10 questions about treatment satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Register data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, after 3 years, register data from patient journals and from NAV will be&#xD;
      collected concerning working status, economical benefits and if the patient have undergone&#xD;
      more treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both intention to treat and per protocol analyses will be carried out on all participants and&#xD;
      those who complete the treatment and data collection, until the last point of assessment.&#xD;
      Mixed methods analyses may be used to include patients with incomplete protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures will be subjected to regression analyses to test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How much of the outcome can be explained by substance use before treatment (AUDIT,&#xD;
           DUDIT)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How much are explained by psychological distress (SCL-90-R: GSI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How much are explained by cognitive deficits?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How much are explained by demographic variables? (Age, sex, education level)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will seek to use hierarchical regression analyses transcending the single predictor&#xD;
      domains by entering those measures from each domain that correlates highest with outcome and&#xD;
      lowest with predictors from other domains. For the first analyses there are only one outcome&#xD;
      measure (participation in group treatment). For the second set of analyses (function after&#xD;
      one year) there are multiple outcome measures (drinking/substance abuse, symptom level,&#xD;
      function and quality of life). Thus, we will seek to construct a gross overall composite&#xD;
      outcome measure based on normative data from the tests used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For non-continuous data (axis 1 diagnosis, gender and marital status) analyses of variance&#xD;
      will be computed with group-characteristics as independent variable and outcome as dependent.&#xD;
      It is reasonable to assume that patients with combinations of substance abuse profiles,&#xD;
      symptom level, cognitive impairments and demographic factors may constitute specific groups&#xD;
      (clusters) with different prognosis. Cluster analysis will be applied to unravel distinct&#xD;
      combinations of factors associated with good or poor prognosis. As an experiment, one&#xD;
      substance use measure, one symptom distress measure, one cognitive functioning measure and&#xD;
      one or two demographic markers will be included in the analysis. Cluster analysis is merely&#xD;
      an explorative method designed to uncover post-hoc empirical groups with combinations of&#xD;
      features, but may discern individual patterns that will not be evident in analyses of group&#xD;
      means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL POWER&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important that the planned number of participants is sufficiently large to answer the&#xD;
      research questions. It is a quasi-experimental design in the sense that division into&#xD;
      subgroups are determined by attributes of the participants not under complete control by the&#xD;
      researchers. Regarding statistical power, the the following examples are computed: If it is&#xD;
      expected that 35 % (n=42) of the participants have an axis 1 diagnosis of major depression&#xD;
      and that this group will have somewhat over half a standard deviation (.55) higher score on&#xD;
      AUDIT/DUDIT one year after completed treatment, this difference will be statistically&#xD;
      significant on the five percent alpha-level if there are 41 and 76 persons in the two groups&#xD;
      (depression vs. absence of depression), which will then be within the planned sample size.&#xD;
      Continuous data will be analyzed with correlations and hierarchical regressions. Small effect&#xD;
      sizes (Cohen's d: .30) will be statistically significant on the five percent level with 85&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
