  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal obesity increases risks for the mother and her child. It is crucial to arouse the&#xD;
      pregnant and postpartum women´s willingness of change and motivation to take care of their&#xD;
      own and their unborn child´s health. Wearable devices can be helpful for weight-management,&#xD;
      e.g. in improving participant's self-efficacy in making healthy behavior changes, improving&#xD;
      self-awareness, in goal setting and getting feedback. More comprehensive research is required&#xD;
      to implement the optimal weight-management intervention for overweight women during pregnancy&#xD;
      and the postpartum period and to develop appropriate and feasible implementation strategies&#xD;
      to support nurses to deliver interventions in maternity clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Supporting Lifestyle Change in&#xD;
      Obese Pregnant Mothers Through Wearable Internet-of-Things (SLIM) intervention. Secondary aim&#xD;
      is to evaluate the implementation of SLIM intervention in maternity care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention was developed based on findings of overweight women and their care givers&#xD;
      interview study. The intervention targeting overweight pregnant women to improve their&#xD;
      weight-management will be delivered during routine perinatal visits from the first visit to&#xD;
      three months after child birth. Interventions core components will be goalsetting,&#xD;
      motivational interviewing, feedback and health technology. Health technology includes&#xD;
      Oura-ring and ZotCare -application. ZotCare -application combines data from Oura Smart Ring,&#xD;
      electronic food diary and it´s also platform for researchers to send e.g. questionnaires and&#xD;
      surveys to participants. Oura-smartring is an advanced technology ring that monitors e.g.&#xD;
      heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), steps, body temperature and sleep) and a smartphone&#xD;
      application that includes data from Oura, and electronic food diary. Data collected with Oura&#xD;
      -smartrings will be transmitted to cloud servers via a smartphone. The cloud will be&#xD;
      responsible for storing the data and for performing the data preprocessing and analysis&#xD;
      methods. Interventions primary outcome will be self-efficacy. Secondary outcomes will be&#xD;
      womens weight, depression symptoms, quality of life, pregnancy anxiety, perceived stress,&#xD;
      sence of coherence and acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of Intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected via Oura smartring, electronic food diary and validated measures:&#xD;
      Weight Efficacy Life-Style Questionnaire (WEL), Self-Efficacy for Physical Activity Scale&#xD;
      (PASE), six-factor questionnaire (6-FQ), Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R18),&#xD;
      WHOQOL-BREF, Sense of coherence (SOC-13), Pregnancy anxiety (PRAQ-R2), Perceived stress and&#xD;
      Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scale (EPDS). Intervention implementation will be evaluated&#xD;
      with process evaluation. Data will be collected from public health nurses working in&#xD;
      maternity clinics using focus group interviews and workshops.&#xD;

      Maternal obesity increases risks for the mother and her child. It is crucial to arouse the&#xD;
      pregnant and postpartum women´s willingness of change and motivation to take care of their&#xD;
      own and their unborn child´s health. Researchers have suggested that reﬁning the pre-existing&#xD;
      prenatal care models, possibly incorporating diet and physical activity into interventions,&#xD;
      could be useful. Continuous monitoring can provide real-time information between scheduled&#xD;
      appointments and thus may be helpful for targeting and tailoring pregnancy follow-up.&#xD;
      Wearable devices can be helpful for weight-management, e.g. in improving participant's&#xD;
      self-efficacy in making healthy behavior changes, improving self-awareness, in goal setting&#xD;
      and getting feedback. However, it's very important to identify and tailor the intervention&#xD;
      into individual motivations in order to facilitate technology adoption. Technological&#xD;
      solutions designed for the pregnant women, can balance the gap between limited resources and&#xD;
      growing demand of maternity care service. More comprehensive research is required to&#xD;
      implement the optimal weight-management intervention for overweight women during pregnancy&#xD;
      and the postpartum period and to develop appropriate and feasible implementation strategies&#xD;
      to support nurses to deliver interventions in maternity clinics.&#xD;

      is to evaluate the implementation of SLIM intervention in maternity care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention was developed based on findings of overweight women and their care givers&#xD;
      interview study. In addition, intervention was planned in collaboration with public health&#xD;
      nurses working in maternity clinics in workshops. The intervention targeting overweight&#xD;
      pregnant women to improve their weight-management will be delivered during routine perinatal&#xD;
      visits from the first visit to three months after child birth. Interventions core components&#xD;
      will be goalsetting, motivational interviewing, feedback and health technology. Health&#xD;

      Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scale (EPDS). Intervention implementation will be evaluated&#xD;
      with process evaluation. Interventions acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility will be&#xD;
      assessed with validated measures: Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM), Intervention&#xD;
      Appropriateness Measure (IAM), and Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM). Data will be&#xD;
      collected from public health nurses working in maternity clinics using focus group interviews&#xD;
