  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, 13% of the population had obesity in 2016 and overweight and obesity are&#xD;
      recognized as the fifth leading risk factor for death (roughly 5 million deaths per year). In&#xD;
      the United States alone, a recent study predicts that over half of the population will have&#xD;
      obesity in 2030. At the global level, overweight and obesity are also estimated to account&#xD;
      for 44% of diabetes, 23% of heart disease and between 7% to 41% of cancer cases, in addition&#xD;
      to numerous other pathologies, including neurological disorders. While obesity and overweight&#xD;
      are classified as a general disease (i.e. a body mass index (BMI) above 25 kg/m2 or 30 kg/m2,&#xD;
      respectively), there are large variabilities between classifications of obesity observed. For&#xD;
      example, sub-populations of obesity present either a rapid or delayed onset of other chronic&#xD;
      diseases, such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies show that lifestyle interventions are effective in improving overweight and&#xD;
      obesity through weight loss, but with very large inter-individual variability, especially in&#xD;
      the long-term. These interventions and the respective observed weight loss are also shown to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of other cardiovascular or metabolic diseases, demonstrating the importance&#xD;
      of weight loss for future quality of life Interestingly, there is a large variation in weight&#xD;
      loss when implementing the same dietary or lifestyle changes, even when many factors are&#xD;
      accounted for in clinical studies. Similar variable weight loss or metabolic responses are&#xD;
      also observed for other obesity treatments, such as pharmaceutical or surgical interventions.&#xD;
      Therefore, in order to prevent and treat overweight and obesity, it is critical to progress&#xD;
      in the understanding of individual variations in responses (trajectories) to weight loss&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While biological, environmental, and behavioral factors indeed drive personal responses,&#xD;
      recent advances have allowed more insight into how the human body processes these stimuli,&#xD;
      namely through microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract. Over the last 10 years,&#xD;
      the gut microbiota, the 100 billion bacterial cells inhabiting our intestines, has emerged as&#xD;
      a recognized factor contributing to our health. Given its access to the food and medicine&#xD;
      consumed by an individual, the gut microbiota can be seen as a &quot;super integrator&quot; highly&#xD;
      sensitive to our environmental and lifestyle changes. Accumulating evidence has highlighted&#xD;
      that the gut microbiota translates these environmental changes by altering its diversity of&#xD;
      bacteria or functions and producing molecules that interact with organs and the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of a weight loss program conducted within the standard of care in a network of&#xD;
      clinical centers across France, the investigators set out to establish a cohort to examine&#xD;
      the relative contribution of clinical, nutritional, and lifestyle factors related to&#xD;
      individual's weight loss success with an emphasis on evaluating the gut microbiome of&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this context, the investigators are testing whether an individuals' microbiota profile&#xD;
      before the real-life dietary intervention influences weight loss responses and changes in&#xD;
      metabolic health parameters to a standardized weight loss diet.&#xD;
