  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CCI-001 is a novel colchicine derivative that is being developed by PharmaMatrix Holdings&#xD;
      Ltd. (PharmaMatrix). The drug binds to tubulin, a component of the microtubule polymers which&#xD;
      are required for a wide range of cellular processes, perhaps most importantly, cell division&#xD;
      and mitosis. CCI-001 has been shown to bind more strongly to β-III tubulin, a tubulin subtype&#xD;
      which is overexpressed in many cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is being undertaken as a first-in-human, Phase I trial in patients with recurrent&#xD;
      and/or metastatic solid tumours. Primary Objectives are to examine the compound's safety&#xD;
      profile, to determine the recommended dose, and to determine pharmacokinetic parameters and&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives are to evaluate the clinical response rate and survival. Expansion&#xD;
      cohorts in in tumour types known to be sensitive to other approved agents with similar&#xD;
      mechanism of action will be treated at the recommended dose: transitional cell bladder&#xD;
      cancer, pancreaticobiliary adenocarcinomas, gynecologic cancers (ovarian, cervical,&#xD;
      endometrial), and lung adenocarcinoma.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is an open-label, single-arm, single-center, Phase I dose-escalation study of CCI-001 in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic solid tumours.&#xD;
Patients will be treated in cohorts of 3, with the starting cohort having an assigned dose of CCI-001 of 1.2 mg/m2. If safety criteria are met, subsequent cohorts will be administered escalating doses of CCI-001, using the modified accelerated dose-escalation method.&#xD;
Any cohort in which a patient experiences DLT in Cycle 1 will be expanded to 6 patients. Dose escalation will continue if only 1 of 6 patients in a cohort experiences DLT. If 2 patients within a cohort experience DLT, the maximum tolerated dose will have been reached/exceeded.&#xD;
The cohort at the dose below this cohort will be expanded to 6 patients to ensure tolerability. If none of the 3 additional patients at this lower dose experiences DLT, that dose will be declared as the recommended dose for the dose expansion phase.</intervention_model_description>
