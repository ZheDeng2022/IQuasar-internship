  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the use of a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS)&#xD;
      can reduce glycemic variability assessed by coefficient of variation (CV) during the acute&#xD;
      phase of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with diabetes treated by insulin infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to assess the impact of the use of CGMS on glycemic&#xD;
      variability in diabetic patients with ACS .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, multicenter (2 centers), open study. The patients included, as soon as&#xD;
      possible, after admission will be randomized before the beginning of insulin therapy with&#xD;
      intravenous insulin .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the use of a continuous glucose monitoring&#xD;
      system (CGMS) on glycemic variability in diabetic patients admitted in Intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) for an acute coronary syndrome ( ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) or&#xD;
      Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)) and treated with insulin infusion&#xD;
      with a standardized protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients in 2 centers will be included, and all patient will have the CGMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done in the 12 hours after admission. Participants will be randomized&#xD;
      in two groups :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conventional strategy: management of hyperglycemia with standard of care, glycemia&#xD;
           monitoring with capillary blood glucose measurement. The goal is to maintain glycemia&#xD;
           between 140-180mg/dL. CGMS will be blinded in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Novel strategy: management of hyperglycemia using CGMS. Measurements of CGMS will be&#xD;
           transmitted in real time to medical staff and use to maintain glycemia between&#xD;
           140-180mg/dL. Alarms will be set to warn medical staff in case of glycemia outside the&#xD;
           range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of follow-up for each patient will be 72 hours or until discharge from Intensive&#xD;
      care unit (if &lt;72 hours)&#xD;
