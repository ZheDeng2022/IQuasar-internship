  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fabry Disease (FD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder due to the absence or deficiency of&#xD;
      hydrolase α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) activity in lysosomes. This dysfunction results in&#xD;
      progressive accumulation of glycosphingolipids in a wide variety of cells, resulting in major&#xD;
      organ system damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Fabry disease can suffer from neuropathic pain, since lysosomal accumulation&#xD;
      affects small unmyelinated nerve fibers. Neuropathic pain is one of the prominent and&#xD;
      debilitating symptoms significantly interfering with life quality in FD patients. Current&#xD;
      treatment of Fabry patients with neuropathic pain is deficient, as they respond poorly to a&#xD;
      conventional pain therapy, often require a high-dose opioids treatment and presentation to&#xD;
      the Emergency Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sativex® has been shown to be a successful treatment option in neuropathic pain of different&#xD;
      origin with minimal neuropsychological influence: in multiple sclerosis (MS),&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain and other. It contains Δ-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)&#xD;
      and Cannabidiol (CBD) and has recently been licensed in Switzerland for treatment of&#xD;
      neuropathic chronic pain in MS. Sativex® is an oral spray.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of the enzyme&#xD;
      α-galactosidase A. Patients suffering from Fabry's disease may suffer from neuropathic pain,&#xD;
      since the lysosomal accumulation of lipids can also take place in the small nerve fibers.&#xD;
      Typically, neuropathic pain occurs in late childhood or adolescence and disappears after&#xD;
      several years, probably due to the irreversible destruction of the small nerve fibers. The&#xD;
      pain management of Fabry patients suffering from neuropathic pain is inadequate, as patients&#xD;
      often do not respond well to conventional pain therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to find out how strongly the investigational drug Sativex® (active&#xD;
      ingredients: tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)) can influence the pain that&#xD;
      can be caused by Fabry's disease. For this purpose, the investigational drug is compared with&#xD;
      a placebo drug. The latter is a drug without an active ingredient. These studies provide us&#xD;
      with important information on the origin of the pain and at the same time on the mechanism of&#xD;
      action of Sativex®. This makes it possible to develop new forms of therapy in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 22-30 patients are divided into two groups of 11-15 patients each. Both groups&#xD;
      will undergo the same test program. This will be divided into two phases: In the first phase,&#xD;
      which will last 8 weeks, one group will receive Sativex® while the other group will receive a&#xD;
      placebo. In the second phase, which will also last 8 weeks, the group that previously&#xD;
      received the investigational drug will now receive the placebo and the previous placebo group&#xD;
      will now receive the investigational drug. The study is double-blind, i.e. neither the&#xD;
      patient nor the investigator knows who is receiving the investigational drug or the placebo.&#xD;
      Patients are randomly assigned to the groups. Throughout the treatment, patients maintain&#xD;
      their usual pain management regimen. (see Study Schedule) For 14 weeks, patients will fill&#xD;
      out their pain diary daily. Every two weeks a blood sample is taken to determine the levels&#xD;
      of cannabinoid metabolites. At the beginning, at the end of the first and after the second&#xD;
      phase, the patient will fill out various questionnaires on neuropathic pain and improvement&#xD;
      of quality of life. This will be used to assess whether pain relief is achieved.&#xD;
