  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimal or absent of diurnal fluctuation in blood pressure, and specifically conditions in&#xD;
      which BP values are elevated during the night compared to daytime (rather than &quot;nighttime&#xD;
      dipping&quot;), are associated with higher rates of morbidity and all-cause mortality. However,&#xD;
      there is a gap in the scientific literature as to the optimal, individualized, timing of&#xD;
      administration of antihypertensive drugs to balance daytime/nighttime fluctuations in BP to&#xD;
      reduce the risk for cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the most widely used method for semi-continuous, ambulatory monitoring of BP is a&#xD;
      Holter, cuff-based monitor, which is cumbersome to use and therefore results in low patient&#xD;
      compliance. Despite various attempts to overcome this problem, practical, patient-friendly&#xD;
      methods for continuous BP monitoring throughout the day and night are currently not&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the main of this study was to investigate whether there is a differential effect of&#xD;
      timing of administration of antihypertensive drugs on diurnal fluctuations in BP using a&#xD;
      wearable, cuff-less sensor with continuous monitoring capabilities. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      evening medication will improve BP fluctuations throughout the day (e.g., allow nighttime&#xD;
      dipping and prevent morning surges) to a greater extend than morning meditation in people&#xD;
      with hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elevated blood pressure (i.e., hypertension) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity and all-cause mortality. Medical treatment can significantly improve the prognosis&#xD;
      of those with hypertension. It has also been suggested that nighttime medication is more&#xD;
      effective in improving mortality and morbidity compared to daytime medication. This&#xD;
      hypothesis relates to the fact that lack of a reduction in BP during the night (termed&#xD;
      &quot;non-dipping&quot;) is associated with a worse prognosis, and therefore nighttime medication can&#xD;
      potentially improve the desired diurnal fluctuations in BP and improve health outcomes in&#xD;
      those with hypertension to a greater extent than daytime medication. However, whether the&#xD;
      timing of drug administration affects the desired diurnal fluctuations in BP remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess fluctuations in BP throughout the day, and specifically during the night, an&#xD;
      ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) for 24 hours is required. Research suggests that this method&#xD;
      allows classification of hypertension and thus more precise prediction of the patient's&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk compared to office-based BP monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, clinician's ability to continuously monitor BP throughout the day has been limited,&#xD;
      as the mostly commonly used method of Holter monitoring only allows for BP measurement every&#xD;
      30 min and imposes a significant burden on the patient. The latter limitation affects&#xD;
      patients' compliance, and thus clinicians' ability to accurately assess daily BP fluctuations&#xD;
      (or lack thereof) that present a major health risk factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the main aim of this study is to use a new wearable, cuff-less technology that that&#xD;
      allows continuous ambulatory monitoring of BP to assess whether nighttime medication for&#xD;
      hypertension improved diurnal fluctuations in BP to a better extent compared to daytime&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is interventional, cross-over and randomized study will be performed in a medical&#xD;
      hospital. One hundred and fifty hypertensive patients, ages 30-80, will be recruited by a&#xD;
      practicing medical physician and perform baseline tests that include blood work and BP&#xD;
      measurement, as well as 24 monitoring of physiological signs (e.g., heart rate, BP, cardiac&#xD;
      output and index and vascular resistance) using a photoplethysmogram (PPG)-based wireless,&#xD;
      wearable device to obtain baseline measures. Participants will then begin medical treatment,&#xD;
      either in the morning or evening, for four weeks. Physiological signs will again be&#xD;
      continuously monitored using the wireless device during the last 48 hours of this&#xD;
      time-period. After four weeks, participants will switch the timing of their medication for&#xD;
      four more week, including 48 hours of monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure measurement: BP will be continuously collected using a wearable, non-invasive,&#xD;
      wireless chest-monitor (Biobeat Technologies Ltd., Petah Tikva, Israel), that is based on PPG&#xD;
      technology. Systolic and diastolic BPs will be monitored and recorded continuously for the&#xD;
      last 48 hours of each four-week intervention and compared between morning and evening&#xD;
      medication, for each participant (i.e., each participant will serve as their own control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests: Blood work will be performed after a 12-hour fast at baseline and at the end of&#xD;
      each intervention. Measured parameters such as glucose, insulin, low and high density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol ,triglycerides sodium and potassium will enable&#xD;
      assessment of cardio-metabolic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires: life quality and sleep quality questionnaires will be administered at&#xD;
      baseline and at the end of each intervention&#xD;
