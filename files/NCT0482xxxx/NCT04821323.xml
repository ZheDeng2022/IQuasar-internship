      The purpose of this study is to characterize the disruption of intestinal barrier as a result&#xD;
      of indomethacin challenge in healthy volunteers using an orally administered&#xD;
      lactulose-mannitol test.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Longitudinal Change From Baseline in Lactulose/Mannitol Ratio in the Urine Following Indomethacin Challenge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Longitudinal change from baseline in L/M ratio in the urine following indomethacin challenge will be assessed. L/M ratio in urine is a useful and noninvasive marker for the evaluation of intestinal permeability in the urinary excretion of these nonmetabolized sugars.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. TEAEs are defined as AEs with onset or worsening on or after date of first dose of study treatment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TE-SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TE-SAEs is defined as any untoward medical occurrence with a reasonable possibility that it is caused by the study intervention that: Is life-threatening (example; leads to stroke or non-fatal pulmonary embolism); Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; Results in other clinically significant sign(s) or symptom(s), (example; clinically asymptomatic brain microhemorrhages); or Results in death.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Longitudinal Change From Baseline in Selected Biomarkers Following Indomethacin Challenge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in selected biomarkers levels (example: Lactulose-mannitol, C-reactive protein [CRP], calprotectin, Et cetera [etc.]) using analysis methods such as liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, immunoturbidimetry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), etc., as a result of the indomethacin challenge.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, and vital signs, and&#xD;
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening. Any abnormalities, must be&#xD;
             consistent with the underlying illness in the study population and this determination&#xD;
             must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the&#xD;
             results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal&#xD;
             reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the&#xD;
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be&#xD;
             appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This determination must be&#xD;
             recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  must be a non-smoker (not smoked for at least 6 months prior to screening) and has not&#xD;
             used nicotine-containing products (example, nicotine patch) for 3 months prior to&#xD;
             screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman must be: a) not of childbearing potential; b) Of childbearing potential and&#xD;
             practicing a highly effective method of contraception (failure rate of less than (&lt;1)&#xD;
             percent (%) per year when used consistently and correctly) and agrees to remain on a&#xD;
             highly effective method while receiving study intervention and until the end of the&#xD;
             intervention cohort. The investigator should evaluate the potential for contraceptive&#xD;
             method failure (example, noncompliance, recently initiated) in relationship to the&#xD;
             first dose of study intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive serum&#xD;
             (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) at screening and a negative urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test prior to study intervention administration on Day -4&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  history of liver or renal insufficiency; significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric, or&#xD;
             metabolic disturbances&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  history of any type of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease or disease treatment&#xD;
             associated with immune suppression or lymphopenia. These include but are not limited&#xD;
             to bone marrow or organ transplantation, lymphoproliferative disorders, T- or B-cell&#xD;
             deficiency syndromes, splenectomy, functional asplenia and chronic granulomatous&#xD;
             disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has an active, acute or chronic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), celiac disease, or gastrointestinal&#xD;
             diseases (GI) surgery, excluding appendectomy and cholecystectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to aspirin or nonsteroidal&#xD;
             anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&#xD;
