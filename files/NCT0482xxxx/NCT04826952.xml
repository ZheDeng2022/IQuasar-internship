      Background and Objectives. Testicular neoplasms are not commonly found in children, a&#xD;
      formidable threat if treated inappropriately. However, there is no consensus concerning their&#xD;
      management. The study aimed to present a holistic picture of the integrated treatment of&#xD;
      malignant testicular tumors based on our 12 years' experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods. This institutional-based retrospective cohort study evaluated clinical&#xD;
      presentation, histopathologic diagnosis, treatment, and outcome in 42 boys with malignant&#xD;
      neoplasm of testis treated between 2006 and 2019.&#xD;

      Study Design. We retrospectively investigated the outcomes of 42 boys aged 0-19 years&#xD;
      presenting with testicular masses. Excluding patients with incomplete records, they were&#xD;
      treated at a tertiary referral center between May 2006 and November 2019, which were reviewed&#xD;
      and retrospectively analyzed based on their age at the time of admission, presenting&#xD;
      complaints, clinical and radiological findings, tumor markers, management, and follow-up.&#xD;
      Pathology was centrally reviewed (C.H.) in patients with a tissue biopsy, but confirmation by&#xD;
      a central review was not required before enrollment. This retrospective study was unanimously&#xD;
      approved by the institutional review board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Their parents or&#xD;
      legal guardians provided written informed consent through an opt-out method on our hospital&#xD;
      website following the ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects in&#xD;
      Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection. The evaluation included age at presentation, medical history, clinical&#xD;
      characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatment methods, histopathologic findings, and&#xD;
      outcomes for every patient. All patients received the examinations of color Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasonography of the testis and the abdomen, plain x-ray of the thorax, and serum&#xD;
      α-fetoprotein (AFP) levels before operations. The AFP measurement is usually very high in&#xD;
      newborns and does not decrease to normal adult levels until 8 months. Thus, the AFP levels of&#xD;
      infants were evaluated according to reference ranges [4,5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Technique All 42 tumors were treated surgically. We explored the groin through an&#xD;
      inguinal incision. The testicle is gently grasped and exteriorized, and the spermatic cord&#xD;
      and vessels within the tunica vaginalis are clamped. The resected tumor mass was sent for&#xD;
      frozen section examination (FSE). Testis-sparing surgery was considered in patients with&#xD;
      non-germ cell tumors. If the tumor had replaced the entire testis, a radical orchiectomy was&#xD;
      taken. All tumors received histologic analysis. The optimal follow-up protocol included&#xD;
      regular control visits with the physical examination, AFP measurements, and testicular&#xD;
      sonography. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered, depending on histopathology and TNM&#xD;
      criteria for tumor classification. If non-germ cell tumors were assessed accurately on FSE,&#xD;
      testis-sparing surgery could be considered an alternative treatment modality.&#xD;

    <description>Childhood testicular tumors deserve special diagnostic attention from the therapeutic point of view. A testicular tumor should be considered malignant until proven otherwise. In cases with suspicion of testicular tumors, the inguinal approach is preferred to the scrotal approach for scrotal violation.</description>
