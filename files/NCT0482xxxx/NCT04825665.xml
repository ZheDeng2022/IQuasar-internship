  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      External root resorption is a common unfavourable sequel of orthodontic treatment. Although&#xD;
      diagnosis of root resorption is usually done by radiographs; they are technique sensitive.&#xD;
      Dentine phosphoprotein, a non-collagenous protein, is suggested to be released into the&#xD;
      gingival crevicular fluid during active root resorption, serving as a good diagnostic tool.&#xD;
      Also, the manner of force application is a modifiable factor suggested to affect root&#xD;
      resorption.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early detection of teeth at risk of severe resorption is crucial.At present, using&#xD;
      radiographs is common but detecting only resorption after 60-70% of the mineralized tissue is&#xD;
      already lost. Moreover, they only provide two-dimensional information, identifying apical&#xD;
      change primarily. Also, radiographs cannot indicate if the process of root resorption is&#xD;
      still active for monitoring its progress and additional radiation exposure to the patient&#xD;
      will be needed. Therefore, a safer, more reliable alternative method to clinically diagnose&#xD;
      early stages of root resorption is needed and may include detecting biomarkers in gingival&#xD;
      crevicular fluid. Furthermore, the relationship between the manner of orthodontic force&#xD;
      application and orthodontically induced root resorption is under study. It has been suggested&#xD;
      that pausing orthodontic forces during treatment may reduce the amount of root resorption,&#xD;
      likely due to cementum repair during the inactive period. This is important specifically in&#xD;
      individuals who are biologically and genetically prone to root resorption. The aim of the&#xD;
      study is to compare the extent of root resorption between controlled continuous and&#xD;
      intermittent orthodontic forces using levels of dentin phosphoprotein in gingival crevicular&#xD;
      fluid.&#xD;
