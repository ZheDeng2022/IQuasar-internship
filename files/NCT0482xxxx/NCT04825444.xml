      Using color Doppler ultrasound to screen people with breast masses. For the patients who show&#xD;
      only a single mass on either side of the breast in color Doppler ultrasound, computer&#xD;
      tomography photoacoustic breast imaging will be performed. By comparing the two modalities,&#xD;
      the blood vessel imaging performance of the computer tomography photoacoustic breast imaging&#xD;
      system developed by Union Photoacoustic technologies Co., Ltd is evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation index of this experiment is the percentage of blood vessel pixels in the same&#xD;
      region of interest (Region Of Interest, ROI) to the total area of the ROI.&#xD;

      Screening of people with breast tumors, through breast color Doppler ultrasound examination,&#xD;
      the results showed that there is only a single tumor on either side of the breast. The&#xD;
      computer tomography photoacoustic breast imaging system was used to perform breast&#xD;
      examination again. By comparing ultrasound and photoacoustic vascular imaging, the vascular&#xD;
      imaging of the computer tomography photoacoustic breast imaging system developed by Union&#xD;
      Photoacoustic technologies Co., Ltd was evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This test does not evaluate the diagnosis or treatment performance of two imaging modalities.&#xD;
      It only compares the vascular imaging of two different imaging systems. Therefore, the&#xD;
      evaluation index of this experiment is the percentage of blood vessel pixel number in the&#xD;
      same region of interest (ROI) to the total pixel number in ROI. By comparing the percentages&#xD;
      of blood vessel pixel number to the total pixel number in the same ROI in ultrasound and&#xD;
      computerized tomography photoacoustic breast imaging system, the vascular imaging of the&#xD;
      computerized tomography photoacoustic breast imaging system is evaluated.&#xD;
