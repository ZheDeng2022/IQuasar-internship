  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess whether the degree of diaphragm excursion and diaphragm thickening&#xD;
      measured by ultrasound during a weaning trial may be used to predict successful weaning from&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation in patients with sepsis in intensive care unit&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and giving written informed consent, Intubated and&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis on admission and fulfilling criteria of weaning&#xD;
      from mechanical ventilation (MV), will undergo diaphragm ultrasound during spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing trial on T-piece. We will measure diaphragm excursion (DE), diaphragm thickness&#xD;
      (DT) and calculate diaphragm thickness fraction (DTF):&#xD;
&#xD;
      DT during inspiration - DT during expiration / DT during expiration&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to weaning outcome, patients will be divided into 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Successful weaning group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weaning failure group&#xD;
&#xD;
      By statistical analysis we will define the cut off value and area under curve (AUC) for DE&#xD;
      and DTF and we can confirm if DE and DTF using ultrasound can be used as predictors for&#xD;
      weaning from MV or not&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be in this group according to primary outcome, if they will fail spontaneous breathing trial or extubation within 48 hours&#xD;
Weaning failure will be considered if:&#xD;
Patients will need MV during spontaneous breathing trial within 120 minutes, or&#xD;
patients will need invasive or non-invasive ventilation within 48 hours</description>

    <intervention_name>Ultrasound</intervention_name>
    <description>Diaphragm ultrasound will be done while patient is supine on T-piece during SBT 30 minutes after disconnecting mechanical ventilation. The measurements will be done by placing the transducer in the eighth or ninth intercostal space, between the anterior axillary and the mid-axillary lines.&#xD;
Diaphragmatic excursion (DE) will be measured in M-mode using a 1- to 5- Megahertz (MHz) ultrasound curved transducer during maximal breathing. The amplitude of diaphragmatic excursion will be measured as the point of maximal height of the diaphragm to the base line.&#xD;
Diaphragmatic thickness (DT) will be measured at both end of maximal inspiration and end of maximal expiration using a high frequency 7-11 MHz ultrasound linear transducer in M-mode. The diaphragm thickness will be measured from the middle of the pleural line to the middle of the peritoneal line.</description>
