  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to quantitatively assess the risk factors that may affect&#xD;
      the re-occurrence of a CVD event and the use of a commercially available mobile application&#xD;
      Samsung Health for the assessment of parameters of exercise tolerance and the ECG M-Trace&#xD;
      Base II application for the assessment of cardiological parameters.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the post-stroke group and in the control group, SMWT (Six Minute Walk Test) and SCT( Stair&#xD;
      Climb Test) were preceded by a 10-minute rest in sitting position. The time of test&#xD;
      performance, the walked distance and steps made as well as the mean and maximum gait velocity&#xD;
      and the calories burned were assessed using the above-mentioned Samsung Health application .&#xD;
      ECG results were assessed with the use of ECG M-Trace Base II application described above. In&#xD;
      addition, cardiological parameters such as: systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR) and arterial blood saturation were assessed. The measurements&#xD;
      were performed at rest and directly after SCMT and SCT. Additionally, after the tests, the&#xD;
      level of dyspnoea and fatigue was assessed according to the modified Borg scale (score 0-10).&#xD;
