  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease of the central nervous&#xD;
      system and the most common cause of non traumatic disability in young and middle-aged people.&#xD;
      Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease (nmosd) is an independent disease different from Ms.&#xD;
      the pathogenesis and the mode of brain and spinal cord injury are different from MS, and the&#xD;
      prognosis and optimal treatment are different. It is difficult to distinguish the two&#xD;
      diseases in the early stage. Early diagnosis and treatment of the two diseases can greatly&#xD;
      improve the quality of life of patients. Therefore, it is an urgent problem to clarify the&#xD;
      difference between MS and nmosd injury patterns and to find sensitive imaging markers for&#xD;
      early clinical intervention. With the continuous progress of computer aided diagnosis (CAD),&#xD;
      it is more and more widely used in medicine, which is expected to help solve the above&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to create a neuroimmune disease evaluation database based on&#xD;
      image data. By combining brain and spinal cord imaging, and based on Zhang quantum space&#xD;
      learning computer-aided technology, we can achieve accurate segmentation of MS and nmosd&#xD;
      brain and spinal cord lesions, analyze the evolution characteristics of the disease at&#xD;
      different time points, and screen the imaging indexes related to clinical scores combined&#xD;
      with clinical and laboratory indexes Objective: to determine the different prognosis and its&#xD;
      influencing factors at the clinical, imaging and molecular levels, and establish the model&#xD;
      for predicting disease progression and prognosis, so as to provide the basis for early&#xD;
      identification and assistance in guiding treatment and judging prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical information was collected: age, gender, course of disease, MMSE, EDSS disability&#xD;
      score, nine hole test, 25 foot walking test. Assess the patient's information processing&#xD;
      ability. Blood samples were collected. Imaging examination was performed. The patients were&#xD;
      followed up regularly.&#xD;
