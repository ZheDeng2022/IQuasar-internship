  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paranoia, the experience of undue or excessive mistrust, exists on a continuum which includes&#xD;
      suspicious thoughts, ideas of reference, and persecutory delusions. Persecutory delusions&#xD;
      refers to strong unfounded fears that others intend harm. These fears are very common. They&#xD;
      affect around 70% of patients with schizophrenia. They can be distressing and make day-to-day&#xD;
      tasks difficult. However, current treatments are limited and a significant proportion of&#xD;
      people do not benefit sufficiently. Therefore, improvements in treatment are needed. A better&#xD;
      understanding of the experience of recovery from paranoia will help inform theoretical&#xD;
      understanding and treatment development. Currently we do not fully understand what causes&#xD;
      paranoia to occur, persist, or end. As such, it is critical to understand the experiences of&#xD;
      those who have recovered, in particular what elements encourage recovery. Therefore, the aim&#xD;
      of this study is to gain a first-person perspective on how people recover from paranoia and&#xD;
      what psychological processes are important for recovery from paranoia. Using a qualitative&#xD;
      approach appropriate for exploratory research, semi-structured interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      with 12-15 patients who have recovered from paranoia. Interviews will be analysed using&#xD;
      interpretative phenomenological analysis, a qualitative research approach which aims to&#xD;
      provide insight on how an individual, in a particular situation, makes sense of their&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
