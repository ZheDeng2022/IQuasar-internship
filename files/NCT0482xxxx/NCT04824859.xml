      This project assesses the feasibility and usability of the geriatric assessment platform&#xD;
      (electronic Geriatric Assessment Platform or eGAP in 50 older patients with cancer, their&#xD;
      caregivers, and their oncology team. Using an iterative process, we will refine the eGAP&#xD;
      based on input from stakeholders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A geriatric assessment is a multidisciplinary diagnostic process that can detect medical,&#xD;
      psychosocial and functional problems not identified by routine evaluation. This can&#xD;
      subsequently guide management of the identified problems. However, the time and resources&#xD;
      required to incorporate a geriatric assessment into clinic visits remain the primary barriers&#xD;
      for implementation. There is a need to increase the adoption of the geriatric assessment&#xD;
      among general oncologists and to address the associated resource limitations. Our long-term&#xD;
      goal is to utilize an electronic platform to facilitate completion of the geriatric&#xD;
      assessment. This project assesses the feasibility and usability of the geriatric assessment&#xD;
      platform (electronic Geriatric Assessment Platform or eGAP) in 50 older patients with cancer,&#xD;
      their caregivers, and oncology providers. Using an iterative process, we will refine the eGAP&#xD;
      based on input from stakeholders (patients, caregivers, oncologists, nurses, advanced&#xD;
      practitioners)&#xD;
