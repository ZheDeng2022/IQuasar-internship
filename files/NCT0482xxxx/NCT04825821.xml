    <textblock>
      Late sequelae of a cesarean section related to a uterine scar defects include gynecological&#xD;
      symptoms and obstetric complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and&#xD;
      characteristics of cesarean scar defects after uterine closure by double-layer barbed suture.&#xD;
