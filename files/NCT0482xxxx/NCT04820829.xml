  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will assess the effects of consuming different proportions of red meat (RM) and&#xD;
      plant-based, protein-rich foods (nuts, seeds, and soy products - NSS) incorporated into a&#xD;
      U.S. Healthy Eating Pattern (HEP) on cardiovascular disease risk factors in adults at high&#xD;
      risk of developing a heart-related disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a randomized, cross-over (balanced incomplete block) experimental design, Forty-eight&#xD;
      middle-aged adults who are overweight and have high blood total cholesterol and LDL-C&#xD;
      concentrations will be recruited. Participants will consume a HEP - all foods provided -&#xD;
      during 5-week controlled feeding periods. The three HEP interventions will be: high RM, low&#xD;
      NSS; moderate RM, moderate NSS; and low RM, high NSS. Each participant will complete two of&#xD;
      the three controlled feeding periods, separated by four weeks when participants will consume&#xD;
      their usual unrestricted diet (washout). The HEP consumed during the controlled feeding&#xD;
      periods will be the same except for the amounts of RM (1, 5, or 9, 3-oz servings/wk) and NSS&#xD;
      (high, moderate, and low, with amounts adjusted to isocalorically offset changes in RM energy&#xD;
      intakes). Poultry, egg, and legume intakes will be the same among the three HEP. The&#xD;
      investigators will measure clinically important cardiovascular disease risk factors before&#xD;
      (usual unrestricted diet) and during the last week of each HEP intervention. The&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk factors will include, but are not limited to, comprehensive lipid&#xD;
      and lipoprotein profile (changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C; primary&#xD;
      outcome), lipoprotein fractionation and particle numbers, and blood pressure. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare improvements in heart disease risk factors and consumer&#xD;
      satisfaction among the three HEP.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The Investigator will use a randomized, cross-over (balanced incomplete block) experimental design, with separate randomizations for males and females. All participants will consume a U.S. HEP - all foods provided - during 5-week controlled feeding periods. Each participant will complete two of the three controlled feeding periods, separated by four weeks when they will consume their usual unrestricted diet (washout). The three HEP interventions will be: high RM, low NSS; moderate RM, moderate NSS; and low RM, high NSS. Measurements will be made before (usual unrestricted diet) and during the last week of each HEP intervention.</intervention_model_description>
