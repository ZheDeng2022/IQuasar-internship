  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The importance of the microvasculature in determining clinical outcomes has been highlighted&#xD;
      in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). For patients with stable CAD, despite the&#xD;
      success of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in relieving a stenosis in the epicardial&#xD;
      coronary artery, microvascular dysfunction may preclude sufficient coronary flow and&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion, possibly leading to worse clinical outcome. With the technical&#xD;
      development of computational fluid dynamics, angiographic derivation of index of Index of&#xD;
      Microcirculatory Resistance (IMR) without pressure wire, hyperemic agents, or theromdilution&#xD;
      method is available as a potential alternative for pressure wire-derived IMR. In this regard,&#xD;
      the current study will evaluate diagnostic implication of angiography-derived IMR and its&#xD;
      prognostic implication after PCI in patients with stable CAD.&#xD;

      The importance of the microvasculature in determining clinical outcomes has been highlighted&#xD;
      in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). For patients with stable CAD, despite the&#xD;
      success of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in relieving a stenosis in the epicardial&#xD;
      coronary artery, microvascular dysfunction may preclude sufficient coronary flow and&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion, possibly leading to worse clinical outcome. With the technical&#xD;
      development of computational fluid dynamics, angiographic derivation of IMR without pressure&#xD;
      wire, hyperemic agents, or theromdilution method is available as a potential alternative for&#xD;
      pressure wire-derived IMR. In this regard, the current study will evaluate diagnostic&#xD;
      implication of angiography-derived IMR and its prognostic implication after PCI in patients&#xD;
      with stable CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study cohorts consist with 3 separate cohort: first, internal diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
      cohort, which will evaluate correlation between angiography-derived IMR and hyperemic&#xD;
      microvascular resistance calculated using Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride Single-Photon Emission&#xD;
      Computed Tomography (CZT-SPECT)-derived myocardial blood flow and invasively measured&#xD;
      pressure data. For this, 53 consecutive patients with available CZT-SPECT within 3 months of&#xD;
      measuring FFR in the left anterior descending coronary artery will be evaluated. Second:&#xD;
      external diagnostic cohort, in which diagnostic accuracy of angiography-derived IMR will be&#xD;
      assessed in patients with ischemia and no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA) and&#xD;
      normal controls, whose results were previously published (J Nucl Cardiol. 2020 Sep 30. doi:&#xD;
      10.1007/s12350-020-02252-8.) Among this cohort, 45 patients with no obstructive CAD and&#xD;
      normal CZT-SPECT perfusion imaging will be regarded as normal controls, in 35 INOCA patients,&#xD;
      vessels with normal corresponding perfusion territory will be regarded as internal control.&#xD;
      Third, prognosis cohort, in which 138 consecutive CAD patients received PCI with available&#xD;
      angiograms and who were suitable for angiographic fractional flow reserve and IMR measurement&#xD;
      will be analyzed. Primary clinical outcome will be cardiac death or congestive heart failure&#xD;
      at 2 years from index procedure. Secondary outcome will be any myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      ischemia-driven revascularization, definite or probable stent thrombosis, congestive heart&#xD;
      failure admission and angina pectoris admission at 2 years from index procedure.&#xD;
