  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The National Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is an evidence-based, 12-month lifestyle&#xD;
      change program to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (herein referred to&#xD;
      as 'diabetes') among adults with prediabetes. The Department of Preventive Medicine,&#xD;
      University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC), in partnership with the American Medical&#xD;
      Association, is collaborating to develop and implement the DPP as a clinical service for UMMC&#xD;
      patients beginning in September 2020. We aim to recruit 245 patients per year over 3 years.&#xD;
      Because this is the first attempt to develop and implement the DPP as a clinical service at&#xD;
      the UMMC, we are proposing to conduct a comprehensive process, outcome, impact and return on&#xD;
      investment evaluation. An effectiveness-implementation hybrid research design will be used to&#xD;
      (1) evaluate a multifaceted implementation strategy and the effectiveness and impact of the&#xD;
      DPP delivered using telehealth by UMMC's Department of Preventive Medicine; (2) conduct an&#xD;
      analysis on medical expenditures among those who participate in a DPP to measure net savings&#xD;
      and return on investment (ROI) relative to non-participants; (3) conduct a longitudinal&#xD;
      cohort analysis to assess incidence of diabetes and changes in body composition, biomarkers,&#xD;
      and psycho-social behavioral constructs among those who participate in a DPP relative to&#xD;
      those who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from this comprehensive research evaluation will be used to (1) improve clinical&#xD;
      operations and implementation; (2) demonstrate the cost benefit of the DPP as a clinical&#xD;
      service for patients with diabetes risk; and (3) provide empirical support for delivering the&#xD;
      DPP via different modalities including telehealth to reduce risk and improve health outcomes&#xD;
      among patients.&#xD;

      The purpose of this research is to: (1) Evaluate a multifaceted implementation strategy for&#xD;
      the uptake of a remote DPP by UMMC's Department of Preventive Medicine. (2) Conduct an&#xD;
      analysis on medical expenditures among those who participate in a DPP to measure net savings&#xD;
      and ROI relative to non-participants. (3) Conduct a longitudinal cohort analysis to assess&#xD;
      incidence of diabetes, body composition, biomarkers, and psycho-social behavioral constructs&#xD;
      among those who participate in a DPP relative to those who do not. Study methods are&#xD;
      described below according to each of three specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Conduct a concurrent implementation and effectiveness evaluation of the DPP in a&#xD;
      clinical care setting for patients with prediabetes (n=245). An effectiveness-implementation&#xD;
      hybrid type III research design will be used to conduct a non-randomized trial with 245 of&#xD;
      patients with prediabetes over a three year recruitment period, while employing an iterative&#xD;
      process evaluation to explore the complex processes, dynamic context and organizational&#xD;
      influences on implementation. The RE-AIM framework will guide the implementation and&#xD;
      effectiveness evaluation including measures of Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation&#xD;
      and Maintenance. Multiple data sources and data types will be used to assess barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators that affect the RE-AIM domains, as well as fidelity, costs, patient satisfaction&#xD;
      and physician burnout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Utilize claims and encounters data to measure medical expenditures for patients with&#xD;
      prediabetes, and determine spending differentials among DPP participants compared with&#xD;
      non-DPP participants. Track trends in per capita medical expenditures for among a panel of&#xD;
      case (DPP participant) and control (Non-DPP participant) subjects. To compare variations in&#xD;
      spending, the differences in the arithmetic means, compound annual growth rates, and&#xD;
      propensity score matching models will be implemented to compare case and control subjects.&#xD;
      The study may also look at those with prediabetes that are later diagnosed with diabetes and&#xD;
      individuals with prediabetes who are not later diagnosed with the condition. These estimates&#xD;
      of spending differentials and evidence of DPP participation and engagement rates will help to&#xD;
      further enhance the algorithm to estimate the potential cost savings and ROI if diabetes is&#xD;
      prevented or delayed in the at-risk population who participate in the DPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Assess the longitudinal effect of the DPP on participant changes in cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease risk including anthropometric and clinical biomarker and psychosocial health outcomes&#xD;
      (N=245). A prospective, repeated measures, experimental cohort design will be used to&#xD;
      determine the long-term impact of the DPP on diabetes incidence and cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      risk among DPP patient participants.&#xD;

    <description>Individuals with prediabetes can mitigate the risks and costs of diabetes by taking preventative action, such as participation in a National Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The DPP began as a multisite randomized controlled trial demonstrating the effectiveness and cost-benefit of a 12-month intensive lifestyle intervention over pharmaceutical treatment for preventing or delaying diabetes among prediabetic participants. In 2010, Congress authorized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to lead the dissemination of the DPP as a targeted approach (high risk populations) and population-based strategy to reduce the incidence of diabetes and diabetes-related healthcare costs. The goal is to achieve modest weight loss (7%) by developing and implementing behavior change skills resulting in lifestyle modifications such as physical activity (150 minutes per week) and dietary and nutritional practices.</description>
