    <textblock>
      This is a research study to find out if a drug called blinatumomab is effective for treating&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) or measurable residual disease (MRD) CD19-positive&#xD;
      mixed phenotypic acute leukemia (MPAL). Measurable Residual Disease (MRD) means that there&#xD;
      are a small number of cancer cells remaining after treatment&#xD;

    <description>Blinatumomab (BLINCYTO , AMG 103, formerly also known as MT103 or bscCD19xCD3) is a novel single chain antibody construct in the class of the bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE®). Blinatumomab directs CD-3 positive effector memory T cells to CD19-positive target cells (Hoffmann et al, 2005; Dreier et al, 2002). The targeted CD19 antigen is constitutively expressed on normal B cells throughout a person's lifetime (Smet et al, 2011) and is highly conserved in B-cell malignancies (Tedder, 2009; Wang et al, 2012).</description>
