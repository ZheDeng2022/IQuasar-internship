  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is the most common cause of disability worldwide. Although general&#xD;
      activity is encouraged in the treatment of LBP, there is limited empirical information&#xD;
      available on the specific types of activities that are beneficial or harmful for patients&#xD;
      seen in primary care for LBP. This study will identify those physical activities with&#xD;
      short-term (transient) effects on LBP exacerbations (or &quot;flares&quot; of LBP), as well as&#xD;
      identifying the long-term (cumulative) effects of such activities on functional recovery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research will use a novel approach to distinguish the short-term effects on LBP of&#xD;
      physical activities from the long-term effects of such activities, by conducting a&#xD;
      longitudinal case-crossover study nested within a cohort study. This design accounts for&#xD;
      measured and unmeasured confounds by using each case as his/her own control- an entirely&#xD;
      observational study that is analogous to a crossover experiment- capitalizing on modern&#xD;
      mobile health and actigraphy technology. The primary exposures of interest are 10&#xD;
      self-reported physical activities commonly performed during work and activities of daily&#xD;
      living, and actigraphy-assessed physical activity. Other exposures of interest include&#xD;
      psychological factors, social factors, lifestyle-related factors, and work-related factors.&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are participant-reported &quot;flares&quot; of low back pain (Aim 1) and&#xD;
      participant-reported back-related functional limitations (mobility and activities of daily&#xD;
      living [ADLs]) at 1-year follow-up, as measured by the Roland-Morris Disability&#xD;
      Questionnaire. This observational study will include up to 550 Veterans with LBP aged 18 and&#xD;
      older recruited from the VA Puget Sound Health Care System (VAPSHCS). The study will not&#xD;
      affect participants' medical care in any way. After informed consent, recruitment, and&#xD;
      baseline data collection, study participants will complete frequent, serial electronic&#xD;
      &quot;e-Questionnaires&quot; using their own personal electronic devices (personal computer [PC],&#xD;
      tablet, or smartphone) over the 1-year period of follow-up. Participants may also wear&#xD;
      ActiGraph units for the 1st 4 weeks of follow-up. Long-term outcomes will be assessed by&#xD;
      extended e-Questionnaires completed at 1-year follow-up. Aim 1 analyses will examine the&#xD;
      short-term effects of 10 specific activity categories on participant-reported flares across&#xD;
      all study assessments over 1-year follow-up. Aim 2 analyses will examine associations between&#xD;
      the frequency of exposure to 10 specific activity categories over weeks 1-4 of follow-up, and&#xD;
      long-term functional recovery at 12 months as defined by the RMDQ. All analyses will use a&#xD;
      biopsychosocial framework accounting for potential confounders (sociodemographics,&#xD;
      psychological factors, etc.) and effect modifiers, and will include sensitivity analyses to&#xD;
      examine the robustness of findings and important study assumptions. This study was registered&#xD;
      prior to the start of enrollment.&#xD;

    <description>At each study assessment, participants are presented with the flare definition used in this study, which was derived from a previously validated flare definition by Costa et al (2000). The definition is: &quot;A 'flare' of low back pain is a worsening of your low back pain that lasts from hours to weeks&quot;.&#xD;
Participants are then asked to self-report whether a flare of low back pain is currently ongoing, by responding to the question &quot;According to the definition above, are you currently experiencing a flare of your low back pain?&quot;, with response options of &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. These response options define participant-reported flares.</description>
