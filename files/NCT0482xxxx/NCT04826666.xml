  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation are surgeries associated with important bleeding and often require&#xD;
      perioperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. Overall, between 20 and 85 % of liver&#xD;
      transplant recipients receive at least one RBC transfusion during their surgery. Such&#xD;
      transfusions are consistently associated with higher morbidity and mortality, although this&#xD;
      causal association is still under debate in many surgical populations. Despite the lack of&#xD;
      clear causative association between perioperative transfusions and worse outcomes, minimizing&#xD;
      bleeding and transfusions is believed to improve postoperative outcomes. Many perioperative&#xD;
      variables are associated with higher blood loss and need for perioperative transfusions:&#xD;
      liver disease severity, preoperative anemia and coagulopathy, higher cardiac filling&#xD;
      pressures and higher fluid administration, among others. However, few perioperative&#xD;
      interventions have been shown to reduce bleeding and transfusion requirements in this&#xD;
      population. Among them, the use of intraoperative phlebotomies to reduce portal and hepatic&#xD;
      venous pressure during the dissection phase is a promising one, also described in liver&#xD;
      resection surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further investigate the effects of intraoperative phlebotomies on intraoperative bleeding,&#xD;
      perioperative transfusions and mortality, the Principal Investigator will conduct a&#xD;
      retrospective cohort study with a propensity score based causal analysis.&#xD;

      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate the effects of intraoperative phlebotomies on intraoperative&#xD;
      bleeding, perioperative transfusions and mortality among patients who underwent a liver&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All successive adult patients who underwent a liver transplantation between July 2008 and&#xD;
      January 2021 at the Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM) will be included in&#xD;
      the study. Because phlebotomies are mostly performed in patients with a near normal renal&#xD;
      function, patients who were under renal replacement therapy prior to surgery as well as those&#xD;
      who had a glomerular filtration rate below 30 mL/h (based on MDRD formula) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exposure of interest will be the performance of an intraoperative phlebotomies.&#xD;
      Intraoperative phlebotomies are performed at the beginning of liver transplant surgery to&#xD;
      reduce portal and hepatic venous pressure and thus reduce bleeding and the need for&#xD;
      transfusions. After graft reperfusion, retrieved blood is reinjected to patients to optimize&#xD;
      volemia and cardiac output. Intraoperative phlebotomy is thus a manipulable well-defined&#xD;
      exposure amenable to causal analysis by consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covariables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many variables are associated with bleeding in liver transplantation. Most of them are also&#xD;
      associated with our exposure of interest and are cofounding factors. Phlebotomies will be&#xD;
      more often performed in non-anemic cirrhotic patients with high portal and central venous&#xD;
      pressure, but less often in patients with severe acute disease with end-organ damage such as&#xD;
      renal failure. Thus, patients who received a phlebotomy have different baseline prognostic&#xD;
      characteristics than those who do not receive as phlebotomy. To control for such confounding,&#xD;
      a sufficient set of variables based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) constructed using&#xD;
      published data and knowledge of the clinical practice (see figure 1) will be included. Since&#xD;
      MELD score is a very robust marker of liver disease severity, it will increase in most&#xD;
      situations of worsening liver disease (such as acute-n-chronic liver failure) and adjust for&#xD;
      all such situations. Since an observational study from the CHUM suggested that intraoperative&#xD;
      bleeding and transfusions have increased since recipients are prioritized by the MELD score,&#xD;
      the calendar year as a covariable will be added, although it is not expected that phlebotomy&#xD;
      practices have significantly changed over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for patients who received their transplantation between 2008 and 2017 is already&#xD;
      available in a dataset used for previous analyses (CHUM Research Ethic Board (REB) approval&#xD;
      #17.036). Data from patients who received a transplantation between January 2018 and January&#xD;
      2021 will be extracted from patients' chart after REB approval or from the dataset used for&#xD;
      another already approved study (CHUM REB #17.251). Data from all these patients will be&#xD;
      merged in a common dataset, cleaned and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient cohort based on the exposure category will be described. Frequencies and&#xD;
      proportions for categorical variables and mean with standard deviation for continuous&#xD;
      variables (or median with quartiles for skewed distributions) will be summarized. Crude&#xD;
      outcome incidence without any relative risk (table 2) will also be presented. For analytical&#xD;
      purposes, intraoperative bleeding will be used as a continuous variable and because many&#xD;
      patients do not receive any perioperative RBC transfusions, perioperative RBC transfusions&#xD;
      between &quot;no transfusion&quot; and &quot;any transfusion&quot; will be dichotomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A causal analysis will be conducted based on a balancing score, the propensity score. No&#xD;
      previous sample size calculation was computed as a convenience sample of all transplanted&#xD;
      patients that meet the inclusion criteria will be used. By excluding patients with at least&#xD;
      moderate renal failure prior to surgery (almost only untreated patients), a cohort with more&#xD;
      treated than untreated patients will be obtained. Treated patients are also the ones for whom&#xD;
      clinicians believed a phlebotomy was helpful based on measured covariables (and potential&#xD;
      unmeasured ones (&quot;confounding by indication bias&quot;)). Also, many untreated patients may not be&#xD;
      at risk of receiving the intervention (positivity) and not overlap treated patients. Thus, an&#xD;
      average treatment effect in the treated (ATT) by the inverse probability of treatment&#xD;
      weighting (IPTW) will be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do so, a propensity score (π_i) for the exposure (intraoperative phlebotomies) based on&#xD;
      all identified and measured previously mentioned confounders will be computed. Quadratic&#xD;
      terms for continuous variables (for more flexibility) and an interaction term between the&#xD;
      MELD score and the central venous pressure (since more severe disease usually have higher&#xD;
      cardiac filling pressure), important drivers of the exposure, will be included. The overlap&#xD;
      of the propensity score between the treated patients and their untreated counterparts will be&#xD;
      evaluated. In case many treated patients do not overlap with any untreated ones, the&#xD;
      specifications of the propensity score model further (remove quadratic terms for example)&#xD;
      will be modified to further restrict the population of interest. The calculated propensity&#xD;
      score to compute weights will be used and create an untreated pseudo-population comparable to&#xD;
      the treated ones (conditional exchangeability); Weights for treated patients and weights will&#xD;
      be used for untreated patients. In case extreme weighs are estimated, truncation (between 1%&#xD;
      and 5% percentiles of the propensity score distribution depending on overlap effect) will be&#xD;
      used to minimize variance and effect of near violations of practical positivity. The&#xD;
      population of interest may be further restriced, if deemed necessary. The pseudo-population&#xD;
      will be described using weighted descriptive statistics and the balancing effect of the&#xD;
      weights will be verified. The causal marginal effect on bleeding will be estimated using a&#xD;
      weighted mean difference and the causal marginal effect of transfusions using a weighted risk&#xD;
      difference. Survival up to 1 year will be reported using a marginal structural model using a&#xD;
      weighted proportional hazard Cox model and express a causal marginal hazard ratio. Results&#xD;
      will be expressed with non-parametric bootstrap percentile 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Senstivity analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPTW analyses may be more sensitive to misspecification of the propensity score model as well&#xD;
      as have a higher estimated variance. Thus, a sensitivity analysis to estimate ATT for all&#xD;
      outcomes will be conducted using a propensity score based matching analysis. This analysis&#xD;
      will use a 1:2 (1 treated and 2 untreated) greedy matching using a caliper (0.2 linear&#xD;
      propensity score standard deviation). For matching, balancing between groups by comparing&#xD;
      covariables' central tendency measurement and variance will be explored, including quadratic&#xD;
      terms for continuous variables, as well as q-q plots. Distribution homogeneity between groups&#xD;
      will also be assessed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. The matching specifications (caliper,&#xD;
      matching ratio) may bemodified if group balancing is not satisfactory. However, the&#xD;
      propensity score specifications will not be modified, to maintain consistency across&#xD;
      analyses. Once balancing is considered appropriate to estimate an ATT, the causal effects&#xD;
      will be estimated by using the Abadie-Imbens estimator. The Abadie-Imbens variance will be&#xD;
      used to compute 95% confidence intervals. R software (R Core Team, 2020, version 4.0.3) will&#xD;
      be used, as well as the Matching, survival, survey and tableone packages. IPTW analyses and&#xD;
      bootstrap will be computed manually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of phlebotomies is considered to be mechanistically mediated by reducing portal&#xD;
      pressure and splanchnic congestion. The effect of the intervention should thus be stronger in&#xD;
      patients with cirrhosis. Thus, a subgroup analysis will be conducted by conduction the&#xD;
      primary analysis (IPTW and bleeding) only in patients transplanted for cirrhosis by excluding&#xD;
      retransplantations and transplantation for acute liver failure.&#xD;
