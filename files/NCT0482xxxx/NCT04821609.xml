  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer (BC) is the most common neoplasm in Chile, and its medical treatment leads to&#xD;
      high survival. One-third of survivors will develop BC-related lymphedema. Lymphedema is a&#xD;
      chronic condition characterized by increased volume in the ipsilateral arm to surgery. A&#xD;
      higher volume is associated with decreased physical functionality and quality of life. Recent&#xD;
      studies suggest that resistance training could control arm volume through increased muscle&#xD;
      mass development, improving physical functionality and quality of life for patients. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, there is no study that has analyzed the effect of a resistance training program&#xD;
      among women at risk of BC-related lymphedema on quality of life. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to determine the effect of resistance training on the quality of life among women with&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy and high risk of BC-related lymphedema compared to a control group with&#xD;
      regular physical therapy management, which does not include resistance training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled study. It will be held at the Complejo Asistencial Dr. Sotero&#xD;
      del Río, which receives all patients from the South East Metropolitan Health Service.&#xD;
      Participants: 116 women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for BC who have undergone axillary&#xD;
      lymph node dissection or with obesity will be recruited. Quality of life will be evaluated&#xD;
      with The European Organization for Research and Treatment in Cancer Quality of Life C-30&#xD;
      (EORTC QLQ C30) questionnaire, validated in Chile; the difference in volume between the arms&#xD;
      with optoelectric equipment; physical functionality with the six-minute walk test; and the&#xD;
      handgrip with a dynamometer. Volunteers will be randomly assigned to the resistance training&#xD;
      group or control group. The resistance training group will consist of twice a week supervised&#xD;
      sessions, for 12 weeks. The exercises will be for arms and legs, self-loading type, and with&#xD;
      external weights. The control group will follow the usual physical therapy management, which&#xD;
      does not include resistance training. Subsequently, volunteers will be evaluated at the third&#xD;
      and sixth months after completion of the 12 weeks resistance training program.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Health-related quality of life on The European Organization for Research and Treatment in Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life C-30 (QOL-C30) questionnaire at 3, 6 and 9 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment in Cancer Quality of Life C-30 is a self-administered and validated questionnaire to assess Health-related quality of life in patients with cancer. Has been validated in Spanish language and on Chilean population. It is composed of nine multi-item scales and six single items. Multi-Item are five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting), and a global health and quality-of-life scale and six single items. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Arms lymphedema Volume on the Perometer System at 3, 6 and 9 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Perometer is considered the gold standard for determining lymphedema volume in research. Is a valid and reliable tool in volume measurement. It determines volume values expressed in milliliters and percentage. A value of 200 mL or 10% difference between one arm and the other is considered significant.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Physical Fitness Six minute walk test at 3, 6 and 9 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3, 6 and 9 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Six minute walk test is a functional test of sub-maximum cardiorespiratory capacity. Valid and reliable in adults with cancer. Result are expressed in meters. A change of 20-30 meters is considered significant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Hand grip strength on Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer at 3, 6 and 9 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamometer assess the maximal voluntary grip strength (measured in kilograms). Each subject will perform six trials, three in each arm, with an alternating bilateral sequence. The results will be based on the best punctuation of the three trials, respectively. There are normative values in percentiles for healthy Chilean women.</description>
