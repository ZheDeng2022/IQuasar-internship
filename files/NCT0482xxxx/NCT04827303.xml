    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled study. A total of 75 patients between the ages of 20-50&#xD;
      who have a diagnosis of acute myofacial pain syndrome in the trapezius muscle and have pain&#xD;
      for a maximum of 5 days were included in the study. Patients were randomly divided into 3&#xD;
      groups. Group 1 patients received kinesio tape method (25 patients), group 2 patients&#xD;
      received trigger point injection method (25 patients), and group 3 patients received neural&#xD;
      therapy injection method (25 patients). A 10-15 cm sized I band was applied to the trapezius&#xD;
      muscles of the first group patients with the patient's neck in lateral flexion. Then, while&#xD;
      the patient's neck is flexed, a Y-shaped 15-20 cm tape will be affixed between C1-7 with the&#xD;
      arms of the Y up, and I tape of 5-10 cm is attached on the arms. In group 2 patients, 1 cc&#xD;
      lidocaine diluted with 4 cc saline (SF) was applied to the trigger points palpated manually&#xD;
      in the trapezius muscles. After the trigger point was squeezed between the thumb and index&#xD;
      finger, a few cc of local anesthetic mixture was applied into the trigger point with the&#xD;
      injector and exited. In the 3rd group patients, a few cc local anesthetic mixture will be&#xD;
      applied intradermally over the trigger point without entering into the trigger points&#xD;
      palpated manually in the trapezius muscles. Patients were checked 72 hours and 1 week after&#xD;
      the first applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain at rest and during movement of the patients in all 3 groups were evaluated with a&#xD;
      visual analog scale (VAS 10 cm). The number of trigger points was determined by the physician&#xD;
      by hand palpation. Pressure pain threshold was evaluated with the algometer device.&#xD;
      Disability assessment of the patients was made using the neck pain disability index.&#xD;
      evaluations were made at the beginning of treatment, 72 hours after and 1 week after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
