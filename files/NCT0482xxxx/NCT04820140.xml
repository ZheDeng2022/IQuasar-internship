    <textblock>
      Aim of this study is to evaluate, in a population of chronic kidney disease patients on&#xD;
      dialysis (Stage 5D), the effect of a muscle strengthening program (training against&#xD;
      resistance vs endurance training by elliptical bike) during a observational period (12 weeks&#xD;
      per program) on frailty, risk of falling, muscle strength and mass, endurance, physical&#xD;
      activity, quality of dialysis, nutritional status and neuromuscular sensitivity.&#xD;

    <description>All patients will be receiving a muscle strengthening program consisting in both a training against resistance and an endurance training by elliptical bike during an observational period of 12 weeks for each treatment. Each training program will be preceded by a 4-week period of lymphatic drainage in order to improve neuromuscular sensitivity.</description>
