  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) and manual therapy approaches added to&#xD;
      the IMT program in healthy individuals with hyperkyphosis is uncertain. This study was aimed&#xD;
      to determine the effects of manual therapy techniques added to IMT and IMT on pulmonary&#xD;
      functions (FVC, FEV1, FEV1 / FVC, and PEF), forward head posture, and hyperkyphosis in&#xD;
      healthy individuals with hyperkyphosis. Thirty-five individuals voluntarily participate to&#xD;
      study were randomly divided into IMT and manual therapy groups. While all participants&#xD;
      received twenty minutes of IMT twice a week for four weeks, manual therapy techniques were&#xD;
      applied to the manual therapy group in addition to IMT. Pulmonary functions, forward head&#xD;
      posture, and hyperkyphosis were evaluated before and after the treatments with spirometry&#xD;
      device; cervical range of joint range of motion measuring device (CROM Deluxe), C0-wall&#xD;
      (OWD), and C7-wall distance measurement respectively. Statistical Package for Social Sciences&#xD;
      (SPSS 25.0) will be used to analyze the data in the research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperkyphosis, which is defined as a thoracic curvature higher than normal limits, is among&#xD;
      the reasons that decrease chest wall mobility and lung function. In modern society, kyphosis&#xD;
      in the thoracic vertebra increases with the increase in sitting time of people. It has been&#xD;
      identified in studies that an increase in thoracic kyphosis and a decrease in the mobility of&#xD;
      the thoracic region of the spine are associated with a decrease in respiratory functions such&#xD;
      as Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manual therapy approaches consisting of different techniques (manipulation, joint&#xD;
      mobilization and soft tissue mobilization) can be an effective approach to improve pulmonary&#xD;
      function by increasing chest wall mobility. Manual therapy techniques applied to the thoracic&#xD;
      region have been shown to cause a significant reduction in thoracic kyphosis. In a study, it&#xD;
      has been shown that thoracic joint mobilization is effective in increasing FVC, FEV1 and Peak&#xD;
      Expiratory Flow (PEF) in people with hyperkhyphosis and chronic neck pain. In addition,&#xD;
      identified studies shows that manual therapy approaches applied to improve respiratory&#xD;
      functions should include both the thoracic and cervical regions due to the relationship&#xD;
      between cervical and thoracic spine movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) leads among the approaches used in the current literature&#xD;
      to increase respiratory functions. There is important evidence that this technique which aims&#xD;
      to increase the strength or endurance of the diaphragm and respiratory assist muscles&#xD;
      activated during inspiration, improves respiratory function in the patient and healthy&#xD;
      population. In the literature, there are studies examining the effects of IMT and manual&#xD;
      therapy approaches on respiratory functions in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD), asthma and smokers. In a study conducted on smokers, the effects of manual&#xD;
      therapy added to the IMT program on maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and other respiratory&#xD;
      parameters were examined and a significant increase in MIP was observed, but a significant&#xD;
      increase in other respiratory parameters not observed. In another study, it was stated that&#xD;
      the addition of manual therapy and therapeutic exercise protocol to IMT in asthmatic&#xD;
      individuals was more effective than IMT in improving forward head posture and kyphotic&#xD;
      posture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the studies on the effects of using IMT and manual therapy techniques together in&#xD;
      healthy individuals on respiratory functions are very limited in the literature, more acute&#xD;
      effects were investigated in these studies. In this context, the aim of our study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the cervical and thoracic region manual therapy approaches added to IMT and IMT&#xD;
      program in healthy individuals with hyperkyphosis; It is the determination of the effects on&#xD;
      respiratory function values such as FVC, FEV1, tiffeneau index (FEV1 / FVC) and PEF, forward&#xD;
      head posture and hyperkyphosis.&#xD;

Participants were initially instructed to &quot;sit in a comfortable, natural posture defined as the typical posture you take during your daily activities and do not move your head&quot;.&#xD;
The head forward arm was attached to the CROM mainframe and the lower end of the control arm (vertebra locator) was held by the investigator on the C7 spinous process.&#xD;
The vertebra locator was placed at a 90 ° angle with the forward arm of the CROM with the help of a bubble indicating that the instrument was straight.&#xD;
The value on the head forward arm measures the distance in centimeters(cm) between the participant's bridge of nose and C7.&#xD;

    <description>Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) was performed with Powerbreathe Classic-Light Resistance device. To determine the intensity of the training, MIP values were measured with the help of the respiratory pressure meter-RP Check (MD Diagnostics Ltd. RP Check MIP &amp; MEP) device before each training. The pressure corresponding to 50 percent of the MIP value in the Powerbreathe device was determined as training workload. It was applied two days a week for four weeks, with five-set and five repetitions, for 20 minutes with 30 seconds rest in between. This inspiratory muscle training program has previously been used by several studies to improve respiratory muscle strength.</description>

    <description>In the manual diaphragm release technique; While the participant was breathing in, the physiotherapist raised his hand slowly to accompany the rising movement of the ribs and deepened the contact during exhalation. The maneuver was performed in two sets of 10 deep breaths.&#xD;
In thoracic mobilization application; The physiotherapist, standing behind the participant, wrapped the crossed arms from his right upper arm with his left hand and performed stretching, extension, lateral flexion, and thoracic rotation with his right hand.&#xD;
In HVLA thoracic manipulation; the physiotherapist, with the support hand on the participant's elbows, applied HVLA thrust in the posterior-anterior and inferior-superior directions with the help of his body while the manipulating hand was on the transverse processes.&#xD;
For cervical joint mobilization; the physiotherapist was applied using the right hand in flexion, extension, right-left rotation, and lateral flexion directions.</description>
