  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy profile of increasing doses of&#xD;
      IPN10200 in comparison to placebo, with the aim to discover the doses(s) that offer the best&#xD;
      efficacy/safety profile when used for the treatment of moderate to severe Upper Facial Lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in three stages. The full study (including all stages) will have&#xD;
      a maximum 424 participants. The protocol is currently approved up to stage 1, step 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 (phase Ib &amp; II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step 1 (Phase Ib): a dose-escalation first-in-human step in participants with moderate&#xD;
           to severe Glabellar Lines (GL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step 2 (Phase II): does finding step in participants with moderate to severe GL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      - An evaluation of efficacy and safety of IPN10200 in one of the following regions: GL +&#xD;
      forehead lines (FHL) or lateral canthal lines (LCL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3 (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A safety and efficiacy evaluation of IPN10200 in all three regions (GL, FHL and LCL)&#xD;

             participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. An inability to substantially lessen GL and/or horizontal forehead rhytids even by&#xD;
             physically spreading them apart as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
