  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic pouchitis is disabled by bloody diarrhoea and abdominal pain often&#xD;
      followed by fever. Pouchitis is an inflammation in a pouch, a reservoir formed by the small&#xD;
      intestine in the management of the chronic inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
      The standard treatment for pouchitis is intensive broad-spectrum antibiotics for a longer&#xD;
      period. However, the treatment often fails after repeated treatments. Studies show that&#xD;
      patients with pouchitis have an altered composition of the gut microbiota compared to healthy&#xD;
      individuals and patients with a pouch without inflammation. As shown by several studies,&#xD;
      faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) with administration of faeces from healthy donors can&#xD;
      alter the microbiota. Treatment with faecal microbiota transplantation to chronic pouchitis&#xD;
      has been investigated in several clinical trials with mixed results. It is however still&#xD;
      uncertain if faecal microbiota transplantation using stool from healthy individuals with a&#xD;
      colon is optimal, or if stool from patient with a normally functioning pouch should be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study primary aims to investigate if transplantation of faeces from patient with a normal&#xD;
      pouch function can induce clinical remission in patients with chronic pouchitis.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut dysbiosis plays a significant causal role in chronic pouchitis. Modulating the gut&#xD;
      microbiota using FMT with stool from a normal function pouch patient has a clinical effect by&#xD;
      inducing clinical remission in patients with chronic pouchitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the trial is to investigate if transplantation (FMT) of faeces from a patient with&#xD;
      a normally functioning pouch can induce clinical remission in patients with chronic&#xD;
      pouchitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is designed as a single-center, open-label, treatment study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faecal microbiota transplantation is performed with faeces from a donor with a normally&#xD;
      functioning pouch. Potential donors are recruited from the Department of Gastrointestinal&#xD;
      Surgery, Aalborg University Hospital, Denmark. They are screened for a various of infectious&#xD;
      diseases by serum analysis (haematology, inflammation, liver and kidney function, HIV,&#xD;
      Hepatitis, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus and HbA1c) and faeces analysis (calprotectin,&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile (PCR), enteric pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic-resistant bacteria,&#xD;
      parasites, cysts, and viruses). Furthermore, the potential donors will complete an extensive&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding general health, risk factors and medical history, before they can be&#xD;
      included as faecal donors in the project. The screening procedure is based on recommendation&#xD;
      from the European FMT Working Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transplantation is performed by enemas, which contain faeces from the faecal donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial before the treatment with FMT, the patient will be invited for serum analysis (CRP,&#xD;
      leukocytes) and faecal analysis (calprotectin, C.difficile, enteric pathogenic bacteria),&#xD;
      followed by a pouchoscopy with collection of biopsies. Materials from serum- and faecal&#xD;
      analysis and biopsies will be stored for later analysis purpose. The patient will further&#xD;
      complete questionnaires concerning symptoms and quality of life. The stage of disease will be&#xD;
      evaluated based on the acknowledged questionnaire for pouchitis called Pouchitis Disease&#xD;
      Activity Index (PDAI) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment begins after all the initial examinations, and the patient will be treated&#xD;
      during one month. The treatment consists of daily enema infusion, which contain faeces from&#xD;
      the faecal donor. During the treatment, the patient will daily record symptoms related to&#xD;
      pouchitis (diarrhea, abdominal pain, bleeding per rectum, fever, general discomfort) and&#xD;
      possible adverse effects to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of treatment, the patient will meet to a follow-up examination including serum&#xD;
      analysis (CRP, leukocytes) and faecal analysis (calprotectin), pouchoscopy incl. biopsies,&#xD;
      and the questionnaires applied before the treatment. Materials from serum- and faecal&#xD;
      analysis and biopsies will be stored for later analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be followed up after additional 1,3, 6 and 12 months to evaluate the long&#xD;
      term effect of the transplantation. The consumption of antibiotics during the first year will&#xD;
      be recorded. In case of lacking effect of faecal microbiota transplantation, the patient is&#xD;
      offered standard antibiotic treatment for pouchitis, and will leave the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faecal samples and biopsies collected in the study will be analyzed for the composition of&#xD;
      the microbiota.&#xD;
