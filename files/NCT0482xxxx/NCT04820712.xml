  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study utilizes a new method to explore compare the overall survival (OS) and&#xD;
      cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients aged 18-45 years with stage I-II HCC who underwent&#xD;
      different types of surgery. The SEER database, which is one of the most comprehensive and&#xD;
      authoritative databases concerning cancer, was used to estimate the survival benefit of&#xD;
      patients who underwent local tumor destruction (LTD), wedge or segmental resection (WSR),&#xD;
      lobectomy resection (LR), liver transplantation (LT), or non-surgery. This study discovered&#xD;
      surgery offered a survival benefit compared with non-surgery for young patients with stage&#xD;
      I-II HCC. Furtherly, LT is associated with superior survival than WSR, LR and LTD in those&#xD;
      patients. Our results facilitate the selection of surgical strategies.&#xD;

      The SEER data contain no identifiers and are publicly available for studies of cancer-based&#xD;
      epidemiology and survival analysis. Therefore, the current study was deemed to be exempt from&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board approval and the need for informed consent was waived. The&#xD;
      submitted magazine requires registration on the website, so this operation is needed.&#xD;
