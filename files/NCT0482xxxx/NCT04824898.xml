  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Simvastatin (SMV) is one of the family members of statins, it has been showed in many&#xD;
      previous studies that the simvastatin when dissolved with methylcellulose in situ gel with a&#xD;
      concentration of 1.2% (SMV) approximately, can have a significant decrease in the pocket&#xD;
      depth, regain the clinical attachment loss (CAL), and improve the bone level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      and the platelets concentrate has been introduced which is the injectable plasma rich fibrin&#xD;
      (I-PRF), as it contains platelets and leukocytes, stem cells and endothelial cells that why&#xD;
      it is called &quot;blood concentrate &quot;. So, it is proposed as treatment option in different&#xD;
      periodontal procedures such as treatment of intra-bony defects,&#xD;

      Group I ( Experimental group): will include 12 patients undergoing open flap debridement&#xD;
      (OFD) followed by single application of I-PRF. Oral Hygiene measure will be instructed&#xD;
      following treatment and maintenance visits will be given to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II (Control group): will include 12 patients undergoing open flap debridement (OFD)&#xD;
      followed by application of 1.2% simvastatin gel. Oral Hygiene measure will be instructed&#xD;
      following treatment and maintenance visits will be given to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral hygiene instructions will be given to all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full mouth Scaling and root planing (SRP) will be performed under local anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 to 8 weeks after the non-surgical periodontal therapy patients will be reassessed&#xD;
           clinically and radiographically For all patients who are suitable for the study the&#xD;
           following clinical and radiographic evaluation parameters will be measured: (All&#xD;
           parameters will be recorded Pre-operatively (base line) and 6 months Post operatively by&#xD;
           an examiner who will be masked to the type of treatment received by the individuals).&#xD;
