  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Wales, like other UK countries, has relatively poor cancer outcomes. Late&#xD;
      diagnosis and a slow referral process are major contributors. General practitioners (GPs) and&#xD;
      other care providers working in primary care are often faced with patients presenting with a&#xD;
      multitude of non-specific symptoms that could be cancer. Safety netting can be used to manage&#xD;
      diagnostic uncertainty by ensuring patients with vague symptoms are appropriately monitored.&#xD;
      The ThinkCancer! Workshop is an educational behaviour change intervention aimed at the whole&#xD;
      general medical practice team, designed to improve primary care approaches to ensure timely&#xD;
      diagnosis of cancer. The workshop will consist of teaching and awareness sessions,&#xD;
      appointment of a Safety Netting Champion and the development of a bespoke Safety Netting&#xD;
      Plan. This study aims to assess the feasibility of the ThinkCancer! Intervention for a future&#xD;
      definitive randomised controlled trial, in terms of recruitment, randomisation, retention,&#xD;
      acceptability, adherence and barriers to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The ThinkCancer! study is a randomised, multisite feasibility trial, with an embedded&#xD;
      process evaluation and economic evaluation. Twenty-three to 30 general medical practices will&#xD;
      be recruited across Wales, randomised in a ratio of 2:1 of intervention versus control who&#xD;
      will follow usual care. The workshop will be delivered by a GP educator, and will be adapted&#xD;
      iteratively throughout the trial period. Baseline practice characteristics will be collected&#xD;
      via questionnaire. We will also collect Primary Care Interval (PCI), Two Week Wait (2WW)&#xD;
      referral rate, conversion rate and detection rate at baseline and six months&#xD;
      post-randomisation. Participant feedback, researcher reflective notes and economic costings&#xD;
      will be collected following each workshop. A process evaluation will assess implementation&#xD;
      using an adapted Normalisation Measure Development (NoMAD) questionnaire and qualitative&#xD;
      interviews. An economic feasibility analysis will inform a future economic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion This study will allow us to test and further develop a novel evidenced-based&#xD;
      complex intervention aimed at general practice teams to expedite the diagnosis of cancer in&#xD;
      primary care. The results from this feasibility study will inform the future design of a&#xD;
      full-scale definitive phase III trial.&#xD;

    <description>The proposed intervention, the ThinkCancer! Workshop, is practice-based and consists of themed sessions for both clinical and non-clinical staff, the co-production of a Cancer Safety Netting Plan (CSNP) and the appointment of a Cancer Safety Netting Champion (CSNC). The workshop aims to raise awareness and increase knowledge around current cancer diagnosis guidance and will be delivered over half a day during GP protected time in the form of face-to-face educational sessions. Sessions will consist of a series of interactive activities exploring existing processes within practices and developing plans for change to implement each component.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any practices in Wales are eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As we intend to include a broad group of general medical practices, there are no&#xD;
             formal exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        As determining feasibility is the main objective of this study, the eligibility criteria&#xD;
        remain broad in order to allow for inclusion of a range of practices, which will aid the&#xD;
        intervention refinement and allow for a better understanding on what is feasible in all&#xD;
        types of practices and why some practices may not take part.&#xD;
