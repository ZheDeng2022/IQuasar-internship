  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parents of children with obesity report feeling blamed for their children's weight and&#xD;
      reluctant to seek pediatric care after stigmatizing experiences. This &quot;weight stigma by&#xD;
      association&quot; may have direct consequences for parents, children, and the parent-child&#xD;
      relationship. The present study builds on qualitative evidence to experimentally test weight&#xD;
      stigma and weight stigma by association in a parent-child relationship using a large,&#xD;
      community-based sample. In an experiment conducted via an online survey, participants were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to view a picture of a parent-child dyad, for which parent and child's&#xD;
      gender (male vs. female) and weight status (with obesity vs. without obesity) were&#xD;
      manipulated. Participants read identical general parenting descriptions that adhered to&#xD;
      American Academy of Pediatrics parenting recommendations, then rated the parent's&#xD;
      effectiveness, helpfulness, and caring.&#xD;
