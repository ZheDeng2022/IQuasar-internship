  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an important public health problem all over the world, and its prevalence is&#xD;
      increasing every year. In obesity, significant changes occur in the mechanical properties of&#xD;
      the lungs and chest wall due to fat deposits in the mediastinum and abdominal cavities. Upper&#xD;
      abdominal surgical procedures usually cause impairment of respiratory functions by affecting&#xD;
      respiratory volume and capacity. The risk of postoperative pulmonary complications increases&#xD;
      with the decrease in restrictive capacities, hypoxemia, and increased respiratory work. It&#xD;
      may also be due to causes such as diaphragm dysfunction, postoperative pain, and surgical&#xD;
      incision.Ultrasonography (USG) is a method accepted for evaluating the normal and&#xD;
      pathological conditions of the diaphragm. M-mode is used to evaluate the anatomical and&#xD;
      functional disorders of the diaphragm. The diaphragm evaluation is performed with the&#xD;
      anterior approach in the supine position and with different respiratory maneuvers (sniffing,&#xD;
      deep inspiration, normal inspiration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the diaphragm function by using USG and spirometry&#xD;
      methods in patients who underwent bariatric surgery and to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      postoperative pain score on diaphragm function.&#xD;

      Approval for this single-center, prospective, observational study was performed after the&#xD;
      approval of the local Ethics Committee and informed consent from the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diaphragm ultrasonography was performed before general anesthesia, after general anesthesia&#xD;
      in the recovery room, and at the postoperative 24th hour in normal breathing, deep&#xD;
      inspiration, and sniffing position. For USG evaluation, while the patients sit in the supine&#xD;
      position at an angle of 45⁰, the 2.5-7.5 Mhz convex probe is placed perpendicular to the&#xD;
      intercostal spaces through the liver window on the anterior axillary line; The posterior part&#xD;
      of the right hemidiaphragm was evaluated by directing it medially, cephalad and dorsally.&#xD;
      Diaphragm movements in M-mode were evaluated after detection of the diaphragm in the B-mode.&#xD;
      The inspiratory amplitude of the diaphragm (DIA: distance traveled by the diaphragm between&#xD;
      the beginning and end of inspiration, cm) in M-mode, inspiratory velocity (IV=&#xD;
      DIA/inspiratory time, cm/sec), and expiratory velocity (EV= DIA/expiratory time, cm/sec)&#xD;
      measurements were made. VAS scores of the patients were questioned while performing USG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function tests (PFT) of patients before surgery and the postoperative first day and&#xD;
      FVC, FEV1, PEF, FEF25-75, and FEV1/FVC measurements have been recorded.&#xD;
