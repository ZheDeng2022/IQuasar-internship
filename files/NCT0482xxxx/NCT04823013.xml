  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to compare the efficacy of ischemic compression and two different&#xD;
      application methods of high power pain threshold ultrasound techniques on latent trigger&#xD;
      point treatment. Asymptomatic subjects divided into three groups. First group took high power&#xD;
      pain threshold ultrasound in which the intensity is kept constant at the pain level; second&#xD;
      group took high power pain threshold ultrasound which the intensity is kept constant at half&#xD;
      the pain level and third group took ischemic compression. All participants were asked to&#xD;
      complete the questionnaires, which assessed pain, psychological factors and disability before&#xD;
      treatment, after 1 week and 1 month follow-up. After each participants completed the&#xD;
      questionnaire, the physical therapist evaluated the MTrPs. MTrPs assessment was performed&#xD;
      before treatment, immediately after treatment, after 1 week and 1 month follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myofascial trigger points have been defined as discrete and hyperirritable areas located&#xD;
      within a taut band of skeletal muscle or fascia which when compressed produce pain,&#xD;
      tenderness, dysfunction and autonomic phenomena. The treatment techniques aimed to return the&#xD;
      fiber groups affected by myofascial trigger points to their normal length and endplates to&#xD;
      their normal function. Although both ischemic compression and two different application&#xD;
      methods of high power pain threshold ultrasound techniques are effective methods in the&#xD;
      treatment of trigger points , there are no studies showing which technique is more effective.&#xD;
      It is aimed to to compare the efficacy of ischemic compression and two different application&#xD;
      methods of high power pain threshold ultrasound techniques on myofascial trigger point&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants in HPPT-US 1 group received the HPPT-US treatment (n=52). The intensity was gradually increased from 0.5 W/cm² to the pain threshold level at which the patient verbally reported the pain. The therapist kept the intensity at that level for 5 s, and then moved the US transducer in a circle without the change of the intensity for 15 s. The procedure was repeated 3 times. Participants in HPPT-US 2 group also received the HPPT-US treatment (n=57). The intensity was gradually increased from 0.5 W/cm² to the pain threshold level at which the patient verbally reported the pain. The therapist kept the intensity at that level for 5 s, then reduced the dose half and moved the US transducer in a circle for 15 s. The procedure was repeated 3 times.Participants in IC group received ischemic compression therapy (n=44). The duration for each trigger points was 1 minute.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants in IC group received ischemic compression therapy. The technique was applied in the sitting position to participants. Ischemic compression was performed by compressing trigger points identified by palpation with tolerable intensity using thumb. The duration for each trigger points was 1 minute. Then the muscle containing the trigger point was applied intramuscular stretching for 30 seconds by therapist</description>
