  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm cartilage regeneration through arthroscopy after a&#xD;
      single administration of autologous Adipose Tissue derived Mesenchymal stem cells(JOINTSTEM)&#xD;
      in patients with degenerative arthritis of K-L grade 3&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      JOINTSTEM is injectables for an OA treatment that uses autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells. As it does not use allogenic tissues and is cultured without additional genetic&#xD;
      modification, it is classified as 'autologous cell therapy' and is completely free of&#xD;
      immunologic rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It primarily aims to regenerate cartilage. The intra-articular injection of JOINTSTEM is&#xD;
      expected to stimulate the regeneration of cartilage, and to innovatively improve joint&#xD;
      function with cartilage regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects of this therapy were patients with K&amp;L grade 3 aged 20 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study with two arms to evaluate&#xD;
      JOINTSTEM as a treatment for subjects with osteoarthritis. Following a 2-week screening&#xD;
      period, approximately 21 patients will be randomly assigned into one of the following two&#xD;
      arms in a 2:1 ratio (2 JointStem : 1 placebo control). After each patient completes 12-month&#xD;
      visit (Visit 6) and the data management team confirms all data have no issue, the individual&#xD;
      database will be locked and the blinding will be open for the statistical analysis.&#xD;

    <description>Change of The RAND-36 Measure of Health-Related Quality of Life (RAND-36) score from baseline (Experimental group vs Control group) Scoring the RAND 36-Item Health Survey is a two-step process. First, precoded numeric values are recoded per the scoring key given in Table 1. Note that all items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. In step 2, items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores.</description>
