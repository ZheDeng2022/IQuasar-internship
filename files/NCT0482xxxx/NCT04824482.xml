  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 80% of ischemic stroke (IS) patients have some walking disability, which restricts&#xD;
      their independence in the activities of daily living. Physical therapy (PT) significantly&#xD;
      contributes to gait recovery in patients after IS. However, it remains unclear, what type of&#xD;
      gait training is more effective and which factors may have impact on gait recovery. Two&#xD;
      hundred fifty IS patients will be enrolled to undergo a 2-week intensive inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation including randomly assigned robot-mediated gait training (RGT) or&#xD;
      therapist-assisted gait training (TGT). A detailed clinical and laboratory assessment of gait&#xD;
      quality, as well as the degree of neurological impairment, quality of life, cognition and&#xD;
      depression will be performed in all patients during the study. We hypothesize that these&#xD;
      variables may also affect gait recovery in patients after IS. In a randomly selected 60&#xD;
      enrolled patients, a multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including functional MRI,&#xD;
      will be performed to assess neural correlates and additional predictors of gait recovery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two hundred fifty consecutive first ever ischemic stroke patients classified as dependent&#xD;
      walkers (Functional Ambulatory Category interval &lt;1,3&gt;) will be enrolled in the randomized&#xD;
      blinded single center prospective clinical trial GAITFAST with a randomization either for&#xD;
      robot-mediated gait training (RGT) or therapist-assisted gait training (TGT) after acute&#xD;
      phase (5-10 days after stroke onset). All enrolled patients will undergo a 2-week intensive&#xD;
      inpatient rehabilitation including randomly assigned TGT or RGT followed with clinical visits&#xD;
      (at the beginning of inpatient rehabilitation, at discharge, and three and six months after&#xD;
      enrollment in the study). Each clinical visit will include detailed clinical functional&#xD;
      assessments, assessment of spatiotemporal and kinetic gait parameters, assessment of&#xD;
      neurological impairment, assessment of quality of life, cognition and depression. In 60&#xD;
      randomly selected enrolled IS patients, a repeated multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) including functional MRI (fMRI) will be performed during the study follow-up to&#xD;
      identify brain structures with possible impact on gait recovery.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in gait speed during overground walking</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (before beginning of inpatient RHB), after two weeks (at the end of inpatient RHB), and in follow-up (after three and six months after stroke onset)</time_frame>
    <description>Gait speed will be measured using the 10 Meters Walking Test (performance measure used to assess walking speed in meters per second over a short distance). The subject will be asked to walk for a distance of 10 meters at his/her comfortable speed. The time will be measured for the distance of the middle six meters, which will allow walk acceleration and deceleration. Each patient will perform two trials with a calculation of mean time value. If physical assistance of another person (to prevent a fall or collapsing) is needed for a patient to complete the test, the level of assistance provided will be documented. Usage of any assistive device and/or bracing (that patients are currently using for walking and are needed to complete the test) will be also documented.</description>
