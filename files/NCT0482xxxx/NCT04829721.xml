  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic floor health workshops have previously been shown to be effective in improving&#xD;
      postpartum knowledge, performance of pelvic floor muscle exercises, and bowel-specific&#xD;
      quality of life. Group learning through a class focused on behavioral modification and pelvic&#xD;
      floor muscle exercises for women with urinary incontinence, has been shown to be an effective&#xD;
      means to educate women about urinary incontinence management. The PAKS study hopes to&#xD;
      demonstrate whether Spanish-speaking women that undergo an informative workshop on pelvic&#xD;
      floor disorders via video in Spanish are more likely to raise their level of knowledge&#xD;
      surrounding pelvic floor disorders and improve the pelvic floor symptoms.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine if an informational workshop on pelvic&#xD;
      floor disorders administered via a video intervention will increase Spanish-speaking women's&#xD;
      knowledge of pelvic floor disorders and decrease pelvic floor symptoms post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis or Aim: A single 20 minute video workshop on pelvic floor disorders will improve&#xD;
      Spanish-speaking women's knowledge of pelvic floor disorders immediately post-intervention&#xD;
      and at 4 weeks post-intervention compared to a pre-intervention knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of the Study (Background): It is estimated that by the year 2050 in the United&#xD;
      States, 58.2 million women will have at least 1 pelvic floor disorder. However, understanding&#xD;
      of these disorders among patients is low. Prior studies assessing patient knowledge have&#xD;
      shown that participants often did not understand basic urogynecologic terms such as urinary&#xD;
      incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and pelvic floor disorder and that the participants had&#xD;
      poor knowledge of participants' conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Latinos will comprise 30% of the population in the United States by year 2060. In Hispanic&#xD;
      women, barriers such as lower income, lower education, limited English language proficiency&#xD;
      and lack of health coverage influence access to health care. In those with pelvic floor&#xD;
      disorders, additional barriers such as poor understanding of general medical conditions,&#xD;
      medical terminology, and female anatomy may lead to low understanding of participants'&#xD;
      condition, treatment options, and therapies. Given this high prevalence estimate, educating&#xD;
      and optimizing care for Hispanic women with such disorders is imperative with implications of&#xD;
      having a significant societal impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic floor health workshops have previously been shown to be effective in improving&#xD;
      postpartum knowledge, performance of pelvic floor muscle exercises, and bowel-specific&#xD;
      quality of life. Learning through a class focused on behavioral modification and pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscle exercises for women with urinary incontinence, was shown to be an effective means to&#xD;
      educate women about urinary incontinence management. Women's knowledge, symptoms, and&#xD;
      quality-of-life scores significantly improved at 3 months after undergoing an educational&#xD;
      pelvic health workshop on incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no studies have investigated the effects of a formal educational pelvic floor&#xD;
      disorder workshop in Spanish on this knowledge or its impact on patient symptoms in those who&#xD;
      suffer from pelvic floor disorders at baseline. The investigators research project proposes&#xD;
      to close the gap between patient knowledge and scientific knowledge and potentially improve&#xD;
      pelvic floor symptoms. The investigators' video workshop will empower women with knowledge&#xD;
      and allow the women to make informed decisions surrounding the women's pelvic floor health.&#xD;
      It will provide the women with tools to improve the women's own pelvic floor health. A pelvic&#xD;
      floor health workshop targeted to Spanish-speaking women is an innovative concept which could&#xD;
      lead to better patient care in a growing population. It may be the first step in prevention&#xD;
      of future pelvic floor conditions.&#xD;

    <description>Difference in questionnaire scores based on the validated Spanish version of the Prolapse and Incontinence Knowledge Questionnaire from baseline compared to immediately post-intervention after an educational video workshop.&#xD;
The Prolapse and Incontinence Knowledge Questionnaire is a 24-item condition-specific questionnaire that consists of 2 knowledge subscales: questions concerning pelvic organ prolapse (score range 0-12) and urinary incontinence (score range 0-12). Each item is given a score of 1 if answered correctly and 0 if answered incorrectly. Women are given a score of 0 if they answered &quot;I don't know&quot; or &quot;No lo sé&quot; presuming a lack of knowledge. Higher scores mean greater knowledge of these pelvic floor disorders.</description>

    <description>Difference in Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20 questionnaire scores at 4 weeks postintervention from baseline compared to 4 weeks post-intervention after an educational video workshop&#xD;
The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20 is a set of 20 symptom questions, answered on a 4-point Likert scale: 1 = not at all to 4 = quite a bit. The mean values of all answered items are multiplied by 25 to determine the scale score (range 0-100). A summary score is also reported (range 0-300). Higher scores denote a greater symptom burden.</description>
