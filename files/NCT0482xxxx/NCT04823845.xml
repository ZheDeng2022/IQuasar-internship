      This study seeks to research the efficacy of Adapalene 0.1% gel as a cost effective and low&#xD;
      risk treatment option for plantar warts of the foot. Patients that present/diagnosed in&#xD;
      designated clinics with plantar warts will be offered the option of being treated with&#xD;
      regular superficial debridements of the epidermis and twice a day application of adapalene&#xD;
      gel 0.1% under occlusion. Patients will be followed until resolution.&#xD;

      PROBLEM/BACKGROUND: Plantar warts are the result of a DNA virus called Human Papilloma Virus&#xD;
      (HPV), specifically subtypes 1,2,4,27, and 57. Plantar warts are a common complaint among&#xD;
      adults and children when standing, walking or running as they are on the weight-bearing&#xD;
      surface of the foot. These cutaneous infections often occur when walking barefoot at public&#xD;
      pools, sidewalks, bathhouses etc. and the epidermis becomes compromised. Surfaces carrying&#xD;
      HPV is transmitted and infects the keratinocyte in the compromised skin and begins&#xD;
      hyperplasia in the granular, prickle layers, and the dermal papillae. Histologically cell&#xD;
      nuclei are eccentrically seen surrounded by koilocytes (halos). This manifests as a&#xD;
      hyperkeratotic cutaneous lesion that is a dermal outpouching with break in normal skin lines,&#xD;
      painful with lateral or direct pressure, and pin point bleeding. These lesions are often self&#xD;
      limiting and resolve in time. However, patients often complain of pain and seek treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients often try over the counter remedies with no avail, and then seek professional help&#xD;
      for the issue. The standard of care for clinicians is often to use debridement with some form&#xD;
      of keratolytic topical agent, such as: salicylic acid, canthridin is used; or cryotherapy,&#xD;
      laser (pulse dye or CO2), bleomycin or candida injections are commonly used. Surgical&#xD;
      excision is often utilized as well. These treatments are often invasive, painful, and require&#xD;
      multiple sessions over a long period of time. Research has suggested the use of adapalene gel&#xD;
      0.1% as a less invasive and faster therapy for plantar warts. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      test a United States population with Adapalene Gel 0.1% for plantar warts as a viable&#xD;
      treatment option with the goals of being faster and less invasive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: Test United States population in the treatment of plantar warts using adapalene&#xD;
      gel 0.1%. Measure the amount of time until resolution of the plantar wart using this&#xD;
      treatment. Document patient pain with this treatment method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: Clinician Interventional Prospective Study. Goal of minimum 50 patients will be&#xD;
      studied from ages 5-90 years old of all health statuses, race, and genders. Pregnant women&#xD;
      will be excluded due to very minimal, but medicine recommendations and guidelines. Patients&#xD;
      presenting to outpatient clinics with plantar warts will be treated with a debridement with&#xD;
      scalpel down to dermis followed by application of Adapalene 0.1% gel under occlusion.&#xD;
      Patients will apply this twice a day under occlusion and return for repeat debridements every&#xD;
      2 weeks. Warts will be measured initially and before and after each debridement until&#xD;
      resolution. Patient pain will be assessed each visit and documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT RECRUITMENT: Patients will present to outpatient clinics, and if diagnosed with a&#xD;
      plantar wart will be offered the standard of care treatment at that clinic or the Adapalene&#xD;
      gel study treatment if they have not tried any other therapies for 2 weeks. Patients will&#xD;
      have the option for the standard of care at the clinic or choose the treatment option of this&#xD;
      study. Pregnant women will be excluded. Any patient having received another treatment therapy&#xD;
      in the last 2 weeks will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMED CONSENT: Patients included in the study will be informed that this is not the&#xD;
      standard of care, and that the standard of care is actually more invasive. This alternative&#xD;
      treatment has been researched and has evidence to be safer, less invasive, and faster than&#xD;
      the current standard of care. Patients will have the option to choose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PROCEDURES: The research group will have their plantar warts photographed, pain&#xD;
      assessed, measured, debrided down to the dermal layer using a sterile 15 scalpel,&#xD;
      re-measured, apply adaplene 0.1% gel to area, cover with occlusive bandage. Patient will&#xD;
      apply this adapelene gel 0.1% twice a day daily and keep covered at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive and inferential statistics will be calculated on 50&#xD;
      patients recruited into the study who had plantar warts. Measures taken will be the age and&#xD;
      sex of patients, duration of warts in months, size of warts, time taken to remove the warts&#xD;
      by using Adapalene gel 0.1% under occlusion, and side effects of usage such as irritation,&#xD;
      erethyma, and scar tissue. Statistics will include frequency and percentages, and means Â±&#xD;
      standard deviations where appropriate. Confidence intervals (95 CIs) will be calculated&#xD;
      around the time taken to remove the warts. A sample size and power analysis showed that if&#xD;
      the mean time to remove the warts using Adapalene gel was 37 days with a standard deviation&#xD;
      of 19, a sample size of 50 would allow us to obtain 95% CIs of 31.6, 42.4 days.&quot; RESEARCH&#xD;
      MATERIALS: Patient's age, gender, race, BMI will be recorded in the EMR as well as wart size,&#xD;
      photo, and pain level each visit.&#xD;
