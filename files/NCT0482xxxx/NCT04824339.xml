      This project will assess the efficacy of an 8-week virtual exercise program on physical&#xD;
      function offered to those with a breast cancer diagnosis currently receiving endocrine&#xD;
      therapy. The intervention includes twice-weekly virtual group exercise classes. Participants&#xD;
      also complete one to three independent home exercise sessions per week throughout the&#xD;
      intervention. Testing will occur virtually at baseline, 8-weeks (at end of program) and&#xD;
      follow-up evaluations will be performed at 16-weeks and 12- months after baseline testing.&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be administered through REDCap. Exercise sessions and testing will be&#xD;
      administered virtually via Zoom.&#xD;

      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to test the effect of a virtually delivered supervised&#xD;
      exercise program specific to breast cancer survivors on endocrine therapy versus delayed&#xD;
      exercise in a partial cross over trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Endocrine therapy is commonly prescribed to breast cancer survivors for 5-10&#xD;
      years and often leads to side effects such as arthralgia, weight gain and bone density loss.&#xD;
      Exercise has been shown to be an effective management strategy of these side effects and may&#xD;
      improve quality of life and physical functioning. Many barriers exist surrounding the&#xD;
      implementation of exercise programs for breast cancer survivors, despite the efficacious&#xD;
      outcomes exercise programs have been shown to provide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to COVID-19, virtual delivery options are needed to continue to provide exercise support&#xD;
      to cancer patients. In September 2020, members of the investigator team successfully&#xD;
      completed a pilot of the virtual intervention (n=30). In British Columbia, the investigators&#xD;
      are well positioned to trial the implementation of an exercise program from a virtual&#xD;
      setting, with programming specific to women receiving endocrine therapy. The knowledge gained&#xD;
      from this study, if shown to be effective, will assist future program delivery and&#xD;
      implementation across British Columbia for breast cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of the exercise intervention group versus delayed&#xD;
      exercise group to improve physical function, as measured by 30 second sit to stand test, from&#xD;
      baseline to end of program (8-weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the intervention to improve endocrine&#xD;
      therapy medication adherence (voils DOSE-non adherence measure) and endocrine symptom scores&#xD;
      (FACT-ES) from baseline to end of program (8-weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary Aim: To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the intervention at improving exercise&#xD;
      levels (modified Godin), health related quality of life (RAND), balance (tandem balance test)&#xD;
      and self-reported anthropometric measures (weight, height, waist and hip circumference) from&#xD;
      baseline to end of program (8-weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aims: 1) To obtain additional data on efficacy outcomes (all outcomes listed&#xD;
      above) with with-in group analysis of delayed exercise intervention group (0-8 weeks vs. 9-16&#xD;
      weeks) to further refine efficacy estimates to inform future implementation trials; and 2) to&#xD;
      examine suitability of efficacy outcomes at 16-weeks (immediate intervention group only) and&#xD;
      in both intervention arms, namely end of intervention 8- or 16-weeks, as appropriate to&#xD;
      12-months after baseline testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the intervention will improve physical function at 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Additionally, it is hypothesized that the intervention will improve medication adherence,&#xD;
      reduce self-reported endocrine symptoms, health-related quality of life, increase exercise&#xD;
      levels, balance and anthropometrics at 8 weeks. The exploratory aims will provide information&#xD;
      on maintenance effect in the short term (16 weeks) and longer term (12 months from&#xD;
      enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design: This study is a partial cross over study. The intervention is 8 weeks in&#xD;
      duration. Participants will be randomized to immediate exercise or delayed exercise, and the&#xD;
      delayed exercise group will cross over to the intervention after 8 weeks. This design was&#xD;
      selected to optimize recruitment (all participants receive the intervention) while allowing&#xD;
      appropriate comparison of intervention versus control, and to gain additional insights into&#xD;
      efficacy of the intervention in order to better design future implementation studies. No&#xD;
      washout period between crossover arms needed. Participants will undergo a virtual baseline&#xD;
      assessment, 16 supervised virtual group-based exercise sessions delivered twice weekly, a&#xD;
      final assessment at completion of the 8-week exercise program, as well as follow-up&#xD;
      assessment at 16-weeks and 12-months after baseline testing. All sessions will take place&#xD;
      virtually via a secure Zoom platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Between group comparisons of those randomized to immediate intervention&#xD;
      versus delayed intervention for changes in primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes from&#xD;
      baseline to 8-weeks will be assessed using two-sample t-tests for normally distributed&#xD;
      quantitative outcomes (primary, secondary, and tertiary). For highly skewed quantitative&#xD;
      outcomes, the comparisons will be done using Mann-Whitney tests. For categorical outcomes,&#xD;
      comparisons will use chi-square tests of independence (and Fisher Exact tests for binary&#xD;
      outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the delayed intervention group, within-group comparisons to assess changes from baseline&#xD;
      (i.e., no intervention) to 16 weeks (i.e., after 8 weeks of delay plus 8 weeks of active&#xD;
      intervention) will be done with paired t-tests for normally distributed outcomes, and&#xD;
      Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for skewed quantitative outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more formal repeated measures analysis of variance will be done to examine the change&#xD;
      across multiple time points, which are baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks and 12-months. All tests&#xD;
      will be two sided with a nominal level of significance of 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis will be undertaken once fifty percent of the planned sample size has been&#xD;
      recruited and randomized. The aim of this analysis is to: 1) re-examine the target sample&#xD;
      size using study data to compute effect size, and update if necessary; and 2) assess whether&#xD;
      the trial should be stopped either due to tremendous efficacy or likely futility. This will&#xD;
      be completed by the project statistician, and all other study team members will remain&#xD;
      blinded, so that the randomization will not be jeopardized.&#xD;
