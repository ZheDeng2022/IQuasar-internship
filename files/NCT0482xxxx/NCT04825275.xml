  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to find out if the study drug (posaconazole) can enter brain&#xD;
      tumors at a high enough amount to stop the tumor cells from dividing. Posaconazole is a drug&#xD;
      which doctors already use for fungal infections and is thought to be able to effect tumor&#xD;
      cells. As treatments for this type of brain tumor are limited, it is hoped that the results&#xD;
      of this study will help to determine if the study drug should be studied further as a&#xD;
      possible treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both ketoconazole and posaconazole are FDA-approved anti-fungal agents with a&#xD;
      well-established side effect and safety profile. Ketoconazole and posaconazole have shown&#xD;
      efficacy in reducing tumor cell proliferation in in-vitro studies. Furthermore, both have&#xD;
      also shown efficacy, mediated at least in part through inhibition of HK2 activity, in animal&#xD;
      models with dosing concentration and schedules that are documented as safe in humans. As a&#xD;
      drug, posaconazole has a more predictable half-life than ketoconazole and has less off-target&#xD;
      effects. Therefore, the proposed trial will focus on the role of posaconazole exclusively. As&#xD;
      a first step, demonstration of adequate penetrance of study drug in brain and tumor tissue&#xD;
      (pharmacokinetics) and biological effect (inhibition of glycolysis and subsequent tumor cell&#xD;
      death) is necessary prior to large scale clinical studies. A total of 5 control participants&#xD;
      will be included in this study as the investigator specifically wants to assess for&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic differences too. The addition of a control group to this study rather to both&#xD;
      the studies (ketoconazole study is a separate protocol) is because the investigator feels&#xD;
      posaconazole may be a more promising drug for moving forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma drug concentration measurements are an unreliable method to assess delivery of drugs&#xD;
      across the blood-brain barrier. In contrast, intracerebral MDC monitoring allows for&#xD;
      approximate measurements within extracellular fluid (ECF) sampling of the brain. MDC&#xD;
      placement within the brain is not a novel technique and has been utilized routinely in the&#xD;
      ICU setting to measure brain metabolism by sampling of ECF of traumatic brain injury patients&#xD;
      [59-61].&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDC are now FDA-approved and are being placed routinely with intracranial pressure monitors.&#xD;
      This method allows for continuous measurement of ECF within a tumor or normal tissue. The&#xD;
      dialysis probe has a semipermeable membrane which is less than 1 mm in diameter into which&#xD;
      two sections of microcatheter are fused. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility&#xD;
      of keeping the catheters in place of critically injured patients for up to 2 weeks [62-64].&#xD;
&#xD;
      When placed at the time of surgical resection, the microcatheters are stereotactically&#xD;
      implanted, placing the probe within the desired brain and/or tumor region. Externally, the&#xD;
      catheter is connected to a syringe pump, which delivers a low flow rate (μl/min) of&#xD;
      continuous perfusion fluid (Lactated Ringers or artificial CSF) and dialysate is collected in&#xD;
      a microvial from the outlet tube. This sterile, single use catheter is minimally invasive and&#xD;
      developed to achieve optimal diffusing characteristics similar to passive diffusion of a&#xD;
      capillary blood vessel. Just as in the function of brain capillary vessel, water, inorganic&#xD;
      ions and small organic molecules freely diffuse across the membrane of the probe, whereas&#xD;
      proteins and protein bound compounds are impermeable. Additionally, lipophilic compounds are&#xD;
      poorly recovered. Therefore, assessment of pharmacokinetics of drug using MDC provides&#xD;
      valuable insight relevant to its anti-neoplastic properties.&#xD;
