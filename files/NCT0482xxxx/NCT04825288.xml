  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will include 2 portions (phase 1 and phase 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first portion will be a Phase I, open label, dose escalation study to establish the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of XB2001 as measured by Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), in&#xD;
      combination with ONIVYDE + LV + 5-FU chemotherapy regimen in patients with advanced&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer and to determine the recommended dose for the subsequent Phase 2 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 2 portion will be implemented with the maximum established tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      XB2001. The target enrollment in the phase 2 portion is 60 patients which will be randomized&#xD;
      on a 1:1 basis to XB2001 plus ONIVYDE + LV + 5-FU (Arm 1) or placebo plus ONIVYDE + LV + 5-FU&#xD;
      (Arm 2).&#xD;

      Study Title: A Phase I/II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (1-BETTER)&#xD;
      examining XB2001 (anti-IL-1⍺ True Human antibody) in combination with ONIVYDE + 5-FU/LV&#xD;
      (+folinic acid) in advanced pancreatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sponsor: XBiotech USA, Inc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Chair: Shubham Pant, M.D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Approximately 69 patients will be enrolled in the USA (at least 9 patients in&#xD;
      the open label phase 1 portion and 60 patients in the randomized phase 2 portion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximate Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will include 2 phases. The first portion will be a Phase I, open label, dose&#xD;
      escalation study evaluating the safety, tolerability and establishing the Maximum Tolerated&#xD;
      Dose (MTD) of XB2001 in at least nine patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who&#xD;
      are receiving ONIVYDE + Leucovorin l + d racemic + 5-Fluorouracil chemotherapy treatment. The&#xD;
      duration for each patient in the Phase I portion will be 14 days (1 treatment cycle) in which&#xD;
      they will be given one intravenous dose of XB2001 prior to receiving ONIVYDE + Leucovorin l +&#xD;
      d racemic + 5-Fluorouracil chemotherapy treatment and assessed for Dose Limited Toxicities&#xD;
      (DLT). The Phase II portion will be implemented following the completion of the Phase I&#xD;
      portion and declaration of the MTD. The duration of subject participation in the randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II portion of the trial is approximately 28 weeks:&#xD;
      including a screening period of up to 30 days, and 24-week treatment period. All study&#xD;
      subjects can continue treatment with XB2001 in an open label extension, for as long as they&#xD;
      are judged to be benefitting clinically and have had no unacceptable toxicities.&#xD;

    <intervention_type>Biological</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>XB2001 or Placebo</intervention_name>
    <description>XB2001 has an IgG4, heavy chain and a kappa light chain. The heavy chains are joined at their hinge regions through two disulfide linkages and each heavy chain is joined to one light chain through one disulfide linkage between their CH1 and CL domains respectively. The heavy chain CH2 domains are glycosylated primarily with the oligosaccharide structure shown in Figure 2.1, as determined by cleaved N-glycan analysis performed by ProteomeLab PA800 Plus. The glycosylated residue (Asn-295 as numbered from the N-terminus of XB2001) is in the same highly conserved N-linked glycosylation site as found in endogenous IgG4 (Asn-297 according to the generic numbering system). Similarly, the primary glycan, commonly referred to as G0F, is the same as that found in about 22% of endogenous human IgG molecules . The main isoform has a pI of about 6.47 and comprises over 60% of the total isoform population, as determined by capillary isoelectric focusing.</description>
