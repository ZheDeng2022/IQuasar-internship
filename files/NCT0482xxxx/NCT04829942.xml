      It is very important for children to take their own health responsibilities in giving them&#xD;
      positive health behavior. The rapid advancement of technology, cultural differences, changing&#xD;
      living conditions, and increasing chronic diseases show us that people should have the&#xD;
      authority to make decisions about their own health, starting from primary school and&#xD;
      childhood. All these bring the concept of health literacy to the fore. According to WHO, the&#xD;
      concept of health literacy is the cognitive and social skills about individuals' ability to&#xD;
      access, understand and use information and their desires in order to protect and improve&#xD;
      well-being in health. Providing appropriate health education for age groups is very important&#xD;
      for the development of health literacy in children. School-based health education is&#xD;
      necessary for health promotion in the 21st century. Studies show that children's health&#xD;
      literacy levels are low. There are very few scales that measure health literacy in children.&#xD;
      Although there are no school health nursing practices in Northern Cyprus, there are no&#xD;
      training programs to develop positive health behaviors. With this study we have planned, it&#xD;
      is aimed to implement a training program within the scope of the &quot;School Health Nursing&#xD;
      Program&quot; in primary schools selected as a pilot in Northern Cyprus and to form the&#xD;
      foundations of School health nursing in our country in line with its results. In addition,&#xD;
      measurement tools specific to age groups are needed to measure the level of health literacy,&#xD;
      especially in school-age children. Therefore, another purpose of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of this program on children by implementing an education program within the&#xD;
      scope of the &quot;School Health Nursing Program&quot;, which will be a first in our country, and to&#xD;
      develop the &quot;Child Health Literacy Scale&quot; and to make it a significant contribution to&#xD;
      science with this scale.&#xD;

      Today's health systems are of great importance in protecting and improving the health of&#xD;
      children. It is very important for children to take their own health responsibilities in&#xD;
      giving them positive health behavior. The rapid advancement of technology, cultural&#xD;
      differences, changing living conditions, and increasing chronic diseases show us that people&#xD;
      should have the authority to make decisions about their own health, starting from primary&#xD;
      school and childhood. All these bring the concept of health literacy to the fore. According&#xD;
      to WHO, the concept of health literacy is the cognitive and social skills about individuals'&#xD;
      ability to access, understand and use information and their desires in order to protect and&#xD;
      improve well-being in health. It is very important to provide health education appropriate to&#xD;
      age groups for the development of health literacy in children. School-based health education&#xD;
      is necessary for health promotion in the 21st century. In this context, school health nurses&#xD;
      gain great importance. School health nursing is of great importance for children to acquire&#xD;
      positive health behaviors and to take their own health responsibilities . In addition to the&#xD;
      importance of school health nursing, it is also important to know the health literacy levels&#xD;
      of children. Studies show that children's health literacy levels are low. There are very few&#xD;
      scales that measure health literacy in children. There is no scale developed to measure&#xD;
      health literacy in primary school students in the literature. Among the topics given to&#xD;
      children in health education, nutrition, physical activity, first aid, individual hygiene,&#xD;
      protection from accidents and prevention of violence are among the most important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the development of positive health behaviors, healthy nutrition and regular physical&#xD;
      activity behaviors, the education given at school age is very important. In this sense,&#xD;
      important responsibilities fall on school health nurses. Although there are no school health&#xD;
      nursing practices in Northern Cyprus, there are no training programs to develop positive&#xD;
      health behaviors. With this study we have planned, it is aimed to implement a training&#xD;
      program within the scope of the &quot;School Health Nursing Program&quot; in primary schools selected&#xD;
      as a pilot in Northern Cyprus and to form the foundations of School health nursing in our&#xD;
      country in line with its results. In addition, measurement tools specific to age groups are&#xD;
      needed to measure the level of health literacy, especially in school-age children. Therefore,&#xD;
      another purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of this program on children by&#xD;
      implementing an education program within the scope of the &quot;School Health Nursing Program&quot;,&#xD;
      which will be a first in our country, and to develop the &quot;Child Health Literacy Scale&quot; and to&#xD;
      make it a significant contribution to science with this scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GOAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was planned to evaluate the effectiveness of the school health nursing program&#xD;
      administered to primary school students under the leadership of a nurse and to develop the&#xD;
      &quot;Child Health Literacy Scale&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Type of Research&#xD;
&#xD;
           The research will be carried out in accordance with the methodological and randomized&#xD;
           controlled experimental research design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Place and time of the research&#xD;
&#xD;
           The research will be carried out in two stages in state primary schools affiliated to&#xD;
           the Ministry of National Education and Culture located within the borders of the Turkish&#xD;
           Republic of Northern Cyprus, following the approval of the Ethics Committee and&#xD;
           institutional permissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The universe and sample of the research&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Universe of the research will be formed by the children studying in state primary schools&#xD;
      affiliated with the Ministry of National Education and Culture of the Turkish Republic of&#xD;
      Northern Cyprus between the dates of the research. The study, which is planned in two stages,&#xD;
      will be studied with two sample groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage: 4th grade students of two primary schools in the Kyrenia region will&#xD;
      participate in the selection of the school where the &quot;School Health Nursing Application&#xD;
      Program&quot;, which is included in the first stage of the research, will be applied. In the&#xD;
      study, it is expected that there will be a moderate increase in the scale scores of the&#xD;
      experimental group children after the education and the effect size is high (d = 0.50)&#xD;
      according to the Cohen scale. Accordingly, the sample size required for 80% power at d = 0.50&#xD;
      and α = 0.05 was determined as 30 persons for the experimental group to approach the normal&#xD;
      distribution by using G * Power 3.1.9.2 software. Similarly, 30 people will be taken for the&#xD;
      control group, and the sample size is 60 people, 30 being experimental and 30 control groups.&#xD;
      The experimental and control group students will be determined with the MedCalc software&#xD;
      using the block randomization technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage, the development of the &quot;Child Health-Literacy Scale&quot; will be carried out&#xD;
      with 6458 students in the 9-11 age group who attend 4th and 5th grades of primary schools.&#xD;
      Students will be determined by simple random sampling method among 4th and 5th grade students&#xD;
      of primary schools in Kyrenia, Nicosia, Güzelyurt, Famagusta and İskele districts.&#xD;
