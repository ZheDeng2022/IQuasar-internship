    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is the first-in-human study of BBT-176. The purpose of this trial is to&#xD;
      investigate the safety and tolerability of BBT-176 (Part 1) and to evaluate the anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity of BBT-176 (Part 2).&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>(Part 2) Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>throughout study completion, approximately 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>PFS will be calculated for each patient as the number of days from the first day of treatment to the date of the first documented disease progression or date of death, whichever occurs first.</description>
