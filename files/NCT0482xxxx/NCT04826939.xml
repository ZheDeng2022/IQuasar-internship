  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The leva and PFDx devices accurately reflect pelvic floor motion consistent with TPUS&#xD;
      evaluation. During a voluntary PFM contraction, the change in angle from a position of rest&#xD;
      to maximal effort that is detected by each device is positively correlated with TPUS&#xD;
      measurements and Modified Oxford scores.&#xD;

      Thirty women 18 years or older will be recruited from OB/GYN, FPMRS or other clinics.&#xD;
      Following informed consent and successful screening, subjects will undergo testing as&#xD;
      outlined below. Five subjects (all will be invited until five subjects have agreed) will&#xD;
      return to clinic in 1-2 weeks to undergo repeat testing using all modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, subject information will be collected, including&#xD;
      demographic data, BMI, and medical history (including ob/gyn history). Subjects will complete&#xD;
      urinalysis for pregnancy. Subjects will also complete the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory&#xD;
      (PFDI-20) questionnaire. All subjects will undergo a complete pelvic examination including&#xD;
      pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q), a digital assessment of PFM strength (Modified&#xD;
      Oxford Scale) and receive a TPUS. Subjects will also complete a series of PFM contractions&#xD;
      using the leva and PFDx devices to measure angle changes, and undergo vaginal assessment with&#xD;
      a perineomter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic floor muscle assessment Prior to recording device measurements, a correct pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscle contraction will be verified via manual pelvic floor assessment. Subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed to perform a &quot;lift-and-squeeze&quot; maneuver of the pelvic floor, and correct PFM&#xD;
      contraction will be verified by the primary examiner (LHQ). PFM strength will then be&#xD;
      assessed via digital palpation by the examiner inserting the first and/or second fingers&#xD;
      approximately 4 cm into the vagina and palpating the right and left PFM during contraction.&#xD;
      Strength will be graded according to the 6-point Modified Oxford Scale (0=no contraction;&#xD;
      1='flicker'; 2=weak; 3=moderate; 4=good; 5=strong). The mean score of the right and left&#xD;
      sides of the vagina will be calculated and used for correlation analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perineometry PFM strength will be measured using a Peritronâ„¢ perineometer, which is a 28mm&#xD;
      diameter compressible probe connected to a handheld microprocessor. It provides readings of&#xD;
      pelvic floor contraction in cm of H20 with precision up to one decimal point, and it has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to show reproducible and reliable measurements. The resting vaginal pressure and&#xD;
      two peak pressures will be measured. For this study, PFM strength is defined as the augmented&#xD;
      vaginal pressure, calculated by measuring the average of 2 peak pressures minus the resting&#xD;
      vaginal pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TPUS measurements TPUS imaging will be completed at the time of the study visit using the BK&#xD;
      Medical Ultrafocus (Peabody, MA) and 8802 transperineal transducer. The probe will be covered&#xD;
      with ultrasound gel and a probe cover. All ultrasound studies will be performed in the office&#xD;
      setting with the patient in the dorsal lithotomy position, with hips flexed and abducted. No&#xD;
      preparation is required, and no rectal or vaginal contrast will be used. Patients will be&#xD;
      instructed to arrive at the office with a partially full bladder and to avoid excessive&#xD;
      pressure on surrounding structures that might distort the anatomy. In the sagittal view,&#xD;
      dynamic ultrasound parameters will be measured relative to a horizontal reference line at the&#xD;
      level of the infero-posterior margin of the pubic symphysis. Dynamic images will be obtained&#xD;
      during PFM contractions and at rest. At least 3 cycles of PFM contraction and relaxation will&#xD;
      be recorded for each individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment will be performed at rest, then with 3 maximum-effort voluntary&#xD;
      contraction (MVC). Ultrasound measurements will include: Anterior-posterior distance (APD) of&#xD;
      the levator hiatus to the pubic bone (primary aim), levator urethra gap (LUG), distance from&#xD;
      bladder neck to the pubic bone and distance of the midurethra to the pubic bone. Urethral&#xD;
      angle at rest and with max contraction will also be measured. The cravioventral shift of the&#xD;
      levator plate relative to a vertical line of reference relative to the anorectal angle will&#xD;
      also be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leva measurements Subjects will be instructed on proper insertion and placement of the leva&#xD;
      device. The examiner will assist with device placement, as needed. With the leva inserted,&#xD;
      subjects will assume a standing position. Subjects will complete a series of pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscle training (five lifts for 15 seconds of maximum lift, followe by 15 seconds of rest).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFDx measurements The examiner will place the PFDx in the vagina, ensuring the ring component&#xD;
      is positioned at the fornix with the extension running the length of vagina and out of the&#xD;
      body. With the device retained in the vagina, subjects will assume a standing position. Angle&#xD;
      measurements will be recorded at rest and with maximal voluntary 'lift-and-squeeze'&#xD;
      contraction. These measurements will be repeated at least 3 times with 1-minute rest between&#xD;
      each measurement.&#xD;
