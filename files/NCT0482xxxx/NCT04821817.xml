      -  This is a prospective randomized clinical study that will be carried on adult patients&#xD;
           aged from 21-60 years and presented for strabismus surgery under peribulbar anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be excluded if they refused to participate or had a contraindication to&#xD;
           peribulbar anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be randomly distributed into either control group in which peribulbar&#xD;
           anesthesia will be performed by injection of 10 ml local anesthetic mixture composed of&#xD;
           4 ml of plain bupivacaine 0.5%, 4 ml of lidocaine 2% containing 50 IU, and 2 ml normal&#xD;
           saline or rocuronium group which peribulbar anesthesia will be performed by injection of&#xD;
           10 ml local anesthetic mixture composed of 4 ml of plain bupivacaine 0.5%, 4 ml of&#xD;
           lidocaine 2% containing 50 IU, and 0.06 mg/kg of rocuronium in 2 ml normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements will include; -&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patient age, weight, height, gestational age, and gravidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The duration of globe akinesia (primary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The onset of lid and globe akinesia and the duration of lid akinesia&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The onset and duration of sensory block&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Time required to start the surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Akinesia score&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. The visual analog score (VAS) which is composed of 0-10 score will be used to&#xD;
                assess the severity of postoperative pain (where 0=no pain and 10=severe pain), The&#xD;
                VAS score will be evaluated 1 h, 2 h postoperative, then every 2 h till 12 h. Any&#xD;
                patients with VAS score more than 4 received rescue analgesia in the form of 50 mg&#xD;
                tramadol intravenous injection with the calculation of the time for the first call&#xD;
                of postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Any detected complication as nausea and vomiting, pain on injection, or increased&#xD;
                intraocular tension.&#xD;

      This prospective randomized double-blind study will be carried out on adult patients who will&#xD;
      be presented for strabismus surgery in Ophthalmology Department in Tanta university hospitals&#xD;
      over the 6-month duration, an informed written consent will be obtained from all the&#xD;
      participants, all patients data will be confidential and will be used for the current study&#xD;
      only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomly allocated into two groups with the aid of computer-generated&#xD;
      software of randomization. All the local anesthetic mixtures will be prepared under complete&#xD;
      aseptic precautions by an anesthesia resident who will not participate in the study and will&#xD;
      be blinded to its groups in to: - Group C (Control group) (20 Patients): Patients in this&#xD;
      group will receive peribulbar anesthesia with a 10 ml local anesthetic mixture composed of 4&#xD;
      ml of plain bupivacaine 0.5%, 4 ml of lidocaine 2% containing 50 IU, and 2 ml normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group R (rocuronium group) (20 patients): Patients in this group will receive peribulbar&#xD;
      anesthesia with 10 ml local anesthetic mixture composed of 4 ml of plain bupivacaine 0.5%, 4&#xD;
      ml of lidocaine 2% containing 50 IU, and 0.06 mg/kg of rocuronium in 2 ml normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic technique On arrival of patients to the pre-anesthesia preparation room, we will&#xD;
      allow them to rest in a supine position with the connection of monitors that consist of 5&#xD;
      leads ECG, non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximeter, and temperature. Also, intravascular&#xD;
      access will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient will be admitted to the operating theatre, all monitors will be applied. A&#xD;
      nasal cannula was used at a flow rate of 2-4 l/min to supply oxygen to patients. The&#xD;
      peribulbar block will be performed by the same anesthesiologist under aseptic precautions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique of peribulbar block Disposable needles in a size of 25 gauge and 16mm bevels&#xD;
      will be used to perform the peribulbar injection. The injection site will be limited by the&#xD;
      lateral nasal margin laterally, inferior orbital margin inferiorly, and the lower lacrimal&#xD;
      punctum superiorly. Once the needle introduced, the patient will be asked to look in the four&#xD;
      cardinal directions of the gaze, superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal to ensure that the&#xD;
      needle is not penetrating the eye globe, then negative aspiration will be done to exclude&#xD;
      intravascular position of the needle, then, the peribulbar injection of the previously&#xD;
      prepared local anesthetic mixture will be performed over 30 seconds and followed by the&#xD;
      fullness of the eyelids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eyelids will be closed and covered by eye pads carefully with an application of 20 mmHg&#xD;
      pressure through an intermittent application of Honan ball for 10 min. The intermittent eye&#xD;
      compression will be relieved after 1 min, 3 min, 5 min, 7 min, 9 min, and 10 min to assess&#xD;
      the onset and the quality of sensory and motor blockade. The sensory block will be assessed&#xD;
      by the abolishment of corneal reflex to the installation of physiological drops on the cornea&#xD;
      or conjunctiva. The onset of anesthesia will be determined by the time interval from local&#xD;
      anesthetics injection and loss of corneal reflex. The motor block will be evaluated by asking&#xD;
      the patient to open, close, and squeeze his eye (Lid Akinesia) and to move his eye globe in&#xD;
      the four directions of the gaze (globe akinesia). The quality of akinesia will be assessed&#xD;
      through the use of akinesia score where 0=inability to move (total akinesia), 1=partial&#xD;
      movement (partial akinesia), and 2=full movements (no akinesia). This score was used to&#xD;
      assess both lid akinesia and globe akinesia in the four directions with an overall score of&#xD;
      10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The onset of lid akinesia will be calculated from peribulbar injection to the partial loss of&#xD;
      ability to open or squeeze eyelids, while the onset of globe akinesia will be estimated from&#xD;
      the injection of the local anesthetic mixture and partial loss of movement of the eye globe&#xD;
      in the four cardinal directions. The surgery will be considered to be optimal to be started&#xD;
      when the patient had corneal anesthesia together with partial lid and globe akinesia. The&#xD;
      optimal time to start the surgery will be considered as the elapsed time between local&#xD;
      anesthetics injection and satisfying the goals to start the surgery. The intraocular pressure&#xD;
      will be measured preoperatively and immediately before initiating the surgery with detection&#xD;
      of a number of patients with an increase in the intraocular tension (increase intraocular&#xD;
      pressure more than 25 mmHg or by more than 10 mmHg than the preoperative value).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the sensory block will be estimated to be the time interval from the&#xD;
      peribulbar injection till regaining corneal sensation, while, the duration of lid or globe&#xD;
      akinesia will be determined by the time elapsed between performing the peribulbar injection&#xD;
      and the full regaining of lid or globe movement respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the duration of globe akinesia. Secondary outcomes will include&#xD;
      the onset and duration of sensory block.&#xD;
