  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this project is to measure the increase in aerobic physical and&#xD;
      metabolic capacities with a 6-month training on a rower assisted by electrostimulation of&#xD;
      lower limbs in a population of adults with traumatic paraplegia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beyond the inability to walk, chronic paraplegic patients show an increase in their mortality&#xD;
      from cardiovascular pathologies, compared to the same age groups of the general population.&#xD;
      It is the hypoactivity induced by neurological impairment that is implicated in the first&#xD;
      place in the pathogenesis of these abnormalities. The search for training methods adapted to&#xD;
      these patients is justified to limit cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to measure the increase in aerobic physical and metabolic&#xD;
      capacities with a 6-month training on a rower assisted by electrostimulation of lower limbs&#xD;
      in a population of adults with stabilized paraplegia (non-walkers), of traumatic origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study is divided in two 3-month phases. The first consists on a training on a rowing machine&#xD;
      with solicitation of the electrostimulated lower limbs only for a period of 3 months at the&#xD;
      rate of 3 sessions of 30 minutes per week. The second consists on a training on a rowing&#xD;
      machine with solicitation of the electrostimulated lower limbs and upper for a period of 3&#xD;
      months at the rate of 3 sessions of 30 minutes per week. The evaluations are composed of the&#xD;
      measurement of maximum oxygen consumption, muscle and neurological parameters&#xD;
