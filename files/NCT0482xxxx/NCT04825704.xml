  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A placebo-controlled and double-blind study is planned according to current legislation and&#xD;
      ICH GCP guidelines with 80 patients at Nordland Hospital, Bodø. Fifty percent are randomized&#xD;
      to receive bupivacaine 5 mg / ml on the gauze swabs used to stop the bleeding after&#xD;
      tonsillectomy, and 50% receive 0.9% sodium chloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain at rest and pain when swallowing according to numerical rating scale (0-10), as well as&#xD;
      the presence of the following symptoms (yes / no): nausea, vomiting, food intake, bleeding,&#xD;
      fever, need for extra painkillers in the form of morphine or similar will be registered 1, 2,&#xD;
      3, 4, 5, 6 hours and 1, 2 4 and 6 days after the operation. Differences are analyzed with&#xD;
      &quot;mixed models&quot; statistics and the results will be published in a peer-based journal.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients undergoing isolated tonsillectomy from the age of 5 years to 40 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known allergy to local anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients using painkillers in the form of opioids fixed before inclusion in the study.&#xD;
             People who have a lot of pain often have more pain after known painful stimuli, such&#xD;
             as surgery. This is known as the phenomenon of &quot;central sensitization&quot; and&#xD;
             &quot;opioid-induced hyperalgesia&quot; and will probably contribute to great heterogeneity&#xD;
             within the groups. Because very few people use opioids regularly from those who have&#xD;
             an isolated tonsillectomy performed, it can make it difficult to detect any&#xD;
             differences between the groups, and the number is far too low to be able to perform&#xD;
             stratified analyzes on only these people.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Persons weighing less than 10 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Persons over the age of 18 who are not competent to give consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients using class Ib antiarrhythmics (lidocaine, mexiletine) due to increased risk&#xD;
             of additive toxicity due to structural similarities. (see SPC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Known partial or total heart block that has not had a pacemaker inserted (see SPC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Severe hepatic failure (spontaneous prothrombin time -international normalized ratio&#xD;
             (PT-INR)&gt; 2.0). These patients are not offered this type of procedure as day surgery&#xD;
             due to the high risk of complications for the surgery itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Severe renal failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;15 ml / min / 1.73m2).&#xD;
