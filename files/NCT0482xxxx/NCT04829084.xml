  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reiyukai Eiko Masunaga Eye Hospital (REMEH) is a non-profitable organization. Retina services&#xD;
      were resumed from October 2019. Until this retinal service started, it has been mostly&#xD;
      cataract-focused. People are unaware of this new retinal service in the hospital. The&#xD;
      investigators would like to fill this gap and our objective is to increase the attendance of&#xD;
      patients with Diabetes Mellitus, for retinal screening at REMEH by providing health education&#xD;
      intervention to selected physicians and establish a referral pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: pre- post-intervention Methods: The investigators are going to conduct&#xD;
      intervention by providing health education on diabetes Retinopathy to the health personnel of&#xD;
      Scheer Memorial Hospital. It has been referring eye patients to REMEH as there is no eye&#xD;
      department there.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management: The demographic information of health personnel of Sheer memorial and&#xD;
      demographic information and other variables of the patient who are referred from Scheer&#xD;
      Hospital will be collected and entered in an excel sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period of approximately 16 months (March 2020 to Sep 2021): Initial 10 months for&#xD;
      proposal writing, preparation, and getting ethical approval. Feb2021 - April 2021 three&#xD;
      months for pretest intervention May- July further data collection and last two months Aug-&#xD;
      Sep Analysis and writing result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The proposed outcome is to increase the proportional change in the number of&#xD;
      patients availing retinal services and to find out a proportional increase in the number of&#xD;
      diabetes screenings from the baseline. Also, a positive outcome is a clear indication for&#xD;
      health education, and setting communication between general physicians and specialties will&#xD;
      set the path for improvement in a timely health care delivery system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of&#xD;
      blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood&#xD;
      vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. People with diabetes can develop an eye disease called&#xD;
      Diabetic Retinopathy when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina.&#xD;
      Diabetic Retinopathy if detected early can be treated to preserve the vision. Once the vision&#xD;
      has been lost it cannot usually be restored. Diabetic retinopathy is an emerging cause of&#xD;
      blindness in developing countries. Diabetic retinopathy is a common and specific&#xD;
      microvascular complication of diabetes and remains the leading cause of preventable blindness&#xD;
      in working-aged people. It is identified in a third of people with diabetes and associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk of life-threatening systemic vascular complications, including stroke,&#xD;
      coronary heart disease, and heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The worldwide prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) was found to be 34.6%. WHO estimates&#xD;
      that DR is responsible for 4.8% of the 37 million cases of blindness throughout the world.&#xD;
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the fifth leading cause of visual impairment and the fourth&#xD;
      leading cause of blindness in the world (WHO, TADDS). In a study undertaken in an urban&#xD;
      population in Nepal, M.D.Bhattarai found the prevalence of diabetes among people aged 20&#xD;
      years and above to be 14.6% and the prevalence among people aged 40 years and above to be&#xD;
      19%. KAP study in Kathmandu revealed good knowledge, good attitude but poor practice among&#xD;
      the diabetic group. In contrast, the non-diabetic groups showed poor knowledge but a good&#xD;
      attitude and poor lifestyle practices. Hence diabetic group needs good practice like early&#xD;
      diagnosis of DR and self-care, and the non-diabetic group needs knowledge. Simply increasing&#xD;
      awareness among diabetic patients about the risk factors is not sufficient to improve&#xD;
      ophthalmic care. Various strategies will be necessary to improve good practice and patient&#xD;
      visits to an eye clinic on a regular basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reiyukai Eiko Masunaga Eye Hospital (REMEH) was established in February 2007. REMEH is a&#xD;
      non-profitable organization. Approximately 411,057 populations of Kavrepalanchowk district&#xD;
      are the catchment area of REMEH. The REMEH hospital provided OPD service to 43,787 patients&#xD;
      in 2018 and 54,213 patients in 2019, performed 1,058 cataract surgeries in 2018 and 1,647 in&#xD;
      2019. Similarly, retina services were resumed from October 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People are unaware of this new retinal service in the hospital. There was irregular retinal&#xD;
      service due to the lack of a vitreoretinal surgeon. But now there is regular medical as well&#xD;
      as surgical retina service. The unavailability of retina surgeons, low literacy rate and the&#xD;
      lack of awareness programs conducted in the community, costly retinal services, lack of&#xD;
      proper linkage to diabetic clinics and REMEH could be a reason for the low uptake of retina&#xD;
      services. The investigators would like to fill this gap and increase the uptake of this&#xD;
      retina sub-specialty focusing on Diabetes Mellitus to decrease blindness caused by Diabetic&#xD;
      Retinopathy by augmenting the referral pathway and declining the problem tree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is operational research that will take place in REMEH. The study design is a&#xD;
      non-randomized pre and post-intervention study design without a control group. The&#xD;
      intervention will consist of Health Education to specific health personnel who deal with DM&#xD;
      patients. A multi-specialty hospital named Scheer Memorial Hospital will be the intervention&#xD;
      hospital. Through the intervention, a referral pathway will be created to send the diabetes&#xD;
      patients for diabetic retinopathy screening to REMEH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To provide health education intervention to selected health personnel and&#xD;
      establish a referral pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To increase the attendance of patients with Diabetes Mellitus for&#xD;
      retinal screening at REMEH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of the intervention hospital:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scheer memorial hospital is a 150-bed hospital with daily 475 outpatient department patients.&#xD;
      It is located 1.8 km away from REMEH and has 223 staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the complete enumerations of all health personnel treating patients with diabetes,&#xD;
      below mentioned personnel will have more chances to interact with diabetic patients so only a&#xD;
      total of 19 health personnel will be chosen. They are 4 physicians, 4 pediatricians, 8&#xD;
      medical officers, and 3 assistants of Scheer Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actions expected from selected health personnel in Scheer Memorial&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Counsel DM patients to visit REMEH&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use referral slip while referring patients to REMEH&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Handover DR-related pamphlet to DM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Record total cases referred to REMEH in a month Depending on the feasibility, the Pilot&#xD;
      may be conducted with another group of doctors, to see if the materials are well understood&#xD;
      and the duration is optimal. A pilot test will help to see the smoothness of the sessions&#xD;
      conducted. Necessary modification in the PPT, method of training delivery if needed will be&#xD;
      done for the training sessions after the pilot Pilot visit: It will include the same IEC&#xD;
      materials used for intervention. PPT presentation by retina specialist with ample time to&#xD;
      answer queries. One short video display. Distribution of posters, pamphlets,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. st visit: The information sheet with the consent form will be shared. The pre-test will&#xD;
           be done. PPT presentation by retina specialist with information on DR and importance of&#xD;
           the timely visit to screen eyes for DM patients will be presented. Distribution of&#xD;
           posters, pamphlets will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd visit: Two video presentations about Diabetic Retinopathy will be done. And posters&#xD;
           and pamphlets will be distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. rd visit: Refresher of previous sessions. A small quiz about the knowledge about DR&#xD;
           among the health personnel will be done and a post-test will be done about the acquired&#xD;
           knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data collection has been started from 1st June 2020 and has been continued till 25th&#xD;
      February 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Management for the manuscript-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preparation (three months: March 2020 to December 2020) The first 10 months will be used&#xD;
           for planning, proposal writing, and getting ethical approval from Nepal Health Research&#xD;
           Council. Scheer Memorial will be requested for approval of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-test and Intervention (February 2021 to April 2021) Baseline data will be collected&#xD;
           from June 1st to February 25th and the intervention started on 26th February 2021.&#xD;
           Initially, the Scheer Memorial hospital will be visited by the management team and the&#xD;
           procedure regarding the project will be explained including the patient referral&#xD;
           process. Similarly, a register will be maintained at REMEH to get demographic&#xD;
           information of each and every Diabetes Mellitus patient and information on the referral&#xD;
           physician/hospitals or self-referral visiting REMEH. Monthly data will be collected from&#xD;
           both the hospital regarding the number of patients referred for DR screening. Pretest to&#xD;
           see the smoothness of the training will be done and then monthly once visits will be&#xD;
           done at Scheer Memorial for intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data collection (Four months: May 2021 to July 2021) The data will be collected for&#xD;
           another three months ie: May to July 2021. Data on demographic detail of health&#xD;
           personnel, pre, and post-test scoring will be collected. Data on demographic details,&#xD;
           referral hospital, presence and stage of DR, visual outcome of patients will also be&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data analysis and Manuscript writing: (2 months: August- September 2021) The last 2&#xD;
           months August and September will be for data analysis and manuscript writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population: Health care personnel Study participants: Selected health care personnel&#xD;
      from Scheer Memorial Hospital hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling techniques: Complete enumerations of all health personnel treating diabetic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure of Data Collection: Primary data collection will be done by a single person who&#xD;
      assists in OPD and who will be designated for data collection. The register will be&#xD;
      maintained at REMEH and monthly data on the number of DM patients referred for DR screening&#xD;
      will be collected from Scheer Memorial. These data will later be entered into Microsoft Excel&#xD;
      files or SPSS on weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Strategies /Activities and patient pathway:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be explained to Scheer Memorial Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention in Scheer Memorial Hospital to do awareness campaigns and refer diabetic&#xD;
           patients to REMEH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The health personals will be acknowledged in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A referral slip/ written communication will be made and the referral process will be a&#xD;
           vice versa feedback process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening of all Diabetes patients will be done at REMEH by dilated fundus examination&#xD;
           under slit-lamp biomicroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dilated fundus examination of diabetic patients visiting the hospital will be done by&#xD;
           slit-lamp biomicroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the participants enter REMEH for retinal services firstly the patient will be assessed.&#xD;
      The demographic data along with the referred physician or self-referral will be noted. It&#xD;
      will include history focused on diabetes and its modifiers. History of patients includes:&#xD;
      duration of diabetes, past glycemic control (hemoglobin A,1c), Medications (especially&#xD;
      insulin, oral hypoglycemic, anti-hypertensives, and lipid-lowering drugs), mention whether&#xD;
      simply diet control or herbal, systemic history (e.g., renal disease, systemic hypertension,&#xD;
      serum lipid levels, pregnancy, Anemia, Cardiac condition), ocular history smoking history and&#xD;
      contact information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening will be made according to WHO tools for assessment of Diabetic Retinopathy.&#xD;
      Detailed patient assessment will include a complete ophthalmic examination, including visual&#xD;
      acuity and the identification and grading of severity of DR and presence of DME for each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination of the eye will include: Visual acuity, measurement of intraocular&#xD;
      pressure (IOP), gonioscopy when indicated (e.g., when neovascularization of the iris is seen&#xD;
      or in eyes with increased IOP), slit-lamp bio-microscopy for anterior segment evaluation, and&#xD;
      fundus examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up will be scheduled according to the National Guidelines for Management of&#xD;
      Diabetic Retinopathy 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entry and Analysis: Data entry and management will be done by the optometrist.&#xD;
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 will be used in the end just&#xD;
      before project outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approvals: Ethical approval taken from Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is a non-randomized pre and post-intervention design which includes the&#xD;
      collaboration between an eye hospital and multi-specialty hospital focusing on the health&#xD;
      professional as a stakeholder to increase the referral of diabetic. The stakeholders will be&#xD;
      provided health education on awareness of diabetic retinopathy using PPTs, posters,&#xD;
      pamphlets, and referral slips. The outcome of the intervention will be assessed by a pre-and&#xD;
      post-evaluation questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few studies similar to ours that have assessed the awareness of physicians by&#xD;
      calculating the Diabetic retinopathy awareness index. Anwar et al conducted a 27-item&#xD;
      consented &amp; validated, multiple-choice questionnaire based on physician's characteristics,&#xD;
      knowledge, and practice of diabetic eye care and challenges faced due to the current DR&#xD;
      referral system in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use a referral slip as a mode of communication between an&#xD;
      ophthalmologist and health care personnel with reference to the referral of diabetic&#xD;
      patients. Storey et al found that written communication between an ophthalmologist and a&#xD;
      primary care physician (PCP) and referral vice versa was effective to change the behavior of&#xD;
      the referring physicians. Riordan et al assessed that phone /letter reminder to patient and&#xD;
      provider level training increased diabetic screening. Printed educational messages or posters&#xD;
      also increased behavior and attitude change to primary care physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grimshaw et al also found that printed educational messages increased the number of referrals&#xD;
      by primary care physicians similar to our study where the investigators are using referral&#xD;
      slips to communicate between the ophthalmologist and health Health education intervention&#xD;
      could be a low-cost solution to improve the awareness, access, utilization of retinal health&#xD;
      care services; thus, health education intervention could reduce the burden of DR among people&#xD;
      with diabetes. However, this is an unexplored area in Nepal. Working closely with the&#xD;
      stakeholders, this study will evaluate the role of health education interventions (which are&#xD;
      already validated in other low-income settings) to reduce the burden of DR in Nepal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength and Limitations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strength of our study is that it will be one of the first studies including stakeholders&#xD;
      to increase the attendance of diabetic retinopathy in Nepal. This helps to reduce the&#xD;
      unavoidable blindness caused by diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
