      Rationale: The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is increasingly being recognized as a potential cause&#xD;
      of chronic low back and buttock pain. The SIJ is affected in 14-22% in patients presenting&#xD;
      with this pain. Conservative treatment options include oral analgesic use, physical therapy,&#xD;
      radiofrequency denervation and intraarticular steroid injections. When non-surgical treatment&#xD;
      remains ineffective, surgical intervention is a reasonable option in the form of minimally&#xD;
      invasive sacroiliac joint fusion (MISJF). Recent literature suggests that imbalance and&#xD;
      sagittal sacropelvic morphology can occur in patients with SIJ dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using motion analyses, the investigators want to evaluate full movement patterns in SIJ&#xD;
      patients. Potentially, changes in these parameters can be observed before and after MISJF&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine spatiotemporal parameters, pelvic obliquity, center of gravity and&#xD;
      load capacity in patients suffering from SIJ dysfunction before and after MISJF surgery.&#xD;
      Movement parameters will also be determined in healthy individuals to compare with patients&#xD;
      suffering from SIJ dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This prospective cohort study will include patients enlisted for MISJF surgery&#xD;
      because of SIJ dysfunction. Spatiotemporal parameters, pelvic obliquity, center of gravity&#xD;
      and load capacity will be examined before and 3 months after surgery in a professional Motion&#xD;
      Lab. Movement parameter of healthy individuals will also be evaluated at the Motion Lab. All&#xD;
      data will be analyzed using MATLAB software.&#xD;

      1.2 RATIONALE The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is an anatomic structure that is increasingly being&#xD;
      recognized as a potential cause of chronic low back and buttock pain. The SIJ is affected in&#xD;
      14-22% in patients presenting with this pain.1,2 A wide variability exists in the clinical&#xD;
      presentation of SIJ dysfunction, from localized pain around the SIJ to radiating pain into&#xD;
      the groin or even the entire lower extremity.3 This sometimes makes it challenging to&#xD;
      accurately diagnose SIJ dysfunction during physical examination. Most surgeons palpate the&#xD;
      SIJ to determine the level and area of tenderness. There are also several provocative tests,&#xD;
      but their reliability is limited.4,5 Currently, diagnostic SIJ intraarticular injection is&#xD;
      the benchmark for diagnosing SIJ dysfunction.6 Conservative treatment options include oral&#xD;
      analgesic use, physical therapy, radiofrequency denervation and intraarticular steroid&#xD;
      injections. 7-11 When non-surgical treatment remains ineffective, minimally invasive&#xD;
      sacroiliac joint fusion (MISJF) is a reasonable option.12 Current literature suggests that&#xD;
      imbalance and sagittal sacropelvic morphology can occur in patients with SIJ dysfunction.13&#xD;
      Sagittal imbalance and sagittal sacropelvic morphology can in turn lead to compensatory&#xD;
      motion in the SIJ, leading to more dysfunction and pain.14 The investigators wonder if&#xD;
      changes in spatiotemporal parameters, pelvic obliquity, center of gravity and load capacity&#xD;
      can be observed in patients suffering from SIJ dysfunction before and after MISJF surgery&#xD;
      with the help of motion analysis. Expectedly, these changes correlate to the clinical&#xD;
      condition patients are in&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 OBJECTIVES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of two different parts, each with different objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Process evaluation on measuring movement patterns in the motion lab:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. What differences can be detected in spatiotemporal parameters, pelvic obliquity,&#xD;
           center of gravity and load capacity between healthy individuals and patients suffering&#xD;
           from SI dysfunction?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical evaluation of MISJF surgery in patients with SI dysfunction:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. What differences can be detected in spatiotemporal parameters, pelvic obliquity,&#xD;
                center of gravity and load capacity in patients suffering from SI dysfunction&#xD;
                before and after MISJF surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. What changes occur in patients suffering from SI dysfunction after MISJF surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. STUDY DESIGN 2.1 STUDY POPULATION In total 10 patients suffering from SIJ dysfunction with&#xD;
      an indication for MISJF, 10 healthy individuals under the age of 25 and 10 healthy&#xD;
      individuals matching the demographic characteristics of patients suffering from SI&#xD;
      dysfunction will be included. This is a total of 30 individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for participating clients in the healthy study group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy individuals under the age of 25, with no history of SI dysfunction or lower back&#xD;
      related illnesses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for participating clients in the healthy study group with the same&#xD;
      demographic characteristics as the SI dysfunction patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy individuals between the age of 25 and 45, female sex and postpartum with no history&#xD;
      of SI dysfunction or lower back related illnesses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for the MISJF group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient is suffering from SIJ dysfunction (uni- or bilateral) because of postpartum&#xD;
           pelvic instability or because of Ehlers Danlos syndrome and is enlisted for primary&#xD;
           MISJF surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient is mobile enough to perform several tests at the motion lab, needed to&#xD;
           obtain spatiotemporal parameters, pelvic obliquity, center of gravity and load capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria for all participating clients are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The individual is not mobile and/or unable to perform tests at the motion lab, needed to&#xD;
           obtain spatiotemporal parameters, pelvic obliquity, center of gravity and load capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inadequate command of the Dutch language.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age under 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. METHODS This prospective study will examine spatiotemporal parameters, pelvic&#xD;
           obliquity, center of gravity and load capacity in healthy individuals and patients&#xD;
           suffering from SI dysfunction before and after MISJF surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 STUDY PARAMETERS Spatiotemporal parameters, pelvic obliquity, center of gravity and load&#xD;
      capacity are the main study parameters and will be determined in the motion lab when walking&#xD;
      (gait analysis) and during single leg stance (both sides). Further tests may include straight&#xD;
      leg raise while seated and step-ups (both sides).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 STUDY PROCEDURE First, spatiotemporal parameters, pelvic obliquity, center of gravity and&#xD;
      load capacity will be determined in 10 healthy individuals under the age of 25. The same&#xD;
      parameters will be determined in 10 healthy individuals matching the demographic&#xD;
      characteristics of patients suffering from SI dysfunction (female, aged 25 to 45 years and&#xD;
      postpartum). Between these two groups potential differences will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of the study spatiotemporal parameters, pelvic obliquity, center of&#xD;
      gravity and load capacity will be determined in patients suffering from SI dysfunction before&#xD;
      MISJF surgery. These patients are elected for primary MISJF surgery for SI dysfunction (uni-&#xD;
      or bilateral) because of postpartum pelvic instability or because of Ehlers Danlos syndrome.&#xD;
      These data will be compared to that of the healthy study group. Spatiotemporal parameters,&#xD;
      pelvic obliquity, center of gravity and load capacity will again be measured in the same&#xD;
      patients around 3 months after surgery. The pre- and postoperative outcomes will be analyzed&#xD;
      and compared. The data from the healthy individuals will be used as reference data in these&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To limit potential biases, the investigators gather extra information from all subjects of&#xD;
      the study. Demographic characteristics will be collected, and questionnaires will be&#xD;
      conducted on clinical outcomes using visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, Oswestry Disability&#xD;
      Index (ODI) for back function and EQ-5D-3L for health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to the patients suffering from SI dysfunction some additional data on daily&#xD;
      activity will be collected. All these patients will carry an activity monitor/accelerometer&#xD;
      for the duration of 1 week before and after surgery to determine activity in these patients.&#xD;
      Differences before and after surgery will be analyzed in accordance with the spatiotemporal&#xD;
      parameters. Finally, the subjects will be asked to give information about the rehabilitation&#xD;
      process and physiotherapy (which program, duration, frequency etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. SAFETY REPORTING During motion analyses all subjects are &quot;visitors&quot; at the motion lab, a&#xD;
      liability insurance is in effect during tests. Instructors/researchers are also covered by&#xD;
      this insurance. There is no need for additional insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Demographic baseline characteristics (e.g. age, ASA classification,&#xD;
      gender, affected side) of the study participants will be described as descriptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 STUDY PARAMETERS The main study parameters are spatiotemporal parameters, pelvic&#xD;
      obliquity, center of gravity and load capacity during motion analysis before and after MISJF&#xD;
      surgery for the patients suffering from SI dysfunction. These measurements will be collected&#xD;
      at the motion lab and analyzed into data to compare different parameters between group&#xD;
      differences (healthy versus SI dysfunction e.g.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other outcome parameters are change in questionnaires outcome in pain measured in Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale (VAS) pain score, disability measured using the Oswestry Disability Index&#xD;
      (ODI) and change in quality-adjusted life years (QALY) measured with EQ-5D-3L. Analysis of&#xD;
      these PROMs will be achieved by linear mixed models to determine the overall effect over time&#xD;
      and difference in change of scores at fixed time points and difference in change from&#xD;
      baseline/preoperative. Between group differences of baseline scores will also be determined,&#xD;
      including data on the rehabilitation process and physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity measured by the activity monitors/accelerometers will be a different outcome&#xD;
      parameter. Analysis of the activity data will be achieved to determine overall difference in&#xD;
      change of scores 3 months after MISJF surgery from baseline/preoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS Demographic baseline characteristics data collection will be&#xD;
      carried out using study management software. To protect the privacy of all participants, all&#xD;
      collected data will be encoded. The codes that are related to each individual patient are&#xD;
      saved in an excel file, which is locked with a password. Only the principal investigator of&#xD;
      the specific site will have access to the encoding keys. The outcome parameters from the&#xD;
      motion lab will be saved on the software used at HSZ. Data will be exchanged between HSZ and&#xD;
      Zuyderland Medical Center using secured emails.&#xD;
