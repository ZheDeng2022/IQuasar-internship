  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to assess the psychic profile of parents of children born&#xD;
      prematurely&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prematurity affects aroound 1 in 10 children worlwide. Many studies have shown the role of&#xD;
      prematurity in the development of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder,&#xD;
      mother-to-child attachment disorders, but few studies have sought to assess the evolution of&#xD;
      this profile over time as well as to assess all of the parents' psychic dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators currently have little knowledge of risk factors (psychological or&#xD;
      psychiatric history, follow-up undertaken, treatments implemented, etc.) that may favor the&#xD;
      occurrence of postpartum mental disorders (anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will thus seek to identify them. Prematurity can have a negative impact on&#xD;
      the parents' psychic experience in the postpartum period. However, few studies have examined&#xD;
      the evolution over time of the parental psychic profile and its possible repercussions on the&#xD;
      child in terms of attachment and becoming neurodevelopmental. Finally, the majority of&#xD;
      studies dealing with these subjects concern only mothers.Tthe investigators will endeavor&#xD;
      here to also take into account the fathers.&#xD;

    <description>A score greater than 15 from the PDEQ (Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire) is considered a score in favour of a significant traumatic dissociation. Minimum scale value : 10, full scale value : 50. Abnormal if greater than or equal to 15.</description>

    <description>these factors are studied by assessing whether or not there is a psychological and / or psychiatric history, medical-psychological follow-up, treatments taken.</description>

    <time_frame>At 24 months corrected age</time_frame>
    <description>A ASQ (Ages Stages Questionnaire) score less than 185 is considered not optimal.&#xD;
The other data collected during the evaluation of the 24 months of age corrected as part of the Réseau Grandir Ensemble (RGE) will be used for the evaluation of neurological development. These data make it possible to classify children's development into optimal or non-optimal according to a rating system which has been defined by the network's scientific council.The impact of the parental psychic profile (at 38 WA +/- 2 weeks, at 3 months and at 24 months of their child's corrected age) on neurological development will be evaluated by Odds Ratios (ORs): ORs measuring the association between the parental psychic profile and the non-optimal ASQ score, ORs measuring the association between the parental psychic profile and the non-optimal development category according to the RGE rating.</description>
