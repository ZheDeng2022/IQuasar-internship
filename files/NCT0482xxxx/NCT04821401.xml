    <textblock>
      In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult men ages 45-65 years and&#xD;
      postmenopausal women to age 65 years, the anti-inflammatory property of proprietary CaAKG&#xD;
      based dietary supplements will be assessed by the measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) as&#xD;
      the primary endpoint. Secondary safety endpoints will be assessed by monitoring blood&#xD;
      chemistry results and recorded adverse effects. In addition, the biological age of the&#xD;
      participants will be determined by the level of DNA methylation measured from saliva samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult men ages 45-65 years&#xD;
      and postmenopausal women up to age 65 years to measure the effect that Rejuvant dietary&#xD;
      supplement products have on inflammation by the measurement of C-Reactive Protein (CRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has four groups as outlined in Table 1. Groups 1-4 are divided by gender and each&#xD;
      Group will receive the gender-specific investigational product or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rejuvant and placebo tablets are 0.500&quot; round and 0.290&quot; thick. Groups 1 and 3 will take two&#xD;
      tablets per day of the gender-specific investigational dietary supplement product. Groups 2&#xD;
      and 4 will take 2 placebo tablets per day. All Groups will take the investigational product&#xD;
      for nine months. Participants will be assessed at four timepoints: Study Initiation (Day 1),&#xD;
      Month 3, Month 6, and Month 9. At each visit weight, blood pressure, pulse, safety labs, CRP,&#xD;
      blood chemistries, Hemoglobin A1C, and uric acid levels will be obtained, and the study&#xD;
      questionnaire will be completed by each participant. These data will allow for an assessment&#xD;
      of the antiinflammatory effects and the safety of the investigational dietary supplement&#xD;
      products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, up to 200 plasma metabolites will be measured. These data will be used to&#xD;
      assess changes in participant metabolism over the course of the study. The blood chemistry&#xD;
      and metabolite data may also be used to calculate the biological age of the participant by&#xD;
      one or more published algorithms. DNA methylation analysis of saliva will determine the&#xD;
      degree of DNA methylation (the cytosine of the CpG dinucleotide can be methylated). The&#xD;
      degree of DNA methylation is correlated with aging and can be used as another measure of the&#xD;
      biological age of the participant.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The medical assistant conducting clinical visits will receive two binders with sets of sequentially numbered, Kit Assignment Forms (n = 50) - one binder for men and one binder for women. For each new participant, the assistant will enter the participant identification # on the next Kit Assignment Form which contains the Kit # to be assigned to the new participant. The kits (contain either the dietary supplement or the placebo) were assigned either dietary supplement or placebo per the order of the randomization list generated by www.randomization.com</masking_description>

    <description>Rejuvant tablets are sustained release tablets that release the active ingredients over 8-12 hours. Both product tablets are 0.500&quot; round and 0.290&quot; thick.&#xD;
AKG and AKG salts are grandfathered as GRAS compounds because these compounds were supplements prior to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (&quot;DSHEA&quot;). AKG and AKG salts are currently sold in the United States as supplements.&#xD;
The other components of the tablets are Vitamin A for the men's product and Vitamin D3 for the women's product. Vitamin A and Vitamin D are GRAS compounds per the FDA</description>
