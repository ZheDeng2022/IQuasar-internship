        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject type and disease characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Suffer from NSCLC diagnosed by pathology (histology or cytology).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Have stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC NSCLC diagnosed according to the 8th edition of&#xD;
                  the American Joint Committee on Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. It is confirmed and recorded by the multidisciplinary oncology committee or the&#xD;
                  treating physician and the thoracic surgeon to have stage III NSCLC that cannot&#xD;
                  accept radical surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. In whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET or FDG-PET/CT and diagnostic-quality&#xD;
                  CT or MRI scans of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and brain, there is no evidence of&#xD;
                  metastatic disease as stage IV NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Note: Unless otherwise proven, the presence of pleural/pericardial effusion is&#xD;
                  considered to indicate metastatic disease. For the presence of pleural effusion&#xD;
                  in both the CT chest scan and the chest X-ray in the front view, thoracentesis is&#xD;
                  required to confirm that the pleural effusion is cytologically negative. Exclude&#xD;
                  participants whose effusion is exudate, even if the effusion is cytologically&#xD;
                  negative. Subjects who have met the remaining inclusion/exclusion criteria and&#xD;
                  whose pleural effusion is not visible on chest X-rays in the front and side&#xD;
                  views, or who have too little effusion to be safely extracted can enter the&#xD;
                  study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Suffer from a measurable disease defined by RECIST 1.1, and at least one lesion&#xD;
                  is suitable as a target lesion (determined by the investigator/imaging review of&#xD;
                  the local research center).&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. No previous treatment (chemotherapy, targeted therapy or radiotherapy) for stage&#xD;
                  III NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  excision biopsy]) is provided. The tissue block of FFPE is better than the slice.&#xD;
                  The newly obtained tumor sample is better than archived tissue and should be&#xD;
                  obtained before chest imaging at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Note: If an unstained section is submitted, the new section must be submitted to&#xD;
                  the testing laboratory within 14 days of preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. The ECOG performance status assessed within 7 days before the first dose of the&#xD;
                  study intervention is 0 or 1 point.&#xD;

             laboratory value that may interfere with the results of the research, prevent the&#xD;
             subject from participating in the research throughout, or cause the researcher to&#xD;
