  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis (LE) is one of the most frequently encountered lesions affecting the&#xD;
      upper extremity and is the most common cause of elbow pain in adults. It occurs on the&#xD;
      lateral side of the elbow where the common extensors originate from the lateral epicondyle.&#xD;
      LE can be considered an overuse injury which occurs on the lateral side of the elbow in the&#xD;
      extensor tendons with repetitive micro-trauma. The clinical presentation of LE involves a&#xD;
      painful or burning sensation over the humeral insertion of the common extensor tendons.&#xD;
      Despite the high incidence of LE, optimal treatment has not been established. Treatment&#xD;
      options include therapeutic exercise, bracing, shock wave or ultrasound therapy , but many of&#xD;
      them lack sufficient evidence of beneficial effects. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) alone&#xD;
      or combined with static magnetic field (PBMT-sMF) has been shown to stimulate tendon healing,&#xD;
      this suggests that therapy using laser or light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is efficacious for the&#xD;
      symptoms associated with epicondylitis. According to the favorable results of PBMT-sMF in&#xD;
      tendons repair processes, this type of therapy can be used as a therapeutic tool for&#xD;
      management in epicondylitis, therefore, more investigations are necessary to establish the&#xD;
      ideal parameters. Therefore, the aim of this project is to investigate the effects of&#xD;
      PBMT-sMF, in the appropriate parameters, on degree of pain and quality of life of patients&#xD;
      with lateral epicondylitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To achieve the proposed objective it will be performed a multi-center, randomized,&#xD;
      triple-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, with voluntary patients with lateral epicondylitis.&#xD;
      Fifty patients will be randomly allocated to two treatment groups: 1. Active PBMT-sMF (MR5®&#xD;
      Prototype Device) or Placebo PBMT-sMF (MR5® Prototype Device). The patients will be treated&#xD;
      by a blinded therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients randomly allocated to the different groups will be subjected to treatment two&#xD;
      times a week for three consecutive weeks, each procedure administration three to four days&#xD;
      apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will contain five phases: 1) pre-procedure activities; 2) pre-procedure assessment&#xD;
      phase; 3) procedure administration phase; 4) procedure administration phase measures; 5)&#xD;
      post-procedure administration phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes measured will be: degree of pain, forearm pain and disability, grip strength,&#xD;
      TNF-α levels, subject satisfaction with overall outcome rating, perceived group assignment&#xD;
      and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes will be obtained at the stabilization phase (pre-procedure activities), baseline&#xD;
      (pre-procedure assessment phase), 24 hours after the end of the treatment (procedure&#xD;
      administration phase measures), and 30 days after the end of the treatment (post-procedure&#xD;
      administration phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary statistical method to analyze the primary endpoint will be Fisher's exact&#xD;
           test to compare the proportion of success between the test (Active PBMT-sMF) and the&#xD;
           control (Placebo PBMT-sMF) groups, considering that randomization has been diligently&#xD;
           conducted and important covariates between the two groups are well balanced. Statistical&#xD;
           significance will be set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The secondary outcomes that are continuous variables will be analyzed through parametric&#xD;
           analysis using ANCOVA. Statistical significance will be set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For patient satisfaction, measured through a Likert Scale, the data will be reduced to&#xD;
           the nominal level by combining all agree and disagree responses into two categories of&#xD;
           &quot;accept&quot; and &quot;reject&quot;. Differences in satisfaction with Study Outcome Ratings between&#xD;
           procedure groups at both evaluated time-points, and any change between. The chi-square&#xD;
           will be used after this transformation. Statistical significance will be set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;

    <description>Forearm pain and disability will be measured by Patient-Rated Forearm Evaluation Questionnaire, which is a 15-item questionnaire designed to measure forearm pain and disability in patients with lateral epicondylitis. The questionnaire rates from 0 to 10 for each question, and consists of 2 subscales: PAIN subscale (0 = no pain, 10 = worst imaginable) and FUNCTION subscale (0 = no difficulty, 10 = unable to do). To the individual subscale scores, a total score can be computed on a scale of 100 (0 = no disability and 100 = worse disability), where pain and functional problems are weighted equally.</description>
