  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some kidney transplant candidates have a very low chance of getting a kidney transplant&#xD;
      because their immune systems are &quot;highly sensitized&quot; to most kidney donors. Being &quot;highly&#xD;
      sensitized&quot; means that they will likely have to wait a long time (more than 5 years) before&#xD;
      an acceptable donor is found for them or, they never receive a compatible donor, and die on&#xD;
      waitlist. The purpose of this study is to find out whether two drugs, daratumumab&#xD;
      (Darzalex®), and belatacept (Nulojix®), can make these kidney transplant candidates less&#xD;
      sensitized, and make it easier and quicker to find a kidney donor for them.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll 15 eligible adult participants with end stage renal failure on&#xD;
      dialysis who are on the waiting list for a deceased donor transplant with calculated panel&#xD;
      reactive antibodies (cPRA) ≥99.9% or &gt;98% (with &gt;5 years of waiting time) or, those with cPRA&#xD;
      &gt;98% and an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-incompatible approved living donor who have not&#xD;
      received a transplant after 1 year in a paired kidney exchange program. The study will&#xD;
      evaluate whether the study treatment is safe and can lower the participant's immune system's&#xD;
      sensitization to kidney donors, making it easier to find a well-matched kidney for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatment is comprised of two drugs, Darzalex® (daratumumab) and Nulojix®&#xD;
      (belatacept). Daratumumab is licensed for treatment of multiple myeloma and belatacept is&#xD;
      licensed for prevention of rejection after kidney transplant. Eligible participants will&#xD;
      receive infusions of daratumumab and belatacept over a 10-week period. An interim safety and&#xD;
      efficacy analysis will occur after the first 5 participants have received study treatment.&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo HLA antibody assessments and bone marrow aspiration prior to and&#xD;
      after completion of treatment and receive 42 weeks of follow up after completing treatment.&#xD;
      Participants who prematurely discontinue study therapy will receive follow up through 56&#xD;
      weeks after their baseline visit. Subjects who receive a kidney transplant while in the study&#xD;
      will receive standard of care immunosuppression and undergo additional 52 weeks of follow up.&#xD;
      Living donors will participate for one study visit to provide blood collection.&#xD;
