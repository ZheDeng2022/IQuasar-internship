  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to prospectively investigate the feasibility of establishing&#xD;
      patient-derived tumoroids (PDT) as a platform for a personalized approach for response&#xD;
      prediction and guide optimal neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant approach. PDT will be investigated&#xD;
      to determine drug sensitivity, predict the response to chemotherapy agents and radiation&#xD;
      therapy, and validate this response in treated patients, and to establish the feasibility of&#xD;
      PDT as a platform for a personalized approach to guide multimodality treatment.&#xD;
