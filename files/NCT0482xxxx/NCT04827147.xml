  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy of two types of high-power prism glasses that&#xD;
      provide field of view expansion for patients with homonymous hemianopia (the complete loss of&#xD;
      half the field of vision on the same side in both eyes).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hemianopic field loss may be unaware of objects in their blind (non-seeing)&#xD;
      hemi-field and often experience difficulties with hazards, such as walking into obstacles on&#xD;
      the side of the field loss. Prism glasses that provide field of view expansion may be helpful&#xD;
      in detecting hazards on the blind side. In this clinical trial, two types of high power prism&#xD;
      glasses will be evaluated. A new design of prisms, Multi-Periscopic Prisms (MPP), will be&#xD;
      compared to commercially-available permanent Fresnel peripheral prism (FPP) glasses. The&#xD;
      extent to which the prismatic devices improve detection of hazards on the side of the field&#xD;
      loss and are helpful when walking will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will try each type of prism glasses at home for 4 weeks in counterbalanced order&#xD;
      with a washout period between. Prism glasses will be fitted by Low Vision Practitioners at&#xD;
      vision rehabilitation clinics. Participants will attend in-office study visits before and&#xD;
      after wearing each type of prism glasses. At the in-office visits they will complete a test&#xD;
      that involves detecting pedestrian hazards in a video simulating a walk through a busy&#xD;
      shopping mall (virtual reality, VR, walking simulator test). In addition, they may be asked&#xD;
      to complete questionnaires to record their experiences of using the prism glasses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After wearing the second pair of prism glasses, participants will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire comparing the two types of prism glasses and to select their preferred type. A&#xD;
      clinical decision will be made as to whether the participant should continue to use either&#xD;
      the first or second pair of prism glasses (e.g. if a participant finds one pair of prism&#xD;
      glasses helpful for obstacle avoidance when walking). For participants who continue with the&#xD;
      prism glasses, telephone follow-up interviews will be conducted after about 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
