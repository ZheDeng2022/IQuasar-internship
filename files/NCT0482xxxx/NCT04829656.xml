  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PACE-DLB Study is for people with at least moderate dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and&#xD;
      their primary caregiver. The study's goals are to learn more about the experiences of people&#xD;
      with DLB and their caregivers as DLB progresses, and what happens as the end of life of the&#xD;
      person with DLB approaches. Participants are enrolled through one of five Lewy Body Dementia&#xD;
      Association (LBDA) Research Center of Excellence clinics, or directly via the LBDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with DLB will enroll into the study along with their primary informal caregiver, such&#xD;
      as the family member or friend who is involved in most of their care and attends the majority&#xD;
      of their medical appointments. A legally authorized representative (LAR) for the person with&#xD;
      DLB will consent to participate in the study on the person's behalf. If the person with DLB&#xD;
      resists taking part in the study, the pair will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of questionnaires about the progression of the person's dementia and the&#xD;
      experiences of the caregiver. The person with DLB will complete one questionnaire themselves&#xD;
      if they are able to. If the pair is enrolled at a LBDA Research Center of Excellence clinical&#xD;
      site, and completes study visits in-person, a brief physical exam of the person with DLB will&#xD;
      be completed by a clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation will last for three years, or until the person with DLB dies. Study&#xD;
      visits take place every six months, either virtually or in person at a clinical study site.&#xD;
      If the person with DLB dies during the study, the caregiver will complete one final virtual&#xD;
      study visit three months afterward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims of the PACE-DLB Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine predictors of the end of life (death within 6 months) in the DLB&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypotheses: Predictors of death within 6 months for individuals with DLB will include&#xD;
           symptoms (e.g. worsening hallucinations, fluctuations) not captured in existing dementia&#xD;
           end-of-life prediction tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify whether change in caregiver measures can predict the end of life in the DLB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize that there will be worsening caregiver burden,&#xD;
           depression, grief, and quality of life preceding the last 6 months of life, controlling&#xD;
           for variables such as resilience, support, and living situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify the impact of demographics, health care factors, and specific DLB symptoms&#xD;
           on patient quality of life and caregiver experiences at the end of life of the person&#xD;
           living with DLB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Location (rural, urban, suburban), provider experience (e.g. specialist vs not),&#xD;
      patient residence (e.g. home, skilled nursing), degree of behavioral symptoms, caregiver type&#xD;
      (spouse vs child vs other), and caregiver characteristics (self-efficacy, perceived social&#xD;
      support, resilience, and coping) will affect patient and informal caregiver experiences at&#xD;
      the patient's end of life, including patient and caregiver quality of life and caregiver&#xD;
      well-being, depression, burden, grief, and satisfaction with end-of-life care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is part of Lewy body dementia, the 2nd-most-common&#xD;
      degenerative dementia in the U.S. It is also one of the Alzheimer's disease-related dementias&#xD;
      (ADRDs). Evidence-based models of end-of-life care for ADRDs are insufficient; families face&#xD;
      difficult medical decisions with little information for guidance. This is particularly&#xD;
      relevant for DLB, where &gt;70% of individuals die of the dementia itself or failure to thrive.&#xD;
      Caregivers describe lack of knowledge of what to expect at the end of life as an important&#xD;
      driver of negative end-of-life experiences. The proposed study addresses this unmet need. It&#xD;
      also addresses the National Institute on Aging's priority to improve quality of care and&#xD;
      quality of life for persons with ADRDs at the end of life and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on published clinical series, over half of enrolled individuals with DLB are expected&#xD;
      to die over the course of the study. To achieve diverse recruitment, the study includes an&#xD;
      in-person cohort where dyads are recruited from Lewy Body Dementia Association Research&#xD;
      Centers of Excellence and a novel virtual cohort where dyads are recruited through the Lewy&#xD;
      Body Dementia Association and study visits are conducted by telephone. Having a virtual&#xD;
      cohort will capture the experiences of individuals with DLB and caregivers not receiving care&#xD;
      at specialty centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the majority of study measures are caregiver-reported, the in-person and virtual&#xD;
      groups have identical study measures, except for the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale,&#xD;
      completed only in person. Collected measures will include demographics, DLB characteristics&#xD;
      (e.g. cognitive, motor, behavioral, sleep, and autonomic symptoms), health care providers and&#xD;
      settings, caregiver considerations (e.g. resilience, support, grief, burden), quality of life&#xD;
      (for the patient and caregiver), and satisfaction with end of life experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The caregiver will complete a final study visit 3 months after the death of the person with&#xD;
      DLB to assess grief, recovery, and quality of the end of life experience. By following dyads&#xD;
      through the end of life and death of the person with DLB and the initial bereavement period&#xD;
      for the caregiver, the study will identify DLB-specific predictors of the last 6 months of&#xD;
      life, changes in caregiver measures that identify the last 6 months of life, and factors&#xD;
      which influence quality end of life experiences. These results will inform the content and&#xD;
      timing of end-of-life counseling in DLB, help establish quality metrics for end of life care,&#xD;
      and identify areas where interventions could potentially improve end of life experiences for&#xD;
      individuals with DLB and their caregivers.&#xD;

These will be assessed across the disease course and specifically at the end of life (at the last clinical visit prior to death).</description>
