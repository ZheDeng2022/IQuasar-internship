      An emerging public health challenge is to protect the growing ageing population from&#xD;
      infectious diseases, which can significantly impact the quality of life of those affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vulnerability of this age group is related to impaired host defenses such as diminished&#xD;
      cell-mediated immunity. Lifestyle considerations, e.g., travel and living arrangements, and&#xD;
      residence in nursing homes, can further complicate the clinical picture.&#xD;

      further complicate the clinical picture. The magnitude and diversity of health&#xD;
      care-associated infections in the aging population are generating new arenas for prevention&#xD;
      and control efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common infections leading to hospitalizations in this age group result in respiratory&#xD;
      infections and bacteraemia and the impact of these infections on the quality of life in aged&#xD;
      populations has not been accurately quantified in a European setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to capture and quantify the impact of infectious diseases on quality of life&#xD;
      in an aged population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IMI European public-private partnership created the VITAL project (Vaccines and&#xD;
      infectious diseases in the Ageing populations) to assess the infectious diseases burden and&#xD;
      mechanisms of immunosenescence in the ageing populations. This aims to provide evidence-based&#xD;
      knowledge on vaccination strategies to establish healthy ageing. The project articulates&#xD;
      around five work packages and this study comes within the frame of the first one. The&#xD;
      expected results of this work combine with and complete the retrospective assessment already&#xD;
      done on the available datasets/databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decreased efficiency of the cell-mediated immunity and more generally the&#xD;
      immunosenescence make the ageing population prone to harming infectious diseases. That&#xD;
      combined with the growth of the ageing populations make healthy ageing a major and current&#xD;
      challenge to address. The common infections leading to hospitalizations in this age groups&#xD;
      include respiratory infections and bacteremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are a leading cause of hospitalizations and death in the&#xD;
      aged adult population. They can be caused by viruses (Influenza for instance), bacteria&#xD;
      (Streptococcus pneumoniae for instance) and fungi, with either a single or a co-infection.&#xD;
      Viruses and bacteria have a comparable share in causing ARI, and a significant part of them&#xD;
      are vaccine preventable pathogens. Although the burden of ARI is highest in the ageing&#xD;
      population, vaccine effectiveness is the lowest in this vulnerable population, mostly because&#xD;
      of immunosenescence. This issue can be tackled by increasing vaccine coverage and efficiency&#xD;
      and developing vaccines and treatments for the pathogens leaving physicians with limited&#xD;
      prevention and therapeutic options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacteremia is defined by the presence of viable bacteria in the circulating blood generally&#xD;
      causing fever, chills, tachycardia, tachypnea, and sometimes requiring hospitalization. It&#xD;
      increases morbidity and has a high mortality rate in all ageing populations. It is mostly&#xD;
      caused by Gram negative (E. Coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella) but also by Gram positive&#xD;
      bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus). Along with its high burden in this population, bacteremia&#xD;
      is difficult to tackle because of an odd and nonspecific clinical presentation. In addition,&#xD;
      bacteremia is associated with comorbidities, underlying diseases and long-term care centres&#xD;
      stays. The increasing proportion of antimicrobial resistance such as methicillin-resistant&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) or extended&#xD;
      spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) make complete eradication harder in a given patient and may&#xD;
      alter his quality of life in a durable way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a high ARI and bacteremia burden in the aged population in terms of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. This burden is also believed to be expressed in terms of lower quality of life,&#xD;
      and increased frailty and disability and has begun to be assessed in either of the two&#xD;
      pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of ARI and/or bacteremia on those components needs to be assessed in the most&#xD;
      comprehensive way as the investigator are facing a specific population: a significant part of&#xD;
      the ageing population is already relatively frail. Frailty has been demonstrated as a&#xD;
      predictor of bad recovery after an ARI hospitalization in older adults, of being an adverse&#xD;
      outcome of acute illness and of being associated with diminished vaccine effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of ARI and bacteremia hospitalization on quality of life, frailty and disability&#xD;
      in that ageing population has not been assessed in a wide European setting to our knowledge.&#xD;
      Filling this data gap will strengthen the evidence-based and guide public health policies&#xD;
      concerning vaccination strategies to promote healthy ageing.&#xD;
