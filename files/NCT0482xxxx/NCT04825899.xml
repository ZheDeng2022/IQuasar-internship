      to detect the translocation of c-Myc, Bcl-2 and Bcl-6 by FISH and 481 gene mutation by next&#xD;

      This is one arm, single center non-intervention study. New diagnosed diffuse large B cell&#xD;
      lymphoma patients were enrolled to detect the translocation of c-Myc, Bcl-2 and Bcl-6 by FISH&#xD;
      and 481 gene mutation by next generation sequencing, then patients received standard&#xD;
      treatment with R-CHOP, R2CHOP and DA-EPOCH by investigate's choice according to the patients&#xD;
      pathological characteristics. the basic characteristics and treatment response and&#xD;
      progression-free survival and overall survival were collected and analyzed with the gene&#xD;
      abnormalities. a total of 100 diffuse large B cell lymphoma patients will enrolled in one&#xD;
      year and will finish after 3 years.&#xD;
