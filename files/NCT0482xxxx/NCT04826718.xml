  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study finds opportunities and justifications, taking into consideration that the&#xD;
      nature of professional practice in health needs scientific evidence resulting from systematic&#xD;
      and systemic studies to strengthen the basis for the decisions made to have an impact on&#xD;
      various levels, from the patient to health management itself. In addition, Cabo Verdean&#xD;
      authorities may benefit from new evidence obtained by this study. It intends, in a growing&#xD;
      number of health professionals exposed or infected with SARS-CoV-2, in the different health&#xD;
      structures of the country, to contribute to substantiate a better perception of the problem&#xD;
      and the required solutions. Therefore, assessing the potential risk factors for SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection among healthcare workers will be essential to characterize virus transmission,&#xD;
      preventing future infections in them and providing the associated healthcare. Due to the&#xD;
      advances and important changes described, questions arise that guide this research and allow&#xD;
      us to identify the problem.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The problem is stated in the following starting questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What conditions and factors are associated with infection and non-infection by SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      among health professionals working in the three hospitals on the islands of Santiago and São&#xD;
      Vicente? Which are they (gender, age group, profession, type of contact, etc.)? Where do the&#xD;
      infected HCW typically work (sector)? When and how did the infection occur? What is the&#xD;
      prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in professionals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and in&#xD;
      HCW that thought they were not infected by SARS-CoV-2? How long do anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies&#xD;
      last? What is the impact of infection on unplanned absenteeism? Which symptoms and complaints&#xD;
      (if any) persists after SARS-CoV-2 infection?&#xD;

        The population of the study is composed of health professionals working in the Hospitals of&#xD;
        the islands of Santiago and S. Vicente.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition to measuring infection-related exposures, specific SARS-CoV-2 infection-related&#xD;
        parameters will also be assessed, including presence and duration of anti-SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
        antibodies; absenteeism due to infection; and self-reported symptomatology due to&#xD;
        SARS-CoV-2/ COVID-19 infection. All participants be followed up to measure unplanned,&#xD;
        infection-related absenteeism, illness-related symptomatology at 3 of for a period of 6&#xD;
        months. At 6 months after enrollement, all participants will also be assessed, including&#xD;
        screening of presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (anti-N and anti-S).&#xD;
