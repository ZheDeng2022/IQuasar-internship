  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective study using fecal DNA methylation test to define the&#xD;
      risk of suffering from advanced adenoma or colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to colonoscopy&#xD;
      and fecal immunochemical test (FIT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study recruits at least 80 participants, including 40 people of healthy controls, 20&#xD;
      people with adenoma, and 20 people with CRC, which were confirmed by colonoscopy. All fecal&#xD;
      specimens from participants will be examined by FIT and multi-methylated target gene&#xD;
      detection through real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      multi-methylated target PCR compared with the FIT and confirm the examination results through&#xD;
      colonoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence rate and the mortality rate of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been steadily&#xD;
      increasing worldwide. Early detection of CRC can provide great opportunities to help&#xD;
      patients, increasing their 5-year survival rate. Colonoscopy has been considered as the&#xD;
      golden standard of CRC screening method, but the invasive procedures cannot be widely adapted&#xD;
      by recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, the most common CRC screening method is fecal immunochemical test (FIT) which is a&#xD;
      cost-effective and non-invasive approach. The sensitivity of FIT for CRC detection is about&#xD;
      80%, but only 20% for adenoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methylation level of candidate genes are determined by qMSP to estimate the risk of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. This study implements fecal DNA methylation test and fecal immunochemical&#xD;
      test simultaneously to evaluate whether the fecal DNA methylation test can improve the&#xD;
      detection rate of adenoma and CRC.&#xD;

    <description>In this study, we estimate the sensitivity and specificity of methylation biomarker isolated from participant's stool DNA and perform FIT simultaneously.&#xD;
The Ct values of candidate genes and GAPDH (reference gene) are determined by real-time PCR. The delta Ct values are calculated by Ct value of candidate gene - Ct value of GAPDH. Furthermore, the cut-off value of each candidate gene was determined based on the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.&#xD;
If the value of Fecal immunochemical test is more than 100 ng Hb/ml, the stool is considered as positive with fecal occult blood.</description>

    <description>Stool specimens are collected from participants in the outpatient department or the inpatient department. Both FIT and stool DNA real-time PCR are performed simultaneously. To improve the sensitivity and specificity of the colorectal cancer screening, this study enrolls multiple candidate genes to distinguish whether the participant has a high risk of colorectal cancer.</description>
