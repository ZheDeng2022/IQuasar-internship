  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This RWS study is to evaluate the feasibility, preliminary safety and performance of Rezūm&#xD;
      system in BPH treatment in China, to generate local real world data from a Chinese BPH&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rezūm System is intended to relieve symptoms, obstructions, and reduce prostate tissue&#xD;
      associated with BPH. It is indicated for men ≥50 years of age with a prostate volume ≥ 30cm3&#xD;
      and ≤80cm3. The Rezūm System is also indicated for treatment of prostate with hyperplasia of&#xD;
      the central zone and/or a median lobe.&#xD;

    <description>Composite device related serious complications for this endpoint are defined as:&#xD;
Device perforation of the rectum or GI tract;&#xD;
Device related formation of fistula between the rectum and urethra;&#xD;
De novo severe urinary retention lasting more than 21 consecutive days post treatment.</description>

    <description>The basic principle of the Rezūm System is to deliver a controlled amount of sterile water vapor directly into the hyperplastic tissue in the transition zone of the prostate using a transurethral approach .The stored thermal energy in the vapor is transferred directly onto the cell membranes as the vapor condenses and releases the heat of condensation, causing cell death. Inaddition, this thermal energy transfer collapses the vasculature within the treatment zone, resulting in a bloodless procedure. During procedure the water vapor is created by a heating element in the Rezūm Delivery Device,Saline flush during vapor delivery protects and preserves the urethra.</description>
