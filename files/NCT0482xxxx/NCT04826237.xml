  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A small clinical trial for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL). Will the&#xD;
      addition of an oral statin to the standard treatment (oral methylprednesolone and the salvage&#xD;
      therapy of intratympanic dexamethasone) improve the treatment outcome for patients with&#xD;
      ISSNHL? This study will compare the two treatments and quantitatively evaluate hearing and&#xD;
      speech discrimination and have the patients subjectively evaluate tinnitus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      idopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss who do not meet the exclusion criteria and do&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria, and who give written informed consent will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      trial. A standard treatment for ISSNHL (oral methyprednisolone) will be given to half of the&#xD;
      patients and the other half of the patients will receive the standard treatment plus either a&#xD;
      placebo or a 7-day course of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (a statin). Patients will return&#xD;
      for follow up, the timing and further treatment of which will be determined by the response&#xD;
      to the drugs. At each appointment, the patients will see the medical professional, have a&#xD;
      hearing test, a speech in noise test, and self evaluate for tinnitus. If there is no&#xD;
      improvement after 2 weeks, patient will be offered up to two intratympanic doses of&#xD;
      dexamethasone, 10 days apart. This is a randomized, double-blind prospective study.&#xD;
      Randomization of males will be separate from that of females.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Neither the participant, the medical professionals, nor those that initially calculate the testing data will know which patient has the placebo or which has the statin. Each patient will be identified by number and sex. Only the clinical coordinator who records the names and treatments and the principal investigator (who does not see patients) will have access to the key. The drugs will be randomized in two groups (for female and male). No one doing data analysis will have any identifiable information other than sex and when the code is broken, the data will be tagged with the identification number of hte patient</masking_description>

    <measure>Change in Pure Tone Audiometry for Hearing Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>At the initiation and the end of the study (up to 4 months after initial assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>Pure tone audiometry to calculate Pure tone averages (PTA) at 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHZ and 4 kHz. will be measured before and at the end of the study. PTA within 15 dB of the pretreatment PTA of the contralateral cochlea will be considered complete improvement.&#xD;
At the end of the study, PTA improvement will be compared between experimental and placebo groups, with a difference of 15 dB or more considered a change in response.&#xD;
PTA at the end of the study will also be compared between a) males and female groups; b)compared between those presenting for treatment within 1 week of loss of hearing and those presenting between 1 week and 2 weeks; c) PTA will also be determined and compared between different age groups.&#xD;
PTA at the end of the study together with word recognition scores at the end of the study will be used to determine the class of hearing improvement using the Gardner-Robertson Scale.</description>

At the end of the study, Word recognition score (% correct). will be used with the PTA at the end of the study to to calculate the Gardner-Robertson classification of hearing improvement.</description>
