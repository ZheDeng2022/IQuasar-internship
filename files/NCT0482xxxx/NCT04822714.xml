      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a user and expert centric mobile phone-based&#xD;
      career intervention program of career competencies among Malaysian public managers. In this&#xD;
      study, the Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) is adopted as the framework to develop&#xD;
      mobile phone-based intervention for career competencies. There is two phases in the study&#xD;
      whereby in Phase 1, a qualitative approach developing the components in the career&#xD;
      intervention module and mobile phone application features. Phase 2 that evaluates the mobile&#xD;
      phone-based career intervention program. Validation will be conducted to meet the objectives&#xD;
      of (i) the usability of the mobile communication career intervention application (survey),&#xD;
      and (ii) evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention program for career competencies&#xD;
      delivered through mobile phone application (randomized controlled trial). The primary outcome&#xD;
      of this study is career competencies. The career competencies score will be compared between&#xD;
      participants in the intervention and control group at the baseline, and follow-ups at week&#xD;
      four and week 12 respectively, using mixed design ANOVA.&#xD;
