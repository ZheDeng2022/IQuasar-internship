      This project was a Randomized clinical trial conducted COMPARATIVE STUDY OF POST ISOMETRIC&#xD;
      RELAXATION AND MULLIGAN BENT LEG RAISE ON HAMSTRING TIGHTNESS IN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Non Probability Convenient sampling was done. Patients following eligibility criteria from&#xD;
      high schools located in vicinity of Jhang district were considered. Sample size was&#xD;
      calculated with Epitool calculator. 28 Participants were randomly allocated in two groups&#xD;
      equally via convenient sampling method. Baseline assessment was done initially. Group A was&#xD;
      given post isometric relaxation and Group B was given mulligan bent leg raise Duration of&#xD;
      research was almost 6 months. All 28 involved subjects were given 12 treatment sessions over&#xD;
      a six-week period, which consisted of 02 treatment sessions per week . Then tightness of&#xD;
      hamstrings was assessed by AKET, SLR and FTF test. The baseline outcome measures consisted of&#xD;
      pain assessment using Numeric rating scale (NPRS), knee joint goniometry in active knee&#xD;
      extension test (AKET) and straight leg raise (SLR), modified finger to floor test (FTF) to&#xD;
      assess the flexibility of hamstring muscles. . All participants were provided written&#xD;
      informed consent prior to commencement of the procedures. Data was analyzed by using SPSS&#xD;
      version 23.&#xD;

    <description>The 90/90 test, also known as the Active Knee Extension (AKE) Hamstring Flexibility Test, measures hamstring flexibility, particularly when the hip is flexed. purpose: to assess the range of active knee extension in a position of hip flexion, as required in running and kicking.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>straight leg raise (SLR) test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>If symptoms are primarily back pain, it is most likely the result of a disc herniation applying pressure on the anterior theca of the spinal cord, or the pathology causing the pressure is more central. &quot;Back pain only&quot; patients who have a disc prolapse have smaller, more central prolapses.[1] If pain is primarily in the leg, it is more likely that the pathology causing the pressure on neurological tissue(s) is more lateral.[1] Disc herniations or pathology causing pressure between the two extremes are more likely to cause pain in both areas.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Asymptomatic Individuals of both gender, aged 13 to 18 years were evaluated for unilateral&#xD;
        or bilateral Hamstring tightness. Those who were unable to reach more than 160 degree of&#xD;
        knee extension with hip held at 90 degree of flexion, as measured with the thigh held at 90&#xD;
        degrees of hip flexion), unable to complete SLR and meet the criteria of finger to floor&#xD;
        test&#xD;
&#xD;
        were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals were excluded who presented with previous injury of lower limb or pain duration&#xD;
        of one year. Also any deformities related to spine, hip and knees or any neurological&#xD;
        disorder or with history of lower limb fracture or surgery were also excluded.Subjects with&#xD;
        hamstring tightness associated with muscle soreness or with Inflammatory condition that&#xD;
        could affect motion were also exluded from the study&#xD;
