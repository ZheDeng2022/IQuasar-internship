      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, chronic mental illness. It can take weeks to&#xD;
      months for antidepressants to work. Researchers want to test a new drug that might act more&#xD;
      rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if TS-161 will improve symptoms of depression in people with MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18-65 with MDD without psychotic features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under a separate protocol. They will have blood tests. They&#xD;
      will complete surveys about their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an inpatient visit at NIH. Participation may last 12-16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first phase of the study, participants will be tapered off their psychiatric&#xD;
      medicines. For 2 weeks they will have a drug-free period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase II participants will take TS-161 or placebo. They will take TS-161 for 3 weeks&#xD;
      and placebo for 3 weeks. In between the 3-week time period, they will have 2-3 weeks where&#xD;
      they will be drug free. Participants will also have the following tests during this time:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological tests and surveys about their symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draws and urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They may complete tests of mood and thinking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging): Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures&#xD;
           of their brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional MRIs: They will perform tasks displayed on a computer screen inside the MRI&#xD;
           scanner&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MEG (magnetoencephalography): Participants will lie down and do tasks of memory,&#xD;
           attention, and thinking. A cone lowered on their head will record brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiograms to record the heart s electrical activity. Electrodes will be placed&#xD;
           on the skin....&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modulation of glutamatergic signaling is implicated in improvement of depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      related constructs/dimensions of observable behavior and neurobiological measures with&#xD;
      treatment. Current standard monoaminergic pharmacological approaches for major depressive&#xD;
      disorder (MDD) have proven to be only modestly effective during acute major depressive&#xD;
      episodes (MDEs). We have systematically tested different glutamatergic modulators in subjects&#xD;
      with mood disorders in order to develop improved therapeutics. We found that the&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, ketamine, produces rapid antidepressant&#xD;
      effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD in MDD, Bipolar Disorder) and in&#xD;
      suicidal ideation. However, despite being highly efficacious, ketamine produces&#xD;
      psychotomimetic effects and has the risk of abuse. The antidepressant effects of mGlu2/3&#xD;
      receptor antagonists are worthy of pursuit, since the antidepressant profile in preclinical&#xD;
      assays as well as the synaptic/neural cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in their&#xD;
      actions are comparable to those of ketamine, but without the side effects and abuse potential&#xD;
      of ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present protocol, we aim to evaluate a new glutamate-mediated mechanism associated&#xD;
      with antidepressant efficacy by targeting the mGlu2/3 receptor with a potent and selective&#xD;
      antagonist. Targeting the mGlu2/3 receptor with an antagonist is anticipated to, and similar&#xD;
      to ketamine, result via pre-synaptic mechanisms in a &quot;glutamate surge&quot; with subsequent&#xD;
      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) activation and gamma power&#xD;
      increases but without potential adverse effects that occur with ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present Phase 2 proof-of-concept (POC) study is designed to evaluate in subjects with&#xD;
      MDD, the antidepressant effects of TS-161, the prodrug of a potent and selective mGlu2/3&#xD;
      receptor antagonist TP0178894 that crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB). In animal model&#xD;
      assays of antidepressant efficacy, TS-161 induced acute and prolonged antidepressant-like&#xD;
      effects without exhibiting ketamine-like side effects as determined by the lack of increase&#xD;
      in locomotor activity or abuse potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also evaluate the putative neurobiological mechanisms involved in the antidepressant&#xD;
      response to TS-161. We expect that this effect may modulate glutamate transmission and&#xD;
      reverse the clinical symptoms of depression. The demonstration that an mGlu2/3 receptor&#xD;
      antagonist produces antidepressant effects without psychotomimetic side effects would support&#xD;
      the therapeutic relevance of the mGlu2/3 receptor and could direct the development of novel&#xD;
      drug targets for the treatment of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-five individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) will be&#xD;
      consented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female subjects, ages 18 to 65 years, with a diagnosis of MDD, currently in an&#xD;
      episode of major depression, will be recruited for this study. This study will consist of a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind crossover administration of either the mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist&#xD;
      prodrug TS-161 (50 to 100 mg/day given orally) or placebo for 3 weeks. The study will assess&#xD;
      the efficacy in improving overall depressive symptomatology and tolerability of TS-161 in&#xD;
      treatment-resistant MDD. Other aims of the study include determining whether changes in gamma&#xD;
      power obtained via magnetoencephalography (MEG), brain neurochemicals (e.g. glutamate)&#xD;
      obtained via magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and peripheral measures correlate with&#xD;
      drug effects and/or antidepressant response to TS-161 in subjects with treatment-resistant&#xD;
      MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: Proportion of subjects achieving remission (MADRS&lt;=10) and response (&gt;=50%&#xD;
      reduction from baseline in MADRS total score); change from baseline on the Hamilton Rating&#xD;
      Scale (HDRS), change from baseline in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and the Columbia&#xD;
      Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) total scores. Surrogate biomarkers of drug&#xD;
      effect/response include: changes in gamma power measured with MEG, changes in prefrontal&#xD;
      glutamate levels measured with 7T 1H-MRS, resting and task based functional connectivity with&#xD;
      fMRI, neurocognitive functioning, and changes in peripheral biological indices (neurotrophic&#xD;
      factors, cell cycle/signal transduction regulators, neuroinflammatory, neuroendocrinological&#xD;
      measures, and metabolomic and proteomic measures).&#xD;
