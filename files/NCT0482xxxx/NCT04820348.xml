  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an effort to personalize medical care, novel approaches have been used to categorize&#xD;
      sub-populations of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). These are based on biological and&#xD;
      genetic variables, allowing identification of clusters with significantly different clinical&#xD;
      characteristics and risks of complications that may be more amenable to targeted and precise&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions. Increasingly, wearable and other digital health technologies have&#xD;
      the potential to capture additional and objective information to support personalized&#xD;
      medicine but at present underserved populations have largely been excluded from clinical&#xD;
      trials incorporating digital health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study, the Investigators aim to build on prior work using specially trained&#xD;
      community health workers (&quot;Community Scientists&quot;) to support engagement with an underserved&#xD;
      population and to encourage adherence to using wearables and other digital health&#xD;
      technologies. In the US, this is especially imperative for the Hispanic/Latino population,&#xD;
      which is at high risk for T2D and associated complications.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As treatment choices for type 2 diabetes (T2D) evolve from a one-size-fits-all approach into&#xD;
      a patient-centered precision medicine model, there is a need for a deeper understanding of&#xD;
      the clinically meaningful differences between individuals to inform therapy choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently there have been new approaches to creating sub-groups of populations with T2D based&#xD;
      on biological, psychosocial, and genetic variables which have identified clusters of patients&#xD;
      with significantly different clinical characteristics and risk of associated complications.&#xD;
      By incorporating personal, wearable digital health technologies, it will become possible to&#xD;
      further refine such stratification through the inclusion of additional variables and advances&#xD;
      in big data analytics and machine learning. The vision is that identifying sub-groups at high&#xD;
      risk of complications early in the course of T2D will help clinicians to offer more effective&#xD;
      personalized therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the US, the prevalence of both diagnosed and undiagnosed T2D is nearly twice as high among&#xD;
      Mexican-origin Hispanic/Latino adults compared to non-Hispanic whites. Rates of&#xD;
      diabetes-related complications are also higher among Hispanic/Latino adults. T2D is also&#xD;
      associated with a high burden of depression. There are independent barriers to the treatment&#xD;
      of depression in the Hispanic/Latino population, and a population with comorbid depression&#xD;
      and T2D could represent a distinct endophenotype requiring modified treatment plans that&#xD;
      address common pathophysiological pathways linking both diseases. Of particular interest is&#xD;
      the common presence of anxiety symptoms that can worsen depression prognosis and muddle the&#xD;
      diagnostic picture. For this purpose, and to elucidate better endophenotypes in our study,&#xD;
      attention will be paid to anxious distress, a specifier of major depressive disorder that&#xD;
      could potentially be very pertinent to this population, and bring about somatic complaints,&#xD;
      insomnia, and irritability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although wearable technologies for self-monitoring such as continuous glucose monitors (CGM)&#xD;
      are used in diabetes care, the overwhelming experience has been in type 1 diabetes and&#xD;
      insulin-treated type 2 diabetes. There is much less use in individuals with non-insulin&#xD;
      treated T2D or those at risk of diabetes. Across all forms of diabetes, minority use of CGM&#xD;
      has been consistently and markedly less than in the general population with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet plays a crucial role in the management of T2D. To design personalized dietary&#xD;
      recommendations, it is vital to understand an individual's food behaviors. Mobile health&#xD;
      platforms present the opportunity to collect detailed information regarding daily food&#xD;
      choices. In this study, data collected through daily food logging and ecological momentary&#xD;
      assessment (EMA) on hunger, satisfaction, and satiety will be used to quantify and understand&#xD;
      the individual's dietary behaviors and glycemic outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To summarize the rationale behind this study, developments in precision medicine have allowed&#xD;
      for the categorization of individuals with T2D into sub-groups that may be amenable to&#xD;
      different therapeutic strategies. However, there is also a need to better understand the&#xD;
      impact of behavioral and psychological factors on the risk of progression of T2D and&#xD;
      responses to existing and new therapies, especially in the context of development of&#xD;
      depressive symptomatology. These may be especially relevant for US minorities, such as&#xD;
      Hispanic/Latino adults who have an excess burden of T2D and the associated complications&#xD;
      compared to non-Hispanic whites. Digital health has the potential to be of enormous value&#xD;
      provided it is acceptable and will be used by underserved communities.&#xD;
