    <textblock>
      Pilot study to test feasibility of 6 months of bazedoxifene (BZA) plus conjugated estrogens&#xD;
      (CE) to modulate breast MRI parameters.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Duavee® which is the combination of the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)&#xD;
      bazedoxifene plus conjugated estrogens is an FDA approved drug for treatment of hot-flashes&#xD;
      and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In a single arm pilot study 6 months&#xD;
      of Duavee® was associated with improvement in several risk biomarkers including benign breast&#xD;
      tissue proliferation, mammographic fibroglandular volume, and progesterone in women in late&#xD;
      menopause transition and at high risk for development of breast cancer. Prior to opening a&#xD;
      planned randomized Phase IIB trial of 6 months of Duavee® vs placebo in high risk women with&#xD;
      hot-flashes followed by open label Duavee®, a pilot trial was initiated of 6 months of&#xD;
      Duavee® vs wait-list control in symptomatic women (Study00145121; NCT04379024). This trial&#xD;
      was also intended to provide additional imaging biomarker information from MRI which was not&#xD;
      performed in the previous prior study. A finding on MRI of greater background parenchymal&#xD;
      enhancement (BPE) in high risk women is positively associated with higher probability of&#xD;
      developing breast cancer and is independent of fibroglandular volume. BPE is reduced by&#xD;
      selective estrogen receptor modulators including tamoxifen. Change in MRI BPE over time was&#xD;
      also investigated for women randomly assigned to either receive Duavee® or not (wait-list&#xD;
      control), as well as exploration of fully automated breast MRI volumetric density measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, midway through the trial, Duavee® became no longer available due to an issue&#xD;
      with packaging and dissolution of the active agents. As an alternative, this current protocol&#xD;
      will utilize separate agents of bazedoxifene (as Vivant® available from Japan) plus&#xD;
      conjugated estrogens (available in the US as Premarin®). The specific objectives are&#xD;
      identical to those in Study00145121, with the exception that Duavee® has been replaced by&#xD;
      BZA+CE. The intent is to combine the results of both trials for analysis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who report vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes or night sweats or both).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No menstrual periods for at least 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 45-65. Women age 45-49 with prior hysterectomy or endometrial ablation with rare&#xD;
             or no periods due to ablation must have a Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) of 25&#xD;
             mIU/ml or higher to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI &lt;36 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Risk Factors/Level. Moderate risk of developing breast cancer based on either by&#xD;
             having any one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  First or 2nd degree relative with breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known carrier of moderate to high penetrance germline mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior breast biopsy showing proliferative breast disease or multiple prior&#xD;
                  biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  High mammographic density (Volpara® categories c or d or BIRADS density&#xD;
                  assessment as heterogeneously or extremely dense (c or d).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  IBIS Breast Cancer Risk Evaluation Version 8&#xD;
                  (http://www.emstrials.org/riskevaluator/). 10-year relative risk of &gt;2X that for&#xD;
                  the population for age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior mammogram must have at least a Volpara® fibroglandular volume of 80 cm3 or&#xD;
             BIRADs b, c, or d category density and/or investigator estimated visual dense area of&#xD;

             captured as a mosaic are not eligible). If no prior mammogram, but breast density is&#xD;
             readily appreciated and documented on physical exam, a study-provided 3D mammogram&#xD;
             with Volpara® software must be performed to document above eligibility criterion. It&#xD;
             will then constitute the baseline mammogram.&#xD;

                  taking BZA+CE for the next 6 months). History, physical exam and breast exam&#xD;
                  performed by a study-associated clinician within 3 months prior to enrollment may&#xD;
                  be substituted for baseline evaluations.&#xD;

                  subsequently taking BZA+CE for the next 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Complete Mayo Clinic hot flash assessment at baseline and 6-month visits (and&#xD;
                  month 12 for women originally randomized to wait list control and subsequently&#xD;
                  taking BZA+CE for the next 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women 45-55 with a functional uterus (e.g., no prior endometrial ablation),&#xD;
                  menstrual period in the past 12 months, and heterosexually active, must be&#xD;
                  agreeable to use some non-hormonal form of contraception while taking BZA+CE&#xD;

             this study as well as for HSC4601. However, any eligibility criteria dealing with&#xD;
             hormone replacement therapy and SERMs are excluded to allow the 6-month aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
