  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the hypothesis that alpha-gal is responsible for the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms that occur in some alpha-gal syndrome subjects following the&#xD;
      consumption of mammalian meat. This will be tested by comparing symptoms and immune responses&#xD;
      in subjects with alpha-gal syndrome following consumption of &quot;wild-type&quot; pork (which contains&#xD;
      alpha-gal) versus consumption of a novel pork product which has been genetically modified to&#xD;
      lack alpha-gal (GalSafe pork from Revivicor Inc.).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Score is calculated from survey of gastrointestinal symptoms between 1 and 5 hours after challenge. .</time_frame>
    <description>GI symptoms will be assessed using modified FAST diary. Score is determined from a survey of five gastrointestinal symptoms obtained at 0,1,3,5 hours following oral pork challenge. Symptoms are measured via numerical rating scale (1-5) and aggregate score will be calculated.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patient report of episodic GI symptoms within past 6 months that correlated with&#xD;
             ingestion of mammalian meat and/or dairy and which improved on a mammalian avoidance&#xD;

          -  Regularly consume/tolerate mammalian meat without obvious associated gastrointestinal&#xD;
             or skin symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have eaten mammalian meat within the past 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits and study procedures.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Alpha-gal cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of anaphylaxis that was or could have been attributed to mammalian meat in the&#xD;
             estimation of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IgE to pork which exceeds the value of IgE to α-Gal on screening test&#xD;

          -  Pregnancy, breastfeeding or lack of birth control in women of child-bearing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the discretion of the principal investigator, patients may be excluded due to&#xD;
             poorly controlled chronic gastrointestinal conditions including but not limited&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease (i.e., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, microscopic&#xD;
             colitis), acid reflux/heartburn, history of bariatric surgery or gastric banding,&#xD;

             the patient from meeting or performing study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control subjects:&#xD;
