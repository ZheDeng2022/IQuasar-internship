    <textblock>
      Forty female patients with age ranging from 30-40 years old were suffering from low back pain&#xD;
      due to visceral dysfunctions participated in this study. They were recruited from a private&#xD;
      clinic. They were assigned into two groups equal in number; Group (A): included twenty&#xD;
      patients who received osteopathic manipulative techniques, 1 session per week for 3 weeks,&#xD;
      and Group (B): included twenty patients who received only analgesic drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty patients received osteopathic manipulative techniques including Suboccipital release&#xD;
      technique, diaphragmatic release.,mesentery release and Colonic manipulation were applied to&#xD;
      the study group according to the patients' needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment program comprised a total of 3 sessions for 3 weeks at one session per week for&#xD;
      an average of 50 minutes per session. Twenty patients in the second group (control ) took&#xD;

    <time_frame>change from baseline to after 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>the participant stood erect while the lumbosacral junction was marked as indicated by the dimples of Venus. For measuring the MST, we put a mark 5 cm below and 10 cm above the junction. The participant was asked to bend forward as far as possible and the stretched distance of these two points was measured as the MST value.</description>
