  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Torque Teno Virus (TTV) prevalence in the general population is very high (&gt;90%) and has not&#xD;
      been consistently confirmed to cause any disease. Kidney transplant studies seem to indicate&#xD;
      that an elevated viremia could predict the risk of de-veloping an infectious process in the&#xD;
      following weeks. An study of the influence of TTV as a predictive marker of infection in&#xD;
      kidney transplant recipi-ents showed higher TTV levels, even 3 months before the infectious&#xD;
      process, allowing the authors to postulate that the quantification of TTV could help to&#xD;
      modulate the treatment of patients at risk. Publications of subsequent studies seem to&#xD;
      confirm these data.In the field of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) few studies&#xD;
      have analyzed the replication kinetics of TTV. There seems to be a drop in TTV plasma load&#xD;
      after conditioning treatment, with a progressive increase in the first months&#xD;
      post-transplant, in parallel with the number of lymphocytes. In early stages of HSCT, a&#xD;
      relation-ship between TTV replication kinetics and the probability of developing an infection&#xD;
      by CMV has also been described. Likewise, the possible relationship of TTV with other&#xD;
      complications of HSCT, such as Epstein-Barr virus infection (EBV) or graft-versus-host&#xD;
      disease (GvHD), have been reported. However, not every study conducted to date show this line&#xD;
      of results.&#xD;

      Torque Teno Virus (TTV) is the prototype of the Anelloviridae family-single chain and&#xD;
      circular viruses. These viruses form about 70% of the human virome. TTV prevalence in the&#xD;
      general population is very high (&gt;90%) and has not been consistently confirmed to cause any&#xD;
      disease. Kidney transplant studies seem to indicate that an elevated viremia could predict&#xD;
      the risk of de-veloping an infectious process (bacterial, viral or fungal) in the following&#xD;
      weeks. A group of research analyzed the influence of TTV as a predictive marker of infection&#xD;
      in 169 kidney transplant recipi-ents. Patients with infection showed higher TTV levels, even&#xD;
      3 months before the infectious process, allowing its authors to postulate that the&#xD;
      quantification of TTV could help to modulate the treatment of patients at risk (reducing&#xD;
      immunosuppression, introducing or prolonging antimi-crobial prophylaxis). Publications of&#xD;
      subsequent studies with greater number of patients seem to confirm these data. Likewise, in&#xD;
      the specific case of CMV infection, the quantification of TTV in the early stages of kidney&#xD;
      or liver transplantation also allows identification of patients at risk of developing a CMV&#xD;
      infection. In the field of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) few studies have&#xD;
      analyzed the replication kinetics of TTV. There seems to be a drop in TTV plasma load after&#xD;
      conditioning treatment, with a progressive increase in the first months post-transplant, in&#xD;
      parallel with the number of lymphocytes. In early stages of HSCT, a relation-ship between TTV&#xD;
      replication kinetics and the probability of developing an infection by CMV has also been&#xD;
      described. Likewise, the possible relationship of TTV with other complications of HSCT, such&#xD;
      as Epstein-Barr virus infection (EBV) or graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), have been&#xD;
      reported. However, not every study conducted to date show this line of results. An other&#xD;
      research analyzed 2054 blood samples from 123 patients undergoing HSCT, finding no&#xD;
      significant differences between TTV and post-transplant complications, such as viral&#xD;
      reactivations (CMV, EBV or adenovirus), acute GvHD, relapse or mortality&#xD;
