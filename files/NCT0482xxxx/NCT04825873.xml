    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of nivolumab in routine cancer practice in&#xD;
      China. Part one of the study will investigate nivolumab for non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy that has locally advanced or has spread.&#xD;
      Part two will investigate nivolumab for post-platinum squamous cell carcinoma of head and&#xD;
      neck that is recurrent or has spread.&#xD;
