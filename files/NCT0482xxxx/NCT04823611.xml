      Part A: This is designed as a randomized, single-blind (blinding of participants and sites),&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, multiple dose, phase 1 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 11 Japanese participants will be randomized in an 8:3 ratio into 1 of the 2&#xD;
      single-blinded treatment arms; AZD8233 high dose or placebo. Participants will be dosed SC on&#xD;
      Days 1, 8, 29, and 57.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B:This is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging,&#xD;
      phase 2 study. Approximately 80 Japanese participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio&#xD;
      into 1 of the 4 double-blinded treatment arms; AZD8233 low dose, AZD8233 medium dose, AZD8233&#xD;
      high dose, or placebo. Participants will be dosed SC on Days 1, 8, 29, and 57.&#xD;
