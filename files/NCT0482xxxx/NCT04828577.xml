  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use real-time fMRI neurofeedback to enhance participants' ability to&#xD;
      control their temporal window, and hence their ability to modulate delay discounting and&#xD;
      alcohol valuation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on 8 years of experience recruiting alcohol users into studies of comparable length and&#xD;
      complexity, the investigators anticipate that 92% of consented participants will be eligible&#xD;
      (i.e., randomized) and 97% of those individuals will complete Aim 2b. Thus, to achieve a&#xD;
      final sample size of 100, the investigators anticipate consenting 111 participants. This&#xD;
      study will include 50 real time fMRI (experimental group) participants and 50 &quot;idealized&quot;&#xD;
      neurofeedback (control) participants. Participants will be randomly assigned to experimental&#xD;
      or control groups, stratified by AUDIT scores, SES, age, and sex. All study procedures will&#xD;
      take place during a single study visit. Before the imaging session, a research assistant will&#xD;
      aid the participant to select salient images related to individualized future goals as well&#xD;
      as alcohol images which elicit self-reported craving. All participants will complete two fMRI&#xD;
      runs within a single session. In run 1 of the scan (offline classifier training),&#xD;
      participants will perform an image viewing task displaying alternating blocks of these goal-&#xD;
      and alcohol-related images. Between the image viewing blocks we will assess reinforcer&#xD;
      pathology with brief in-scanner measures of delay discounting and alcohol valuation (BAAD).&#xD;
      In total, there will be six blocks each of the goal-oriented images, alcohol-related images,&#xD;
      delay discounting, and BAAD (24 blocks total). Since this is a proof-of-concept experiment,&#xD;
      the interspersed delay discounting and BAAD blocks will enable monitoring and validating&#xD;
      changes in the participant's temporal window and alcohol valuation after the image viewing&#xD;
      blocks. Only the fMRI measures of goal- and alcohol-related image viewing will be used to&#xD;
      build a support vector classifier (SVC) of decreased vs. increased delay discounting. If&#xD;
      participants are allocated to the real time fMRI group, in run 2 the SVC model from run 1&#xD;
      will be used to provide participants with real-time neurofeedback while they attempt to&#xD;
      modulate their temporal window. The participants will see a dial with a needle on the screen&#xD;
      along with instructions to think of either future goals or alcohol cues. The dial will be&#xD;
      directly controlled by ongoing output from the SVC, updating the needle position as&#xD;
      participants imagine immediate (alcohol-related) or delayed (goal-related) cues. Control&#xD;
      participants (&quot;idealized&quot; neurofeedback group) will undergo the same procedures, but in run 2&#xD;
      neurofeedback, will be presented with an &quot;idealized&quot; dial (perfect needle movements in both&#xD;
      alcohol and goal directions) and will be specifically instructed that they are not&#xD;
      controlling the interface. The investigators have used this type of sham needle movement as a&#xD;
      control condition in previous experiments. Based on this, it is expected that experimental&#xD;
      group will have increased whole brain signal to noise for alcohol vs. goal fMRI analyses and&#xD;
      increased recruitment of frontal-parietal networks from enhanced visual attention to the&#xD;
      task.&#xD;

    <description>Delay discounting tasks provide a measure of the temporal window and examine the devaluation of awards as a function of the delay to the receipt. These computerized assessments provide participants with hypothetical choices between smaller amounts of a reward available immediately and a larger amount of a reward after a range of delays (1 day-25 years). Discounting rates will be measured using the adjusting amount delay discounting and minute delay discounting tasks both inside and outside the fMRI. Pre-post differences will be assessed between real and idealized neurofeedback groups.</description>

    <description>Real time neurofeedback will be based on a classifier of increasing or decreasing delay discounting fMRI patterns. Participants will try to modulate their discounting rate based on neurofeedback via a visual dial, during an fMRI scan.
