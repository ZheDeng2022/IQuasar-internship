  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies differences between a mindfulness and a gaming virtual reality (VR)&#xD;
      experience as a means for preoperative anxiety management and postoperative pain management&#xD;
      among patients after head and neck surgery. Investigators will assess differences in anxiety&#xD;
      scores, pain scores, physiologic measures, and subjective patient experiences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optimal postoperative pain control after head and neck surgery is vital for recovery, and&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic strategies to improve pain may help reduce narcotic use. Further,&#xD;
      preoperative anxiety is common and can impact postoperative pain, analgesic requirements, and&#xD;
      recovery. In addition to facilitating with postoperative pain control, VR may have a role in&#xD;
      reducing preoperative anxiety. However, it is unclear whether different VR experiences may be&#xD;
      more beneficial for different clinical applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate if there are differences in preoperative anxiety and postoperative&#xD;
      pain when utilizing different VR experiences. Patients undergoing head and neck surgery will&#xD;
      be randomly allocated preoperatively to first participate in either a mindfulness or active&#xD;
      gaming VR experience, and then postoperatively will crossover and participate in the other&#xD;
      experience they did not utilize prior to surgery.&#xD;
