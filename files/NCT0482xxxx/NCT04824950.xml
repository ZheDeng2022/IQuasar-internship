  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the predictive value in terms of specificity of&#xD;
      circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and positron emission computed tomography (PET-CT) after 2&#xD;
      cycles of chemotherapy (C2), on the probability of obtaining a metabolic complete response&#xD;
      after 4 cycles of induction chemotherapy (C4) in patients with primary mediastinal large B&#xD;
      cell lymphoma (PMBL) receiving standard R-CHOP14 or R-ACVBP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of studies with PMBL patients pinpoint the importance of being able to identify&#xD;
      primary chemo refractory patients at an early stage, in order to be able to improve their&#xD;
      prognosis. Indeed, a biomarker such as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) monitoring would be of&#xD;
      great help to better assess the therapeutic response and offer an individualized care given&#xD;
      the frequent positive residual uptake of the mediastinum at end of treatment. Indeed, ctDNA&#xD;
      can be detected with Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that it would be helpful to prospectively compare the&#xD;
      predictive value of ctDNA versus PET on the capacity to detect primary refractory patients&#xD;
      after 2 or 4 cycles of first line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no prospective studies reporting the evolution of the tumor clone under&#xD;
      treatment or after obtaining complete remission in PMBL. The establishment of this&#xD;
      prospective, multicenter, ambitious and original pilot project will make it possible to&#xD;
      structure the analysis of tumor DNA circulating within these centers caring for patients with&#xD;
      lymphomas within LYSA group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The notion of minimal residual disease (MRD) has shown its interest in follicular lymphomas&#xD;
      and mantle cell lymphomas. The level of sensitivity of NGS-type approaches on the one hand&#xD;
      and the informativeness of the recurrent mutations recently described on the other hand&#xD;
      constitute two elements for reconsidering the problem of MRD in PMBLs. Molecular MRD by&#xD;
      analysis of circulating tumor DNA could constitute a new marker for monitoring response to&#xD;
      treatment in addition to PET-CT and be useful as a tool for non-invasive tumor sequencing at&#xD;
      diagnosis and at relapse, in order to to determine the eligibility for possible targeted&#xD;
      therapies (based on the inactivation of mutated genes) or immunotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the prognostic value of obtaining a quantified complete molecular&#xD;
      response (RMC) by analysis of free circulating DNA (ctDNA) after 2 and 4 cycles of first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy (C2 and C4) for the treatment of PMBL, and that of positron emission computed&#xD;
      tomography (PET) performed at the same time, on overall survival and progression-free&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will describe 3 different populations of patients included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with &quot;negative&quot; plasma DNA at diagnosis (defined by the absence of somatic&#xD;
           mutation detectable at diagnosis by ctDNA analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with &quot;positive&quot; plasma DNA at diagnosis (defined by the presence of at least&#xD;
           one somatic mutation detectable at diagnosis by ctDNA analysis) and whose plasma DNA&#xD;
           becomes &quot;negative&quot; after 2 cycles of chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with &quot;positive&quot; plasma DNA and whose plasma DNA remains &quot;positive&quot; after 2&#xD;
           cycles of chemotherapy For these 3 patient profiles, we will perform comparisons, search&#xD;
           for correlations with different variables and perform univariate and multivariate&#xD;
           statistical analyzes.&#xD;
