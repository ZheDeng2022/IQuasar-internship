      The overall aim of this project is to better understand the emotion regulating effect of&#xD;
      labeling emotions (affecting labeling, AL) for individuals with self-perceived emotional&#xD;
      regulation difficulties from both a clinical population and a non-clinical population, by&#xD;
      using both self-assessment and psychophysiological testing of emotional activation. The main&#xD;
      part of the project includes a brief intervention aiming to test the emotion-regulating&#xD;
      effect of a short behavioral intervention to learn and practice AL. This two-week&#xD;
      intervention, aims to improve the ability to regulate emotions, and to assess the benefits of&#xD;
      emotion regulation strategies for individuals with and without a clinical diagnosis, but with&#xD;
      self-perceived difficulties in emotion regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of this study aims to conceptually replicate a previous basic research study&#xD;
      on AL and its emotion-regulating effect in a experimental laboratory setting and to extend&#xD;
      that replication to include a clinical group. The replication contributes to an indepth&#xD;
      understanding of AL as an implicit emotion regulation strategy in the short term, i.e. as a&#xD;
      strategy used directly in the emotionally charged situation, and expands that knowledge to&#xD;
      also include the effect in individuals with a clinical diagnosis. Also, it provides the&#xD;
      opportunity to evaluate the effect of the two week AL behavioral intervention using&#xD;
      psychophysiological testing.&#xD;

      Main study: AFFECT LABELING - DAILY EXERCISE IN PUTTING WORDS ON EMOTIONS DESIGN AND&#xD;
      PROCEDURE This clinical study is a randomized, wait-list controlled design with repeated&#xD;
      measurements. Participants are randomized at inclusion between being directly offered a&#xD;
      14-day course to train AL and waiting two weeks before beginning the intervention.&#xD;
      Participants are blind to this randomization and do not know that they are in the waitlist&#xD;
      condition, in order to avoid nocebo effects. The randomization is done 1: 1, and stratified&#xD;
      by clinical categorization (participants with or without a psychiatric diagnosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The course is given via a secure web platform (BASS4) in which the participant also makes all&#xD;
      their assessments, and interacts with the study material and their course leader (clinical&#xD;
      psychologist or master level psychology students).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention - web course in affect labeling The intervention is given as a two week&#xD;
      internet-delivered course in using AL with the guidance of a course leader (licensed&#xD;
      psychologist or psychologist assistant under supervision). The course is divided into two&#xD;
      modules where module 1 contains a) Psychoeducation about different emotions and its function,&#xD;
      b) Information about AL and its potential emotion-regulating effect, c) Instruction on how to&#xD;
      use AL in everyday life and d) Planning of daily short exercises in naming emotions. Daily&#xD;
      registration with multiple choice answers is introduced to help the practice of AL. All&#xD;
      assessments are web-based and reminders are sent to the participants' cellphone. The course&#xD;
      leader is active in providing feedback on the exercises and planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Module 2 is largely a continuation of module 1 where any obstacles and other difficulties are&#xD;
      discussed in order to increase the chance of active practice in AL, and continued daily&#xD;
      practice. Module 3 is a brief summary of what has been taught and is made available to the&#xD;
      participant after post-assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory sub-study: Participants will also participate in a laboratory-based study where&#xD;
      the emotion regulating effect of AL will be compared with distraction or passive viewing&#xD;
      while being exposed to emotionally provocative visual stimuli. Participants are exposed to 3&#xD;
      blocks of 8 images and questions about the images (&quot;trials&quot;) with equal numbers of negative&#xD;
      and neutral valence in three conditions: instruction to &quot;Watch&quot;, instruction to use AL and&#xD;
      instruction to use Distraction. The instructions and pictures are given in a randomized,&#xD;
      balanced order. Before each block, a 3-second instruction is displayed that indicates whether&#xD;
      the participant should use &quot;Watch&quot;, &quot;AL&quot; or &quot;Distraction&quot; for all 8 images in the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will carry out the laboratory sub-study on two occasions: before and after&#xD;
      the 14 day period it takes for the individuals who directly receives the web-based course in&#xD;
      AL to complete it.&#xD;
