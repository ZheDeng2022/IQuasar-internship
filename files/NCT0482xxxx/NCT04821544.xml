  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching purpose of this study is to determine if a modified 8-week mindfulness-based&#xD;
      intervention (with a focus on self-compassion; MBSC) will reduce stress and increase&#xD;
      self-compassion in mothers of preterm infants and beneficially modify the human milk&#xD;
      produced, and subsequently improve infant health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During every two-week period, newly admitted preterm infants (&lt;36 weeks gestational age) will&#xD;
      be recruited at performance site OHSU NICU and block-randomized to either control (standard&#xD;
      of care) or intervention (modified 8-week mindfulness-based intervention (with a focus on&#xD;
      self-compassion; MBSC) group. The purpose of the nested cohorts is to minimize the postpartum&#xD;
      time difference among cohort mothers. Each nested MBSC cohort will undergo the 8-week MBSC&#xD;
      intervention with a focus on increasing self-compassion. The MBSC program includes previously&#xD;
      developed daily mindfulness practices, guided meditations, routine mindfulness prompts, and&#xD;
      four video conference group sessions with a certified mindfulness facilitator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal data: The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form (SCS-SF)&#xD;
      will be given to mothers from both groups pre- and post-intervention, and during the 4th&#xD;
      week. Saliva, urine, stool, and human milk samples will be collected at the same time points&#xD;
      as above. Additional maternal data include: age, race, height, weight (pre-pregnancy and last&#xD;
      weight before delivery), parity, delivery mode, chorioamnionitis, preeclampsia, HELLP&#xD;
      (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet) syndrome, antenatal antibiotics,&#xD;
      anti-depressants or other mood-altering/neurochemical medications (current and during&#xD;
      pregnancy), diagnosis of depression or other mental illness within the previous 5 years,&#xD;
      history of postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis, diabetes, hypertension, heart&#xD;
      disease, and any inflammatory or autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infant data: Gestational age, birth weight, ventilation requirement, surgical interventions,&#xD;
      patent ductus arteriosus, growth, nutrition prescriptions, saliva, urine and stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: All data (not including biosamples) will be collected using REDCap hosted&#xD;
      within the UI system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample measurements: Maternal salivary cortisol (marker of stress) and oxytocin (marker of&#xD;
      anxiety and &quot;social-closeness&quot;) concentrations will be measured using ELISA. Human milk&#xD;
      proteins will be identified using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Following proteomic&#xD;
      analyses, targeted proteins will be quantified using ELISA and Western Blot. Both maternal&#xD;
      and infant saliva, urine and stool samples will be used for metabolomic and transcriptomic&#xD;
      sequencing to identify metabolic and molecular changes, respectively, in both mothers and&#xD;
      infants. Infant systemic oxidative stress will be measured through urine F2-isoprostanes&#xD;
      concentrations (ELISA), and infant intestinal inflammation will be determined with stool&#xD;
      calprotectin concentrations (ELISA).&#xD;

    <description>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) - Change from Baseline PSS to 4 and 8 weeks&#xD;
The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is validated and the most widely used instrument to measure perception of stress. The PSS includes 14 questions inquiring about feelings and thoughts during the past month expressed through frequency. The PSS will be used pre-intervention, post-intervention (8 weeks), and at the mid-point of the intervention (4 weeks). The scale for each question ranges from 0-4. The PSS measures how often the responder found life to be unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded. Higher score indicates higher perceived stress. The total score ranges between 0-56.</description>

    <description>Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form (SCS-SF) - Change from Baseline SCS-SF to 4 and 8 weeks&#xD;
The Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form (SCS-SF)19 is a shortened and highly correlated (r â‰¥ 0.97) scale (12 items) from the original 26-item SCS. The SCS-SF measures six key components of self-compassion using a scale that ranges from 1-5: self-kindness, self-judgement, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, and over-identification. Self-compassion is associated with psychological well-being and is therefore often measured alongside stress and anxiety. High score indicates higher self-compassion. The total score ranges between 0-60.</description>
