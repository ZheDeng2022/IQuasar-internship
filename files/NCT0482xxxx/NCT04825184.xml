  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High prevalence of body and eating concerns in Brazilian populations is well-documented, with&#xD;
      risk observed across the lifespan. Prevalence rates of body dissatisfaction range between&#xD;
      26.6 - 56% and 10.7- 36% for adolescent girls and boys, respectively (1, 2, 3). The&#xD;
      prevalence of these disordered attitudes and behaviours are mirrored in older populations,&#xD;
      and have shown to manifest within family units (6). Further, Brazilian consumer trends&#xD;
      reflect these attitudes and behaviours, with it being the leading country in diet pill&#xD;
      consumption and aesthetic surgeries, and second in the world for total aesthetic procedures&#xD;
      (i.e., surgical and non-surgical), with 2.27 million procedures conducted annually (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the scope of body and eating concerns, few evidence-based interventions have been&#xD;
      developed and tested for Brazilian populations and even fewer are accessible, scalable or&#xD;
      cost-effective. Harnessing technology to deliver evidence-based care is a key focus for&#xD;
      researchers. Micro-interventions (brief, low intensity, self-administered interventions),&#xD;
      offer an alternative to traditional, intense interventions that may be unsuitable for milder&#xD;
      concerns. Body image micro-interventions have proven effective at providing immediate and&#xD;
      short-term improvements in body image among women (9). To date, body image&#xD;
      micro-interventions have been developed and evaluated among high-income, White,&#xD;
      English-speaking samples, with little research exploring how this intervention model may&#xD;
      cater to other cultures and countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate&#xD;
      the immediate and short-term impact of a chatbot on Brazilian adolescents' body image, affect&#xD;
      and body image self-efficacy. Primary outcomes include immediate and short-term changes in&#xD;
      state- and trait-based body image, respectively. Secondary outcomes include immediate changes&#xD;
      in state-based affect and short-term changes in trait affect and body image self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chatbot intervention is designed to target sociocultural risk and protective factors for&#xD;
      body image using eight, brief therapeutic techniques derived from several evidence-based&#xD;
      theories, including media literacy, cognitive behaviour theory and positive body image. The&#xD;
      chatbot was developed through a collaboration between Dove (Unilever), United Nations&#xD;
      Children's Fund (UNICEF), The Centre for Appearance Research, and Talk 2 U.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison control condition will be assessment only. This is informed by a care as usual&#xD;
      framework; whereby, Brazilian adolescents are not currently offered body image prevention or&#xD;
      intervention resources at school or within the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To undertake this project, 2800 adolescent girls and boys will be recruited through an&#xD;
      external research agency. Participants will be randomised to either the chatbot or assessment&#xD;
      only conditions. Those in the intervention condition, will be encouraged to engage with the&#xD;
      chatbot over a 72-hour period, where they will be assessed on state-body satisfaction and&#xD;
      affect immediately before and after completing an intervention technique. All participants&#xD;
      will be assessed on trait body image, affect and body image self-efficacy at baseline,&#xD;
      post-intervention (72-hours) and at one-week and one-month follow-ups. At completion of the&#xD;
      one-month follow-up, all participants will receive a debrief form, outlining the study aims&#xD;
      and objectives, and additional resources for body and eating concerns. Those in the&#xD;
      assessment only condition will be invited to engage with the chatbot; however, their&#xD;
      engagement will not be monitored or assessed. Lastly, to compensate participants for their&#xD;
      time, they will receive an electronic voucher to the value of approx. US$25 and US$21, for&#xD;
      the intervention and control condition, respectively.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      High prevalence of body and eating concerns in Brazilian populations is well-documented, with&#xD;
      risk observed across the lifespan. With a population of 211 million people, prevalence rates&#xD;
      of body dissatisfaction range between 26.6 - 56% and 10.7- 36% for adolescent girls and boys,&#xD;
      respectively (1, 2, 3). Equally, an emerging proportion of adolescents report engaging in&#xD;
      disordered eating (i.e., binge eating [10.4%], dietary restriction [8.7%]) and weight control&#xD;
      behaviours (i.e., vomit and laxative use [.3 - 7.4%]; 4,5). The prevalence of these&#xD;
      disordered attitudes and behaviours are mirrored in older populations, and have shown to&#xD;
      manifest within family units (6). A meta-analysis into eating disorder prevalence among&#xD;
      Brazilian university students (Mage = 21.6 years) reported 14.9% of students met criteria for&#xD;
      an eating disorder, with cases highest among nutrition students (7). Meanwhile, Brazilian&#xD;
      parents' perceptions of their child's weight during early adolescence (i.e., 11 years), has&#xD;
      shown to predict higher weight gain and engagement in weight control behaviours during&#xD;
      late-adolescence (i.e., 18 years; 6). Brazilian consumer trends reflect these attitudes and&#xD;
      behaviours, with it being the leading country in diet pill consumption and aesthetic&#xD;
      surgeries, and second in the world for total aesthetic procedures (i.e., surgical and&#xD;
      non-surgical), with 2.27 million procedures conducted annually (8). Despite the scope of body&#xD;
      and eating concerns, few evidence-based interventions have been developed and tested for&#xD;
      Brazilian populations and even fewer are accessible, scalable or cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is widely accepted among health professionals, policy makers and governments that the&#xD;
      global burden of mental health will never be successfully met by extant health professionals&#xD;
      and services alone. Further, current intervention modalities (e.g., face-to-face&#xD;
      psychotherapy) may be unnecessary or unsuitable for milder concerns, which may be responsive&#xD;
      to lower intensity interventions that demand fewer resources. Harnessing technology to&#xD;
      deliver evidence-based care is a key focus for researchers. Micro-interventions (brief, low&#xD;
      intensity, self-administered interventions), offer an alternative to traditional, intense&#xD;
      interventions that may be unsuitable for milder concerns. Body image micro-interventions have&#xD;
      proven effective at providing immediate and short-term improvements in body image among women&#xD;
      (9). To date, body image micro-interventions have been developed and evaluated among&#xD;
      high-income, White, English-speaking samples, with little research exploring how this&#xD;
      intervention model may cater to other cultures and countries. Given the prevalence of body&#xD;
      image concerns among Brazilian adolescents, coupled with health care disparities, developing&#xD;
      evidence-based micro-interventions for scalability is an imperative step in mental health&#xD;
      research for Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate a chatbot that targets risk and protective&#xD;
      factors for body image among Brazilian adolescents. Using a two-armed randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial design (i.e., intervention vs. assessment only), the study will assess the chatbot's&#xD;
      efficacy at eliciting immediate and short-term improvements in adolescents' state- and&#xD;
      trait-based body image, affect and body image self-efficacy. This is the first artificial&#xD;
      intelligence chatbot to target body image among adolescents, particularly in Brazil; thus, a&#xD;
      secondary aim is to assess user's intervention engagement and adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A set of hypotheses were formulated for overall chatbot efficacy (H1-H2), moderation effects&#xD;
      within sub-samples (H3) and intervention engagement and adherence (H4):&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: The chatbot was designed to provide immediate benefits to users. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      anticipated that adolescents will experience improvements in state-based body satisfaction&#xD;
      and affect at the time of engagement with the chatbot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Adolescents randomised into the intervention condition will experience greater&#xD;
      improvements in trait-based body esteem, affect and body image self-efficacy at&#xD;
      post-intervention, one-week and one-month follow-up following a 72-hour trial period,&#xD;
      relative to the assessment only control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: Intervention effects will be moderated by gender, and baseline levels of body esteem,&#xD;
      affect and body image self-efficacy. Specifically, intervention effects will be greatest&#xD;
      among:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Girls&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Girls and boys with lower levels of trait body esteem&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Girls and boys with higher levels of trait negative affect&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Girls and boys with higher levels of body image self-efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4: With regards to user engagement and adherence, given the novelty of this intervention,&#xD;
      analyses will be of an exploratory nature. It is, however, anticipated that greater&#xD;
      engagement and adherence with the chatbot intervention will lead to greater improvements in&#xD;
      trait-based outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-arm randomised controlled trial, comparing an online intervention to an&#xD;
      assessment only control condition. Those in the intervention condition will interact with an&#xD;
      artificial intelligence chatbot over a 72-hour period, while participants in the control&#xD;
      condition will receive care as usual. Assessments of primary and secondary trait outcomes&#xD;
      will be conducted at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), one-week (T3) and one-month&#xD;
      follow-up (T4). Participants in the intervention condition will also be assessed on state&#xD;
      body satisfaction and affect immediately before and after engaging with an intervention&#xD;
      technique embedded into the chatbot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body image chatbot, Topity, is designed to target sociocultural risk and protective&#xD;
      factors for body image using eight, brief therapeutic techniques derived from several&#xD;
      evidence-based theories, including media literacy, cognitive behaviour theory and positive&#xD;
      body image. The intervention aims to engage users in techniques that teach users how to 1)&#xD;
      Critically analyse and evaluate media content to reduce vulnerability to negative media&#xD;
      influences (i.e., media literacy theory; 10); 2) Identify and challenge unhelpful thinking&#xD;
      styles and behaviours that perpetuate body image distress (i.e., cognitive behaviour theory;&#xD;
      11); and 3) Appreciating the features, functions and health of the body, beyond it's&#xD;
      appearance (i.e., positive body image theory; 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      This universal intervention was designed to provide whole population benefits, irrespective&#xD;
      of an individual's level of risk. Therefore, increased risk for body or eating concerns was&#xD;
      not an inclusion criterion for this trial. Eligible participants are those aged 13-18 years&#xD;
      old; Portuguese speaking; Brazilian resident; and, have access to Facebook Messenger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and data collection procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      A representative sample of 2,800 adolescents aged 13-18 will be recruited via a Brazilian&#xD;
      research agency, using the agency's recruitment panels (e.g., via email) and UNICEF's online&#xD;
      communication platforms (e.g., U-Report). Recruitment materials will include a link to a&#xD;
      screener to determine participant eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the screening results, participants will receive an information pack to be read by&#xD;
      themselves and their parent or guardian. Parents will be invited to provide consent by&#xD;
      uploading a signed consent to an online, confidential portal. Following parent consent,&#xD;
      participants will complete the online self-report assessment (baseline; T1), which will&#xD;
      commence with adolescents providing informed assent, by clicking a checkbox. Those who do no&#xD;
      assent will not proceed with the trial. At completion of the baseline survey, adolescents&#xD;
      will be randomised into one of two conditions: intervention or assessment only. Those in the&#xD;
      intervention condition will receive a link to the chatbot via email 24-hours after completing&#xD;
      the baseline assessment. Those in the assessment only condition will be advised of their&#xD;
      opportunity to engage with the chatbot at study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents will be invited and encouraged to engage with the chatbot, as much as possible,&#xD;
      over a 72-hour period. During this period, participants will have the opportunity to complete&#xD;
      and re-engage with eight intervention techniques. Participants will be assessed on state body&#xD;
      satisfaction and affect immediately after engaging with a technique. At the completion of the&#xD;
      72-hour period, both conditions will be assessed on primary and secondary trait outcomes&#xD;
      (post-intervention; T2). Those in the intervention condition will be encouraged to continue&#xD;
      using the chatbot. One-week (T3) and one-month (T4) following the intervention period,&#xD;
      participants will be assessed on primary and secondary trait outcomes. At the completion of&#xD;
      the one-month follow-up, all participants will receive a debrief form, outlining the study&#xD;
      aims and objectives, and additional resources for body image and eating concerns. Those in&#xD;
      the assessment only condition will be invited to engage with the chatbot; however, their&#xD;
      engagement will not be monitored or assessed.&#xD;
