  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to improve the survival rates and decrease progression of pancreatic advanced&#xD;
      cancer, this study aims to evaluate the first line treatment approved for this disease&#xD;
      (gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel) in combination with two experimental drugs, an inhibitor of&#xD;
      the signaling pathway of Hedgehog and an immunotherapy drug able of blocking the CTLA-4&#xD;
      receptor.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading neoplasms in the world in terms of mortality, with&#xD;
      very low survival rates mainly due to its rapid progression and diagnosis in advanced stages,&#xD;
      which makes its treatment extremely difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel is currently considered the first-line standard treatment for&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic cancer due to this superiority against other treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to find an alternative to improve survival of advanced pancreatic cancer, this study&#xD;
      aims to evaluate the efficacy with first-line treatment in combination of two experimental&#xD;
      drugs, a Hedgehog pathway inhibitor (NLM-001) and a CTLA-4 blocker (zalifrelimab) in&#xD;
      previously untreated patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

             of brain metastases that have been treated may participate provided they show evidence&#xD;
             of stable supratentorial lesions at screening (defined as 2 brain images, both of&#xD;
             which are obtained after treatment to the brain metastases. These imaging scans should&#xD;
             both be obtained ≥4 weeks apart). In addition, any neurologic symptoms that developed&#xD;
             either as a result of the brain metastases or their treatment must have returned to&#xD;
             baseline or resolved. For individuals who received steroids as part of brain&#xD;
