  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinically, formation of white spots can occur as early as 4 weeks into orthodontic treatment&#xD;
      and very common in high caries risk individuals. When left untreated, the calcium loss&#xD;
      continues, the enamel breaks down entirely, and a cavity appears. These can cause caries&#xD;
      thereby leading to poor esthetics and patient dissatisfaction. The labio-gingival area of the&#xD;
      lateral incisors is the most common site for WSL and the maxillary posterior segments are the&#xD;
      least common site, with males affected more in comparison with females.Hence inducing&#xD;
      remineralization of existing lesions is the key treatment to prevent cavitation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      White spot lesion (WSL) is the earliest sign of demineralization of the enamel and a common&#xD;
      problem caused because of plaque accumulation and poor oral hygiene. These WSLs are of great&#xD;
      concern in young patients, considering that esthetics is the prime reason for young patients&#xD;
      to seek dental treatment. The appearance of these areas of demineralization should be&#xD;
      prevented and appropriate strategies must be undertaken in remineralizing these lesions. A&#xD;
      recent meta-analysis on the incidence and prevalence of these lesions in orthodontic patients&#xD;
      included 14 studies indicated that the incidence of new carious lesions formed during&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment in patients was 45.8% and the prevalence of lesions in patients&#xD;
      undergoing orthodontic treatment was 68.4%. This is considerably high and needs urgent&#xD;
      attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enamel decalcification can occur as a result of orthodontic bracket or any other foreign body&#xD;
      attached onto the tooth surface, and provoked by poor oral hygiene. It is an incipient caries&#xD;
      in the subsurface beneath an intact enamel outer surface. It is characterized by chalky white&#xD;
      appearance (WSLs) mostly around the brackets, and have different refractive index than intact&#xD;
      enamel surface.If the WSL's are left untreated it can progress to break down the enamel&#xD;
      surface and develop into advance stages of carious lesion that indicate esthetic restorations&#xD;
      or in more advance cases a prosthodontic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown good evidence on non-invasive treatment of WSLs such as establishing good&#xD;
      oral hygiene and the use of fluoride and non-fluoride remineralizing agents. Fluoride&#xD;
      containing agents are available as high-fluoride toothpaste, fluoride mouthwash, gels and&#xD;
      varnish. Recently, other non-fluoride materials and techniques such as casein phosphopeptide&#xD;
      -amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) has shown promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinpro® is 5% sodium fluoride varnish and is indicated to be used for hypersensitive as well&#xD;
      as for demineralized teeth. It flows smoothly on moist teeth and binds firmly to their&#xD;
      surfaces. 1ml of Clinpro® contain 50 mg of sodium fluoride. Fluoride varnish placed around&#xD;
      orthodontic brackets during treatment has been shown to reduce the incidence and prevalence&#xD;
      of WSL. Tooth Mousse® contains Casein phosphopeptide-Amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP - ACP)&#xD;
      is product from the milk casein. This delivers the necessary Calcium and Phosphate ions to&#xD;
      the tooth, which will reduce the risk of caries and white spot by enhancing tooth&#xD;
      remineralization. MI Paste® which is Casein phosphopeptide-Amorphous calcium phosphate&#xD;
      fluoride (CPP-ACPF) additional contains fluoride in addition to CPP-ACP. The level of&#xD;
      fluoride is 900ppm which approximates that in adult strength toothpastes. When CPP-ACPF is&#xD;
      applied in the oral environment, it will bind to biofilms, plaque, bacteria, hydroxyapatite&#xD;
      and soft tissue localizing bio-available calcium, phosphate and fluoride. Recent studies have&#xD;
      investigated the remineralization potential of CPP-ACP combined with fluoride and have found&#xD;
      a synergistic effect when these are administered together, which is the composition in MI&#xD;
      paste. Patients who have previous history of milk protein allergy or lactose intolerance are&#xD;
      not suitable to use MI paste or tooth mousse. This is based on the manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions. However, there is no published data on these allergic reactions to CPP-ACP&#xD;
      products so far. 1.23% APF (Acidulated phosphate fluoride) gel is routinely used professional&#xD;
      based fluoride for patients with high caries risk. Listerine® Sodium fluoride (0.2%) mouth&#xD;
      rinses are effective in reducing caries and inhibit carbohydrate utilization of oral&#xD;
      microorganisms by blocking enzymes involved in the bacterial glycolytic pathway studies have&#xD;
      shown sodium fluoride mouth rinse to be effective in reducing S. mutans counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the variety of agents that are available the aim of this clinical study is to&#xD;
      compare Clinpro® 5% sodium fluoride plus tri calcium phosphate varnish, Tooth mousse® CPP-ACP&#xD;
      without fluoride, MI Paste® CPP-ACP with fluoride and 0.2% sodium fluoride mouthwash in&#xD;
      remineralization of white spot lesions.&#xD;
