      This randomised trial will investigate the effect of low energy availability (energy intake&#xD;
      minus exercise energy expenditure), and calcium supplementation during low energy&#xD;
      availability, on bone and calcium metabolism in women during acute load carriage exercise.&#xD;
      This study will test the following hypotheses: i) low energy availability will result in an&#xD;
      uncoupling of bone turnover and a negative calcium balance during load carriage; ii) calcium&#xD;
      supplementation during low energy availability will attenuate the increase in bone resorption&#xD;
      and negative calcium balance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Military field exercises are characterised by high exercising energy expenditures, restricted&#xD;
      dietary intake and prolonged periods of load carriage. These exercise and nutritional&#xD;
      challenges can result in impaired bone turnover, a negative calcium balance and an increased&#xD;
      risk of stress fracture. Women have increased sensitivity to metabolic and endocrine&#xD;
      disturbances associated with energy deficit, and have a higher incidence of stress fracture&#xD;
      during military training compared with men. This randomised trial will investigate the effect&#xD;
      of low energy availability (energy intake minus exercise energy expenditure), and calcium&#xD;
      supplementation during low energy availability, on bone and calcium metabolism in women&#xD;
      during acute load carriage exercise. This randomised controlled trial will randomise women&#xD;
      into three groups, stratified by aerobic fitness, body mass index and contraception. Each&#xD;
      participant will complete two 6-day experimental testing sessions before (baseline) and after&#xD;
      (follow-up) 2 weeks of an experimental diet: Group 1) adequate energy (45 kcal∙kg fat free&#xD;
      mass [FFM]∙d-1) / adequate calcium (1500 mg∙d-1); Group 2) low energy availability (15&#xD;
      kcal∙kg FFM∙d-1) / adequate calcium (1500 mg∙d-1), and; Group 3) low energy availability (15&#xD;
      kcal∙kg FFM∙d-1) / low calcium (250 mg∙d-1). Each 6-day trial will involve three bouts of&#xD;
      load carriage (9.7 km in 90 minutes carrying 20 kg), separated by 24 to 48 hours recovery&#xD;
      whilst remaining on the experimental diet. During each experimental trial blood and urine&#xD;
      will be sampled for markers of bone and calcium metabolism, and endocrine function. Following&#xD;
      the completion of the second, 6-day experimental trial, participants will return to their&#xD;
      habitual diet for 2 weeks and then provide a recovery blood and urine sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: The absolute change in urinary calcium balance (Ca44:Ca42) from Experimental&#xD;
      Testing 1 to 2 will be compared between groups (Group 1 vs Group 2 and Group 2 vs Group 3)&#xD;
      using one-way ANCOVAs with calcium balance (either as a ratio, or both the numerator and&#xD;
      denominator) in Experimental Testing 1 and baseline body mass as the covariates, or a linear&#xD;
      mixed model with the restricted maximum likelihood estimation to allow incorporation of&#xD;
      incomplete data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes: Absolute change for AUC for circulating measures of bone turnover and&#xD;
      calcium metabolism during load carriage from Experimental Testing 1 to 2 will be compared&#xD;
      between groups using one-way ANCOVAs (Group 1 vs Group 2 and Group 2 vs Group 3) with AUC in&#xD;
      Experimental Testing 1 as the covariate, or a linear mixed model with the restricted maximum&#xD;
      likelihood estimation to allow incorporation of incomplete data. Absolute change for fasting&#xD;
      circulating measures of bone turnover, calcium metabolism and endocrine function from&#xD;
      Experimental Testing 1 to 2 will be compared between groups (Group 1 vs Group 2 and Group 2&#xD;
      vs Group 3) using one-way ANCOVAs with baseline measures in Experimental Testing 1 as the&#xD;
      covariate, or a linear mixed model with the restricted maximum likelihood estimation to allow&#xD;
      incorporation of incomplete data. A mixed-design 3 × 3 (Group [Group 1 vs Group 2 vs Group 3]&#xD;
      × time [Experimental Testing 1 vs Experimental Testing 2 vs Recovery]) ANOVA will be used to&#xD;
      examine changes in body mass, lean mass, fat mass and aBMD.&#xD;
