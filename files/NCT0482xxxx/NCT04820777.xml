  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic stroke patients often have impaired balance on reactive balance control. Task&#xD;
      specific exercises are important part of the fall intervention in daily activities of life&#xD;
      should be incorporated during the rehabilitative services Objective: Effects of perturbation&#xD;
      based balance training in reactive balance control in chronic stroke patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RCT (Randomized Control Trail) study was conducted. Stroke patients who have impaired balance&#xD;
      and reactive control were determined on inclusion &amp; exclusion criteria. Stroke patients with&#xD;
      impaired balance control were arbitrarily allocated into two groups with one control and one&#xD;
      interventional group ages ranged from 45 to 50 years. The sample size was 20 patients. Group&#xD;
      1 (control group) received tradional balance training and Group 2 (interventional group)&#xD;
      received perturbation based training for balance control. The interval of treatment was 6&#xD;
      weeks. Data is collected from Azra Naheed Medical college (Ch Muhammad Akram teaching &amp;&#xD;
      research hospital) Lahore and Physiotherapy department of Social security hospital manga&#xD;
      mandi Lahore. Tinetti performance oriented mobility assessment (POMA),Time up and go (TUG)&#xD;
      and Activity specific balance confidence (ABC) was used to evaluate the pre and post values&#xD;
      of balance control.&#xD;
