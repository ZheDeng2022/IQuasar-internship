  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of disability in older adults. Because&#xD;
      pharmacological approaches do not seem to prevent or slow the disease, clinicians need&#xD;
      non-pharmacological interventions that might help people with AD remain independent for as&#xD;
      long as possible. This study aims to evaluate the effects of a new behavioral treatment, the&#xD;
      Structured External Memory Aid Treatment (SEMAT), for adults with mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (MCI) designed to promote independent living skills by explicitly teaching the use of&#xD;
      strategies and tools to compensate for cognitive weaknesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate the efficacy of the SEMAT for improving functional performance in a pilot&#xD;
      randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate demographic, clinical, and neuropsychological predictors of treatment&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Develop and refine the SEMAT manual and other materials for training future&#xD;
      interventionists.&#xD;

      Clinical Trial Study Design: Pilot Individually Randomized Group-Treatment Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site: University of Delaware&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants: Approximately 65 older adults will be recruited to participate to ensure&#xD;
      50 completers with MCI. Participants will be recruited and complete study procedures in&#xD;
      waves. Each wave will consist of 10 completers with MCI; for a total of 5 waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Following the screening criteria session and informed consent, if the&#xD;
      participant met the criteria for amnestic MCI he/she will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      immediate treatment (n=25) or delayed treatment control (n=25) condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures Aim 1: Clinical Trial. Once randomly assigned to a condition, participants&#xD;
      will complete baseline testing and additional testing at two other time periods: weeks 8 and&#xD;
      16. Participants in the immediate treatment condition will then complete 7-weeks of the group&#xD;
      SEMAT. At week 8, participants in both groups will complete assessments. Then, those in the&#xD;
      delayed treatment group will complete 7-weeks of treatment. At week 16, participants in both&#xD;
      conditions will complete assessments. During assessment sessions, participants will complete&#xD;
      performance-based and self-reported measures of independent daily tasks and tests of thinking&#xD;
      and memory independently with an assessor for approximately 1 hour. During treatment sessions&#xD;
      (approximately 60 minutes), participants will interact with group-mates and learn how use&#xD;
      three different categories of external memory aids. Treatment sessions will be video recorded&#xD;
      and transcribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2a: The 50 participants with MCI who are enrolled in Aim 1 activities will also be&#xD;
           included in Aim 2. Participants will complete additional self-report measures of&#xD;
           efficacy and depression prior to the active phase of treatment either during baseline or&#xD;
           week 8 (Aim 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2b: The investigators will randomly select a subpopulation of participants with&#xD;
           single-domain aMCI (n=15) and multi-domain aMCI (n=15), as well as their study partners&#xD;
           (n=15; n=15) to complete cognitive interviewing immediately following completion of the&#xD;
           active phase of the intervention (Aim 1). Participants will engage in semi-structured&#xD;
           interviews that will take approximately 1 hour and will be video recorded, transcribed,&#xD;
           and qualitatively analyzed for themes that are discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Each participant will be involved for approximately 18 weeks (including&#xD;
      screening criteria session and cognitive interviews, if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retention of Subjects: The investigators will stagger participant payments and over recruit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control condition: No treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The Structured External Memory Aid Treatment (SEMAT): A 7-week treatment that&#xD;
      will teach three categories of external memory aids to participants to help compensate for&#xD;
      everyday memory challenges. This is a behavioral intervention.&#xD;

    <description>The Functional External Memory Aid Tool, a performance-based assessment tool of attempted compensation and task accuracy. The development of this tool is described above (Preliminary Data). Participants can score a maximum of 33 points on the 11-item FEMAT, representing successful use of compensatory strategies to complete everyday tasks. Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ) assesses self-reported memory skills and use of strategies across three subscales (ability, strategy, and contentment). The MMQ is 57-items.</description>

    <description>The Everyday Cognition (ECog) is an informant questionnaire to assess improvements in memory based everyday functioning. The ECog comprises of 39 items on which the participant's current level of everyday functioning is compared to a pervious level. Items are rated on a four-point scale: 1= better or no change; 4= consistently much worse. Higher scores indicate greater functional limitations.</description>

    <description>The Neuro-QOL Cognitive Function v2.0 item bank will be given as a self-report version to participants. This measure is a version of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Cognitive Function v2.0 item bank that has been optimized for adults with acquired neurological conditions. It assesses perceived difficulties in cognitive abilities or in the application of such abilities to everyday tasks, and has good psychometric properties as an outcome measure (e.g., is sensitive to change).</description>

    <description>During the 7 weeks of treatment, the interventionist will teach 3 categories of external memory aids (calendars, timers, notes) following an already-developed detailed treatment manual (described here briefly).&#xD;
Week 1: Introduction of External Memory Aid Treatment and Person-Centered Goal Setting. Weeks 2-7. In the next six weeks, three categories of external memory aids will be taught: calendars, timers, and notes. The focus of the first session will be how to use the strategies, and the second session will build awareness of when to use these strategies during everyday tasks. Within each category, three types of strategies will be taught to participants. Within each session, learning phases will follow training stages from compensatory learning theory: 1) acquisition phase, 2) application phase, and 3) an adaptation phase.</description>
