      Study the specificities of families in a precarious situation with a child with autism&#xD;
      spectrum disorders (ASD) in terms of housing, in order to better support them in the various&#xD;
      social spaces and improve collaboration between professionals and parents&#xD;

      Identify the living conditions related to the housing of children with autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorders (ASD) treated at the Léo Kanner Center (CLK), psychopathology department of the&#xD;
      Saint-Étienne University Hospital. The aim is to describe through the trajectories of&#xD;
      children with ASD and their families, their living conditions, and through interviews with&#xD;
      professionals who support them, how the specificities related to precarious situations are&#xD;
      identified and taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualitative survey, carried out by sociological interviews with families whose children are&#xD;
      followed at the Léo Kanner Center (CLK) and the professionals who care for them, would make&#xD;
      it possible to collect data on the development of a young child with autism in his home and&#xD;
      more generally in his habitat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to study the specificities of families in a precarious situation&#xD;
      with a child with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in terms of housing, in order to better&#xD;
      support them in different social spaces and improve collaboration between professionals and&#xD;
      parents. The project aims to bring children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) into a&#xD;
      dynamic of access to human rights. He suggests three levers to achieve this: rely on a&#xD;
      precise inventory of needs; work towards a transformation of representations; streamline&#xD;
      access to healthcare and common law services.&#xD;
