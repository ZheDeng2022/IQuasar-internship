  <brief_summary>

      This Individual Patient Expanded Access IND has been created per the request of a 19-year-old&#xD;
      man who has been diagnosed with Spinal Cord Injury.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subject is a 19-year-old male who fell approximately 50 feet onto his back during a skiing&#xD;
      accident. He suffered traumatic anterolisthesis at T10-11 with associated spinal cord&#xD;
      transection and obliteration of the central canal. He and his family are requesting this&#xD;
      Individual Patient Expanded Access IND with the purpose of possible restoration of nerve&#xD;
      transmission and restoring sensation in his lower body using intravenous autologous adipose&#xD;
      derived mesenchymal stem cells. This study will give 14 infusions of 200 million HB-adMSC's&#xD;
      over a 52 week period.&#xD;
