  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators of this study have developed a standardized counseling aid using an&#xD;
      electronic mobile device to help women learn about what to expect during labor and subsequent&#xD;
      vaginal delivery or cesarean delivery, specifically regarding pain expectations. Half of&#xD;
      women will complete the counseling aid and the other half will receive standard counseling&#xD;
      and care. The study aims to determine if the counseling aid improves patient satisfaction and&#xD;
      perception of pain control.&#xD;

      A. Objective To compare perception of postpartum pain and patient satisfaction between women&#xD;
      who receive routine obstetric care to those who receive routine obstetric care and complete a&#xD;
      standardized counseling aid antepartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Background Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is a standardized, evidenced-based&#xD;
      method for the perioperative management of surgical patients. ERAS protocols have been well&#xD;
      studied in several surgical specialties, including gynecologic oncology and benign&#xD;
      gynecology, and have been shown to reduce hospital length of stay and costs without&#xD;
      increasing rates of complications or readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of ERAS in obstetrics is also growing. Recent studies have shown that an enhanced&#xD;
      recovery pathway after cesarean delivery can decrease hospital stay and cost and reduce&#xD;
      opioid use. Guidelines have been developed for evidence-based recommendations for&#xD;
      preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative phases of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important component of any ERAS protocol is pre-operative counseling. Postoperative pain&#xD;
      management starts with counseling prior to surgery. Guidelines suggest that preoperative&#xD;
      counseling should include patient-centered education on the options for management of pain.&#xD;
      This process also allows an opportunity to engage patients in the decision making process.&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that counseling on pain expectations can improve patient&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to develop a standardized antepartum counseling aid and improve&#xD;
      postpartum pain perceptions and patient experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Study Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study Design The study is a randomized control trial. Patients will be assigned 1:1 to&#xD;
           the study group and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1: Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Group: Women will watch an educational video regarding expectations for delivery&#xD;
           and postpartum care in addition to receiving standard care and counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2: Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control Group: Women will receive standard care and counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of Potentially Eligible Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Potentially eligible patients will be identified through screening of clinic patients at&#xD;
           time of routine prenatal visit at the Prisma Health OBGYN Center between 35 to 41 weeks&#xD;
           gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigators will review charts of women scheduled for routine obstetric appointments&#xD;
           and screen for eligibility. Eligible women will be contacted at the time of their&#xD;
           prenatal appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study fliers advertising the study will also be posted in OB clinics at the OBGYN&#xD;
           Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Women who are interested in enrollment will be counseled and consented by study&#xD;
           personnel at their scheduled appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The enrollment process involves a face-to-face interview with one of the study&#xD;
           investigators for verification of study eligibility and counseling regarding study&#xD;
           procedures as well as potential benefits and risks prior to obtaining written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment Allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. On day of enrollment, patients will be randomized into the treatment group or the&#xD;
           control group using a computer-generated randomization scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Randomization will be stratified by plan for delivery with plan for vaginal delivery&#xD;
           versus plan for cesarean delivery, as content of the educational videos will be geared&#xD;
           towards mode of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Randomization assignment will not be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. All participants will complete an initial demographic questionnaire immediately&#xD;
           following randomization via self- administered assessments within the test application&#xD;
           using a mobile tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Subjects allocated to Group 1: will:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. Complete the demographic questionnaire, the survey questions, and then complete the&#xD;
           counseling aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Prior to discharge after delivery, study personnel will administer the postpartum&#xD;
           questionnaire via a mobile tablet. The questionnaire is programmed into the study&#xD;
           application.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Subjects allocated to Group 2: will:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. Complete the demographic questionnaire and survey questions without watching the&#xD;
           educational video.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Prior to discharge after delivery, study personnel will administer the postpartum&#xD;
           questionnaire via a mobile tablet. The questionnaire is programmed into the study&#xD;
           application.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Research staff will complete chart reviews to confirm delivery information and other&#xD;
           study related data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary: What is the impact of a standardized antepartum counseling aid on patient&#xD;
           satisfaction with pain expectations during hospital admission for labor and delivery&#xD;
           compared to women who do not use the counseling aid and receive routine counseling only?&#xD;
           Satisfaction will be measured using the Revised American Pain Society Patient Outcome&#xD;
           Questionnaire (APS-POQ-R). The APS-POQ-R is designed for use in adult hospital pain&#xD;
           management QI activities and measures 6 aspects of quality including: (1) pain severity&#xD;
           and relief; (2) impact of pain on activity, sleep, and negative emotions; (3) side&#xD;
           effects of treatment; (4) helpfulness of information about pain treatment; (5) ability&#xD;
           to participate in pain treatment decisions; and (6) use of nonpharmocological&#xD;
           strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary outcomes: Perception of pain control intrapartum and postpartum based on&#xD;
           postpartum questionnaires, expectations of what type and how much pain medication at&#xD;
           time of discharge, use of narcotics postpartum as determined by chart review, pain&#xD;
           perceptions in patients with history of mood disorder as determined by questionnaire,&#xD;
           pain perceptions in patients with history of substance abuse as determined by&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
