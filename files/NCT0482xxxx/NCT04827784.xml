    <textblock>
      The retrospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the Auriculotemporal Nerve Block&#xD;
      (ATNB) in achieving unrestricted mouth opening amount and in reducing the pain scores in&#xD;
      those patients diagnosed with disc displacement with (DDWR) and without reduction (DDWOR)&#xD;
      according to the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders, who could not benefit&#xD;
      from noninvasive methods but did not want further invasion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The records of 410 patients referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery with&#xD;
      TMD symptoms were reviewed to determine the treatment modalities used and their outcomes. The&#xD;
      subjects were examined and diagnosed according to the Turkish translation version of The&#xD;
      Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD-Axis 1 questionnaire and&#xD;
      examination form). The pain intensity, maximal mouth opening (MMO) amounts, and self-reported&#xD;
      outcome variables of twenty-two patients who underwent non-invasive therapies (occlusal&#xD;
      stabilization splints, behavioral modifications, physical therapy, pharmacotherapy) but did&#xD;
      not benefit from them and volunteered for the ATNB instead of invasive therapies&#xD;
      (arthrocentesis, arthroscopy, and discectomy) were also evaluated. Prior to the ATNB, written&#xD;
      informed consent was obtained from each participant. Also, each participant was warned about&#xD;
      complications of the ATNB before the administration, such as hematoma at the injection site,&#xD;
      positive aspiration, and temporary anesthesia of the facial nerve.&#xD;

    <description>A total of 3 doses of Auriculotemporal Nerve Block (ATNB) were administered to involved participants. Local anesthetic solutions containing Articaine Hydrochloride (80 mg / 2 ml) and epinephrine bitartrate (0.02 mg / 2 ml) were used for ATNB application. The injections were repeated on follow-up visits in the first and fourth weeks. The maximal mouth opening amounts, pain intensity values (via VAS scale), and self-reported outcomes were evaluated at the pre-injection, first week, fourth week, and sixth-month follow-up controls.</description>

    <description>The head and neck of the condyle were detected by palpating the pretragal area. Then, the needle was inserted anterior to the junction of the tragus and the lobule. After 0.5 ml the solution was subcutaneously infiltrated, the needle was protruded until it touched the neck of the condyle. Aspiration was performed to avoid intravenous injections, and the remaining solution was injected thereafter.</description>
