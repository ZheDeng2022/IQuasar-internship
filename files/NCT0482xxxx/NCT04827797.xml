  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to determine the effects of different birthing balls used at the first stage&#xD;
      of childbirth on birth outcomes and maternal satisfaction. Randomized controlled,&#xD;
      single-blind clinical study included a total of 180 pregnant women. The study included 3&#xD;
      groups (A: routine hospital care, B: spherical birthing ball, C: peanut ball). Especially&#xD;
      spherical birthing ball, were effective in reducing labor pain and facilitating faster rate&#xD;
      of descent of the fetal head, and they increased maternal satisfaction.&#xD;

      The study aimed to determine the effects of different birthing balls used at the first stage&#xD;
      of childbirth on birth outcomes and maternal satisfaction. Randomized controlled,&#xD;
      single-blind clinical study included a total of 180 pregnant women. The study included 3&#xD;
      groups (A: routine hospital care, B: spherical birthing ball, C: peanut ball). Especially&#xD;
      spherical birthing ball, were effective in reducing labor pain and facilitating faster rate&#xD;
      of descent of the fetal head, and they increased maternal satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPACT STATEMENT What is already known on this subject? Labor pain and outcomes occurring&#xD;
      during labor are known and expected situation. Some non-pharmacological methods are applied&#xD;
      to ensure that birth is easy and maternal satisfaction is high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What the results of this study add? There is no studies using the peanut ball and the&#xD;
      spherical birth ball together. In our study, it was found that both balls are effective, but&#xD;
      the spherical birth ball is more significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?&#xD;
      Our study suggested that the spherical birth ball had effective on birth outcomes. Future&#xD;
      studies should be performed to investigate the effects of birth balls in the postpartum&#xD;
      period, breastfeeding or prenatal period.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Latent, active and transition phase in labor</time_frame>
    <description>in this scale, the participants marked the severity of their pain on a 10-cm ruler with one end stating &quot;no pain&quot; and the other end &quot;worst possible pain&quot;. VAS was used to determine the severity of pain and the effectiveness of the intervention in this study.</description>

    <measure>Verbal Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Latent, active and transition phase of labor</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is based on participants' choice of word that defines their pain state</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Partogram</measure>
    <time_frame>active phase of labor</time_frame>
    <description>This is used starting from the active phase of labor. The progress of the labor and the health status of the baby are monitored on the partogram</description>

    <measure>Evaluation Scale for Maternal Satisfaction with Normal Delivery</measure>
    <time_frame>within a period of 1-4 hours postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>This is used to assess maternal satisfaction in normal delivery. Higher total scores on the scale indicate stronger maternal satisfaction with the hospital care provided in normal delivery</description>
