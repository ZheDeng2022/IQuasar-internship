        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and Female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be 50 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have OA in a single or bilateral shoulder(s) with an inferior osteophyte&#xD;
             measuring &lt;7 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &gt; 1 mm joint space width in the study shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ASES score of 14.1 to 88.5&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Osteoarthritis must be primary. Subjects must have previously tried 6 months of one of&#xD;
             the following conservative treatments: activity modification, physical therapy, and&#xD;
             anti-inflammatory or injection therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients can provide written informed consent after the nature of the study is fully&#xD;
             explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant abnormal hematology, serum chemistry, or&#xD;
             urinalysis screening laboratory results. If the laboratory reports a single,&#xD;
             non-clinically relevant, non-life-threatening result for any of these studies and is&#xD;
             the only excluding factor it may be repeated 1 week later if the patient wishes. If&#xD;
             the laboratory reports a single, non-clinically relevant, non-life-threatening result&#xD;
             for any of these studies and is the only excluding factor it may be repeated 1 week&#xD;
             later if the patient wishes. Normalization of that laboratory study will then be&#xD;
             considered non-exclusionary. If repeat non-clinically relevant, non-life-threatening&#xD;
             results do not normalize the patient may be further evaluated by a specialist or&#xD;
             primary care provider to determine if lab result should be exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking anti-inflammatory medications (prescription or over-the-counter),&#xD;
             including herbal therapies, within 14 days of baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Walch Type B2/C glenoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking anti-rheumatic disease medication (including methotrexate or other&#xD;
             antimetabolites) within the 3 months prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving injections to the treated shoulder within 3 months prior to study&#xD;
             entry,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or currently breast-feeding children. Females of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to receiving the&#xD;
             study drug and will agree use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method or&#xD;
             abstinence) from the time of screening to a period of 3 months following completion of&#xD;
             the drug treatment cycle. Females of childbearing potential are defined as&#xD;
             premenopausal and not surgically sterilized, or post-menopausal for fewer than 2&#xD;
             years. A urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to the administration of the&#xD;
             study drug to confirm negative results. If the urine pregnancy test is positive, the&#xD;
             study drug will not be administered and the result will be confirmed by a serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test. Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at a central clinical&#xD;
             laboratory, whereas urine pregnancy tests will be performed by qualified personnel&#xD;
             using kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with systemic, rheumatic or inflammatory disease of the shoulder or&#xD;
             chondrocalcinosis, hemochromatosis, inflammatory arthritis, arthropathy of the&#xD;
             shoulder associated with juxta-articular Paget's disease, ochronosis, hemophilic&#xD;
             arthropathy, infectious arthritis, villonodular synovitis, and synovial&#xD;
             chondromatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with ongoing infectious disease, including HIV and hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, endocrine&#xD;
             disease, cancer, or diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients participating in a study of an experimental drug or medical device within 30&#xD;
             days of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with hardware or implants in the affected shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previous open shoulder surgery or an arthroscopic procedure requiring&#xD;
             structural repair with anchors and/or sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of large glenoid cysts&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Opiate use within three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking Coumadin or Plavix&#xD;
