      NIMBLE is a comprehensive, five-year collaborative effort to standardize, compare, validate,&#xD;
      and advance the regulatory qualification of imaging and circulating biomarkers to diagnose&#xD;
      and stage nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and to predict and assess response to&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention (https://fnih.org/what-we-do/biomarkers-consortium/programs/nimble)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study, Study 1.1, is a prospective, observational, two-center, short- term&#xD;
      cross-sectional study to assess the reproducibility and repeatability of a set of specified&#xD;
      ultrasound-based quantitative imaging biomarkers. The primary focus will be on imaging&#xD;
      biomarkers of the liver fibrosis component of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),&#xD;
      rather than the steatosis or inflammation component. The rationale is that the fibrosis&#xD;
      component is linked most closely to survival and other clinical outcomes. Study 1.1 will also&#xD;
      collect data to explore vendor- or device-specific investigational biomarkers on other&#xD;
      components of NAFLD such as steatosis and possibly inflammation. The data collected will be&#xD;
      used to inform a decision of which of these biomarkers have sufficient precision to be&#xD;
      advanced to NIMBLE Stage 2.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Study participants will not be randomized to individual treatment groups or be blinded. In order to ensure a uniform distribution of scanner combinations, participants will follow a block-randomization pattern with different scanner combinations for different participants, however, patients and operators will not be blinded to ultrasound scanners being used.&#xD;
All efforts will be made to keep ultrasound operators blinded to clinical and laboratory data, however, it is not believed that this will significantly affect the ultrasound acquisition. The Visit 2 operator will be asked to not review the Visit 1 exam results.&#xD;
Central analysts will be blinded to key clinical and laboratory findings to minimize potential bias. Blinding of the central analysts will be outlined in a separate Image Review Charter.</masking_description>

             coefficient of ultrasound and VCTE measurements. Women who state they might be&#xD;
