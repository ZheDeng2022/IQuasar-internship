  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE - blood clots that form in deep veins or in the lungs) has been&#xD;
      identified as a leading cause of death in economically developed countries for pregnant and&#xD;
      recently-pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that clotting parameters can take up to 6 weeks to return to normal for&#xD;
      women who have had term deliveries, however there is an absence of information on time taken&#xD;
      for clotting parameters to normalise following abortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, existing guidelines are based solely on expert opinion and recommend durations of&#xD;
      VTE prevention from as short as 7 days, up to 6 weeks following abortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women are assessed for risk of VTE, but data are needed to inform an evidence-based&#xD;
      approach to prevention of VTE in these women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from this pilot study have the potential to inform clinical guidance and&#xD;
      possibly a larger study subsequently.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sample population: Women who attend the abortion service at the Chalmers Centre to receive&#xD;
      abortion assessment and abortion care. There will be 3 groups recruited based upon&#xD;
      gestational age of pregnancy - Group 1: Gestation less than 10 weeks (10 participants), Group&#xD;
      2: Gestation 10+0 -13+6 weeks (10 participants), Group 3: Gestation 14+0-20+0 weeks (10&#xD;
      participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information Sheet: All new patients attending the clinic will be given a copy of the&#xD;
      participant information sheet, so that they have time to read about the study. The&#xD;
      Information sheet will also be available on the 'research' section of the clinic website -&#xD;
      all women are routinely directed to this page before attending clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach by research staff: Following registration, all patients are taken for an ultrasound&#xD;
      scan by a clinical support worker to confirm gestation. Following this, patients move to a&#xD;
      waiting area until they can be seen for their assessment. While they are waiting, the clinic&#xD;
      coordinator will ask the patient if they are happy to be approached by the researcher to&#xD;
      discuss the study further. If they are happy to discuss further, the researcher will then&#xD;
      approach and discuss the study in a private room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent: If patients are happy to participate in the study, the researcher will then obtain&#xD;
      written informed consent prior to their bloods being taken by clinic staff if bloods required&#xD;
      for routine care, if no routine bloods are required, the researcher will obtain the blood&#xD;
      sample. Participants will be asked if they are planning to use a hormonal form of&#xD;
      contraception following their abortion - if yes, they would be asked to wait until they have&#xD;
      had their second blood sample taken to commence or not taken forward into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First blood test: This will be obtained on the day of clinic attendance and ultrasound scan.&#xD;
      Blood samples (less than 20 ml) will be obtained and taken to the NHS Lothian laboratory at&#xD;
      the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and for ClotPro thromboelastography point of care testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second blood test: An appointment will be made to see the patient in Chalmers Centre or at&#xD;
      their home to obtain a further blood sample to compare to the initial test. This will take&#xD;
      place 10-14 days following mifepristone administration. For the repeat sample we will conduct&#xD;
      a COVID-19 risk assessment and only invite them for return visit/home visit if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The participant has confirmed they and close contacts are well and without suspicion of&#xD;
           COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The participant agrees to a home visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The research staff undertaking the home visit should be well and have had no known&#xD;
           contact with a COVID-19 positive individual for the past 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If they are having an intrauterine contraceptive, implant or injection, the second blood&#xD;
      sample can be taken when they come into clinic for this, to minimise the number of visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison group: A comparison group, Group 4 (10 participants), who are healthy volunteers,&#xD;
      recruited from sexual and reproductive health clinics at Chalmers Centre, will be asked to&#xD;
      provide a single blood test for ClotPro and lab tests, and urine pregnancy test hCG to act as&#xD;
      a nonpregnant comparison. These participants must not be using hormonal contraception and&#xD;
      must not be pregnant. This group will be approached by clinicians working in the SRH clinics&#xD;
      and the researcher will be on hand to obtain consent and then draw blood.&#xD;
