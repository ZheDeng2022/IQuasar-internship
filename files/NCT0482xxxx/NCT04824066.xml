  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this research is to use machine learning analysis of high-resolution&#xD;
      data-collected by wearable technology-of cardiothoracic surgical patients to assess recovery&#xD;
      and detect complications at their earliest stage&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center non-randomized prospective cohort study using wearable devices in&#xD;
      cardiothoracic surgery patients to detect post-operative complications. Patients undergoing&#xD;
      cardiothoracic surgery who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled&#xD;
      consecutively with verbal informed consent from the time this protocol is approved by the IRB&#xD;
      until 1000 subjects are enrolled. At ~30 days preoperatively the subjects will have a&#xD;
      wearable device (such as a Fitbit) placed on their wrist and will wear the device until ~60&#xD;
      days post-operatively. This device will wirelessly transmit data regarding activity and sleep&#xD;
      quality to a smartphone application for the duration of wear and data will be analyzed by our&#xD;
      collaborators at Case Western Reserve University.&#xD;
