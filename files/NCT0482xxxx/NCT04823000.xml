    <textblock>
      An open prospective study with multiple (every 6-12 months) intrathecal or intravenous&#xD;
      injections of autologous MSC in patients with progressive forms of MS (secondary progressive,&#xD;
      primary progressive or relapsing-progressive), who failed to respond to first and second&#xD;
      lines of immunomodulatory treatments and deteriorated (at least 0.5 degree in the EDSS scale)&#xD;
      during the year preceding their inclusion to our study or had at least one major relapse&#xD;
      without sufficient recovery.&#xD;

      An open prospective study with multiple intrathecal or intravenous injections of autologous&#xD;
      MSC in 24 patients with progressive forms of MS (secondary progressive, primary progressive&#xD;
      or relapsing-progressive), who failed to respond to first and second lines of&#xD;
      immunomodulatory treatments and deteriorated (at least 0.5 degree in the EDSS scale) during&#xD;
      the year preceding their inclusion to our study or had at least one major relapse without&#xD;
      sufficient recovery. Patients will be treated with 1x10 million MSC per kg of body weight,&#xD;
      intrathecally and intravenously and subsequently with up to 8 courses of IT- or IV-injections&#xD;
      of MSC (at the same dose), at intervals of 6-12 months. The duration of the trial is 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up every 3 months for the whole duration of the trial, for safety&#xD;
      assessment and changes in the disability scores (EDSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunological analysis will be performed at 4 time points (day 1, month 1, month 3 and month&#xD;
      6) following the first MSC-treatment and will include a fluorescent cell sorter (FACS)&#xD;
      analysis to evaluate the proportions of the lymphocytes expressing markers of immune&#xD;
      activation or of regulatory cell phenotype.&#xD;
