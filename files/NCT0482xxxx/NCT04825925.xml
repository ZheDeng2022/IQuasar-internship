    <description>Bronchial arteriography was performed to find tumor-feeding artery. After the catheter had been inserted into the tumor-feeding artery, the Platinum was infused. BAI (Bronchial Arterial Infusion ) chemotherapy was followed by DEB-BACE(Drug-eluting beads bronchial arterial chemoembolization); the CalliSpheres loaded with Vinorelbine were infused into the tumor-feeding arteries until stasis or near-stasis of blood flow in the vessel was observed.</description>
