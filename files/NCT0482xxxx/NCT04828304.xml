  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the PULSE study is to perform post market clinical follow up (PMCF) on safety&#xD;
      and efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety: To confirm transient short-terms side effects and verify long-term/outstanding&#xD;
           risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Efficacy: To confirm the performance of PLASOMA, i.e. the beneficial effect on bacterial&#xD;
           load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary purpose is to examine the beneficial effects of PLASOMA on wound healing and to&#xD;
      perform a health technology assessment (HTA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study will be an open label two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT),&#xD;
      performed at at least three sites (multi-center) in the Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two arms are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group: Standard wound care for 12 weeks or until healing, whichever occurs&#xD;
           first;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment group: Standard wound care + PLASOMA treatment for 12 weeks or until healing,&#xD;
           whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of PLASOMA treatment will be determined by the treating (para)medical&#xD;
      professional based on the number of visits they would schedule for the standard wound care at&#xD;
      the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all study subjects, the treatment frequency will be at least once per week (in order to&#xD;
      have enough treatments for safety evaluation) and should not exceed once per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up (FU) will be performed at three timepoints for both arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FU1: 2 weeks after end treatment period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FU2: 12 weeks after end treatment period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FU3: 12 months after start treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCL1: have a slow-healing or non-healing ulcer consisting of, but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  diabetic ulcers (Wagner-Meggitt classification system/ University of Texas&#xD;
             classification system: grades 1-3)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  venous ulcers&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pressure ulcers (international NPUAP/EPUAP classification system: categories/stages&#xD;
             II-IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  burn wounds (second and third degree)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  skin grafts and flaps&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  infected post-surgical ulcers. Standard wound care has not resulted in sufficient&#xD;
             healing after at least two weeks (including first line care) and therefore advanced&#xD;
             wound care treatments are necessary as an adjunct therapy to standard wound care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: There is no upper limit for the duration that the wound exists. In case a subject has&#xD;
        multiple wounds that meet the in- and exclusion criteria, the wound with the longest&#xD;
        duration will be chosen for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCL2: have a wound with a wound surface area that matches the size of the plasma area of&#xD;
        the pad, i.e. a maximum diameter of 3 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCL3: have a wound with a minimum wound size of 1 cm2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCL4: are willing and physically able to carry out all study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCL5: have a minimum age of 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCL1: the wound is very exudative, i.e. wounds in which moisture is visible again within a&#xD;
        few minutes after patting dry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCL2: any implanted active electronic device, such as a pacemaker, is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCL3: an electronic medical device is attached to the body, including electronic life&#xD;
        support equipment and insulin pumps. If the sole purpose of the medical device is&#xD;
        monitoring, the subject is not excluded but it should be noted that use of PLASOMA together&#xD;
        with such devices has not been tested and may lead to erroneous operation of the attached&#xD;
        device during PLASOMA treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: no exclusion if electronic medical device will be detached during PLASOMA treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCL4: a metal implant (including stents) in the treatment area, i.e. the area between pad&#xD;
        and electrode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCL5: a conductive connection from outside to inside the body at or near the heart is&#xD;
        present, e.g. a catheter with electrolyte fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCL6: the to-be-treated wound is located on the torso above the navel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCL7: the subject is hospitalized at the time of inclusion or likely to be hospitalized in&#xD;
        the near future (14 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCL8: the subject has had (vascular) surgery related to the to-be-treated wound within the&#xD;
        previous 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCL9: the subject has any known malignant wound degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCL10: the subject receives treatment with immunosuppressive agents or oral&#xD;
        corticosteroids; no exclusion if subject has received a stable dose for at least 2 months&#xD;
        and the oral corticosteroid dose does not exceed 7.5 mg/day prednisone or equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCL11: the subject is receiving or likely to receive advanced wound therapies - such as&#xD;
        negative pressure therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, biologicals (e.g. skin substitutes,&#xD;
        growth factors), electrophysical therapy - until FU1 for the to be-treated wound. Advanced&#xD;
        wound dressings are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCL12: the subject suffers from comorbidity or there are other circumstances (e.g. long&#xD;
        lasting COVID-19 symptoms), which in the investigator's opinion, are likely to compromise&#xD;
        the outcome of the study or the feasibility of the subject fulfilling the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCL13: the subject had a COVID-19 infection (i.e. tested positive for COVID-19 or very&#xD;
        likely infected with COVID-19 but not confirmed by a COVID-19 test) in the past 6 months&#xD;
        (counted from disease onset) and still has persistent symptoms (such as fatigue).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCL14: the subject has epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCL15: the subject is pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCL16: the subject is unable to provide consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCL17: the subject participates in another clinical study.&#xD;
