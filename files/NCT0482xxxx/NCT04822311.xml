    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of an exercise intervention on retired American&#xD;
      professional football (APF) players. A total of 20 retired APF players (â‰¥ 18 years of age),&#xD;
      who suffer from chronic pain, will be enrolled. The study duration for each participants will&#xD;
      be 18 months. Enrolled participants will perform a 18 months exercise intervention which&#xD;
      involves 90 exercise rehabilitation training visits. In addition, participants will also be&#xD;
      tested on various measures of health and function both at baseline (prior to intervention),&#xD;
      at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months (post intervention). All testing and result&#xD;
      interpretation will be performed by trained research personnel. Participants are not&#xD;
      University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) participants; however, study testing visits will&#xD;
      occur at UIC. All exercise intervention training visits will occur at Gh Fitlab.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will give voluntary informed consent to participate in the study. The&#xD;
      study will include 20 retired APF players participating in a 18 month exercise&#xD;
      rehabilitation. The study will consist of 94 visits (4 study testing visits and 90 exercise&#xD;
      visits). Participants will come in for study testing visits at baseline (prior to starting&#xD;
      the exercise program), at 6 months, at 12 months, and at 18 months(after ending the exercise&#xD;
      program). Each of those visits will take about 2-3 hours. All testing done in the 4 test&#xD;
      visits will help assess the participant's cardiovascular and functional responses and/or&#xD;
      changes to the exercise intervention as indicated in the Objectives/Aims Section. The next&#xD;
      section contains a list of the tests that will be performed at each visit. After the initial&#xD;
      baseline visit, participants will come twice weekly, for roughly 1 hour each session, for 6&#xD;
      months (52 visits). From 6-12 months, participants will come once a week, for roughly 1 hour&#xD;
      each session (26 additional visits). From 12-18 months, participants will come twice a month,&#xD;
      for roughly 1 hour sessions (12 visits). All study testing visits will occur at the UIC. All&#xD;
      exercise intervention training visits will occur at Gh Fitlab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Testing Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants agree to be in the study, they will be asked to do the following procedures&#xD;
      at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  participants will be asked to confirm their employment status each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  participants height and weight will be measured and their body mass index (BMI) will be&#xD;
           calculated. Additionally, we will measure body fat composition and lean body mass using&#xD;
           a DEXA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will ask about age, race, years in the APF league, number of concussions, number of&#xD;
           fractures, surgical history, and list of pain medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Waist circumference as well as blood pressure will be measured for general health&#xD;
           markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants exercise limit will be measured with a 1 Repetition Max test (1RM), a timed&#xD;
           8 foot walk down the hallway (if applicable), a timed sit to stand test (sitting and&#xD;
           standing 5 times in a row-if applicable), maximum sit to stands, and a balance test&#xD;
           (standing in 3 different positions for 10 seconds each). These three tests combine to&#xD;
           form a score called a short performance battery score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their strength and frailty will be measured using a grip dynamometer (squeezing a hand&#xD;
           held device as hard as possible in their dominant hand three times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate general health, the PROMIS v.1.1 - Global Health questionnaire will be&#xD;
           administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate mental health and pain intensity, the PROMIS 29 Profile v2.0 will be&#xD;
           administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate quality of life, the SF-36 will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate mental health, specifically depression, the Beck Depression Inventory will&#xD;
           be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate brain anatomy and function, we will be using a quantitative EEG (QEEG), and&#xD;
           a computer program called the Integrated Visual and Auditory Scale (IVA-2). For the&#xD;
           QEEG, a technician will attach discs (electrodes) to the scalp of the participant using&#xD;
           a special adhesive. Sometimes, an elastic cap fitted with electrodes is used instead.&#xD;
           The electrodes are connected with wires to an instrument that amplifies the brain waves&#xD;
           and records them on computer equipment. The electrodes don't transmit any sensations.&#xD;
           They just record brain waves. For the IVA-2, you will perform tasks on a computer that&#xD;
           will test sustained attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the measure of pain and disability, the Numeric Rating Scale and Pain&#xD;
           Catastrophizing Scale will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate fatigue, the Fatigue Severity Index will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will be asked to disclose the number of hospital visits they have had in the last&#xD;
           18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their total weight lifted during their training session will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Training Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial baseline visit, participants will begin their exercise training&#xD;
      intervention which involves:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two days a week of exercise trainings for the first 6 months, and one day a week from&#xD;
           6-12 months. From 12-18 months, participants will then complete two days a month of&#xD;
           exercise training. Each visit will last roughly one hour and will incorporate&#xD;
           approximately 5-10 minute light warm-up plus stretching and then the exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least twice weekly, GH Fitness staff will follow-up with participants via text&#xD;
           message, email or a phone call to evaluate their physical progress and overall health&#xD;
           and energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Weeks 6, 13, 18, 25, 41 and 52 participants will focus on cardio and endurance&#xD;
           exercises. These exercises may include running in place, or using a recumbent&#xD;
           (stationary) bike. All other weeks consist of basic strength training/resistance&#xD;
           workouts.&#xD;

    <description>1. Exercise will positively affect body composition. With this hypothesis we will test whether muscle strength (dynamometer) and muscle mass (DEXA scan) changes after 6 months, 12 months, 18 months of an exercise intervention. Baseline measurement will be performed before the intervention, at 6 months, 12 months, and at the end of the study (18 months) with muscle mass measured by DEXA and strength measured again by dynamometer.</description>

    <description>2. We expect participants will see improvements in their physical abilities after 18 months in the exercise training sessions. This will be assessed by comparing baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months, 8 foot walk, timed sit to stand, and balance testing scores.</description>

    <description>3. Participants enrolled in the exercise intervention will have an overall improved sense of well-being, increased independence, quality of life, and decreased depression.

APF players with chronic pain described as greater than 5 out of a 10 point scale and lasting greater than 12 months, will display alterations in brain wave function consistent with abnormal function of the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) , thalamus (relays motor and sensory signals to the cortex) , brainstem, primary somatosensory cortex (S1, postcentral gyrus of the anterior parietal lobe) and posterior parietal cortex (posterior to the primary somatosensory cortex)</description>
