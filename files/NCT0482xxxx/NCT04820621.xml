  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with chronic kidney diseases. Before&#xD;
      a treatment can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to better&#xD;
      understand its safety and what happens to the drug in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers will investigate how the liver function influences blood&#xD;
      concentrations of runcaciguat in participants with different degrees of liver impairment&#xD;
      compared to participants with normal liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will all take one tablet with 15 mg runcaciguat by mouth. Prior to inclusion&#xD;
      into the study, all participants will have a screening examination within 21 to 2 days prior&#xD;
      to dosing to check eligibility for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, all of the participants will stay at the study site for up to 8 days (from&#xD;
      Day -1 to Day 7), whereby Day 6 and 7 might also be performed in an ambulatory setting. Blood&#xD;
      and urine samples will be collected. The physician will check the participants' heart health&#xD;
      using an electrocardiogram (ECG) and by measuring blood pressure and heart rate. The&#xD;
      participants will answer questions about their wellbeing and taken medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will have a follow-up examination 7 to 11 days after dosing to follow-up&#xD;
      their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be in the study for approximately 5 weeks. The entire study will last&#xD;
      about 9 months.&#xD;
