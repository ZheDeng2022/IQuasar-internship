  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR) and coronary artery disease is common and associated with&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality. Ischemic MR has been traditionally treated surgically&#xD;
      through either valve repair or replacement at the time of concomitant bypass grafting.&#xD;
      Although patients with ischemic MR represent a heterogeneous group, outcomes for these&#xD;
      patients over the intermediate term is poor owing to left ventricle (LV) dysfunction causing&#xD;
      MR and the presence of coronary disease, which portends poor survival. There is an emergence&#xD;
      of percutaneous therapies to treat MR which have been shown to be a less invasive, safe, and&#xD;
      viable approach to treat comorbid patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to treat ischemic MR either surgically or percutaneously is influenced by the&#xD;
      presence of coronary disease and the ability to provide adequate revascularization. Mitral&#xD;
      valve surgery concomitant to surgical revascularization, however, is associated with a&#xD;
      several fold increase in mortality. In fact, the incremental risk increase is further&#xD;
      magnified in high-risk patients. We therefore propose a novel prospective study to guide&#xD;
      intervention for ischemic MR. Patients will be randomized to undergo surgical therapy with&#xD;
      either mitral repair/replacement and/or concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting OR&#xD;
      percutaneous mitral repair, followed by coronary artery bypass grafting.&#xD;
