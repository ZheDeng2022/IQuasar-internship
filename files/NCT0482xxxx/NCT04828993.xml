  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study designed to determine the effect of&#xD;
      tafamidis meglumine on TTR stabilization as well as tafamidis meglumine safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and efficacy in ATTR-PN patients in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 10-15 participants are planned to be enrolled. All enrolled participants will&#xD;
      receive oral tafamidis meglumine 20 mg soft capsules once daily for 48 weeks.&#xD;
