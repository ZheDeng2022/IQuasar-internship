      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety profile of the SP MenB vaccine formulations and the 2 licensed&#xD;
           MenB comparator vaccines in healthy adults, adolescents, toddlers and infants, when&#xD;
           administered alone (Stages 1-4) or concomitantly with MenQuadfiTM (MenACYW conjugate&#xD;
           vaccine) (for Stages 2-4 only), and with age-appropriated routine pediatric vaccines&#xD;
           (for Stages 3-4 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To describe the safety profile of the SP MenB vaccine formulations, Bexsero Vaccine&#xD;
                and Trumenba Vaccine in healthy adults, and adolescents;&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To describe the safety profile of the SP MenB vaccine formulations and Bexsero&#xD;
                Vaccine in toddlers and infants;&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To describe the safety profile of the SP MenB vaccine formulations,&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  when administered alone&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  when administered with MenQuadfiTM (MenACYW conjugate vaccine)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  when administered with routine infant immunizations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune response to the SP MenB vaccine formulations and the 2 licensed&#xD;
           MenB comparator vaccines after the last dose of primary vaccination in healthy adults,&#xD;
           adolescents, toddlers and infants, when administered alone, or concomitantly with&#xD;
           MenQuadfi Vaccine or other routine vaccines, as measured by the serum bactericidal assay&#xD;
           using human complement (hSBA) in the primary panel of MenB strains by Stage, by age&#xD;
           group and by vaccine schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune response to the SP MenB vaccine formulations and the 2 licensed&#xD;
           MenB comparator vaccines at each timepoint in healthy adults, adolescents, toddlers and&#xD;
           infants, when administered alone or concomitantly with MenQuadfi Vaccine or other&#xD;
           routine vaccines as measured by hSBA in the primary panel of MenB strains by Stage by&#xD;
           age group and by vaccine schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune response (breadth of coverage) in the secondary panel of MenB&#xD;
           strains in participants (adults and adolescents) in Stage 1 and 2 after the last dose of&#xD;
           the primary series in each group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the persistence of immune response following primary series at D366, and&#xD;
           immune response 1 month after a booster dose of the SP MenB vaccine given 1-year&#xD;
           post-dose 1 (at D366) in a subset of adults and adolescents in Stage 2 who received SP&#xD;
           MenB vaccine formulations, Bexsero Vaccine or Trumenba Vaccine as measured by hSBA in&#xD;
           the primary panel of MenB strains by age group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune response against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y measured&#xD;
           with hSBA in participants from each agegroup receiving MenQuadfi Vaccine&#xD;

      Study duration per participant will be approximately: 7 months for Stage 1 participants, 12&#xD;
      to 18.5 months for Stage 2 participants, 12 months for Stage 3 participants and 18 months for&#xD;
      Stage 4 participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each vaccine group at each age group (Stage 1, 3 and 4 only), the first 5 participants&#xD;
      enrolled (sentinels) will be assessed via early safety data review (ESDR) as a cohort for the&#xD;
      evaluation of biological safety and overall safety profile for D01-D08 post dose 1. The&#xD;
      safety data collected will be reviewed before proceeding with recruitment of remaining&#xD;
      participants in each study group. Enrollment of remaining participants randomized to each&#xD;
      group will be based on the outcome of the safety assessments of the sentinels: only a&#xD;
      positive review outcome will allow the enrollment of the sentinel cohort of the respective&#xD;
      lower age group.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Stage 1 and Stage 2 (adults and adolescents) will be modified double-blind: the investigators and study staff who conduct the safety assessment and the participant will not know which vaccine is administered. Only the study staff who prepare and administer the vaccine and are not involved with the safety evaluation will know which vaccine is administered. The individual(s) responsible for the preparation / administration of the vaccines will not be authorized to collect any safety or serology data. Testing laboratories will be blinded. In order to maintain the blind in Stage 2 (adults and adolescents), a placebo injection will be used. After the 6-months safety assessment from the last dose of primary vaccination, Stage 2 will be unblinded for the administration of booster vaccinations. Stage 3 and Stage 4 (toddlers and infants) will be open-label.</masking_description>
