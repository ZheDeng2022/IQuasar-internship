      The rationale of this study in UGIB patients is to assess whether the prediction of mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity using AIMS65 score improves when used in combination with RDW in the emergency&#xD;
      department setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UGIB is a ticking time-bomb and emergency physicians are challenged to accurately assess&#xD;
      risk, and aggressively manage patients with gastrointestinal bleeding within the stipulated&#xD;
      time in the confines of emergency department. If not managed properly, it is associated with&#xD;
      high mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various clinical prediction scores help in risk stratifying such patients. Among the scores,&#xD;
      AIMS65 score is the easy to use score and has good mortality predictive accuracy. RDW, once&#xD;
      thought as marker of chronic blood loss has recently been identified as a good prognostic&#xD;
      indicator as well as good predictor of mortality in conditions where there is acute blood&#xD;
      loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both AIMS65 score and RDW value have been used separately as a predictor of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in patients with UGIB. But there are not much studies so far evaluating their&#xD;
      combined role as marker of predicting mortality as well as high risk among UGIB patients.&#xD;
      Hence there is a need for a study to know the predictive value of combination of AIMS6S score&#xD;
      and RDW in patients presenting to ED with symptoms of UGIB not been much studies comparing&#xD;
      the relationship between RDW and upper GI bleed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of this study in UGIB patients is to assess whether the prediction of mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity using AIMS65 score improves when used in combination with RDW in the emergency&#xD;
      department setting.&#xD;

        All adult (&gt;18 years of age) patients presenting with UGIB to the ED of Jubilee Mission&#xD;
        Medical College and Research Institute during the 18 months' time period were included in&#xD;
        the study. The diagnosis of UGIB was based on patients' presentations, including coffee&#xD;
        ground vomitus, hematemesis, melena, and blood in nasogastric aspirate. These patients were&#xD;
        considered eligible for the study.&#xD;
