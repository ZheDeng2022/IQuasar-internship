  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SOCRATES is part of BSC's Post-market surveillance system. The implementation of such systems&#xD;
      is mandatory per local regulations such as the Regulation '(EU) 2017/745 of the European&#xD;
      Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on medical devices' or short Medical Device&#xD;
      Regulation (MDR). The SOCRATES design is therefore based on the BSC's commitment as well as&#xD;
      external regulatory requirements to proactively and systematically gather, record and analyze&#xD;
      relevant data on the quality, performance and safety of devices throughout their entire&#xD;
      lifetime.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SOCRATES is a non-randomized, multisite, single-arm, open-label, global post-market&#xD;
      observational data collection per standard of care. While generally of prospective design, a&#xD;
      limited retrospective element is allowed for the inclusion of patients for a short period of&#xD;
      10 days after their index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOCRATES intends to enroll a number of subjects that will support the analysis of all the&#xD;
      individual PMCF Plans. An average of approximately 100 subjects per year and site on a&#xD;
      continuous basis is expected but may vary depending on the needs of individual PMCF Plans. As&#xD;
      long as SOCRATES is active, there is no upper limit to the total number of subjects that may&#xD;
      be enrolled, and enrollment will be driven by the need to support sample sizes of individual&#xD;
      PMCF plans for given products/product groupings supported by SOCRATES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOCRATES is designed to be a continuous effort after the data collection commences without a&#xD;
      predefined closure timepoint. Data collection and enrollment may be stopped, restarted or&#xD;
      finalized per Sponsor discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected duration of SOCRATES participation for a subject is dependent on&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the specific lifetime of the device (e.g. the battery usage for pulse generators or&#xD;
           continued active use of leads for CRM devices) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the necessary timeframe to adequately assess safety and performance of the device based&#xD;
           on the residual risk assessed for each device in the associated PMCF plan. Timeframes&#xD;
           might e.g. spread from 7 days to one year post procedure for EP. The maximum duration&#xD;
           per enrolled subject will consequently vary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For BSC implantable devices subjects are intended to be followed for the entire time of being&#xD;
      implanted with a BSC device to allow data collection over the lifetime of the device(s) as&#xD;
      required by applicable regulations. A maximum duration per enrolled subject is not defined,&#xD;
      unless locally required. In case a local maximum duration is enforced subjects may be&#xD;
      consented again and re-enrolled for continued participation if they are still in scope for&#xD;
      SOCRATES. Sites shall ensure continuous data collection without any gaps in case a&#xD;
      re-enrollment becomes applicable. Data sets for re-enrolled subjects will be handled as if&#xD;
      the subject was continuously enrolled. This process will ensure to meet the requirement of&#xD;
      MDR for device manufacturers to collect data over the lifetime of the devices.&#xD;
