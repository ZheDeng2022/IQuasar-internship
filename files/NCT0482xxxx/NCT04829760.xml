  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 10-week randomized, controlled study to compare the safety and efficacy of two&#xD;
      common fiber supplements, psyllium and wheat bran in terms of changes in body weight,&#xD;
      nutrition status, and bowel function in patients with Parkinson's Disease who have&#xD;
      constipation symptoms. After a 2-week run-in period, participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive 10 grams daily of psyllium, coarse wheat bran, or maltodextrin (placebo) for 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Nutritional and neurological evaluations will be conducted at the beginning and end of the&#xD;
      8-week intervention period.&#xD;
