  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Locked posterior glenohumeral dislocations with a reverse Hill-Sachs impaction fracture&#xD;
      involving less than 30% of the humeral head are most frequently treated with lesser&#xD;
      tuberosity transfer into the defect, whereas those involving more than 50% undergo humeral&#xD;
      head arthroplasty. Reconstruction of the defect with segmental femoral osteochondral&#xD;
      allografts has been proposed to treat patients between these two ranges, but the&#xD;
      medium-/long-term outcomes of this joint-preserving procedure are controversial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twelve patients with a unilateral locked posterior shoulder dislocation and at least 30%&#xD;
      (mean 31%) impaction of the humeral head were treated with segmental reconstruction of the&#xD;
      defect with fresh-frozen humeral head osteochondral allografts. Patients were assessed&#xD;
      clinically, radiographically and with computed tomography (CT) at a medium follow-up of 66&#xD;
      months (range, 24-225).All twelve shoulders presented a slight limitation in anterior&#xD;
      elevation&#xD;

    <measure>Western Ontario Shoulder Instability index (WOSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WOSI score questionnaire is a tool designed for self-assessment of shoulder function for patients with instability problems</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Constant-Murley score (CS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Constant-Murley score is a 100-points scale composed of a number of individual parameters. These parameters define the level of pain and the ability to carry out the normal daily activities of the patient.The Constant-Murley score was introduced to determine the functionality after the treatment of a shoulder injury. The test is divided into four subscales: pain (15 points), activities of daily living (20 points), strength (25 points) and range of motion: forward elevation, external rotation, abduction and internal rotation of the shoulder (40 points). The higher the score, the higher the quality of the function.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Score (ASES)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Score (ASES) was designed to assess the condition of the shoulder, regardless of disease pathology.&#xD;
The ASES is a composite instrument, requiring both a physician assessment and a patient-completed portion; however, it is commonly presented as solely the patient-reported survey. This includes a section on pain (7 items) and a section on activities of daily living (10 items). Scores range from 0 to 100 with a score of 0 indicating a worse shoulder condition and 100 indicating a better shoulder condition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Samilson-Prieto score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Samilson-Prieto classification system is based on the presence and size of osteophytes and the rate of arthrosis in the uninvolved shoulder reflects the high sensitivity of this system. The prevalence of arthrosis is often reported in long-term follow-ups after trauma or surgery.</description>

    <description>Humeral allograft group 12 patients were surgically treated for a locked posterior glenohumeral dislocation with a humeral head defect affecting at least 30% of the head diameter. During surgery, the bone defect was substituted with a fresh-frozen humeral head osteochondral allograft.Included patients were clinically and radiographically re-evaluated for the purpose of this study by examiners not involved in the primary treatment at a mean of 66 months postoperatively. The clinical examination consisted of a physical examination and structured interview. Computed tomography (CT) was carried out at the medium follow-up of 66 months in all patients to evaluate OA progression and allograft resorption.</description>

    <description>Between 2001 and 2018, a total of 12 consecutive patients were surgically treated for a locked posterior glenohumeral dislocation with a humeral head defect affecting at least 30% of the head diameter.
