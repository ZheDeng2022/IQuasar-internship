    <textblock>
      Well-being is a state defined as the optimal psychological functioning and the experience&#xD;
      associated with it, integrating physical and subjective factors. It has been suggested that&#xD;
      the bidirectional interaction between the brain and the rest of the body is fundamental in&#xD;
      the regulation of wellbeing levels. In particular, the gastrointestinal system (modulated by&#xD;
      the microbiota) sends information that is integrated by the brain, affecting its functioning&#xD;
      and mental processes. However, the mechanism of such communication is still unknown. The aim&#xD;
      of this proposal is to study the different ways in which psychological processes can&#xD;
      influence gut signals and vice versa, and how this relationship might be trained or modified&#xD;
      in order to improve wellbeing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within the field of Psychology and Contemplative Sciences, the relationship and&#xD;
      interdependence between the brain and body have been one of the most prevalent questions when&#xD;
      it comes to understanding the psychobiological mechanisms underlying human behavior. It is&#xD;
      proposed that the brain should be seen as a dynamic, complex, and self-organized system,&#xD;
      which is closely coupled and integrated with whole-body signals, establishing a two-way&#xD;
      communication axis. This has been evidenced through an increase in scientific research&#xD;
      adopting an embodied perspective that considers both diverse brain measurements as well as&#xD;
      signals from other parts of the body, such as the heart and the gastrointestinal system.&#xD;
      Recent pieces of evidence have furthermore begun to reveal the different ways in which&#xD;
      psychological processes can influence the body, and how this could be trained in order to&#xD;
      improve wellness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interoception is a cognitive process developed to monitor the internal state of the body and&#xD;
      it involves the continuous and dynamic integration of information from different (internal)&#xD;
      origins, including respiratory, cardiac, and gastrointestinal systems. New research agendas&#xD;
      have started to link interoception to wellbeing, and with the psychopathology of psychiatric&#xD;
      conditions, from depression and autism to eating disorders. Interestingly, it has been shown&#xD;
      that this ability can be trained through contemplative practices designed to improve body&#xD;
      awareness, socio-affective and socio-cognitive capacity. Moreover, some interoceptive&#xD;
      dimensions like thirst interoception might be affected by lifestyle and habits such as diet.&#xD;
      Altogether, this evidence suggests that understanding the mechanism of brain-body integration&#xD;
      represents a promising alternative to improve wellbeing and mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One example of psychophysical integration that has taken much importance in recent years, due&#xD;
      to its implications on wellbeing and mental health, is the one established between the brain&#xD;
      and the gastrointestinal system. In particular, gut-microbiota research is acquiring special&#xD;
      importance because of its implications in psychological states such as stress and anxiety,&#xD;
      and psychiatric conditions like depression and autism. It has been shown that microbiota&#xD;
      affects brain functioning through different pathways including neural, humoral, and&#xD;
      endocrine. However, the mechanism of brain-gut-microbiota integration and its relationship to&#xD;
      wellbeing is still unknown. The integration of information through large-scale oscillation&#xD;
      coupling has been one of the most validated proposals regarding signal processing and&#xD;
      communication. An oscillatory coupling between the brain and the gastrointestinal system was&#xD;
      recently described, shedding light on a possible mechanism via which the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      system constantly and instantaneously sends information to the brain, which in turn&#xD;
      integrates this information either consciously or unconsciously, thus affecting mental&#xD;
      processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research proposal aims to study how the brain integrates information from the gut&#xD;
      (regulated by the microbiota) and the relevance of this coupling on wellbeing. To do this,&#xD;
      the oscillatory coupling between the electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrogastrogram (EGG)&#xD;
      signals will be recorded and evaluated. EEGs and EGGs will be recorded under different&#xD;
      interventions including training designed to increase interoceptive gastric awareness and&#xD;
      treatment with probiotics to modify some microorganisms that have already been associated&#xD;
      with mental health. The oscillatory coupling will be compared to the well-being observed&#xD;
      after each of the interventions. In this investigation, wellbeing will be defined as optimal&#xD;
      psychological functioning, integrating physical and subjective factors, and will be evaluated&#xD;
      through different self-reported questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions related to improving body awareness and contemplative practices, in general,&#xD;
      are helping to improve the levels of wellness around the world and in Chile, representing an&#xD;
      accessible and cheap way to manage psychological conditions regardless of socioeconomic and&#xD;
      demographic aspects, contributing to the development of new therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
      Additionally, a strong relationship between diet, microbiota, and health has now been&#xD;
      demonstrated. Thus, understanding the mechanism via which the microbiota communicates with&#xD;
      the brain, the susceptibility of this communication to microbiota changes, and the&#xD;
      relationship of this process with participants' diet could provide relevant information when&#xD;
      making decisions related to eating habits and lifestyles.&#xD;

In a second step, a second PCR will be carried out in order to add the primers required for future sequencing. Finally, the results of the amplification will be quantified using qPCR, and will be stored in genomic libraries for subsequent sequencing and bioinformatic analysis [50].

    <description>The brain-gut oscillatory coupling is one outcome that is obtained by measuring the power amplitude of the Electroencephalographic (EEG) and phase of the electrogastrographic (EGG) activity.&#xD;
The Brain-gut oscillatory coupling is obtained by calculating a modulation index between the phase of the EGG slow frequency gastric oscillations (0.05 Hz) and the power amplitude of EEG alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz). The modulation index is a measurement that indicates in which extend the phase of slow gastric oscillations modulate the amplitude of alpha waves For the EEG activity, 64 active electrodes will be positioned on a cap located on the participant's head. For the EGG record, a set of 16 skin electrodes will be positioned on the abdomen as described in Richter, Babo-Rebelo.</description>
