  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress-related ill-health is rated one of the largest health challenges in the western world.&#xD;
      The most empirically supported treatment for stress-related disorders is cognitive behaviour&#xD;
      therapy (CBT), but accessibility is low and most patients in primary care do not receive this&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment. Collaborative care has been shown to be an effective working model&#xD;
      for primary care patients with mental health problems. This type of care intervention has&#xD;
      however not been compared against CBT, which is arguably the gold standard treatment for this&#xD;
      patient group. The overarching purpose of this project is to investigate if implementation of&#xD;
      two treatment models - collaborative care and Internet-based CBT -can be effective as early&#xD;
      interventions for primary care patients with stress-related ill-health.&#xD;

      Stress-related ill-health is rated one of the largest health challenges in the western world.&#xD;
      The most empirically supported treatment for stress-related disorders is cognitive behaviour&#xD;
      therapy (CBT), but accessibility is low and most patients in primary care do not receive this&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment. Collaborative care has been shown to be an effective working model&#xD;
      for primary care patients with mental health problems. In this study collaborative care is&#xD;
      conducted by a nurse who provides the patient with self-management support. This intervention&#xD;
      has been implemented at Gustavsbergs primary care clinic in Stockholm as a means to increase&#xD;
      accessibility and quality of care for the large group of patients with stress-related&#xD;
      ill-health (operationalized as ICD-11 adjustment disorder). This type of care intervention&#xD;
      has however not been compared against CBT, which is arguably the gold standard treatment for&#xD;
      this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research group has developed and tested an Internet-based CBT (ICBT) for stress-related&#xD;
      ill health, which has been shown to be effective and also potentially very suitable for the&#xD;
      primary care context. The overarching purpose of this project is to investigate if&#xD;
      implementation of two treatment models - collaborative care and ICBT - can be effective as&#xD;
      early interventions for primary care patients with stress-related ill-health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main research question: Is a brief collaborative care intervention provided by a nurse at&#xD;
      least as effective as ICBT delivered by a psychologist for primary care patients with mild to&#xD;
      moderate symptoms of stress (ICD-11 adjustment disorder)?&#xD;
