    <textblock>
      Coronary microcirculatory dysfunction has been known to be prevalent even after successful&#xD;
      revascularization of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients.&#xD;
      Microvascular obstruction (MVO) in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is significant prognostic&#xD;
      indicator in STEMI patients after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Although&#xD;
      current gold-standard method to assess microvascular damage or dysfunction in STEMI patients&#xD;
      is CMR and assessment of MVO, previous study presented that index of microcirculatory&#xD;
      resistance (IMR) in culprit vessel of STEMI patients showed significant association with the&#xD;
      presence of MVO in CMR and the risk of cardiac death or heart failure admission.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the need for pressure-temperature sensor wire and hyperemic agents&#xD;
      significantly limits adoption of IMR in daily practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent technical development enabled angiographic derivation of IMR without pressure wire,&#xD;
      hyperemic agents, or thermodilution method. In this regard, the current study will evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility of functional angiography-derived IMR (angio-IMR) in the evaluation of MVO&#xD;
      after successful primary PCI for STEMI.&#xD;

      Coronary microcirculatory dysfunction has been known to be prevalent even after successful&#xD;

      Recent technical development enabled angiographic derivation of IMR without pressure wire,&#xD;
      hyperemic agents, or thermodilution method. In this regard, the current study will evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility of functional angiography-derived IMR (angio-IMR) in the evaluation of MVO&#xD;
      after successful primary PCI for STEMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be derived from the prospective institutional AMI registry of&#xD;
      Samsung Medical Center between December 2007 and July 2014. Main results from this registry&#xD;
      were published elsewhere (PLoS One. 2017 Jan 12;12(1):e0170115 and Sci Rep. 2019 Jul&#xD;
      4;9(1):9646). In this registry, 515 consecutive patients who presented with acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and underwent CMR were prospectively enrolled. AMI was defined as evidence of&#xD;
      myocardial injury (defined as elevation of cardiac troponin values, with at least one value&#xD;
      above the 99th percentile upper reference limit) with necrosis in a clinical setting,&#xD;
      consistent with myocardial ischemia. Among the total patients, STEMI patients (n = 332),&#xD;
      whose electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation more than 1 mm in two or more contiguous&#xD;
      leads or a presumably new-onset left bundle branch block, will be analyzed for the current&#xD;
      study. For the study purpose, patients with failed primary PCI (n=1), treated by medical&#xD;
      treatment alone without PCI (n=4), and no available coronary angiographic images (n=3) will&#xD;
      be excluded. Among the remaining 324 patients, functional coronary angiography core&#xD;
      laboratory (Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Shanghai, China) evaluated the&#xD;
      quality of angiographic images and additionally exclude patients with insufficient image&#xD;
      quality for angio-IMR calculation (n=37). All patients also underwent baseline and 1-year&#xD;
      follow-up echocardiography. The Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center approved&#xD;
      this study, and all patients provided written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association of Angio-IMR with CMR-derived quantitative parameters (extent of MVO, infarct&#xD;
      size, area at risk) and qualitative parameter (presence of MVO) will be analyzed. The&#xD;
      discrimination ability of angio-IMR to predict the presence of MVO in CMR will be compared&#xD;
      with conventional angiographic measures of culprit vessel reperfusion (TIMI flow grade,&#xD;
      myocardial blush grade).&#xD;
