  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pediatric&#xD;
      formulations of TRIUMEQ (dolutegravir [DTG] 5 milligrams [mg]/abacavir [ABC] 60 mg/lamivudine&#xD;
      [3TC] 30 mg) dispersible tablets and DOVATO (DTG 5 mg/3TC 30 mg) dispersible tablets in&#xD;
      healthy adult participants. Additionally, safety and tolerability of these formulations will&#xD;
      also be assessed. TRIUMEQ and DOVATO are registered trademarks of GlaxoSmithKline group of&#xD;
