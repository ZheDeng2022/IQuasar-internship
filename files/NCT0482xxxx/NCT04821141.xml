  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women at risk for development of breast cancer and experiencing vasomotor menopausal symptoms&#xD;
      (hot flashes) will be randomized to bazedoxifene (BZA) plus conjugated estrogens (CE) for 6&#xD;
      months versus a wait list control. Two risk factors for development of breast cancer will be&#xD;
      studied pre-study and after 6 months: fibroglandular volume (FGV) on mammogram as assessed by&#xD;
      Volpara software and proliferation by Ki-67 immunocytochemistry in benign breast tissue&#xD;
      acquired by random periareolar fine needle aspiration (RPFNA). Change in biomarkers will be&#xD;
      compared between groups.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase IIB trial of 6 months of BZA 20 mg +CE 0.45 mg (subsequently designated as BZA+CE) vs a&#xD;
      waitlist control. Trial is informed by prior results of a single arm trial that used Duavee®&#xD;
      (combination of BZA+CE that is FDA-approved for relief of hot flashes). Since Duavee® is&#xD;
      currently not available commercially, the two separate components are used instead. Breast&#xD;
      imaging, benign breast tissue by RPFNA, and blood for biomarkers will be obtained at baseline&#xD;
      and at 6 months using similar assessment techniques. The primary endpoint is the difference&#xD;
      between the BZA+CE and control groups for absolute change from baseline to 6 months in the&#xD;
      risk biomarker fibroglandular volume (FGV). Volpara® fully automated assessments overcome the&#xD;
      interpretive variance inherent in subjective assessments. Additional endpoints include&#xD;
      changes in benign breast epithelial immunolabeling for Ki-67, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα),&#xD;
      progesterone receptor (PR), and anterior gradient-2 protein (AGR2); and systemic levels of&#xD;
      bioavailable hormones, IGF-1, IGFBP3, and measures of insulin sensitivity. The modifying&#xD;
      effects of baseline BMI, visceral adipose, and plasma BZA concentrations on markers will be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current vasomotor symptoms (hot-flashes, night sweats or both). These do not need to&#xD;
             be frequent or severe, but should occur at least once a week. Women who feel that they&#xD;
             would likely need a supplement or be at high risk of withdrawal if they were&#xD;
             randomized to waitlist because of vasomotor symptoms are not good candidates for this&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Menopause status: late menopause transition (have missed 2 periods within past 12&#xD;
             months) or postmenopausal (no periods for 12 months or more) with an intact functional&#xD;
             uterus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intact Functional Uterus: have missed at least 2 periods in the past 12 months in the&#xD;
             absence of a Mirena IUD or oral contraceptives which suppress menses.&#xD;

          -  BRCA1/2 deleterious mutation (these women should have both of their ovaries and&#xD;
             fallopian tubes removed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pleomorphic LCIS, DCIS, prior invasive breast, uterine or ovarian cancer (estrogen&#xD;

             renal function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women are sufficiently distressed by their vasomotor symptoms, such that they do not&#xD;
             believe they would be able to remain on study for 6 months without additional&#xD;
             medications if their hot flashes were not relieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition or intercurrent illness that in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
             makes the woman a poor candidate for RPFNA or treatment with BZA+CE.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current anticoagulant use (must have discontinued for 3 weeks prior to FNA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking oral or transdermal systemic hormones within two months (eight weeks) prior to&#xD;
             baseline blood, imaging studies or RPFNA.&#xD;

             blood imaging or RPFNA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria for Intervention Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BIRADs Class I-III mammogram suitable for assessment by Volpara® software, and&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For women with very large breasts: the entire breast must be able to be captured in&#xD;

             clinical report is sent to KUMC (pdf format is acceptable) and the investigator may&#xD;
             proceed with RPFNA and additional screening. However, the raw imaging file (DICOM&#xD;
             format) must still be received in KUMC central repository prior to stratification and&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;

          -  RPFNA specimen must be received at KUMC in good condition and cellular enough to&#xD;
             provide a minimum of 500 epithelial cells on slide(s); but there is no requirement for&#xD;
