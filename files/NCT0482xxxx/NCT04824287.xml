    <textblock>
      Sample of study was calculated as 32 using G*Power Software (ver. 3.1.9.2) for 80% power and&#xD;
      medium effect size (f=0.25) at 95% confidence level in line with the data of Lin et al.&#xD;
      Participants were assigned to the experimental and control groups by the stratified block&#xD;
      randomization method. The locks were assigned to layers using Microsoft Excel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individuals in the experimental group received pelvic floor muscle exercises training&#xD;
      from the researcher using the Roy Adaptation Model in addition to routine discharge training.&#xD;
      The patients received a PFME training booklet prepared by the researcher. Face-to-face&#xD;
      training was given to the individuals in the experimental group on the day before the&#xD;
      operation, on the second and third postoperative days, and on the day of discharge. The&#xD;
      training continued with phone calls at the first, second and third weeks and the first,&#xD;
      second, third, and sixth months after the surgery. Data was collected a day before discharge,&#xD;
      first, second, third, and sixth months after the surgery.&#xD;
