  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial was conducted to assess the effects of platelets-rich fibrin&#xD;
      (PRF) and ozonated oil on the healing of palatal donor wound sites and the patient's&#xD;
      morbidity after free gingival graft (FGG) harvesting&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many surgical techniques have been suggested to enhance the width of keratinized tissue&#xD;
      either by free gingival grafts (FGGs) or by sub-epithelial connective tissue grafts. FGG is&#xD;
      easy to carry out and qualify the harvest of large quantities of connective tissues (CT).&#xD;
      Contrariwise, it produces a site of secondary intention wound healing with discomfort and&#xD;
      pain. Excessive post-operative morbidity has been reported in the literature as a possible&#xD;
      complication of harvesting a FGG; different procedures with primary-intention healing have&#xD;
      been proposed to overcome this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) membrane to coat the fresh wound may accelerate the&#xD;
      process of healing by providing a more stable rigid fibrin mesh, which is better than a blood&#xD;
      clot and supplying a sustained release of growth factors promoting rapid hemostasis at the&#xD;
      FGG donor site. PRF is a platelet concentrate obtained by inexpensive and simple procedure&#xD;
      that does not need biochemical blood handling, it promotes efficient neovascularization,&#xD;
      hastened wound closure and rapid cicatricial tissue remodeling through its three-dimensional&#xD;
      fibrin meshwork. PRF owing its energizing effect on wound healing as it provides a superb&#xD;
      scaffold for epithelialization and angiogenesis together with the presence of many growth&#xD;
      factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor and fibroblast&#xD;
      growth factor (FGF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently, most of researches in dental field using either ozone gas only, dissolved in water&#xD;
      (ozonated water) or in plant oils such as olive oil (ozonated oil), focusing on its excellent&#xD;
      antimicrobial efficacy, enhancement of wound healing in oral cavity without the possibility&#xD;
      of drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral wound healing is a dynamic process and complex phenomenon involving series overlapping&#xD;
      stages of restoring tissue and cellular structures. Cellular and biochemical events in wound&#xD;
      healing can be divided into several phases: inﬂammation, granulation tissue formation, matrix&#xD;
      formation, re-epithelialization and tissue remodeling. Epithelial healing or&#xD;
      re-epithelialization is an important process that involves the interactions between&#xD;
      keratinocytes and extracellular matrix upon which cells migrate, proliferate and&#xD;
      differentiate, hence restoring tissue function and structure. The rate of re-epithelization&#xD;
      is considered as one of the criteria that reflect the influence of PRF and ozonated oil on&#xD;
      healing of wound sites.&#xD;

    <description>The PRF was prepared according to Choukroun et al. [5] immediately before surgery, a 10 ml blood sample was taken by venipuncture of the antecubital vein without anticoagulant. The tubes were centrifuged immediately by a dedicated centrifuge at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes.&#xD;
A structured fibrin clot was produced by such preparation protocol in the middle of the tube, with the erythrocytes at the bottom and acellular plasma at the top. Following elimination of acellular plasma, a sterile scissors was used to separate the PRF from the erythrocytes. A membrane of PRF was formed by squeezing it gently between two pieces of gauze. Folding of the membrane was performed to achieve the required thickness (1.0 mm) with accurate trimming to match the palatal wound. The obtained membrane was then placed at the palatal donor site and compressed with gauze. Then, it was secured with 3-0 black plaited silk and a stent was placed.</description>

    <description>the palatal wounds in control group were managed by compressing the donor site with gauze and periodontal pack was placed. Patients in control group used a soft stent to protect the palatal donor wound site . Patients were instructed firmly not to shatter the stent for 1 week. The stent was removed and reseated only by the operator during the application of medications and collection of smears. One week postoperatively, the protective stents were discontinued.</description>

    <description>All patients in ozone group were asked to visit the clinic on a daily basis through the first week and have their allocated therapeutic medication applied to their particular palatal donor site wounds. The wounds were coated with 2 ml ozonated oil per day, with a concentration of 15 µg of ozone/ml of olive oil. Moreover, palatal wounds in control group were managed by compressing the donor site with gauze and periodontal pack was placed. Patients in ozone group used a soft stent to protect the palatal donor wound site and to retain the tested oils in the post harvested palatal wounds. Patients were instructed firmly not to shatter the stent for 1 week. The stent was removed and reseated only by the operator during the application of medications and collection of smears. One week postoperatively, the protective stents were discontinued.</description>
