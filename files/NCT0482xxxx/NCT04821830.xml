      Parkinson disease (PD) is a common disorder in which reduced speed of movement results from&#xD;
      inadequate brain production of the chemical dopamine. The most effective treatment for PD is&#xD;
      the drug levo-dopa, which partially replaces brain dopamine. Despite decades of successful&#xD;
      use, how levo-dopa improves speed of movement in PD is not understood. This observational&#xD;
      study recruits participants who have been prescribed levo-dopa by their treating physicians.&#xD;
      Before their first dose, immediately after their first dose and later, when their dose has&#xD;
      been stabilized, they will engage with the research team to participate in a few simple&#xD;
      experiments to measure speed, grip strength, tremor, and stability (on and off of treatment).&#xD;
      The purpose of these experiments is to understand how levo-dopa treatment in Parkinson&#xD;
      disease enhances movement speed. An important but not understood component of levo-dopa&#xD;
      action, the Long Duration Response (LDR), lasts for days to weeks. A basic function of&#xD;
      dopamine signaling in the brain is modulation of motivation - the coupling between effort and&#xD;
      action values. These experiments will determine if the LDR is associated with relative&#xD;
      normalization of motivation function in the brain. The motivation behavior of recently&#xD;
      diagnosed PD participants will be examined before and after treatment with levo-dopa to&#xD;
      determine if the magnitude of the LDR is correlated with improvements in motivation behavior.&#xD;

      Dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) is the standard symptomatic treatment for early to&#xD;
      moderate Parkinson disease (PD). In early to moderate PD, the most important DRT component is&#xD;
      the Long Duration Response (LDR), a pharmacodynamic effect that builds up over the course of&#xD;
      days-weeks and can be induced by dopamine agonists. Despite its effectiveness, DRT actions&#xD;
      are poorly understood and the basis of the LDR is unknown. As the LDR wanes in advancing&#xD;
      disease, PD patients develop troublesome motor fluctuations and increasing disability.&#xD;
      Improved understanding of the LDR has the potential to prolong the duration of its effects&#xD;
      and could have a significant positive effect on clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The kinetics of the LDR suggest long-term plastic changes in striatal function. Recent&#xD;
      studies of striatal dopamine actions in PD subjects and experimental animals indicate that&#xD;
      striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission regulates &quot;vigor,&quot; the force, velocity, or amplitude&#xD;
      of actions. Vigor is closely allied to the concept that striatal dopaminergic&#xD;
      neurotransmission mediates motivation, which involves the assessment of act utility and the&#xD;
      appropriate scaling of actions to perceived rewards. Recent theoretical and experimental&#xD;
      results suggest that tonic striatal dopamine signaling, mimicked by dopamine agonist&#xD;
      administration, is a key determinant of movement vigor. Convergent clinical pharmacologic and&#xD;
      experimental data lead to a strong hypothesis that the LDR results from chronic DRT partially&#xD;
      restoring motivational coupling of effort to perceived reward and movement vigor. Prior&#xD;
      experiments examining vigor in PD subjects did not take the LDR into account, resulting in&#xD;
      incomplete examinations of the role of vigor deficits in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent non-human primate work on the control and vigor of saccadic eye movements indicates&#xD;
      the existence of basal ganglia circuit changes that stably encode motor action values for&#xD;
      prolonged periods. Striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission is critical for establishing this&#xD;
      remarkably stable form of value-action coupling. This phenomenon is a plausible circuit level&#xD;
      mechanism underlying the LDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long-term goal is to understand the clinically relevant actions of DRT. The primary&#xD;
      objective of our proposal is to test the hypothesis that the LDR results from partial&#xD;
      restoration of normal action vigor by reinstating the link between motivation and effort. Our&#xD;
      secondary objective is to explore potential mechanisms underlying the LDR. The rationale for&#xD;
      these experiments is that better understanding of the LDR, a clinically crucial component of&#xD;
      DRT action, will lead to improved symptomatic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study recently diagnosed PD subjects. All subjects will undergo standard evaluations&#xD;
      of clinical, cognitive, and motivational features. Subjects will perform incentive motivation&#xD;
      tasks assessing movement vigor in response to monetary incentives. Two complementary tasks,&#xD;
      one based on modulation of movement velocity and one based on modulation of grip strength,&#xD;
      will be employed. To assess whether the recently described stable action-value coupling for&#xD;
      saccades is relevant to the LDR, subjects will perform a task that measures saccadic eye&#xD;
      movement vigor in response to stable value signals learned prior to LDR induction. Subjects&#xD;
      will perform all tasks before and after LDR induction in both the &quot;practical off&quot; and&#xD;
      post-acute treatment states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To use incentive motivation tasks to evaluate the coupling between motivation&#xD;
      and movement vigor in recently treated PD subjects before and after LDR induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1A: LDR induction will result in partial restoration of movement vigor in response&#xD;
      to monetary incentives in PD subjects in the &quot;practical off&quot; state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1B: The magnitude of partially restored movement vigor in response to monetary&#xD;
      incentives will correlate with reduced bradykinesia in PD subjects in the &quot;practical off&quot;&#xD;
      state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1C: Identical effects will be found with an incentive motivation task based on&#xD;
      movement amplitude and one based on grip strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To use a saccadic eye movement task to assess saccadic eye movement vigor in&#xD;
      response to stable value signals in recently treated PD subjects before and after LDR&#xD;
      induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: LDR induction will result in partial restoration of saccadic eye movement vigor&#xD;
      in response to previously learned stable value signals in PD subjects in the &quot;practical off&quot;&#xD;
      state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation of our hypotheses would have considerable impact by identifying a specific&#xD;
      functional process underlying the LDR and a potential mechanism of the LDR. This will&#xD;
      facilitate research into LDR mechanisms, provide a rational basis for developing valid animal&#xD;
      models of the LDR, and open a new path towards improved symptomatic management of PD.&#xD;
