    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled clinical study. Indications:&#xD;
      Glioblastoma diagnosed after surgery (WHO grade IV). The patient received conventional&#xD;
      postoperative concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy, or neoadjuvant temozolomide combined&#xD;
      with concurrent increased intensity-modulated radiotherapy. According to data from previous&#xD;
      clinical trials, conventional doses of concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy PFS 6.9&#xD;
      months neoadjuvant temozolomide combined with concurrently increased intensity-modulated&#xD;
      radiotherapy PFS 13.7 months, an estimated 20% leakage rate, and a total sample size of 80&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <description>1. New auxiliary TMZ period: oral TMZ 75mg/m2, qd, continued until the beginning of radiotherapy. 2. Concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy period: 4 weeks in total. Prior to treatment, radiotherapy positioning and planning were established, using SIB-IMRT technology, the irradiation range, the tumor residual area 60Gy/20f/4w, the tumor bed area 40Gy/20f/4w, 1 time/d, 5 times/w. During radiotherapy, TMZ will continue to be administered orally simultaneously, the specific dose: TMZ 75mg/m2 qd, until 42 days. 3. Intermediate rest period: 4 weeks in total. ;4. TMZ adjuvant chemotherapy period: 6 to 12 months in total. Cycle 1: TMZ 150mg/m2, d1-5, q28d; if the patient can tolerate it, cycles 2-12: TMZ 200mg/m2, d1-5, q28d; after cycles 3, 6, 9, and 12 of adjuvant chemotherapy Head functional magnetic resonance examination was performed to assess the size of residual lesions and edema.</description>

Intermediate rest period: 4 weeks in total. The patient will go to the hospital to recheck blood routine every week;3. TMZ adjuvant chemotherapy period: 6 to 12 months in total. Cycle 1: TMZ 150mg/m2, d1-5, q28d; if the patient can tolerate it, cycles 2-12: TMZ 200mg/m2, d1-5, q28d; head functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed after adjuvant chemotherapy in cycles 3, 6, 9, and 12 to assess the size of residual lesions and edema.</description>
