      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent neurobiological&#xD;
      brain disorders. Diagnosis of ADHD in adults is complex and subjective. Recent studies give&#xD;
      further support for the involvement of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmitters in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of ADHD. Studies show that glutamate (Glu) and GABA change according to&#xD;
      stimulant treatment. Measuring modulations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of Glu and&#xD;
      GABA may help to explore the pathophysiology of ADHD and give a diagnostic biomarker tool for&#xD;
      ADHD in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize Glu and GABA levels in the ACC, by using the proton Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Spectroscopy ([1H]MRS) system in adults with ADHD compared to healthy control subjects (HCS),&#xD;
      before and after stimulant treatment, and to correlate between Glu and GABA levels and&#xD;
      clinical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADHD adults ages 18-40 years (N= 35), and HCS (N= 25), will fill out a DSMV and ASRS&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spectroscopic analyses will be done using 1H MRS (3T) in ADHD adults, before and after&#xD;
      stimulant treatment (Methylphenidate /Mixed Amphetamine salts) in an open-label fashion as&#xD;
      compared to HCS. Proton spectra will be acquired from the ACC.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We hypothesize that brain Glu and GABA levels and/or their ratio involved in ADHD&#xD;
           pathology&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Glu and GABA levels and/or their ratio will be affected by medical treatment in ADHD&#xD;
           group&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Alteration of Glu and GABA and/or their ratios, before and after treatment, will&#xD;
           correlate with clinical response to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize changes in Glu and GABA levels in the ACC of adults with ADHD compared to the&#xD;
      healthy subjects To characterize Glu and GABA levels in the ACC of adults with ADHD before&#xD;
      and 1.5 hrs. after stimulant treatment using 1H MRS system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the correlation between Glu and GABA levels in ADHD patients (before and after&#xD;
      medical treatment) and clinical symptoms as assessed by ASRS and DSMV and/or NeuroTrax&#xD;
      Braincare computerized test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective observational, open-label, comparative study that is approved by the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Maccabi Healthcare services and the Ethical Committee of&#xD;
      Tel Aviv University, in collaboration with the Weizmann Institute of Science. Medically&#xD;
      healthy ADHD adults of ages 18-40 years (N= 35), and matched HCS (N= 25) will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure ADHD Participants will be enrolled from the Maccabi database. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      enrolled as a Control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-assessment questionnaires including epidemiologic data, DSMV, and Adult ADHD&#xD;
           Self-Report Scale (ASRS) will be filled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detailed explanation will be given of the trial objectives, trial methods and risks or&#xD;
           possible discomfort that may result from an MRI/MRS examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During screening, subjects will receive information regarding the study, including&#xD;
           general eligibility criteria, study design, procedures and duration. Subjects will have&#xD;
           the opportunity to ask questions and will undergo an informed consent procedure.&#xD;
           Subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. The participant will&#xD;
           sign an informed consent form and will receive a copy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening, participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to the center&#xD;
      for Computational Neuroimaging at Weizmann Institute of Science to perform the MRS scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADHD patients will be instructed not to take medication for at least 72 hours prior to their&#xD;
      arrival and will be asked to bring their medical drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will go through spectroscopic analyses using 1H MRS (at 3 Tesla) Control&#xD;
      group participants will go through MRS once and complete their study. Adults with ADHD will&#xD;
      repeat MRS screening, 1.5 hours after taking their medical treatment (Methylphenidate /Mixed&#xD;
      Amphetamine salts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medically healthy adults diagnosed with ADHD (men and women) ages 18-40 years (N= 35),&#xD;
      treated with Amphetamines (Mixed Amphetamine salts (Attent) or short-acting methylphenidate&#xD;
      (Ritalin)) will be enrolled from the Maccabi database. Matched HCS (N= 25) volunteers ages&#xD;
      18-40 years, who did not report ADHD or any other illness or medical conditions, and who do&#xD;
      not take chronic medications, will be enrolled from the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale and DSMV questionnaire will be used to determine ADHD&#xD;
      symptoms in both groups.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Sharing of data generated by this project is an essential part of our proposed activities and will be carried out in several different ways. We would wish to make our results available both to the community of scientists interested in ADHD and the biology to avoid unintentional duplication of research. Conversely, we would welcome collaboration with others who could make use of the H-MRS protocols developed in psychiatric disease. Any patient-level data that is shared will be anonymized to protect personally identifiable information.</ipd_description>
