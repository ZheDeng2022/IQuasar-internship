      In this pretest-posttest, randomized controlled study, the effect of the empowerment program&#xD;
      developed based on Roy Adaptation on the healthy lifestyle behaviors, self-esteem and social&#xD;
      media addiction of nursing students will be examined. The hypothesis of this study is that&#xD;
      the empowerment program based on Roy Adaptation Model reduces Social Media Addiction,&#xD;

      The universe of this study was composed of 411 nursing students studying at Mersin&#xD;
      University's faculty of nursing.The data were collected using the Bergen Social Media&#xD;
      Addiction Scale from 384 nursing students who accepted to participate in the study between 09&#xD;
      January 2020 - 09 March 2020.From the scale developed by Andresan et al in 2017 and adapted&#xD;
      to Turkish by Demirci in 2019, 110 nursing students who scored 3 or more out of at least 4&#xD;
      out of 6 items or scored 18 or more out of the total score constituted the sample of the&#xD;
      study.110 nursing students were assigned to the experimental and control groups (55&#xD;
      experimental and 55 control groups) by block randomization.7 separate focus group sessions&#xD;
      were held online between 01 September 2020 - 01 October 2020 with 55 student nurses in the&#xD;
      experimental group. Using the literature and data obtained from the first stage of the study&#xD;
      (analysis of focus group sessions), a strengthening program based on the Roy Adaptation Model&#xD;
      was made.The necessary corrections and additions were made to the program by obtaining expert&#xD;
      opinions from field experts regarding the program created. Empowerment program based on Roy&#xD;
      Adaptation Model will be applied to 55 student nurses in the experimental group between 01&#xD;
      February 2021 - 01 May 2021 through online group sessions. The Bergen Social Media Addiction&#xD;
      Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors Scale, which were applied&#xD;
      as a pre-test in the first session of the application, will be applied as a post-test in the&#xD;
      12th session.&#xD;

    <description>The scale is answered according to five-point Likert-type grading ranging from (1) very rare to (5) very frequent. The total score of the scale varies between 6-30. As the scores obtained from the scale increase, the level of social media addiction also increases.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Healthy lifestyle evaluated using the Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from before implementation and 12th week of practice.</time_frame>
    <description>The rating is in the form of a 4-point Likert. It is accepted as never (1), sometimes (2), often (3), regularly (4). For the whole scale, the lowest score is 52, the highest score is 208. While the maximum points that can be obtained from the sub-dimensions of health responsibility, nutrition, spiritual development and interpersonal relations are 36, the minimum points are 9. While the maximum scores from physical activity and stress management sub-dimensions are 32, the minimum scores are 8. The high score obtained from the Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors Scale indicates that the individual has more positive health behaviors in his life.</description>

    <description>The score obtained from the scale varies between 0-30. The higher the score, the higher the self-esteem. Thirty points are considered as self-esteem at the maximum level, 15-25 as normal self-esteem, and below 15 points as decreased self-esteem.</description>
