  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial will be conducted to study the&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of blue light combined with corticoid treatment in the preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative period of keloid removal surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Keloid scars are characterized by the excessive proliferation of fibroblasts and an imbalance&#xD;
      between the production and degradation of collagen, leading to its buildup in the dermis.&#xD;
      Although the genesis of this condition is not yet fully clarified, keloids are known to have&#xD;
      a genetic component and are related to an increase in the expression of transforming growth&#xD;
      factor beta (TGF-β). There is no &quot;gold standard&quot; treatment and recurrence is frequent.&#xD;
      Therefore, novel treatment options are needed. In vitro studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      photobiomodulation (PBM) reduces the multiplication velocity and quantity of fibroblasts as&#xD;
      well as the expression of TGF-β. This is a low-cost, noninvasive therapy with no side effects&#xD;
      that has proved to be a good tool to complement the most established treatment. Therefore,&#xD;
      the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of blue light combined with corticoid&#xD;
      treatment in the preoperative and postoperative period of keloid removal surgery. A&#xD;
      randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial will be conducted involving two groups:&#xD;
      1) Sham (N = 29): intralesional administration of corticoid (IAC) and sham PBM in the&#xD;
      preoperative and postoperative periods of keloid removal surgery; and 2) active PBM combined&#xD;
      with IAC (N = 29) in the preoperative and postoperative periods of keloid removal surgery.&#xD;
      Transcutaneous PBM will be performed on the keloid in the preoperative period and on the&#xD;
      remaining scar in the postoperative period using blue LED (470 nm, 0,4W, 24J per point on 10&#xD;
      linear points, total 240J). The patients will answer two questionnaires: one for the&#xD;
      assessment of quality of life (Qualifibro-UNIFESP) and one for the assessment of satisfaction&#xD;
      with the scar (PSAQ). The team of plastic surgeons will answer the Vancouver Scar Scale&#xD;
      (VSS). All questionnaires will be administered one, three, six, and twelve months&#xD;
      postoperatively. The keloids will be molded in silicone prior to the onset of treatment and&#xD;
      prior to excision to assess pre-treatment and post-treatment size. The same will be performed&#xD;
      for the remaining scar at one, three, six, and twelve months postoperatively. The removed&#xD;
      keloid will be sent for histopathological analysis for the determination of the quantity of&#xD;
      fibroblasts, the organization and distribution of collagen (picrosirius staining), and the&#xD;
      expression of TGF-β. All data will be submitted to statistical analysis.&#xD;
