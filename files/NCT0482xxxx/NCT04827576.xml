    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of magrolimab + docetaxel combination therapy in solid tumors (Safety&#xD;
      Run-in Cohort 1, Phase 2 Cohorts 1a,&#xD;
&#xD;
      1b, and 1c) and to evaluate the efficacy of magrolimab + docetaxel combination therapy in&#xD;
      solid tumors as determined by investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) (Phase 2&#xD;
      Cohorts 1a, 1b, and 1c)&#xD;

      This study will consist of a Safety Run-in Cohort 1 (magrolimab + docetaxel combination).&#xD;
      After completion of the Safety Run-in Cohort 1, Phase 2 Cohort 1 will occur as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 Cohort 1: a cohort of participants with solid tumors (metastatic non-small cell&#xD;
           lung cancer (mNSCLC) (Phase 2 Cohort 1a), metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) (Phase 2&#xD;
           Cohort 1b), and metastatic small cell lung cancer (mSCLC) (Phase 2 Cohort 1c).&#xD;
