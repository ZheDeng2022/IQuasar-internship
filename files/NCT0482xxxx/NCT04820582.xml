  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a chronic disease that affects one out of 10 women. Endometriosis care is&#xD;
      full of variation. Recommendations for optimal management vary between clinician and centers.&#xD;
      One way of dealing with this unwanted variation is the shift towards a value -based&#xD;
      endometriosis care. Value-based healthcare (VBHC) is a strategy focused on the optimization&#xD;
      of the balance between outcomes that are important to patients and cost to achieve these&#xD;
      outcomes. To do so, for a given condition it is important to define a standardized set of&#xD;
      outcomes metrics allowing quality of care monitoring and comparison in order to optimize&#xD;
      clinical practices and patient pathways. A common set of outcomes combining clinical outcomes&#xD;
      (Clinical Reported Outcome Measures, CROMs) as well as quality of life and functional&#xD;
      recovery indicators through Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). Different standardized&#xD;
      data sets have already been developed to measure outcomes in other pathologies, however a&#xD;
      standardized set of outcome measurements have not yet been determined for endometriosis. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to determine a standard set of outcome measurements for&#xD;
      endometriosis.&#xD;
