  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced prostate cancer are often treated with the chemotherapy drug&#xD;
      docetaxel. The manufacturers of this drug suggest using the same dose of drug per mÂ² body&#xD;
      surface area for all patients. However we know that individuals end up with more or less of&#xD;
      the drug circulating in their blood even after they have been given the same dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A software program (a &quot;Dosing Tool&quot;) has been developed to provide information to doctors on&#xD;
      how docetaxel will affect individual patients. The program may help doctors to make informed&#xD;
      decisions about exactly how much drug to give to different people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the PARTNER study is to gather information from blood tests on patients being&#xD;
      treated with docetaxel to help in the further development of the Dosing Tool. Some of these&#xD;
      blood tests would have been taken anyway as part of patients' routine treatment. Others are&#xD;
      extra for this study. Apart from the additional blood tests, everyone who enters the study is&#xD;
      treated just as they would normally be if they were not taking part in the study.&#xD;
