    <textblock>
      The MiMBa (Malaria in Mothers and Babies) Pregnancy Registry aims to generate robust evidence&#xD;
      on the safety of a range of antimalarials when used in pregnancy, particularly in the first&#xD;
      trimester. This will be a multi-country observational study and will be deployed in several&#xD;
      field sites in Africa.&#xD;

      Background:There is often no, or limited, safety data on drug use in early pregnancy and&#xD;
      particularly for drugs targeting tropical diseases because these are not widely used in&#xD;
      resource-rich countries with robust pharmacovigilance systems. It is critical to develop&#xD;
      surveillance systems to assess the safety of these drugs in pregnancy. Malaria in pregnancy&#xD;
      requires prompt and effective treatment to prevent adverse health consequences for the mother&#xD;
      and her unborn baby. Malaria infection in the first trimester has been associated with&#xD;
      miscarriage, preterm birth and low birth weight. Pregnant women in the first trimester are&#xD;
      often inadvertently treated with the same antimalarials as provided to the adult population&#xD;
      which is a concern for drugs which are contraindicated in early pregnancy, such as&#xD;
      artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs). This occurs either because they are not aware or do&#xD;
      not report that they are pregnant, or because quinine, the standard of care for malaria&#xD;
      treatment in the first trimester is not available. There is limited data available about the&#xD;
      safety of ACTs in early pregnancy. Investigators will develop a pregnancy registry for&#xD;
      monitoring the safety of antimalarial drugs during pregnancy with a focus on the first&#xD;
      trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Aim: The aim of the pregnancy registry is to generate robust data on the safety of a&#xD;
      range of antimalarials in pregnancy and particularly use in the first trimester to inform&#xD;
      regulators and policymakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods in Brief: Investigators will set-up a pregnancy exposure registry for antimalarial&#xD;
      drugs to capture safety data from women inadvertently exposed to (i.e. treated with)&#xD;
      antimalarials used in the general population that are not currently recommended for use in&#xD;
      the first trimester. To capture this safety data, several sentinel sites will be set-up in&#xD;
      multiple malaria-endemic countries to follow women from the moment the pregnancy is&#xD;
      identified and capture pregnancy outcomes (i.e. miscarriage, stillbirth, live birth). Some&#xD;
      sites (including Kenya) will provide pregnancy tests to enable early pregnancy detection and&#xD;
      referral to ANC to capture early miscarriages. Newborns will be assessed for congenital&#xD;
      anomalies at birth and up to 2 years of age. Any suspected case of congenital anomalies will&#xD;
      be referred for further assessment by a specialist (e.g. paediatrician) who will confirm the&#xD;
      diagnosis and advise on how to further manage any problems or complications. The national&#xD;
      referral system will be used in cases requiring further intervention. Exposure data will be&#xD;
      collected on any acute illnesses occurring during pregnancy, such as malaria and COVID-19,&#xD;
      and chronic conditions, such as HIV, TB, epilepsy or diabetes, and details of any treatment&#xD;
      given (including antimalarials). Antimalarial and other drug exposure data in early&#xD;
      pregnancy, i.e. before the pregnancy was known, will be captured through record linkage with&#xD;
      treatment records from outpatient departments, community health workers, and any other&#xD;
      treatment records. Women will provide informed consent for this data to be collected and to&#xD;
      be followed up throughout pregnancy. The pregnancy outcomes and prevalence of congenital&#xD;
      anomalies will then be compared between pregnancies exposed and those not exposed to specific&#xD;
      antimalarials during the first trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes: The expected outcome of this study is information and reassurance about&#xD;
      the safety profile of specific antimalarials, with a focus on the first trimester, to inform&#xD;
      malaria treatment guidelines. The findings will be shared with the relevant local and&#xD;
      national health and regulatory authorities and disseminated in scientific meetings and in&#xD;
      peer-reviewed journals. Data generated will be pooled with data from similar pregnancy&#xD;
      registries in other malaria-endemic countries and will be shared with the WHO/TDR Central&#xD;
      registry for epidemiological surveillance of drug safety in pregnancy and other relevant&#xD;
      pregnancy exposure registries.&#xD;
