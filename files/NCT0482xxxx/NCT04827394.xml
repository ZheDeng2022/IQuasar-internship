  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are proposing a pilot randomized controlled trial evaluating the benefit of&#xD;
      immediately warming preterm babies using a warming mattress and a plastic wrap, while&#xD;
      delaying clamping the umbilical cord at the time of c-section in babies born between 32 and&#xD;
      36 weeks to determine if it reduces the risk of hypothermia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be advertised and introduced to patients admitted to the OU Children's&#xD;
      Hospital labor and delivery or antepartum units by research nurses. Interested participants&#xD;
      will be consented. Researchers are choosing to only include patients undergoing non-emergent&#xD;
      cesarean in order to improve their ability to control parameters such as room temperature and&#xD;
      labor-related clinical or subclinical maternal infection, which are known confounders.&#xD;
      Further, they are limiting their investigation to fetuses 32-36 weeks gestation, since this&#xD;
      population represents the largest preterm delivery population. Recruitment and randomization&#xD;
      will be stratified by gestational age with an aim to enroll at least 44 pregnancies at 32-34&#xD;
      weeks and 6 days and 20 pregnancies between 35-36 weeks and 6 days. Last, it is impossible to&#xD;
      recruit patients outside of the inpatient setting for a study investigating preterm delivery,&#xD;
      as such deliveries are rarely predictable in the outpatient setting. There will only be one&#xD;
      site for this study, the OU Children's Hospital labor and delivery and antepartum units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a pragmatic randomized controlled pilot trial of neonatal warming&#xD;
      techniques with participants allocated in a 1:1 ratio using a random block allocation table&#xD;
      using blocks of size 4 and 6 that are stratified by gestational age ranges of 35-36 weeks and&#xD;
      6 days and 32-34 weeks and 6 days. Since there cannot be a placebo intervention, neither the&#xD;
      patient nor the neonatal team will be blinded to the group assignment. The group assignments&#xD;
      will be made and coded by a third party at the time of randomization. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to their respective groups immediately prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical technician will be provided with the necessary neonatal wraps and mattresses in&#xD;
      a sterile fashion, and they will ensure these are available on the surgical field once the&#xD;
      cesarean has begun. In the intervention group, the thermal mattress will be activated&#xD;
      immediately prior to hysterotomy and placed on the sterile field with delivery of the infant&#xD;
      directly onto the mattress. The infant will be dried, stimulated and bulb suctioned as deemed&#xD;
      necessary per standard of care followed by wrapping. In the non-intervention group, the&#xD;
      infant will be delivered onto the sterile field, dried and suctioned as deemed necessary per&#xD;
      OU standard. Cord clamping will be delayed for 60 seconds in all infants under the&#xD;
      supervision of both the obstetrician and the neonatal resuscitation team. If either team&#xD;
      believes delayed cord clamping is no longer considered safe, as is usual protocol, the cord&#xD;
      will be clamped and cut and the baby will be handed off to the neonatology team. After the&#xD;
      infant is handed to the neonatology team along with all group assignment specific materials&#xD;
      (neonatal wrap and thermal mattress, if in the intervention group), neonatal temperature will&#xD;
      be assessed immediately upon arrival to the resuscitation warmer using a digital thermometer&#xD;
      placed in the axillary space. Infant temperature will be recorded at 1) arrival to the&#xD;
      warmer, 2) after the neonatologist deems that in-room resuscitation is complete and 3) at&#xD;
      admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), Mother Baby Unit (MBU) or&#xD;
      Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) depending on the baby's needs; determined by the&#xD;
      resuscitating physicians. These measurements will be recorded by research nurses in a data&#xD;
      collection sheet. Further, the research nurse will record the time from delivery to the time&#xD;
      it takes for the infant to arrive at the warmer. Upon arrival at the warmer, the mattress and&#xD;
      wrap will be removed as neonatal evaluation takes place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As immediate neonatal temperature is not generally discussed with patients unless there is an&#xD;
      issue such as concern for infection, neonatal temperature will not be routinely discussed&#xD;
      with all participants. Only if there is concern for neonatal infection or if there is&#xD;
      hyperthermia (&gt;37.5 degrees C) will the study results be discussed with the patient.&#xD;
