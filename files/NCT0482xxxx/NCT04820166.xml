  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The complications associated with portal hypertension in cirrhosis are the main cause of&#xD;
      death in patients with cirrhosis. The level of portal venous pressure is closely related to&#xD;
      the prognosis of patients. HVPG (hepatic venous pressure gradient) is the &quot;gold standard&quot; for&#xD;
      predicting portal venous pressure and an important indicator for evaluating the efficacy of&#xD;
      NSBBS. However, monitoring HVPG has many limitationsï¼Œand the clinical application is also&#xD;
      limited to a certain extent. Therefore, this study intends to clarify the guiding value of&#xD;
      monitoring portal venous pressure in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of portal&#xD;
      hypertension patients through a single-center, prospective and observational study.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study intends to clarify the guiding value of monitoring portal venous&#xD;
      pressure in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of portal hypertension patients through a&#xD;
      single-center, prospective and observational study. At the same time, to explore the&#xD;
      correlation between HVPG and PPG in cirrhosis patients at different stages and different&#xD;
      etiologies, and to evaluate the role of spleen stiffness in predicting the severity of&#xD;
      esophageal and gastric varices in patients with portal hypertension, and to find biomarkers&#xD;
      to predict the risk of complications related to portal hypertension.&#xD;
