  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous catheters have become one of the indispensable tools of modern medicine.&#xD;
      Peripheric intravenous catheters facilitate the work of healthcare professionals in the&#xD;
      treatment phase, especially in diagnostic procedures. Intravenous catheters cause&#xD;
      microorganisms to enter the bloodstream by damaging the skin, which is the body's first&#xD;
      defense barrier. In this case, it causes infections, sepsis, an increase in mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity rates, prolongation of hospital stay, increase in antibiotic use, and medical&#xD;
      expenses. The density of the skin flora in the area where the catheter will be inserted is a&#xD;
      major risk factor for infection.To prevent complications associated with peripheric&#xD;
      intravenous catheters; Performing the procedure in line with the principles of surgical&#xD;
      asepsis and following the correct follow-up are among the most important measures that the&#xD;
      nurse should take. Also, the child and the parents should be prepared for the procedure and&#xD;
      the appropriate environment should be provided. Along with correct catheter placement and&#xD;
      care, antisepsis of the cannula placement area is among the indicators of nursing care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As well as the effectiveness and safety of skin disinfectants, topical absorption, lack of&#xD;
      toxic effect, local and irritation effect are also important. Solutions with 5% NaHCO3 have&#xD;
      recently come to the fore as antiseptic agents. When the literature is examined, it has not&#xD;
      been found that there are very few studies on this solution and it is used in skin antisepsis&#xD;
      before peripheral intravenous catheterization in children. This study was planned as a&#xD;
      randomized controlled experimental design to determine the effectiveness of 5% NaHCO3 water&#xD;
      solution in catheter site cleaning in pediatric patients by comparing it with the most&#xD;
      commonly used antiseptic agents and to monitor the development of catheter-related&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous therapy is one of the basic elements of modern health care. IV routes provided&#xD;
      through catheters for pediatric patients are necessary for primary and secondary health and&#xD;
      increase the possibility of mortality and morbidity depending on the treatment given and the&#xD;
      factors of the patient. As in every invasive application, there are problems regarding the&#xD;
      use of catheters, which is a minimal surgical procedure, and perhaps the most important of&#xD;
      these is catheter-related infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRI's are defined as the accompanying of both local (redness around the catheter, increased&#xD;
      temperature, discharge, drainage, tenderness, edema) and systemic (fever, chills, changes in&#xD;
      laboratory tests) infection findings in patients and is an important complication for&#xD;
      children. is happening. The increase in prevalence varies among patients, as well as between&#xD;
      cities and countries, and is among the top three among hospital-associated infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are many studies on infections related to the use of a peripheric intravenous&#xD;
      catheters in adult patients, it is reported that this issue is not addressed much in&#xD;
      children. It is thought that there is no standardization regarding peripheric intravenous&#xD;
      catheters management in the studies conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the risk factors for infection such as body weight, concomitant chronic disease,&#xD;
      characteristics of the catheter used and the drug administered, presence of interconnection&#xD;
      for pediatric patients are different from adults, catheter-related infections in the&#xD;
      pediatric age group requires a separate discussion. It cannot be denied that the main step in&#xD;
      the prevention of catheter-related infections is the management of peripheric intravenous&#xD;
      catheters and determining an appropriate skin antiseptic is a part of this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Children, 70% Alcohol, 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate, 1% Octenidine, and 10% Povidone-iodine&#xD;
      type antiseptics are commonly used for skin antisepsis. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) solutions&#xD;
      are used in different areas such as oral hygiene and dental care in the world and our&#xD;
      country, and side effects are not reported. There is limited information in the literature&#xD;
      regarding its use as a skin antiseptic, and it is seen that this information belongs to the&#xD;
      adult age group. There is no data on the child age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, which was planned in two stages to determine the effectiveness of the use of&#xD;
      sodium bicarbonate as a skin antiseptic in the prevention of catheter-related infections, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the antiseptics used in the first stage was evaluated in the laboratory&#xD;
      environment against the most common microorganisms in the skin flora, and in the second&#xD;
      stage, the use of these antiseptic solutions in skin cleansing in pediatric patients before&#xD;
      the peripheric intravenous catheters procedure their effectiveness has been evaluated.&#xD;
