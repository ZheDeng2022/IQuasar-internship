  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to evaluate the effectiveness, on the skin cleanliness of the&#xD;
      patient on arrival at the operating room, of an intervention aimed at improving the&#xD;
      performance of the preoperative shower, for patients undergoing a planned surgical&#xD;
      intervention in an orthopedic surgery department, digestive, gynecological, thoracic, or&#xD;
      vascular.&#xD;

      The project will be realized in 2 phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The first phase of the project will consist of a sociological survey conducted with&#xD;
      caregivers and patients in the care sectors participating in the study. This component&#xD;
      sociological research will be carried out on the basis of in-depth interviews with caregivers&#xD;
      (nurses and nursing assistants) from the departments concerned by research and patients. The&#xD;
      expected sample, subject to data saturation, is 40 caregivers and 20 patients. These in-depth&#xD;
      and non-directive interviews will be carried out by a sociologist and will aim to explore the&#xD;
      way in which healthcare professionals see their activity professional, the relationship they&#xD;
      maintain with the various members of the healthcare team, their perceptions of the body,&#xD;
      privacy and hygiene of patients, but also to explore the representations of caregivers of the&#xD;
      preoperative shower and of the relationship with caregivers during phases of explanation,&#xD;
      possible help with the shower, and control of cleanliness cutaneous. These interviews will&#xD;
      identify the representations of caregivers and patients with the aim of establishing a&#xD;
      procedure for caregivers to improve care of the preoperative shower. In view of the&#xD;
      statements of patients and caregivers concerning preparing for the preoperative shower and&#xD;
      checking skin cleanliness during the Survey exploratory, it appears necessary to improve and&#xD;
      formalize the protocol. Investigation will thus establish a base of knowledge necessary to&#xD;
      establish a care procedure giving an account of the roles of each person, caregivers and&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
