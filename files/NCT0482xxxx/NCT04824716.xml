    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of ischemic postconditioning in&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction patients. The safety of patients enrolled in the study was&#xD;
      ensured during the entire study. Over 18 years old men and women were enrolled in the study&#xD;
      who arrived to 2 of the most acknowledged Hungarian cardiac centres due to acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and fulfilled all inclusion and exclusion criteria as per protocol. Patients in&#xD;
      the order of their arrival were assigned either to control or post conditioned groups by&#xD;
      turns. Medical treatment of the control group was done according to standard Percutaneous&#xD;
      Coronary Intervention (PCI) guidelines, i.e. there was no further intervention after artery&#xD;
      opening for 8 minutes, then stenting was performed. In the post conditioned group, after&#xD;
      reperfusion has been confirmed, the coronary artery was occluded by inflation of the stent&#xD;
      balloon 4 times (for 1-1 minute) followed by 1-1-minute reperfusion repeatedly to induce&#xD;
      ischemic postconditioning. Postconditioning procedure was followed by stenting as in the&#xD;
      control group. All other interventions and treatments in both patient groups were identical&#xD;
      according to guidelines.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Over 18 years old men and women were enrolled in the study who arrived to 2 of the most&#xD;
      acknowledged Hungarian cardiac centres due to acute myocardial infarction and fulfilled all&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria as per protocol. Patients in the order of their arrival were&#xD;
      assigned either to control or post conditioned groups by turns. After closing patient&#xD;
      enrolment, further subgrouping will be performed in case sufficient group size has been&#xD;
      achieved as follows: (1) normal, control, (2) normal, post conditioned, (3)&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemic, not treated with statins, control, (4) hypercholesterolemic, not&#xD;
      treated with statins, post conditioned, (5) statin treated, control, (6) statin treated, post&#xD;
      conditioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterisation of postconditioning is performed by the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood tests 5 minutes before as well as 8, 60 minutes, 24 hours, and 3 months after PCI&#xD;
           to measure nitrotyrosine, a biomarker of peroxynitrite formation (nitrosative stress) by&#xD;
           ELISA; B-type natriuretic peptide, a biomarker of heart failure by ELISA; matrix&#xD;
           metalloproteinase activities (MMP-2 and MMP-9) putative biomarkers of cardiac&#xD;
           remodelling by zymography; microRNA expression pattern by sequencing and its validation&#xD;
           by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Routine laboratory tests 6, 12 and 48 hours after PCI including creatine kinase (CKMB)&#xD;
           and cardiac troponin T (cTnT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ECG immediately after recanalization and intervention after 60 and 90 minutes, then 12,&#xD;
           24, 36 and 48 hours later 12-lead ECG is registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Echocardiography: 48 hours after intervention, standard view to judge left ventricle&#xD;
           segments movement disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Angiography: Blush, Syntax score, and ischemic risk zone (area at risk, AAR) are&#xD;
           determined&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. cardiac late enhancement magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to determine infarct size&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3-month follow-up visit the following parameters were measured: echocardiography for&#xD;
      restitution assessment, cardiac late enhancement MR imaging to determine infarct size and&#xD;
      cardiac function, blood sampling for above mentioned biochemical laboratory tests&#xD;

    <description>The protocol of primary PCI followed by stenting is executed according to the descriptions according to the majority of relevant scientific literature on postconditioning studies and in accordance with the most recent guidelines. In the post conditioned group, after recanalization, the artery is occluded by inflation of stent balloon (4 times for 1-1 minute) followed by 1-1-minute reperfusion, repeatedly. Eight minutes after the start of examination, angiography is made in order to determine blood flow. Intervention is finished by the operator and another angiographic image is made (identical to initial standard projection).</description>
