  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative monitoring of all patients after anaesthesia in the post anaesthesia care unit&#xD;
      (PACU) is standard of care today. It helps to reduce morbidity and even mortality in&#xD;
      high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to clinical monitoring by qualified staff, standard monitoring in the PACU&#xD;
      includes non-invasive, intermittent, haemodynamic monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is going to investigate the influence of the continuation of goal directed&#xD;
      haemodynamic optimization in the recovery room on the basis of non-invasive monitoring tools,&#xD;
      i.e. ultrasound and the volume-clamp method, in regard of length of stay in the PACU and&#xD;
      postoperative complications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Postoperative monitoring of all patients after surgery in post anaesthesia care unit (PACU)&#xD;
      is standard of care today. It helps to reduce morbidity and even mortality in high-risk&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to clinical monitoring by qualified staff, standard monitoring in the PACU&#xD;
      includes non-invasive, intermittent, haemodynamic monitoring. The time of transfer of&#xD;
      patients from the PACU to the general ward is assessed on the basis of several parameters.&#xD;
      There is consensus on the most important endpoints of transferability: awareness, quality of&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing, circulatory situation, bleeding situation, body temperature, diuresis&#xD;
      and satisfactory freedom from pain and absence of nausea, but the processes and contents and&#xD;
      how they can be established as quickly and sustainable as possible are not yet defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will investigate the influence of continuing non-invasive, goal-directed&#xD;
      haemodynamic optimization in the recovery room, after major traumatological, general and&#xD;
      vascular surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized controlled trial the investigators will include a population of 80 patients&#xD;
      with a minimum age of 18 years in the study after clarification and approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will be routinely treated with an appropriate protocol for goal-oriented&#xD;
      haemodynamic optimization. The study group will receive targeted haemodynamic optimization&#xD;
      using Vigileo FlowTrac-Analysis and transthoracic echocardiography in the operation room and&#xD;
      finger-cuff based pulse analysis technology in the PACU. The observed parameters of targeted&#xD;
      haemodynamic optimization will be stroke volume and cardiac output, volume response&#xD;
      parameters and collapsability of the inferior vena cava for the volume status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As primary endpoints the investigators considered the number of postoperative complications.&#xD;
      As secondary endpoints, the investigators will compare the time spent in the recovery room,&#xD;
      the time spent in hospital and 28-day mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that, in patients classified ASA II and III, a continuation of a targeted&#xD;
      haemodynamic optimization in the PACU with non-invasive monitoring methods can reduce&#xD;
      postoperative complications after a variety of surgical procedures.&#xD;
